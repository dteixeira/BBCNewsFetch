      <title>Syria chemical arms removal begins</title>
      <description>The destruction of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal is under way, monitors from the OPCW international watchdog say.</description>

      <body>The destruction of Syria's chemical weapons has begun, international monitors have said.The operation is being overseen by a team from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).The mission was established under a United Nations resolution, which was passed after agreement between Russia and the US.The resolution followed international outrage at a chemical weapons attack near Damascus in August.In an interim report, UN chemical weapons inspectors confirmed that the nerve agent sarin had been used in the attack in Ghouta on the outskirts of the city on August 21.It was estimated to have killed hundreds of people and was blamed by the United States and other Western powers on the regime of Bashar al-Assad. But he accuses Syrian rebels of being behind it.It was not clear at which of the chemical weapons sites declared by the government, thought to number about 20, that Sunday's operation took place.An official on the joint OPCW-UN delegation later said: "The first day of destruction and disabling is over and missile warheads, aerial bombs, along with mobile and static mixing and filling units, were dealt with. Work continues tomorrow and in the next few days."The destruction of the stockpile, being carried out by the Syrians, is not expected to be straightforward, as some sites are in combat zones.It is the first time the OPCW - based in The Hague - has been asked to oversee the destruction of a chemical weapons armoury during a conflict.The Syrian government gave details of its chemical weapons arsenal last month to the OPCW under the Russia-US agreement which also provided for Damascus to join the Chemical Weapons Convention.That arsenal is thought to include more than 1,000 tonnes of sarin and the blister agent sulphur mustard among other banned chemicals.Under the terms of the agreement between the US and Russia Syria's chemical weapons capability should be removed by the middle of 2014.The speed with which the team has been able to reach the sites and start the process of destruction underlines the urgency of the mission, says the BBC's Anna Holligan in the Hague.It was hoped that the new climate of co-operation would help bring about a wider conference in Geneva on ending the Syrian conflict.UN-Arab League peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi was quoted on French media on Sunday as saying he was encouraging all parties to come to Geneva in the second half of November but that peace talks were not a certainty.Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has meanwhile suggested Germany could mediate to try to end the 30-month-long civil war.Speaking to Germany's Der Spiegel magazine in an interview to be published on Monday, Mr Assad said he "would be delighted if envoys came from Germany".But he stressed that Damascus would not negotiate with rebels unless they laid down their weapons.Mr Assad again repeated his denial that his troops had used chemical weapons, blaming the rebels instead.More than 100,000 people have died since the uprising began in 2011 and millions more have fled Syria.</body>

      <title>Tory MP pushes for early EU vote</title>
      <description>A prominent Conservative backbench MP says he will try to force the government to hold an early referendum on whether the UK should leave the EU.</description>

      <date>1381073991</date>
      <body>Prominent Conservative backbencher Adam Afriyie has said he will try to force the government to hold an early vote on whether the UK should leave the EU.The prime minister has promised to hold an in/out referendum in 2017 if he wins the next general election, but Mr Afriyie said voters were "not convinced" that it would happen.He said he would push for a vote in October 2014 instead.But Home Secretary Theresa May warned that Mr Afriyie had "got it wrong".And a Downing Street spokesman said of Mr Afriyie's plan: "The PM will not let it stand."Mr Afriyie - who has denied newspaper claims he is being groomed to replace party leader David Cameron - said he would table an amendment to the European Union (Referendum) Bill on Monday.Mr Cameron has pledged to renegotiate the UK's relationship with the EU before an in/out referendum in 2017.But, speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics programme, Mr Afriyie said there would be "ample time" to conduct this renegotiation by as early as next year."By having a referendum in 2014, it gives us 12 months to renegotiate," he said. "But more than that, it kick-starts negotiations."EU member states would need to "accommodate" British demands for reforms "if they wish us to remain", he added.He argued: "I think it strengthens the prime minister's hand."The MP said 80% of people wanted a referendum, and more than 50% of people wanted a referendum this side of the election."British businesses need certainty," he said."Look, we can carry on kicking this can down the road forever."But I've had a struggle with my conscience over this one."I don't want to cause any trouble over it, but I think it's absolutely essential that Parliament and MPs have the opportunity to search their souls and to give people a referendum this side of the election."In an article for the Mail on Sunday, he predicted that - without a referendum before 2015 - "large numbers of people will continue to vote UKIP whatever happens - and if they do, there is a distinct danger that Labour will gain a majority and we will never see a referendum at all".UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he would be "absolutely delighted" if Britain could have an early referendum.He told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme on Sunday that a referendum before 2015 would be good for British industry and business."Adam Afriyie has put his finger on the real problem - and that's that four years ago, Mr Cameron gave us a cast-iron guarantee that there would be a referendum."This time last year, he was saying there would not be a referendum, and he is now saying there should be a referendum."People are not quite sure what to believe."But Mrs May, speaking on the same programme, said: "We need to be negotiating that settlement with the European Union and then put to the British people the Europe of the future - not the Europe of the past - and give them that opportunity to say in or out."What is crucial is that we have, at the next election, a Conservative party that will be offering people that renegotiation of a new settlement with Europe, looking to the future and then putting that to the British people in an in/out referendum."Backbench Conservative MP James Wharton is attempting to enshrine his party leadership's referendum pledge in law - without the support of coalition partners the Liberal Democrats - with his European Union (Referendum) Bill.As a private member's bill, it is vulnerable to being delayed by procedural tactics from MPs who oppose it, and will only become law if the government allocates enough parliamentary time for its proponents to overcome any such hurdles.Mrs May warned that Mr Afriyie's amendment to the bill could "jeopardise" its prospects entirely.And Mr Wharton told BBC Radio 5 live the amendment could "kill" his bill."My concern is that any amendment, no matter how well-meaning it might be, is going to make the progress of the bill more difficult and it'll make it easier for those MPs who want to use procedural techniques to slow it down and stop it... that bit more possible."I don't want to see that. I'd like to see my bill go through and I think this harms the chances of that happening."Liberal Democrat deputy leader Simon Hughes, whose party opposes a referendum on the EU unless further powers are handed from Westminster to Brussels, said a 2014 referendum would be a "barmy" distraction from the government's attempts to boost UK economic growth.Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said the Conservative leadership had scheduled a referendum in 2017 due to "internal party management as much as anything else".The PM's promise of a "grand, unilateral renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU" was "deeply flawed and bound to unravel", he added, in pre-released extracts of a speech to be delivered in London on Tuesday.The European Union (Referendum) Bill is due to return to the House of Commons for further debate on 8 November.</body>

      <title>Libya calls for US raid explanation</title>
      <description>Libya's PM asks Washington to explain the capture of a Libyan terror suspect by US special forces, one of two such raids in Africa on Saturday.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24420767</url>
      <date>1381078013</date>
      <body>Libya's prime minister has called on Washington to explain a special forces raid on its territory, one of two by US commandos in Africa on Saturday.Ali Zeidan's office said he had asked for clarification and stressed Libya was "keen on prosecuting any Libyan citizen inside Libya".The raid captured al-Qaeda leader, Anas al-Liby, whom the US says is "currently lawfully detained outside of Libya".The other raid was in southern Somalia but failed to capture its target.The commando raid there was believed to have focused on a leader of the al-Shebab militant group, which says it carried out last month's attack on the Westgate shopping centre in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, leaving at least 67 people dead.When asked on Sunday whether Somalia had been aware of the raid, Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon Saaid said: "Our co-operation with international partners on fighting against terrorism is not a secret."A press release posted on an official Libyan government website read: "The Libyan government is following the news about the Libyan citizen wanted by the US government."Since we've heard, we have been in touch with the US government and have asked for clarification on this matter."The Libyan government is keen on prosecuting any Libyan citizen inside Libya, no matter what the charges are... the accused are innocent until proven guilty."The statement raises questions about how much, if anything, Libya knew in advance of the raid.A US official had earlier been quoted by CNN as saying that the raid was conducted with the knowledge of the Libyan government.Liby, 49, is believed to have been one of the masterminds behind the 1998 US embassy attacks, which killed more than 220 people in Kenya and Tanzania.He has been indicted in a New York court in connection with the attacks.Liby - whose real name is Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai - has been on the FBI's most wanted list for more than a decade with a $5m (£3.1m) bounty on his head.A Pentagon statement on Sunday said he was "currently lawfully detained under the law of war in a secure location outside of Libya".It said: "The successful capture operation was made possible by superb work and coordination across our national security agencies and the intelligence community, and was approved by President Obama."No American personnel were injured, it said.Anas al-Liby was seized in Tripoli early on Saturday as he was parking outside his house.Three vehicles encircled him, his car window was smashed and his gun was seized before he was taken away, his brother, Nabih, told the Associated Press news agency.On Sunday he told reporters that the US operation was an "act of piracy".Liby's son, Abdullah, said that those he could see taking his father looked Libyan and spoke a Libyan dialect. He said that some were masked.US Secretary of State John Kerry said the operations in Libya and Somalia showed that the US would never stop "in its effort to hold those accountable who conduct acts of terror".Those who attacked American interests "can run but they can't hide", he said.The US defence department also confirmed that special forces had carried out a seaborne operation in Somalia's coastal town of Barawe on Saturday.Pentagon spokesman George Little said the forces had been "involved in a counter-terrorism operation against a known al-Shabab terrorist". He gave no further details.Initial reports in the US media quoted unnamed US officials as saying that the suspect had been captured or killed by US Navy Seals in the pre-dawn raid on a villa.However, the officials later said that the Seals failed to find the intended target, who was not identified.Prime Minister Saiid said on Sunday: "We have collaboration with the world and with neighbouring countries in the battle against al Shabab... our interest is to get a peaceful Somalia, free from terrorism."The raid was carried out by members of Seal Team Six - the same unit that killed al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, a US military official told AP.The official added that in Barawe the commandos had decided to abort the mission after encountering fierce resistance from al-Shabab fighters."The Barawe raid was planned a week and a half ago," a US security official told the New York Times."It was prompted by the Westgate attack," added the official, who was speaking on the condition of anonymity.Al-Shabab earlier told the BBC that "white soldiers" had arrived by boat in Barawe and rebels had repulsed them, losing a fighter.</body>

      <title>Fresh clashes in Egypt 'kill 28'</title>
      <description>At least 28 people are killed and up to 100 hurt in Egypt in clashes between police and supporters of ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.</description>

      <body>At least 28 people have been killed and dozens hurt in Egypt in clashes between police and supporters of the deposed Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.More than 200 members of his Muslim Brotherhood were arrested in Cairo, where 26 of the deaths were reported.Supporters of Mr Morsi marched in several cities, as the military-backed government marked the 40th anniversary of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.Morsi supporters say he was deposed in a military coup in July.Hundreds of people had gathered in Cairo's Tahrir Square to celebrate the anniversary.Jets and Apache helicopters flew overhead in formation, as part of a grand display of military hardware by the government.The crowd cheered the flypasts, a number of people carrying portraits of defence chief Gen Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Some want him to stand as Egypt's next president.But the BBC's Quentin Sommerville in Cairo says supporters of Mr Morsi also took to the streets in their thousands, trying to make their way to the square and calling Gen Sisi a murderer.Security forces used tear gas and fired into the air to stop them.In the upscale Dokki district, a number of protesters were hit by live rounds, some by birdshot. In return they threw rocks at police and soldiers, our correspondent says.The street battles raged for hours, with small fires burning and black smoke rising in several parts of the capital.But the military succeeded in keeping the rival supporters apart, our correspondent says.The interior ministry earlier warned it would confront any "attempts that may disturb the 6 October celebrations", the Mena state news agency reported.In a televised address, Prime Minister Hazem Beblawi described it as a "critical time" for the country and urged Egyptians to "stand together, be optimistic about the future".The health ministry said that in addition to the Cairo deaths, one person was killed in Delga, about 300km (190 miles) south of Cairo, and another in Bani Suef, 80km south of the capital.Hundreds of Islamist protesters have died in violence since the Egyptian military deposed Mr Morsi in July, 13 months after he was elected as president.He and other senior Brotherhood figures have been imprisoned and face trial.The authorities are moving to seize the movement's assets after its activities were banned as part of a crackdown.However, Brotherhood supporters have continued to take to the streets to protest - albeit in smaller numbers than before.</body>

      <title>'Nuclear implications' of power loss</title>
      <description>A loss of power for more than 90 minutes at Devonport Dockyard had potential nuclear implications, a Ministry of Defence report says.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-24421402</url>
      <date>1381079044</date>
      <body>A loss of power at a city dockyard had "potential nuclear implications", a Ministry of Defence (MoD) report said.The 90-minute power-loss, at Devonport in Plymouth, could have been "catastrophic", a nuclear analyst said.Caused by a central nuclear switchboard fault at the yard, it was the most potentially dangerous of 50 "events" recorded in 2012.The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) has now issued an improvement notice on the dockyard.Power is essential at the dockyard to ensure reactors on the nuclear submarines are kept cool.The incident, in July 2012, was regarded as code-B on the sliding scale of "severity" - code A being the most severe.John Large, an engineer and independent nuclear analyst, said: "The loss of power was a catastrophic event, which is what happened before the Fukushima meltdown."According to the improvement notice the dockyard, which is operated by Babcock Marine, has until 31 March 2014 to meet its own operating rules and instructions.No-one from the operating firm has been available for comment.However, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said it took all safety concerns "extremely seriously" and was aware of the ONR improvement notice.In a statement issued to BBC News, the MoD said it understood Babcock Marine had agreed an improvement programme with the ONR to "enable the identified issues to be addressed in a timely manner"."We will continue to work with Babcock Marine and safety regulators to ensure that safety is managed effectively across the wider Devonport site," a spokesperson said.The ONR said Devonport Royal Dockyard Limited had taken action to remedy some of the problems identified and it was satisfied there was "no immediate impact on safety", but it believed the improvement notice was "necessary".In the "site event" report for HM Naval Base Devonport, the MoD said 50 events in 2012 was higher number than the two previous years, but "broadly similar" to the number recorded in 2008 and 2009.The report said it was "reasonable" to expect a rise in the number of events as there had been a corresponding increase in the number of "submarine" days in specially-designed nuclear dockyard berths."With more routine and non-routine nuclear activity, it is reasonable to expect an associated increase in the number of events," the report said.The report said previously unidentified faults in standby diesel generators meant the secondary power source was unable to re-supply power for more than 90 minutes."Through a combination of factors and additional unidentified defects, this defect was revealed, and resulted in an event with potential nuclear implications," the report said.An earthquake and tsunami off the coast of Japan in March 2011 knocked out cooling systems to reactors at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, three of which melted down.Devonport resident Ian Avent, who is also the organiser of the Campaign Against Nuclear Storage and Radiation, described the loss of power as "scary".Oliver Colvile, the Conservative MP for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, said he was very concerned about the situation and intended to speak to Babcock Marine about the actions it was taking.He said he expected the "highest levels of safety" to be maintained at the dockyard.</body>

      <title>National Crime Agency hailed by May</title>
      <description>The UK's new National Crime Agency will "relentlessly pursue organised criminals", says Home Secretary Theresa May, ahead of the body's launch on Monday.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24418847</url>
      <date>1381075128</date>
      <body>The UK's new National Crime Agency will "relentlessly pursue organised criminals", Home Secretary Theresa May has told the BBC.She said the body, to launch on Monday, would focus on dealing with organised crime, economic crime, border policing, child protection and cybercrime.The new agency will replace the Serious Organised Crime Agency, known as Soca.Labour called the move a "rebranding exercise", and warned the NCA was "not strong enough" for future challenges.It is the third time since 1998 that an organised crime body has been set up.The National Crime Squad was set up 15 years ago, only to be replaced eight years later by Soca - which is now being scrapped.The NCA will work with each of the regional police forces in the UK and similar organisations abroad.The agency will have 4,500 officers and aims to adopt a more visible, joined-up approach than was previously the case.It has significant powers to compel police forces in England and Wales to provide assistance and carry out policing operations.Mrs May told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that the new agency was "designed to be a relentless crime-fighting body which will relentlessly pursue organised criminals".The home secretary said: "Crime is falling in this country, but we can't be complacent - and particularly on organised crime. I don't think the last government put enough emphasis on this.""At the core of the NCA will be intelligence. It will work at local level and regionally across government, not just the police. It will work internationally as well," she said.But shadow policing minister David Hanson said the NCA "doesn't match the government's hype"."Most of the NCA is just the rebranding of existing organisations such as the Serious Organised Crime Agency, but with a substantial 20% cut imposed by the Home Office on their overall budget," he said.Mr Hanson added: "The new organisation is not strong enough to deal with the exponential growth of economic and online crime. It will simply absorb the existing National Cyber Crime but with fewer resources."It is right to have stronger national action on organised crime with the NCA, on child exploitation and on intelligence - but the government has to support this effort and not simply use this as a rebranding exercise to hide substantial policing cuts."However, Mrs May told the BBC she was satisfied that the NCA was "going to be well-resourced".She said changes across policing had shown it was possible to fight crime while being "careful with the budgets that are available", as part of the government-wide commitment to "deal with the deficit".And she rejected comparisons with the US, amid suggestions that an organised crime agency was essentially a British version of the FBI."It is a British approach to dealing with an issue that we face," she said.Each police force in the UK has territorial responsibility for its particular area. Crimes that are carried out across more than one county or area usually involve officers from both areas.The new body will have a strategic role in which it will attempt to look at the bigger picture of organised crime in the UK, how it operates and how it can be disrupted.The NCA will answer directly to the home secretary and will have the same powers in Scotland as it does in England and Wales.The situation will be different in Northern Ireland, where the agency will carry out its border and customs functions, but not other crime-fighting roles.</body>

      <body>Prince Harry has honoured special forces soldiers killed in the line of duty during an unannounced visit to the headquarters of the Australian SAS.He joined families of fallen Special Air Service Regiment members to lay wreaths at Campbell Barracks in Perth.Prince Harry was accompanied by Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott when he flew into the city for the last engagement of his 36-hour state visit.He is now heading to a Dubai fundraiser for his aids charity, Sentebale.Prince Harry, a captain in the British Army who has served twice in Afghanistan, met and had lunch with current and former members of the Australian SAS unit and toured their base.Wreaths were laid in the Garden of Reflection at the barracks, and he also met members of groups which provide support to the unit.The commanding officer, whose identity was only given as "Lieutenant Colonel G", said the unit was "humbled and grateful" that the prince had "made the time to join us"."Prince Harry knows what it means to serve his nation on operations and most importantly what it means to the families of those serving," he said."Today's visit by His Royal Highness and the prime minister represents a unique opportunity to recognise the broader SAS regimental family that provides the back-up and support at home."Families play a critical role for those serving in the SASR, and indeed the whole of the Australian Defence Force, and we are thankful that the families of some of our serving, former and fallen members were able to be here today."On Saturday, Prince Harry begun his first official trip to Australia by joining celebrations to mark its navy's arrival at Sydney Harbour 100 years ago.He attended the International Fleet Review, featuring some 40 warships from 17 countries, including the Royal Navy's type 45 destroyer, HMS Daring.Thousands of people flocked to the harbour as Prince Harry met crowds before boarding a boat for a reception with Mr Abbott at his official residence in the city.</body>

      <title>Farage: I will stand as MP in 2015</title>

      <body>UKIP leader Nigel Farage has confirmed he is planning to stand as an MP at the next general election, due in 2015.Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, he insisted that the 2014 elections to the European Parliament were his main priority.But the UKIP leader revealed he had been considering a bid to become MP for Folkestone and Hythe.He also said he thought PM David Cameron and his cabinet colleagues regarded UKIP as "the lower orders".Mr Farage refused to be drawn on speculation that he would stand in another Kent constituency, South Thanet."I was thinking about Folkestone," he replied."But it doesn't really matter. I'm not going say where I'm standing. I'm not even going to think about where I'm standing."I am going to stand, but let's get the European elections out the way first."On the subject of whether there was likely to be any deal between UKIP and the Conservatives at the next general election, he said: "It's perfectly clear that Mr Cameron and the cabinet view us as being part of the lower orders, and we're really not good enough for them."He said he was "perfectly relaxed" about his party co-operating with the Conservatives at the local level, but he added: "I don't think it will happen."The current MP for Folkestone and Hythe, the Conservatives' Damian Collins won a 10,122-vote majority at the general election in 2010 on nearly 50% of the vote.The UKIP candidate won 4.6% of the vote, but in the May 2013 county council elections three UKIP members were voted in to represent Folkestone.Mr Farage explained his party's general election strategy: "We will target our resources where we won county council seats, where we won district council seats following the model that the Lib Dems used under Paddy Ashdown building on local strength."If you can win at council level, you can win at parliamentary level."Mr Collins took to Twitter to comment: "Nigel Farage says 'it doesn't really matter' whether he commits to stand to be an MP in Folkestone or Thanet."He's got no commitment."</body>

      <title>Italy divers recover migrant bodies</title>
      <description>Divers in Italy recover more bodies of more than 200 African migrants missing after their boat sank off the island of Lampedusa on Thursday.</description>

      <date>1381078415</date>
      <body>Divers in Italy have been recovering more bodies from the boat of African migrants that sank on Thursday.Seventy bodies were brought out on Sunday, bringing the official death toll to 181. About 200 people are still missing and 155 have survived the accident off Lampedusa island.The authorities have denied allegations that they were slow to mount a rescue.France has called for an urgent EU meeting after Italy requested help to deal with the influx of migrants.Tens of thousands of migrants attempt the perilous crossing from North Africa to Sicily and other Italian islands each year, and accidents are common - but this week's shipwreck was among the deadliest on record.Divers resumed their search on Sunday morning, after 48-hour delay due to bad weather.Many bodies are believed to be trapped in the wreck located in deep water, about 1km (half a mile) off Lampedusa .The survivors are to be placed under investigation for "clandestine immigration", as provided for by a controversial immigration law pushed through by right-wing parties in 2002.The offence carries a 5,000-euro (£4,230; $6,780) fine.Italy has said it will amend immigration laws. Members of parliament have complained that some of its provisions discourage people from helping migrants in distress.The fisherman who arrived first at the site of the accident, Vito Fiorino, has accused the coast guard of wasting time by filming footage of rescue efforts."They refused to take on board some people we'd already saved because they said protocol forbade it," he was quoted as saying by Ansa news agency.A report in local newspaper La Sicilia said two boats belonging to Italy's Financial Guard, which carries out a range of police and rescue duties, had remained in port.The coast guard denied that there was any delay in its rescue effort."After we received the alarm by radio at 07:00 we immediately intervened with out boats, arriving on at the site of the shipwreck at 07:20," it said in a statement.Judicial authorities said they had no evidence of delays. And two of the migrants have told the BBC that boats did rescue them, but it took a while."After swimming for a long time, probably around three hours, boats started to arrive to rescue us. Rescue boats, small boats, all the boats in the area came to save us, they dragged us out of the water," Futsum Mesfa, 20, from Eritrea said."I lost my cousin, who was on the boat with me, I also lost many friends," he added.The head of a fishermen's association, Toto Martello, denied in turn reports that three fishermen sailed straight past the scene of the accident.The 20m (66ft) boat carrying more than 500 people - mostly from Eritrea and Somalia - was approaching Lampedusa early on Thursday when it began taking on water after its motor stopped working.Mr Mesfa told the BBC that the skipper set fire to a piece of material to try to attract the attention of passing ships, only to have the fire spread to the rest of the vessel.The boat - which set sail from the Libyan port of Misrata - is thought to have capsized when everyone moved to one side.</body>

      <title>Deadly monster truck crash in Mexico</title>
      <description>At least eight people are killed and dozens injured at a show in Mexico as a modified pick-up known as a monster truck crashes into spectators.</description>

      <body>At least eight people have been killed and dozens injured at a show in Mexico after a modified pick-up known as a monster truck crashed into spectators.At least one child was said to be among the dead.The monster truck - with tyres said to be 1.5 metres (nearly 5ft) high - ploughed into a stand.The vehicle was taking part in a demonstration at an annual air show attended by thousands in the northern city of Chihuahua on Saturday evening.The monster truck was performing a demolition stunt which involved crushing two cars beneath its huge tyres.Eyewitness video showed the truck completing one pass, driving over the cars, then turning for a second attempt.It accelerated much more quickly this time and landed heavily over the second car before veering off to the right and into the stand.A spokesman for the Chihuahua state prosecutors' office, Carlos Gonzalez, put the number of injured at about 80.He said prosecutors were looking at the possibility that mechanical failure meant the driver was unable to disengage the accelerator.But some witnesses said the driver may have lost control after hitting his head on the interior of the truck.Daniel Dominguez told Associated Press he was watching the show with a group of relatives."The driver hit his head and his helmet flew off," Mr Dominguez said. "The truck came directly at where we were.''Another spectator, Jesus Manuel Ibarra, told the agency: "I fell over, and when I turned around I saw the tyre very close. It hit me and threw me to the other side."A call has gone out from local health services for blood donations.The BBC's Will Grant in Mexico says some people are now calling for an investigation into safety measures at events like this and are asking how the audience could be placed so close to trucks performing stunts with only limited barriers in place.</body>

      <description>Tottenham Hotspur fans ignore police warnings not to use the word "Yid" in chants at a match against West Ham United.</description>

      <body>Tottenham Hotspur fans have ignored a police warning not to use the word "Yid" in chants at a match against West Ham United.Spurs supporters chanted "We'll sing what we want" and "Yid Army" at White Hart Lane, in north London.Before the match, the Met Police warned fans using the term could be arrested. One fan was arrested at half-time.Spurs have a strong Jewish following and have been the target of abuse from opposition fans.However, some Spurs supporters use the term themselves in an act of defiance.Before the game, which West Ham won 3-0, match commander Ch Supt Mick Johnson said "racism and offensive language have no place in football".A police spokesman said officers were speaking with fans on their way into the stadium about the issue.The Met Police said one Tottenham fan had been arrested for a public order offence and was in custody at a north London police station.The Football Association has warned supporters the use of such words could result in a banning order or criminal charges.Last month, the chairman of the footballers' union, Clarke Carlisle, said fans should be banned for using the word, but Prime Minister David Cameron has said people should not be prosecuted unless it is used as an insult.On Friday, the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust said they believed no Spurs fan "uses the term 'yid' in an offensive or insulting way".However, it said the distinction between the use of the term as a "badge of honour and a call to arms" and the "anti-Semitic abuse levelled at our fans by supporters of opposing teams, appears to have been dismissed by the FA and the Metropolitan Police".Before the game, West Ham United also warned supporters that "unacceptable conduct" at the match could lead to fans being banned from attending games.</body>

      <body>Russian President Vladimir Putin has taken part in a ceremony in Moscow to launch the torch relay for next year's Winter Olympics in Sochi.The torch will go on a 123-day journey covering some 65,000km (40,000 miles) before the Games start in the Black Sea resort on 7 February.The torch's journey will include a trip into space.Mr Putin said the Games would show Russia's "respect for equality and diversity".The run-up to the Games has so far been marred by controversy over a new Russian law that restricts the spread of information about homosexuality, as well as allegations by rights groups that authorities have rounded up migrant workers who helped build the Games venues in Sochi.The Olympic flame had been flown in from Greece after being lit last Sunday at the birthplace of the ancient Games.Hoisting the flame in Moscow, Mr Putin declared in a ceremony shown live on television that "our shared dream is becoming reality".He said the Games would show "respect for equality and diversity - ideals that are so intertwined with the ideals of the Olympic movement itself".Mr Putin said the relay would show off Russia "the way that it is and the way we love it"."Today is a joyous and momentous day," he said. "The Olympic flame - the symbol of the planet's main sports event, the symbol of peace and friendship - has arrived in Russia, and in a few minutes it will be on its way around our huge country."On its journey the flame will:</body>

      <body>Lord Sugar has been investigated by police after he was accused of posting a racist message on Twitter.The businessman and star of The Apprentice posted a photo of a child apparently of Chinese origin crying.He wrote: "The kid in the middle is upset because he was told off for leaving the production line of the iPhone 5."Merseyside Police said it had investigated a complaint but said "no criminal offences" had taken place.Lord Sugar's spokesman said he would not be commenting on the complaint.Liverpool shop owner Nichola Szeto had taken offence about the reference to the Asian factories where the mobile phones are produced and complained about the "racist tweet" to the Metropolitan Police.She was then contacted by Merseyside Police and went to a Liverpool police station to make a statement about the tweet, which was posted on 30 September.A police spokesman said: "Merseyside Police can confirm officers received a complaint in relation to the tweet sent on the evening of Sunday September 30."The communication has been examined by the force's specialist hate crime investigation team and at this time it has been recorded as a hate incident and no criminal offences have taken place."Officers from the specialist team will be contacting the person who made the initial complaint to discuss this."</body>

      <body>Former cabinet minister Liam Fox successfully claimed 3p of taxpayers' money for a car journey of about 100 metres, expenses documents show.Mr Fox's office made the claim after he travelled a distance recorded as 0.06 miles in October 2012.He had visited a concrete firm before heading within his north Somerset base to a constituency surgery in Yatton.The ex-defence secretary made another 15 claims of under £1 for car travel approved in 2012-13, the files showed.These included 24p for a 0.54-mile journey from a constituency surgery to a school competition in Clevedon, and 44p for a 0.98-mile journey from a local politics event at Winford Manor to Winford School.Under the current system, MPs can claim 45p per mile.MPs claimed a total of £23m in personal expenses in the year to April.Paperwork from the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) shows Mr Fox claimed £3,866.31 in travel expenses - including rail fares - in the last financial year.The claim for the car journey to Yatton was paid last December, according to the notes.Mr Fox told the Sunday People: "I don't do my expenses. My office does them. But they are all done according to the rules for travel distances."Last year, the Conservative MP had to repay £3,000 of expenses after it was found he had allowed his friend Adam Werritty to live at his taxpayer-funded second home for a year rent-free.He was also criticised for allowing their Atlantic Bridge think tank to be run from his parliamentary offices.Mr Fox resigned from his cabinet position in October 2011 over his relationship with Mr Werritty.</body>

      <description>Glastonbury Festival organisers Michael and Emily Eavis say they are "blown away" by demand as tickets for 2014 sell out in one hour 27 minutes.</description>

      <body>Tickets for next year's Glastonbury Festival have sold out in record time, according to organisers.Michael and Emily Eavis issued a joint statement confirming all 120,000 remaining tickets had been sold in just one hour and 27 minutes.They said they were "blown away" by the numbers logging on and were "genuinely sorry" that so many had missed out.Ticketing website See Tickets had earlier apologised to customers on Twitter for "technical difficulties".The site, which had been managing the sale of tickets for Glastonbury, wrote that the issues had led to "a very difficult half an hour" before the site stabilised, later adding that it was selling 3,000 tickets a minute.Prices for the 2014 event had been increased by £10 to £210, plus a booking fee, but festival-goers could pay a deposit of £50 before settling their bill in April.For the first time, coach packages were available three days earlier, with all 15,000 tickets selling out in half an hour.A statement by the father and daughter Eavis team, Michael and Emily, was posted on the festival's own Twitter feed, saying: "We genuinely try to make the ticket system as fair as it can be, but when demand outstrips supply, it is an unfortunate inevitability that some people will be left disappointed."They went on to thank people for their "incredible support", adding: "We really don't take it for granted and we are exceedingly fortunate to have that loyalty."No acts have yet been confirmed to play at the festival at Worthy Farm between 26 and 29 June next year, but there is already speculation about who will headline.David Bowie is one of the bookies' favourites, with other rumours including Foo Fighters and Fleetwood Mac.This year saw Arctic Monkeys, Rolling Stones and Mumford and Sons top the bill on the festival's famous Pyramid Stage.</body>

      <title>Tottenham 0-3 West Ham</title>
      <description>Ravel Morrison scores a superb solo goal as West Ham defeat Tottenham to climb out of the Premier League's bottom three.</description>

      <date>1381080490</date>
      <body>Ravel Morrison scored a superb solo goal as West Ham earned a vital win against Tottenham to climb out of the Premier League's bottom three.Winston Reid's close-range effort just after the hour gave the Hammers a first away goal of the season.A ricochet off Ricardo Vaz Te doubled the lead before Morrison ran the length of the Spurs half to chip in.Tottenham's best chances fell to Jermain Defoe but he was denied by West Ham goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen.West Ham's first away win in nine Premier League games was their first at White Hart Lane since 1999 and lifts them to 13th in the table. Meanwhile, Spurs' second defeat of the season ended a six-game unbeaten run and sees them drop to sixth.It was more of a surprise given that Andre Villas-Boas's side had the joint-tightest defence in the league, having conceded only twice before this encounter.But the day arguably belonged to Morrison, 20, who capped a confident and hard-working display with a goal that underlined a talent that many observers have spoken of in glowing terms.The former Manchester United player was called into the England Under-21 squad last week and this performance showed that the youngster could perhaps now turn the corner after having questions asked of his temperament.Before Morrison's move to East London in January 2012, then United boss Sir Alex Ferguson said: "He's got a great talent but it's how to deal with it that is important."West Ham boss Sam Allardyce took the unusual step of naming no recognised strikers in his side, as Morrison rotated with Mohamed Diame as the furthest player forward but it proved a masterstroke.Morrison was the visitors' most potent player in the first half and they almost took the lead when he was tripped near the edge of the box.Rather than take a shot, Mark Noble enterprisingly scooped the ball over the wall and Kevin Nolan volleyed just wide from an angle.At the other end, Andros Townsend gave watching England manager Roy Hodgson something to think about ahead of the World Cup qualifiers with another performance of direct running and confident dribbling.But, despite several decent crosses from the right, Defoe could not make contact on his first Premier League start of the season.Despite their tight defence, Villas-Boas's side have only scored six goals in six games prior to this match and their frustrations in front of goal continued after the break when Jaaskelainen twice thwarted Defoe.James Tomkins had a header well saved by Hugo Lloris from a corner, yet it was Tottenham who began to show the greater purpose and Reid's opener on 66 minutes came against the run of play.Reid expertly headed Stewart Downing's corner towards goal only for it to be blocked by Nolan on the line. The ball bounced back to the Kiwi and he made no mistake with the rebound.Vaz Te added a privileged second soon after. The Portuguese was found by Noble and his tame shot hit Loris before bouncing back to him and in off his knee.There was nothing lucky about Morrison's goal, though. He collected Diame's clever flick and ran with the ball before taking on Michael Dawson and signalling his talent with a wonderfully composed finish.</body>

      <title>Thomas wins vault bronze at Worlds</title>
      <description>Kristian Thomas wins bronze in the vault to claim Great Britain's first ever medal in the event at the World Championships.</description>

      <body>Kristian Thomas won bronze in the vault to claim Britain's first ever medal in the event at the World Gymnastics.The London 2012 team bronze medallist delivered his two vaults to near-perfection on Sunday in Antwerp.Thomas, 24, finished with an average score of 15.233, behind South Korea's Yang Hak-Seon (15.533) and American Steven Legendre (15.249)."To make the final was the first aim, so I'm over the moon. I'm really happy and proud," said Thomas."Once again, the British gymnasts have proved how good we are and I'm delighted to have contributed to that success."The Wolverhampton gymnast has long been considered a vital contributor in the team event, exemplified by the stunning vault he produced during London 2012's team final, helping GB to bronze.But unlike world medallists Louis Smith, Daniel Keatings, Dan Purvis and most recently Max Whitlock, the podium had eluded him in individual competition until now.Nor had 2013 shaped up well for Thomas, who missed much of the year - including the European Championships in April - through a fractured tibia."Three weeks ago I didn't even know if I'd be coming to the World Championships," he told BBC Sport."It's been a real rollercoaster of a year. Three weeks ago I was still battling to try to get into the team. To nail the first vault the way I did was so special."Yang, the defending world and Olympic champion and the last to compete, cemented his dominance of the apparatus with another victory.Britain finish this year's World Championships with two medals, supplied by Thomas's vault and Whitlock on the pommel horse.Add to that two near-misses - Whitlock's fourth place in an exceptionally competitive all-around final on Thursday, with Purvis narrowly missing bronze in the men's floor event - and British Gymnastics can be satisfied that the men are building on last year's Olympic success."Today, watching Kristian's final on the vault was really good. For GB to come away with two medals is amazing," said Whitlock, a double bronze medallist at London 2012 yet making his Worlds debut this year.Elsewhere on Sunday, 16-year-old Simone Biles completed a hugely successful week for both her and the United States squad with victory in the women's floor final.Biles, already the all-around champion, scored 15.000 to beat Italy's Vanessa Ferrari, her nearest challenger with 14.633.The first-year senior also won silver on the vault and bronze on the balance beam at these championships.The US won an unprecedented 12 world medals in Belgium, three more than the previous American record set in Melbourne eight years earlier.The US men contributed four medals without winning a world title, while the women won at least one medal in every event - Kyla Ross taking three silvers and McKayla Maroney lifting the world vault title.Russia's Aliya Mustafina won the beam event for her first world title in three years, and Japanese all-around champion Kohei Uchimura shared parallel bars gold with China's Lin Chaopan.Sunday's concluding final, on the high bar, lived up to expectations as Olympic champion Epke Zonderland once again stunned the crowd with a daring and difficult routine.The Dutchman scored 16.000 for his first world title, beating German friend and arch-rival Fabian Hambuechen, who could only manage 15.933 in response.</body>

      <title>Vettel not thinking about title</title>

      <body>Sebastian Vettel said he is "trying not to think about" the fact he can win his fourth world title in Japan next week.The Red Bull driver will be champion if he wins at Suzuka and rival Fernando Alonso of Ferrari is lower than eighth.Vettel said: "To be honest, I don't really care. I look forward to Japan because it's one of the nicest tracks."There are a lot of points to get, even though it looks very good for us. There's still a chance for Fernando, so we have to stay on top of our game."After his dominant victory in Korea on Sunday, Vettel is 77 points ahead of Alonso - who finished sixth in Korea - with a maximum of 125 available from the remaining five races.It is more likely Vettel will win the title in either India or Abu Dhabi, the two races after Japan, as Alonso has finished as low as eighth only once this season when he has made it to the end of a race, and that was when his car had a reliability problem in Bahrain.Alonso said: "The championship is a low priority at the moment. It doesn't look so good, not only because of points but more the performance gap that is stopping us thinking about the championship. We will not give up, [but] second in the constructors' championship is more realistic."Japan's Suzuka is Vettel's favourite track, but he said he did not mind at which track he won the title."To be honest, I don't think it really matters," he said. "I think it's an exceptional situation anyway. Even though it looks very good, it's still not over so we shouldn't feel too comfortable."Which track? It's not really important. Sure, there are a couple of tracks that probably mean a little bit more to the drivers than others. I think generally there's no track on the calendar that I dislike but there are a couple of highlights."I think I mentioned on the podium next week, Japan, is one of the highlights in the year, but regarding the championship I think our target is to win the championship and not to win it in one place in particular."He added: "We're just having a good time. We enjoy the fact that the team is working very well. The car is working... it's on the edge to be honest, more so than you would probably think from the outside but it's obviously nice when you get the results like Singapore or this weekend."Red Bull team boss Christian Horner admitted Red Bull would have to "try quite hard to screw it up", but insisted the team were "not focusing" on the fact they were on the verge of a fourth drivers' and constructors' double.</body>

      <body>Rafael Nadal may be set to overtake Novak Djokovic and regain the world number one spot, but he was beaten by his rival in the China Open final.An inspired Djokovic won 6-3 6-4 against his Spanish opponent, who will move to the top of the men's rankings on Monday after reaching the final.The Serb, who broke in each set on his way to winning, said: "I needed this."I wanted to win against Nadal, who has been the best player so far in 2013. It's important for my confidence."Djokovic, who won the China Open for a fourth time, started strongly and set the tone for the match by breaking Nadal's first service game as he raced into a 3-0 lead.The break proved crucial as the Serb produced some impressive tennis, with the timing and depth of his strokes not allowing Nadal the chance to get his game going.Djokovic dragged Nadal out wide with his serve and struck a powerful forehand into open space to wrap up the opening set after 35 minutes.The start of the second set saw Djokovic immediately break the Spaniard again and he continued to hold the initiative in commanding style.He took the following game to love and, as Nadal struggled to put pressure on his serve, went on to secure an emphatic win.Djokovic added: "It's been an incredible week again at the China Open and I still haven't lost a match here - I just love the conditions, the court and the atmosphere that goes around the tournament."I managed to stay tough and not drop my concentration, which I think [happened] in both Montreal and at the US Open in the important moments."I've learnt my lesson from a few very tough and close matches that I lost against Rafa on hard courts, especially the last one in the US Open final."Nadal, who will return to the top of the rankings for the first time since July 2011, failed to engineer a break point as his run of 21 matches unbeaten came to an end in Beijing.He said: "I couldn't see a way to stop him and he was too strong for me."I didn't play my best match. It was difficult to create spin on this ball and he was able to hit all the balls where he wanted."When that's happening against a player like Novak, you are dead - you don't have a chance."</body>

      <body>Double Olympic champion Sebastian Coe says Mo Farah's aim to break two hours for the marathon is "highly ambitious".Britain's Farah, the 5,000m and 10,000m world and Olympic champion, is said to be looking at becoming the first to run the 26.2 mile race in under two hours."This is a very ambitious aim from Mo," Lord Coe told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek programme."I love ambition. You cannot even think of breaking a record unless you are innately ambitious."Kenyan Wilson Kipsang broke the marathon world record by 15 seconds as he claimed the Berlin title last Sunday.The 31-year-old clocked a time of two hours three minutes 23 seconds to better the previous mark set by compatriot Patrick Makau two years ago.And 30-year-old Farah is intending to trim that time even further, something Coe says would be a huge feat.Coe, who won the 1500m Olympic titles in 1980 and 1984, explained: "With the risk of this sounding like a maths tutorial, the arithmetic of a sub two hour marathon is both instructive and quite sobering."You've got to run four minutes thirty five seconds per mile over the course. To put that into perspective and to understand what that means, go down to your local running track, run a lap in under 70 seconds, and then continue for 105 laps. You get the scale of what we are talking about."This is highly ambitious observation from Mo but he has the right training group in his corner. His coach Alberto Salazar is a former world marathon record holder. This is a very, very ambitious aim."Sir Roger Bannister, who was first person to run a sub four-minute mile believes with the right conditions and conditioning, Farah can achieve it."I don't think Mo will be ready to do it next year but it is of course possible," Sir Roger told BBC Radio 5 live."It has to be a set occasion, it couldn't be at an event and he would have to be lucky to have a day when the weather is favourable."He needs a course that is relatively flat, without hills. He needs a freedom from wind because that slows you down and he has to have pacemakers who will enable him to relax."However, Bannister did admit that Farah is yet to prove himself in a marathon despite having established himself as one of the greatest long-distance runners of all time."I think Mo is the most talented, wide-ranging distance runner we have ever seen," said Bannister."He may best at the lower range because he has broken Steve Cram's 1500m British record and run multiple times at 5k and 10k. But has not run at the marathon distance and we cannot be sure if his qualities extend."Farah is set to run the 2014 London Marathon next April.</body>

      <date>1381060028</date>
      <body>US Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker has warned that business is starting to suffer from the federal shutdown.Her comments at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) came as leaders gathering for the summit voiced worries about the US situation.Philippine President Benigno Aquino said that what happens in the US "affects us all".On Friday, the US defence contractor Lockheed Martin said it would put 3,000 workers on unpaid leave.The US government closed non-essential operations on Tuesday after Congress failed to agree a new budget.And President Barack Obama cancelled a scheduled trip to Asia because of the shutdown."The shutdown is not good for business. It's not good for the economy," Ms Pritzker said. One consequence of the shutdown had been her department's inability to collate vital economic data."We're a huge source of data for American business and that is a problem... It's affecting businesses and it's affecting their ability to get data," she said.From Monday, Lockheed will put 3,000 staff on leave, but the defence giant said this number would rise if the shutdown continued."I'm disappointed that we must take these actions and we continue to encourage our lawmakers to come together to pass a funding bill that will end this shutdown,'' Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed's chief executive and president, said in a statement."We hope that Congress and the Administration are able to resolve this situation as soon as possible," she added.The announcement followed United Technologies' decision to temporarily lay off 2,000 employees.The company, which makes Blackhawk helicopters, said some manufacturing had been halted because there were no government inspectors working to sign off products.Global impactThe widening impact of the shutdown sparked concern at Apec meeting in Bali on Sunday.Mrs Aquino said: "The US economy is the number one economy in the world, what happens there affects all of us."The world economy obviously is not in a position to withstand too much shock at this time when we are just recovering as a global economy."Meanwhile, Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said the US had to confront its fiscal problems "in a better way than they are doing it now with shutting down the government".Mr Obama is refusing to negotiate with the Republicans over the budget issues until they pass a temporary bill to reopen the government.He also wants agreement to raise the $16.7 trillion US borrowing limit, to avoid the country defaulting on its debts.</body>

      <body>Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham will not accept "slurs on his character" from his Conservative counterpart Jeremy Hunt, a Labour spokesman has said.Mr Hunt had suggested on Twitter that Mr Burnham attempted to "cover up" NHS failings when he was in government.As a result, the Labour MP instructed his lawyers to write to the heath secretary, the spokesman confirmed.A Conservative spokesman described Mr Burnham's move as "astonishing".Labour believes that Mr Hunt's tweet was "a step too far" and is seeking a retraction and apology unless Mr Hunt can provide evidence to substantiate his allegation, BBC political correspondent Alan Soady said.The Labour spokesman said: "Instead of focusing on what he should be doing and tackling the AandE crisis, Jeremy Hunt has spent all year orchestrating a smear campaign against Andy Burnham. On Friday, he went a step too far."This is behaviour unbecoming of a secretary of state. Andy Burnham is not prepared to accept these unfounded slurs on his character and the last government. He has therefore instructed lawyers to act on his behalf."In response, a Conservative source told our correspondent: "It's astonishing that Labour are still trying to deny the clear link between [England's health watchdog] the CQC's decision not to expose poor hospital care under the last government and the political pressure applied to the CQC by Labour ministers."Mr Hunt's tweet is understood to relate to a CQC investigation into Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which was placed in "special measures" in July after recording above-average death rates.Conservative MP Steve Barclay has said a series of emails - which he obtained and published on Friday after making a freedom of information request to the CQC - showed that Mr Burnham had put "pressure on the regulator to water down its concerns" about the trust when he was health secretary under Labour.</body>

      <title>Union anger at health pay proposal</title>
      <description>Unions criticise government moves to halt a 1% pay rise for all NHS staff in England, arguing they deserve to be rewarded for holding the health service together.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24408681</url>
      <date>1380991958</date>
      <body>Unions have criticised government moves to halt a 1% pay rise for all NHS staff in England.The Department of Health said the increase was unaffordable alongside the current system which sees many staff automatically receive incremental annual rises.It has urged the NHS pay review body to withhold the rise for 1.3m staff.Rachael Maskell, of the Unite trade union, said staff deserved the pay reward for "holding the NHS together".Health trusts are currently under pressure to make savings and the NHS wage bill accounts for around 40% of its budget.All public sector pay increases are capped at 1%.The Department of Health (DoH) proposes using the funding intended for the rise to "modernise" pay structures.It says automatic increments - linked to length of service and satisfactory performance - add £900m to salary costs.The DoH has stressed no decisions on changes to pay have been taken, insisting independent bodies will make their recommendations in February or March next year.But the plans, outlined in the DoH's submission to two independent pay review bodies, have been criticised by Unite and Labour.Ms Maskell, of Unite, said: "The Department of Health have got other choices. They're entering into a reorganisation which is costing £3bn, which nobody asked for and isn't adding anything to patient care."It is about choices and the NHS staff have already had two years of a pay freeze - 1% last year - and, quite frankly, are really falling behind inflation now with their wages."Staff moraleShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme motivation and morale was down among frontline health workers "at this very difficult time".However, in its submission the DoH points to a staff survey suggesting high levels of motivation and morale and says there should only be basic pay increases if there is "strong evidence" recruitment, retention, morale or motivation issues require this.Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the NHS reorganisation had taken money out of front-line services."There has to be pay restraint in the NHS as well as other public services... but the NHS has been through some very difficult years - so have NHS staff - and this was a modest increase to recognise the pressure that all families are under."To take it away, to break that promise, is just another kick in the teeth."Staff representatives have also reacted angrily to the plans."What they have done is inflammatory," said Christina McAnea, head of health at Unison and joint chairwoman of the NHS Staff Council."We are not going to negotiate while a gun is held to our head for a paltry 1% pay rise - our members will not react well to that."Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association council said this would not result in staff leaving in their "droves".However he added: "We're going to find it increasingly hard to recruit, partly for the specialist skills and partly for the numbers of staff that we'd need to bring into the health service to implement the safe minimum staffing levels."Health minister Anna Soubry defended the government 's stance telling the BBC: "This is about making sure we pay our NHS staff well and we reward their improvement in skills."This system works in other public sectors and the private sector. People want to make sure that they are getting good quality, first class services especially at a time when the NHS faces challenges."Earlier a DoH spokeswoman said: "Many NHS staff have continued to receive pay rises of up to 3.5% and we want to keep working with the trade unions and employers on affordable pay."The measures we are proposing will help increase quality for patients and help us realise our vision of an affordable seven-day service."In June Chancellor George Osborne said ministers were working to "remove automatic pay rises" for teachers, health professionals, prison and police staff.The DoH drew attention to Mr Osborne's comments and confirmed it wanted NHS pay to have "stronger links to performance, quality and productivity".</body>

      <title>'Over half of schools failing in RE'</title>
      <description>More than half of schools in England are failing pupils on religious education, says watchdog Ofsted.</description>

      <date>1381051158</date>
      <body>More than half of England's schools are failing pupils on religious education, the schools watchdog Ofsted has said.Its report accuses schools and the government of failing to focus effectively on the subject.It adds that six in 10 schools are not "realising the subject's full potential" in an increasingly globalised and multicultural century.The Religious Education Council for England and Wales called the findings disappointing but not surprising.The report highlights low standards, weak teaching, weak examination provision and confusion about the purpose of RE.In particular, it says the recent introduction of the English Baccalaureate measure for pupils who achieve grade C or above in English, mathematics, science, a language and either history or geography, ignores RE and has further marginalised the subject.The report echoes comments by the Education Secretary Michael Gove. In July he told religious leaders RE had "suffered" because of government changes.He said he had thought that because schools have a statutory duty to provide RE lessons the subject was protected.Ofsted's report, Religious Education: realising the potential, says the subject "plays a key role in promoting social cohesion and the virtues of respect and empathy, which are important in our diverse society" but it finds "many pupils leave school with scant subject knowledge and understanding".It adds: "Moreover RE teaching often fails to challenge and extend pupils' ability to explore fundamental questions about human life, religion and belief."Inspectors visited a sample of 185 schools, both primary and secondary, between September 2009 and July 2012.They found achievement and teaching in RE was less than good in six out of 10 primary schools, and in fewer than half of secondary schools and that not enough had been done to improve provision since a previous report in 2010.Teaching in primary schools was "not good enough because of weaknesses in teachers understanding of the subject", they found.Standards were higher for GCSE and sixth form students but even at GCSE level teaching often "failed to secure the core aim of the examination specifications, that is to enable pupils to adopt an enquiring, critical and reflective approach to the study of religion."The authors urge the Department for Education (DfE) to consider whether the quality and quantity of statutory RE provision should be left to schools to decide - or specified by central government.They want the DfE to work with professional RE teaching associations to "clarify the aims and purposes of RE" and to improve teacher training.Schools should ensure that teaching deepens "pupils' understanding of the nature, diversity and impact of religion and belief in the contemporary world," they urge.John Keast, chairman of the Religious Education Council for England and Wales said they had been warning "for some time about the poor state of religious education in many schools".He said they would publish their own report and RE curriculum later in October."It is now vital that the DfE works with the Religious Education Council on putting things right. We can do better than this."Stephen Evans of the National Secular Society said the recommendations did not go far enough."With the freedom to determine their own syllabus for RE, many schools with a religious character abuse the subject and use it for missionising."Young people would be better served by a new national curriculum subject for all pupils that covers a variety of religious, non-religious and secular philosophies and world views."Meanwhile, Gail Larkin from the National Association of Head Teachers said consecutive governments were responsible for schools placing less emphasis on the subject.She said: "Some of the major policy changes that we've had, the impact has been to convey the message that RE is of less value than other subjects."So, as a head teacher... we are concentrating more - as we've been told to do by consecutive governments - on core subjects and subjects that can be measured.""Unfortunately", she added, "I think RE has fallen off the radar".</body>

      <body>The alleged mastermind behind the online illegal drugs marketplace Silk Road is too dangerous to be bailed, US prosecutors have said.Ross Ulbricht, 29, was arrested this week and is charged with being the administrator of the site which has now been shut down.He is also accused of trying to arrange the killing of one of the site's users."We deny all charges and that is the end of the discussion at this point," Mr Ulbricht's lawyer said.Mr Ulbricht appeared in a San Francisco court on Friday wearing a green T-shirt under red jail clothes and had his ankles shackled.A request from his legal team for his bail hearing to be pushed back was granted - it will now take place on 9 October.Federal magistrate Joseph Spero asked Mr Ulbricht's lawyer Brandon LeBlanc whether seeing the criminal indictment that included a murder-for-hire charge had "changed his calculus" on whether he thought Mr Ulbricht would be granted bail.As part of its criminal complaint, the FBI alleged that Mr Ulbricht had sought to pay a Silk Road user to kill another user who had threatened to expose details of the site's users.Prosecutors opposed the delay, arguing that Mr Ulbricht represented a danger to the community, and that there was a high likelihood that he may attempt to flee.The Silk Road was a well-known destination on Tor, a so-called "dark web" service that anonymises users, making it much more difficult for authorities to track locations.The site sold a range of items, but was most famous for offering a host of illegal drugs, paid for using virtual currency Bitcoin.</body>

      <title>'Digital baby' screen for sperm donors</title>
      <description>A service that digitally weaves together the DNA of prospective parents to check for potential disease in thousands of "virtual babies" is set to launch in the US by December.</description>

      <date>1380885044</date>
      <body>A service that digitally weaves together the DNA of prospective parents to check for potential disease in thousands of "virtual babies" is set to launch in the US by December.New York start-up Genepeeks will initially focus on donor sperm, simulating before pregnancy how the genetic sequence of a female client might combine with those of different males.Donors that more often produce "digital children" with a higher risk of inherited disorders will be filtered out, leaving those who are better genetic matches.Everything happens in a computer, but experts have raised ethical questions."We are just in the business right now of giving prospective mothers, who are using donor sperm to conceive, a filtered catalogue of donors based on their own underlying genetic profile," Genepeeks co-founder Anne Morriss told BBC News."We are filtering out the donor matches with an elevated risk of rare recessive paediatric conditions."Ms Morriss, an entrepreneur, gave a presentation on the company at the Consumer Genetics Conference in Boston last week.She was motivated in part by her own experience of starting a family. Her son was conceived with a sperm donor who happened to share with Morriss the gene for an inherited disorder called MCADD.MCADD (medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency) prevents those affected from converting fats to sugar. It can be fatal if it is not diagnosed early. Luckily, in Ms Morriss's case, the condition was picked up in newborn screening tests."My son has a pretty normal life," Ms Morriss said, "but about 30% of children with rare genetic diseases don't make it past the age of five."Genepeeks has formalised a partnership with a sperm bank - the Manhattan Cryobank - and has a patent pending on the DNA screening technology.The start-up benefits from the rapid pace of change in genetic technology.Indeed, six months ago, Genepeeks' founders decided it was able to use a superior system for DNA analysis (called "targeted exon sequencing") than the one originally envisaged - a result, says Anne Morriss, of falling costs and increased flexibility.For couples planning babies, other companies already screen one or both partners for genes that could cause disease if combined with a similar variant - so-called "carrier screening".One academic who studies the use of genetic technology commented: "This is like that, but ramped up 100,000 times."Ms Morriss's business partner, Prof Lee Silver, a geneticist and expert on bioethics at Princeton University, New Jersey, told BBC News: "We get the DNA sequence from two prospective parents. We simulate the process of reproduction, forming virtual sperm and virtual eggs. We put them together to form a hypothetical child genome."Then we can look at that hypothetical genome and - with all the tools of modern genetics - determine the risk that the genome will result in a child with disease. We're looking directly for disease and not carrier status. For each pair of people that we're going to analyse, we make 10,000 hypothetical children."The process will be run for the client and each potential donor one by one, scanning for some 600 known single-gene recessive conditions. In this way, the highest-risk pairings can be filtered out.Anne Morriss added: "At this stage our clients won't be receiving any genetic information back. We're very much focused on the practical utility of helping prospective parents who want to protect their future kids, giving them the option of additional analysis to what is currently being offered in the industry."But the company's founders have plans to expand the screening beyond single-gene recessive disorders to more complex conditions in which multiple genes play a part.Indeed, going to the trouble of simulating thousands of digital children deliberately lays the ground for this: "[It's] impossible to get towards an accurate risk calculation in any other way," said Anne Morriss.And in a video produced by the company, Prof Silver says: "My hope for the future is that any people who want to have a baby can use this technology to greatly reduce the risk of disease being expressed in their child."To some, such a prospect might appear like a step towards designer babies - until now the preserve of science fiction literature and films such as Gattaca, which envisaged a future of genetic "haves" and "have-nots".Bio-ethicists approached by the BBC said Genepeeks was a logical outcome of the increasing demand for more information when making reproductive decisions.However, some raised potential concerns about risk communication and the expansion of screening beyond rare single-gene disorders. But they suggested there were few, if any, regulatory barriers.One ethicist told BBC News: "The biggest question for me, just from the outset, is the understanding of uncertainty. Even people who have been doing genomics for years still have a hard time figuring out exactly what a risk for a particular genetic predisposition really means for a family."Gene-environment interactions can lead to people either having disease or not having disease."Dr Ewan Birney, associate director of the European Bioinformatics Institute in Hinxton, UK, echoed the point: "It's good that they're focusing on the carrier status of these rare Mendelian disorders where it's potentially more clear-cut. That said, these things are more complex than they first seem," he said."I'm sure the scientists appreciate that complexity. But when transmitting that complexity to everyday people, these things can sound more absolute than they really are."He added: "The thing I would want to stress here is just how complex this is. It's great that people are thinking of using this technology in lots of different ways, but our knowledge gap is very large."Risk communication to clients was, said Anne Morriss, "absolutely critical to anyone in this industry"."We have to be crystal clear about what we're testing for, what risks we're helping to reduce; that there's no guarantee you won't give birth to a sick child," she said.Prof Mildred Cho, associate director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics in California, raised questions over whether the sperm donor should also receive information about their genome gleaned from the screening process."Unlike hair colour, occupation or family history - those are things, presumably, the donor already knows - the thing that's different about this that I see is it could create information that the donor doesn't already have. It also has implications for the donor's other biological family members," Prof Cho told BBC News.This week it also emerged that California-based consumer genetics company 23andMe had submitted the patent on a DNA analysis tool for planning a child.Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter</body>

      <body>Funding for the BBC's arts coverage will go up by 20%, the broadcaster's director general is to announce.Tony Hall - who used to run the Royal Opera House - says he wants to return the arts to the corporation's "heart".It will mean plays, art exhibitions and more live music from around the UK being broadcast on the BBC.Among Lord Hall's proposals are a new "BBC Arts at" brand and new television series fronted by historian Simon Schama and broadcaster Andrew Marr.The director general, formerly the BBC's head of news, returned to the corporation following the Jimmy Savile scandal.He wants to see the BBC collaborate more with arts institutions around the country.In a speech on Tuesday he is expected to unveil new partnerships with London's British Museum, the Tate and the Manchester International Festival.The plans mean that more opening nights, major exhibitions and arts events will be shown live on television.An experimental digital service known as The Space, developed by the BBC and Arts Council England, is also due to be relaunched in 2014."Arts programming sits right at the heart of the BBC and is a vital part of who we are, but I want us to to be much more ambitious," Lord Hall said."We need to showcase more of the incredible talent that this country has to offer to the widest possible audiences.He is due to announce major new television series featuring two faces familiar to BBC audiences.Mr Schama will front a five-part series in partnership with the National Portrait Gallery exploring the history of Britain through portraiture.A series looking at the greatest writers in Scotland will be presented by journalist Mr Marr.And there will be a series of six BBC One programmes seeking to uncover the "hidden heroes" of British art, with 10 amateurs competing for the title of Britain's best artists.The announcement is part of the director general's new strategy for the BBC and comes as the corporation looks to cut 2,000 jobs over five years after the freezing of the licence fee.</body>

      <title>Why is a children's book about rabbits being read at weddings?</title>
      <description>More and more people are including children's books in their wedding readings. Why?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24379830</url>
      <date>1380845753</date>
      <body>More and more people are including children's books in their wedding readings. Why?When Hannah Larkin married her husband Jason, she had three readings, but one stood out - a reading from Guess How Much I Love You by Sam McBratney.In her late teens, Larkin had fallen in love with the story of Big Nutbrown Hare and Little Nutbrown Hare and their attempt to articulate their love. It remained one of her favourite books.Said hares try to outdo each other in their hyperbolic declarations of love for each other.A sample section runs: '"I love you all the way down the lane as far as the river," cried Little Nutbrown Hare. "I love you across the river and over the hills," said Big Nutbrown Hare.'It might seem saccharine stuff to a hardened cynic but many brides and grooms seem to feel differently."Although it's a children's book, it resonates with adult life because it's about the infinite nature of genuine love," says Larkin. At the wedding at a hotel in the New Forest, her sister read the entire book. Her husband's goddaughter Amelia looked up at her, mesmerised by the story.The "classic" Christian wedding reading is 1 Corinthians 13, with its ruminations on faith, hope and love (or charity), but modern couples are varying their readings, says Bernadette Chapman, director of the UK Alliance of Wedding Planners."That's the big thing with weddings now... it's about [the couple's] personalities," says Chapman. Children's literature has become so popular because it's inter-generational and everyone can relate to it."They're trying to choose readings that are easy to understand, that are fun to read and fun to listen to and just bring a smile to people's faces."Chapman says readings from children's books have become popular among remarrying couples who want to give children from previous relationships a key role by reading from a favourite story.One of the most popular readings is taken from The Velveteen Rabbit by Margery Williams. It tells the tale of a small stuffed rabbit and its longing to become real through the love of a human.When actress Drew Barrymore married Will Kopelman in 2012, Kopelman's sister read a passage from the book. Prince William and Prince Harry read alternate lines from it at the wedding of Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall.The growing popularity of wedding blogs has prompted more creativity in the choice of reading, Chapman says.But why does children's literature continue to have such resonance? Prof Maria Nikolajeva, director of the University of Cambridge-Homerton Research and Teaching Centre for Children's Literature, says that children's books give us a shared experience.Nikolajeva's daughter had a reading from The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery at her wedding and Nikolajeva read from The Velveteen Rabbit during the ceremony.She says children's books are adept at expressing profound thoughts and philosophy about life in a very concise manner, which makes them ideal for wedding readings.Books like The Velveteen Rabbit take on existential questions, such as what it means to be a human being, in a way that we can connect with."As we grow up we are exploring the world and we very often explore the world through the characters of literature because it offers us an experience that we cannot always find in the everyday world," says Nikolajeva.She says children love to revisit books as they grow older because as they change, they "interact with the text each time, understanding it more and getting involved with it more".Children's books can be harder to write than longer form fiction, the theory goes, because an author has to articulate a concept in a way that can be reinterpreted as we develop.Even as adults, we can find new meaning in children's literature.When Andrea Dell married her husband Robert at a hotel in Wigan, she opted for a reading from The Owl and the Pussycat by Edward Lear, a poem she remembered from childhood. For Dell, it took on new meaning with its references to getting married."It was just an opportunity to make everybody smile and something that was familiar to them and also was quite evocative with the imagery in it, and also I'm a huge cat fan," says Dell.She says it is something they can share with their children in years to come and might even be a reading her daughter chooses for her wedding."People are moving away from the traditional; they like to mix things up a bit. We had some music from Star Wars in our proceedings," says Dell, whose husband is a big Star Wars fan."I think there is so much variety in children's literature. I think people are looking a bit further afield to try and make it a bit more interesting and a bit more unique to them."You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <body>Andrei Pandele was a young architect when he began photographing his home country, Romania, in the 1970s. His camera captured a period of huge change under communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. For some, his stunning photos are now a painful reminder of a time of destruction, and a life lost."It's cool! I really like it." Born in the year of the 1989 Revolution, Paul is one of a new generation of Romanians - multilingual, well-educated and ambitious for his country.He is understandably proud of the giant House of the People, once Ceausescu's palace. After all, it's now home to Romania's fledgling democracy and only trumped in size by the Pentagon building in the US.We are hovering in one of its many airless, pointlessly large halls, waiting for a conference on sustainable tourism to finish in the never-ending room next door.I don't share Paul's sentiments. The vast slabs of marble feel suffocating - we may as well be stuck in the centre of an outsized wedding cake.Photographer Andrei Pandele is emphatic: "The Palace? Ha! It is a wall in the way of the people. A dam, even."We have met in a tea shop in the old Jewish quarter of Bucharest. There are photographs from his collection on every wall.They're exceptional images rarely caught on camera, but then Andrei is an exceptional man - tall, dignified and handsome at 65.It is thanks to his fearless vision that Ceausescu's relentless attack on Bucharest can be seen stage by stage - as if peeling away the layers of an onion."I was an architect," he explains. "I could find plans [and] approximate what they would destroy. Not exactly, no-one knew that. They were wild, totally out of control."Seven square kilometres of the city centre were destroyed to make way for the Palace of the People. Andrei wanted to take some pictures before old Bucharest disappeared altogether.I've been coming to Romania for 20 years but I have never seen images like these.A city caught in its very own Armageddon. Andrei preserved a Bucharest that no longer exists - the exquisite glass-covered market, the archways, cobbled streets, the vine-clad villas, the city once called the "little Paris of the East".But in many of the pictures the mighty onslaught has already begun - innumerable cranes chewing their way through people's lives, the facade of the crazy palace looming up over the threatened cityscape. And then, in some others, there's just snow or dust and the desert of demolition.Not a verbose man, in front of his pictures, Andrei becomes almost chatty."After two years of photographing the architectural destruction I decided that it was very bad, but it was even worse that they were ruining the lives of 22 million people. So I began to take pictures of everyday life. I think they are much more striking."The next series of photographs showing everyday life under Ceausescu is like a haunting silent movie. We see desolate streets when there was no petrol, queues for food that never came, trams straddled by desperate commuters, useless cars buried under snow and a wedding party picking their way through the streets. No-one is smiling.I can't decide which is more astonishing - the photographs or the photographer? How did he get away with taking pictures which so openly "denigrated the socialist reality", a crime that carried a six-year prison sentence in communist Romania?Andrei explains that he was a part-time sports photographer, so he had a state-sanctioned excuse to carry a camera.And he tells me I must understand the strange psychology of the state policemen: "Tessa, they are very aggressive with those who are afraid, but much less aggressive with people who are not at all afraid. I was confident. Don't hide if you don't want to get caught."Andrei's brazen behaviour captured a vital slice of Romania's painful past.Yet it took a full 18 years before he could show his photographs to an astonished Romanian public.The people in power did not want to be reminded of what they had got so wrong. He had to wait.Andrei shrugs: "I have seen women over 40 exploding in tears in front of my photographs, because they saw their life had been destroyed, but they realised it 20 years too late. And a lot of teenagers laughed neurotically - because they recognised something in the pictures that their parents had told them, but they had never seen for themselves."My young friend Paul represents the generation that escaped that hell.He's silenced by Andrei - his experience, his audacity, his pictures.Later, as we walk back through the centre of Bucharest, taking in its schizophrenic appearance with fresh eyes, Paul quietly concedes: 'It is a pity Ceausescu had to build the palace complex right in the middle of the old city."From Our Own Correspondent: Listen online or download the podcast.BBC Radio 4: Saturdays at 11:30 and some Thursdays at 11:00BBC World Service: Short editions Monday-Friday - see World Service programme schedule.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <body>A hospital patient whose death has prompted a murder inquiry was a "really brilliant man", say neighbours.Police are investigating whether James May, 76, had been given a drugs overdose before he died at the James Paget Hospital, in Norfolk.A hospital worker was arrested on suspicion of murder on Saturday and has been bailed until November.Neighbours of Mr May, who died on 20 September, described the Great Yarmouth man as "humble and welcoming".Paying tribute to him, Matthew Palmer, 21, also said Mr May was a "good neighbour", "enthusiastic" and a "really brilliant man."Mr May, a retired driving instructor, moved to Great Yarmouth about 10 years ago from London, in search of a quieter pace of life.Diane Halliday, 67, also of Great Yarmouth, had known Mr May since he retired to the town and said he was a "genuinely nice chap"."It was so sad to think that he'd died, but to have all this [the investigation] as well is just unbelievable.""He could have had a good few more years left... it knocks you back a bit to think this could have happened... you can't take it all in."The James Paget University Hospital reported an allegation of medical malpractice in connection with Mr May's death, 10 days after the incident in September.Det Ch Insp Paul Durham, from the Norfolk and Suffolk Major Investigation Team, said: "We are investigating an allegation that a drugs overdose was administered to a patient, leading to his death."A Home Office post-mortem, carried out earlier this week, determined the cause of Mr May's death as heart failure and we now await the results of further toxicology tests which will help inform our inquiry."Mr May lived with his terrier-cross dog Polly and was a keen member of the Hemsby short mat bowls club. He also enjoyed time in his boat on the Norfolk Broads.</body>

      <body>Bank card fraudsters have targeted Surrey residents in a series of attempted thefts over a period of 24 hours, police said.Ten reports of attempted scams were reported to police, with the latest three calls received just after 21:00 BST on Saturday.The fraudsters phone people claiming to be a police officer and try to get them to hand over cash and cards.Attempted thefts happened in Guildford, Woking, Pyrford, Burpham and Chobham.The callers use a variety of stories including saying the person's bank card has been used by somebody they have in custody.They then ask the card holder to phone the bank to cancel the card and say they will send a courier round to collect it.The fraudster stays on the line and obtains the person's bank details whilst they think they are phoning the bank.A courier then visits the victim's home, saying they have been sent by the police to collect the card.The latest calls were received in Upshot Lane, Woking; Frog Grove Lane, Wood Street Village and Burnet Avenue, Burpham.An attempt was also made in Boltons Lane, Pyrford at about 17:30 BST, when a man claiming to be a courier attempted to get bank cards from an elderly resident.He is described as white, aged about 40, 5ft 8in (1.7m) tall and spoke with an eastern European accent. He was stocky, with short dark hair and was wearing a dark jacket and trousers.Officers have urged anyone who receives a suspicious call not give away any details and to call the police.</body>

      <title>'No NHS pay freeze' in Scotland</title>
      <description>Scottish Health Secretary Alex Neil pledges not to impose a pay freeze on NHS workers in Scotland.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-24419314</url>
      <date>1381054422</date>
      <body>The Scottish government has pledged not to impose a pay freeze on NHS workers in Scotland.It came after the Department of Health (DoH) at Westminster urged UK-wide pay review bodies to cancel a planned 1% pay rise next year.It said the rise was unaffordable and the money should instead be used to help maintain safe staffing levels.But Scottish Health Minister Alex Neil said he had "no intention" of withholding the rise in Scotland.He said the Scottish government had made its own proposals to the pay review bodies, proposing that the 1% rise is implemented in 2014/15 as well as giving further help to those on low wages by ensuring no one employed by the health service earns less than the Scottish Living Wage.Mr Neil accused Westminster counterpart Jeremy Hunt of "bad faith" and said withholding the pay rise would be a "betrayal of the NHS".He added: "To steal the pay rise back from workers' hands will destabilise the NHS across the UK and damage morale."The Scottish government has no intention of following Jeremy Hunt and we will use our independence over the health service to block this move."But with UK wide agreement to Agenda for Change - which established pay policy in the health service - this damaging right wing approach could hit Scottish services, and under the current funding settlement could drive down Scotland's budget in the future."My message to Hunt is unequivocal - Scotland rejects your politics, your attack on staff, and your desire to destroy the real NHS."The health secretary said he would be meeting with unions "to ensure this ludicrous proposal finds no foundation in Scotland."On Saturday it emerged the DoH had made a written submission to the NHS Pay Review Body in which it said the proposed 1% rise was unaffordable alongside the current system, which sees many staff automatically receive incremental annual rises.The move has been criticised by Labour and the unions.The DoH has stressed no decisions on changes to pay have been taken, and said independent bodies will make their recommendations in February or March next year.However, in its submission, the DoH pointed to a staff survey suggesting high levels of motivation and morale, and said there should only be basic pay increases if there is "strong evidence" recruitment, retention, morale or motivation issues require this.The submission said: "Employers cannot pay staff more, improve quality and productivity and protect jobs."Careful and prudent management of the NHS pay bill is critical if we are to maintain the right number of frontline staff with the right skills. We believe more affordable employment contracts can help deliver better care and improve job security."The NHS Pay Review Body makes recommendations on the remuneration of all staff paid under Agenda for Change and employed in the NHS.Its recommendations apply to about 1.5 million staff in NHS Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with the exception of doctors, dentists and very senior managers.It reports separately to the health ministers in each country of the UK, who can accept, reject or modify its recommendation.</body>

      <title>Parade protests 'must be peaceful'</title>
      <description>A senior member of the Democratic Unionist Party says any parade protests must be peaceful, after an Orangeman talks about a possible campaign of civil disobedience.</description>

      <date>1381058548</date>
      <body>A senior member of the Democratic Unionist Party has defended the right of Protestants to protest about parades but said they must be peaceful.Arlene Foster's comments come after a senior Orangeman said protests over a contentious Orange Order parade could include "civil disobedience".William Mawhinney made the comments at a protest rally over restrictions to a 12 July parade in north Belfast.Ms Foster urged young people not to get involved in criminal activity.Northern Ireland's enterprise minister told the BBC's Sunday Politics programme: "We very much defend the right of people to protest on any issue."But what must happen, and I do make this very clear, is that people must remain within the law of the land when they engage in protest," she said."Some people, during the flags protest, went out to protest and things went further than they should have gone and therefore those young people now have a criminal conviction"I do not want to see young people, whether in Belfast or anywhere else in Northern Ireland, blighted with a criminal conviction for something that they will regret for the rest of their lives."The Orange Order has been staging a protest in the Woodvale area every Saturday since part of its parade was stopped in July.It was prevented from returning along part of the Crumlin Road separating loyalist and nationalist communities. Several nights of violence ensued.Addressing a crowd of about 500 people on the Woodvale Road on Saturday, Mr Mawhinney said the parade protests would be "up-scaled... right up to civil disobedience if that's what it takes".The County Grand Secretary in Belfast added: "The camp and the protests continue as strongly as they ever did from when they first began."Mr Mawhinney was flanked by a number of politicians, including her party colleague Nelson McCausland of the Democratic Unionist Party.When asked about Mr McCausland's appearance at the rally, Ms Foster, told the BBC: "I know that Nelson will have been there, and he will have been exercising his right, but he will also have been exercising his responsibility as he always does in those occasions."He will have been bringing calm to the area and talking to people to make sure that things did not get out of hand and I very much defend the right of Nelson to be there."The Orange Order has not said exactly what it means by civil disobedience, but has insisted it doesn't mean violence.Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said positive leadership was needed within unionism to take a stand against "illegal marches, sectarianism and violence, and the provocative actions of the Orange Order in Belfast"."The lack of real leadership by unionist leaders has had a negative effect on public opinion and confidence in the power-sharing institutions is being undermined," he said.</body>

      <body>Companies in Wales could do more to export goods to new markets, according to the South Wales Chamber of Commerce.Director Graham Morgan said businesses should create more opportunities to tap into emerging markets.Wales exported £633m worth of goods to the Middle East in 2012, making it the fourth most popular destination.The Welsh government said international trade remains a priority. A Royal Bank of Scotland report said firms could use markets like Mexico and Brazil more.Mr Morgan told BBC Wales Today: "There are certainly a range of mechanisms in place to move into new markets."I think there's probably a shortfall in the number of businesses that have fantastic products and fantastic services but don't appreciate that they can now be sold in overseas markets."And the more we can get business proprietors to think in terms of where they can be making headway in what has been a difficult economic market, the better for Wales."Chris Howarth, managing director of confectionery company Bon Bon Buddies in Blackwood, Caerphilly county, said it was challenging trading across different parts of world.He said: "You have to get it right in a completely different cultural environment so you have to be committed to learning a different set of rules of the game... every single market is different."The Welsh government said they have a programme of trade missions and exhibitions in place which will take in markets including China, India, Brazil and Russia.</body>

      <body>A South African union representing car workers has agreed a new pay deal, ending a month-long strike that has crippled the industry.The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa accepted a 10% pay rise this year and 8% in the next two years.The strike in the car components industry caused severe disruption, especially to exports.Last week BMW said it had stopped "all future plans" to expand in South Africa because of the industrial action.Under the deal, pay at small-to-medium-sized car parts firms will only rise wages by 9% in the first year, followed by 8% in the subsequent two years."The strike was very hard for us," Irvin Jim, the general secretary of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), told reporters.The car components' strike followed industrial action by workers at car manufacturers themselves, which hit production at BMW, Ford, Nissan and General Motors and cost an estimated $2bn (£1.24bn) in lost output.This year, the mining, construction and aviation sectors have also been hit by strikes, raising concerns about the impact on South Africa's economic growth.Last week, Bodo Donauer, managing director at BMW South Africa, said the company had been unable to produce 11,000 cars while its workers were striking."But more important than these 11,000 cars is the sustainable damage which this [the strike] has made," Mr Donauer said.On Sunday, Mr Jim said BMW's decision to stop future investment was "blackmail" which would be "rejected with the contempt it deserves".</body>

      <title>New Zealand win Rugby Championship</title>
      <description>New Zealand clinch the Rugby Championship title with a 38-27 victory over South Africa in Johannesburg.</description>

      <date>1380994980</date>
      <body>New Zealand secured the Rugby Championship with a pulsating 38-27 win over South Africa at Ellis Park.After Ben Smith's try put the All Blacks ahead, two Bryan Habana scores gave the Springboks hope only for two tries from Liam Messam to give the visitors a half-time lead.Tries from Willie le Roux and Jean de Villiers put South Africa in front.But scores from Beauden Barrett and Kieran Read earned a sixth win from six games for the All Blacks.South Africa went into the game needing a bonus point victory by more than seven points to claim the trophy.But Kiwi coach Steve Hansen's team never looked interested in winning the title with damage limitation, producing a stylish display to win the tournament for the eighth time in 11 years, including its previous incarnation as the Tri-Nations before Argentina joined last year.South Africa had to be content with second place in the group, while Australia secured third spot after a thumping 54-17 victory of fourth-placed Argentina.Barrett's try - New Zealand's fourth - guaranteed a bonus point and confirmed the trophy with 20 minutes left."We had the belief to hit back when the momentum was against us," said New Zealand skipper Richie McCaw."As an All Black I relish these occasions and winning at this great stadium makes me so proud. We gave everything out there this evening."Springboks captain Jean de Villiers said: "To win rugby matches you have to attack and defend and our defence was not up to scratch in this match."Let us give credit to New Zealand - they deserved to win the match and the Championship after a great advertisement for rugby."Morne Steyn kicked an early penalty but the All Blacks moved ahead when a fine offload from Read was followed by Smith beating two defenders to score.But South Africa responded when Duane Vermeulen made space with a surging run and sent Habana over in the 18th minute.Two minutes later a fine one-handed pass from Francois Louw put Habana into space and the winger chipped over Smith and gathered before touching down in the corner.Habana limped off with what appeared to be a hamstring injury two minutes later and the hosts failed to build on their 15-7 advantage.Heavy pressure from New Zealand resulted in Messam, assisted by Brodie Retallick, bundling over from about a yard.And when South Africa attempted to run the ball out in first-half added time, Read turned the ball over and a slick passing move to the left ended with Messam stepping in to score his second try.Six minutes after the interval Messam was sent to the sin bin and within seconds the hosts took a penalty quickly and fed the ball right for Le Roux to cross, with Steyn's conversion making it 22-21.With 14 men, Ma'a Nonu denied a decisive try and after Barrett's penalty restored New Zealand's advantage, De Villiers barged through three tackles to score.The game swung again within two minutes when Barrett broke through to score a fourth try and end South Africa's chances of winning the trophy.New Zealand's Ben Franks was shown a yellow card but, even with a man down, the outstanding Read was sent over in the corner by Julian Savea.</body>

      <body>More than two million people in China are employed by the government to monitor web activity, state media say, providing a rare glimpse into how the state tries to control the internet.The Beijing News says the monitors, described as internet opinion analysts, are on state and commercial payrolls.China's hundreds of millions of web users increasingly use microblogs to criticise the state or vent anger.Recent research suggested Chinese censors actively target social media.The report by the Beijing News said that these monitors were not required to delete postings.They are "strictly to gather and analyse public opinions on microblog sites and compile reports for decision-makers", it said. It also added details about how some of these monitors work.Tang Xiaotao has been working as a monitor for less than six months, the report says, without revealing where he works."He sits in front of a PC every day, and opening up an application, he types in key words which are specified by clients."He then monitors negative opinions related to the clients, and gathers (them) and compile reports and send them to the clients," it says.The reports says the software used in the office is even more advanced and supported by thousands of servers. It also monitors websites outside China.China rarely reveals any details concerning the scale and sophistication of its internet police force.It is believed that the two million internet monitors are part of a huge army which the government relies on to control the internet.The government is also to organise training classes for them for the first time from 14 to 18 October, the paper says.But it is not clear whether the training will be for existing monitors or for new recruits.The training will have eight modules, and teach participants how to analyse and judge online postings and deal with crisis situations, it says.The most popular microblogging site Sina Weibo, launched in 2010, now has more than 500 million registered users with 100 million messages posted daily.Topics cover a wide range - from personal hobbies, health to celebrity gossip and food safety but they talso include politically sensitive issues like official corruption.Postings deemed to be politically incorrect are routinely deleted.</body>

      <body>A German embassy employee in Yemen has been shot dead, reports say.The attack took place outside a supermarket in the capital's Hadda district, where the German and other foreign embassies are located.The victim - reported to be a bodyguard of Ambassador Carola Mueller-Holtkemper - has not been named. German officials say they are checking the reports.Yemen is struggling to control general lawlessness, an al-Qaeda insurgency, and divisions within the army.Initial reports suggested that the attack was a failed kidnapping attempt of Germany's ambassador."The ambassador escaped but her bodyguard was killed as he tried to resist the attackers who managed to flee," AFP news agency quoted an unnamed diplomatic source as saying.However, the agency later quoted a Yemeni foreign ministry spokesman as saying that Ms Mueller-Holtkemper was "currently outside the country".The German foreign ministry told the BBC it could not confirm any of the reports.Germany - along with several other Western countries - briefly closed its Yemen embassy in August, after the US warned of a potential major militant attack in the Middle East.</body>

      <description>Negotiations on a sweeping free trade pact between the US and the EU are postponed because of a partial government shutdown in America.</description>

      <body>Negotiations on a sweeping free trade pact between the US and the EU have been postponed because of a partial government shutdown in America.US officials had been due in Brussels next week to discuss the deal aimed at boosting bilateral ties.US President Barack Obama earlier cancelled his trip to Asia because of the shutdown.The US government closed non-essential operations on Tuesday after Congress failed to agree a new budget.Since then hundreds of thousands of government employees have not been working or paid.On Friday, US trade representative Michael Froman informed the EU that financial and staffing constraints made it impossible to send a full negotiating team to Brussels.But he stressed that Washington would continue working with the EU on drawing up the deal, but would have to wait until the shutdown was over.Reacting to the US announcement, European Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht said the delay was unfortunate."But let me underline that it in no way distracts us from our overall aim of achieving an ambitious trade and investment deal," he added.Meanwhile, the White House said that Mr Obama would miss two summits in Asia, including the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) meeting in Indonesia.It said the decision was made due to the "difficulty in moving forward with foreign travel in the face of a shutdown".Mr Obama called Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on Friday and expressed his regret over the cancellation, Indonesian presidential spokesman for foreign affairs Teuku Faizasyah told the BBC.The visit had not been rescheduled, the spokesman added.Secretary of State John Kerry will attend the Apec gathering and the East Asia summit in Brunei in Mr Obama's place, the White House said.President Obama had been due to begin a four-nation Asian trip on Saturday, heading to Bali and Brunei before travelling on to Malaysia and the Philippines.The US government partially shut down operations on Tuesday after Republicans who control the House of Representatives refused to approve a budget, saying they would only do so if Mr Obama's healthcare reform law was delayed or stripped of funding.Mr Obama and the Democrats have refused, noting the law was passed in 2010, subsequently approved by the Supreme Court, and was a central issue in the 2012 election which Mr Obama won comfortably.On Friday, Democrats and Republicans appeared no closer to finding a way out of the impasse.Republican House Speaker John Boehner insisted Mr Obama and Democratic Senate leaders open negotiations on the shutdown."All we're asking for is to sit down and have a discussion," he said. "This isn't some damn game."Mr Obama later said he was happy to hold talks with the Republicans, "but we can't do it with a gun held to the head of the American people"."This shutdown could be over today," he said. "We know there are the votes for it in the House of Representatives. If Speaker Boehner will simply allow the vote to take place, we can end this shutdown."The US also faces running out of money and defaulting on its debt if there is no agreement to raise government borrowing limits later this month.Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said warned earlier that a failure to raise the US debt ceiling would be a far worse threat to the global economy than the current shutdown.She said it was "mission critical" that the US agreed a new debt limit.Ms Lagarde's comments were echoed by the US Treasury.It said a debt default could lead to a financial crisis as bad as 2008 or worse.Meanwhile, the impact of the shutdown was being felt across the country.The National Transportation Safety Board did not send investigators to a deadly church bus crash in Tennessee that killed eight people and injured 14 others.The labour department also postponed the release of the highly anticipated September jobs report.With Tropical Storm Karen bearing down on the Gulf states, the website of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), carried a message saying: "Due to the federal government shutdown, NOAA.gov and most associated web sites are unavailable."It referred visitors to the National Weather Service.However, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) recalled workers to help prepare for the storm.On Friday, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said the House would vote on a measure to re-open Fema as well as the National Weather Service to deal with the impending storm.</body>

      <title>Brazil opposition launches alliance</title>
      <description>Former Environment Minister Marina Silva joins the Brazilian Socialist Party after failing to officially register her new party.</description>

      <date>1381015539</date>
      <body>In a major political realignment in Brazil, the former senator and Environment Minister Marina Silva has joined the Brazilian Socialist Party.The popular environmentalist joined the Socialists after failing to officially register her new party.The Socialist Party is headed by the state governor of Pernambuco and presidential hopeful Eduardo Campos, who also boasts high approval ratings.Brazilians will choose a successor to President Dilma Rousseff in a year.While Mr Campos is expected to be the Socialist Party's presidential candidate, Ms Silva's role in the ticket is not yet clear.Ms Silva's announcement came after more than a day of intense negotiations.Her Sustainability Network was 50,000 signatures short of the 492,000 required by Brazilian law to be officially registered.Late on Thursday, Brazil's Supreme Electoral Court rejected an appeal to consider about 100,000 signatures that had been considered invalid.As the country's legislation requires potential candidates to be affiliated to a party one year before running for an election, Ms Silva had to join a party until Saturday in order to keep her presidential hopes alive.At an event in the capital, Brasilia, Ms Silva and her closest allies of the Sustainability Network joined the Socialist Party.The former Amazon activist joked that hers was the "first clandestine party founded in democracy"."This is a historic re-alignment, burying once and for all the old republic," Ms Silva said.The president of Socialist Party, which counts former Brazil striker and current federal deputy Romario among its ranks, also said the alliance was "historic".Mr Campos, whose government of the north-eastern state of Pernambuco has one of the country's highest approval ratings, also said the move broke a "false polarisation" in Brazilian politics."Those who understood what happened on the streets in June [during Brazil's massive protests], won't find it hard to understand what is happening here," he told a crowd in Brasilia.Ms Silva came third with nearly 20m votes in her 2010 presidential bid. Recent opinion polls show her trailing only President Rousseff, while Mr Campos has about 4% support.Political analysts are divided as to what impact the alliance could have, with some arguing it will create a more united opposition front, threatening Ms Rousseff's re-election plans, while others say it could actually disappoint potential Marina Silva voters.Ms Silva served as an environment minister for five years, before stepping down in 2008, citing disagreements with the government.Since her surprising success in 2010 as the Brazilian Green Party's presidential candidate, she has seen her political influence grow, even though she left the party a year later.</body>

      <title>Argentine president ordered to rest</title>
      <description>Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is ordered to take a month off work after doctors discover bleeding on her brain.</description>

      <body>Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has been ordered to take a month off work after bleeding was found on her brain.Ms Fernandez, 60, was undergoing medical checks for another condition when the bleeding - a subdural hematoma - was discovered.Vice-President Amado Boudou is flying back from France to take over her duties.Ms Fernandez has been campaigning ahead of congressional elections.The break from campaigning is considered awkward for the president as some opinion polls have suggested the government could lose control of Congress in the poll on 27 October.Her spokesman, Alfredo Scoccimarro, issued a statement saying her doctors had carried out a brain scan in August after a previously undisclosed trauma - thought to be caused by a fall.However, they found nothing untoward.On Saturday, she went to hospital for checks for an irregular heartbeat and also complained of headaches.A further scan revealed the subdural hematoma - bleeding between the brain and the skull.The condition is said to be "chronic" but not "acute" according to the presidential statement, and Ms Fernandez will not be staying in hospital.Her doctors are to monitor the bleeding using imaging technology.President Fernandez, a centre-left Peronist, was first elected in 2007 and then returned to power by a comfortable majority in 2011.There have been hints that she may seek a third term, though she has never confirmed this.This would also require a change to the constitution - only possible if her party keeps control of Congress.</body>

      <body>Iran's foreign minister is urging world powers to come up with new proposals for talks on its nuclear programme, which are set to resume next week.Mohammed Javad Zarif said the terms offered before Hassan Rouhani was elected president were now "history" and that a "new approach" was needed.The existing proposals seek curbs on uranium enrichment in Iran.Mr Rouhani has vowed to bring a plan to substantive nuclear negotiations due to take place on 15 October.Just over a week ago, he spoke to President Barack Obama by phone in an effort to ease tension over Iran's nuclear ambitions - the first conversation between Iranian and US leaders in more than 30 years.Iran wants talks to result in a lifting of UN sanctions imposed over concerns that it aims to build nuclear weapons clandestinely - an allegation Tehran denies.In another development, a senior Iranian official said the authorities are holding four people believed to be involved in sabotage against Iranian nuclear facilities."The previous plan given to Iran belongs to history and they must enter talks with a new point of view," said Mr Zarif, who is both foreign minister and chief nuclear negotiator."The players must put away this illusion that they can impose anything on the Iranian people," he told Iranian state TV late on Saturday.The election of Mr Rouhani in June and appointment of Mr Zarif have raised hopes that Iran's standoff with the West over its nuclear programme can be resolved.Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei endorsed Mr Rouhani's overtures to the US on Saturday."We support the diplomatic initiative of the government and attach importance to its activities in this trip," he said on his website.Ayatollah Khamenei said that "some of what happened on the New York trip was not appropriate", without being specific."We are pessimistic towards the Americans and do not put any trust in them," he said."The American government is untrustworthy, supercilious and unreasonable, and breaks its promises."Key Iranian nuclear sites</body>

      <body>A suicide bomber has attacked a primary school in northern Iraq, killing at least 12 children and their headteacher, police and medics say.Another 90 people were injured in the attack near Tal Afar, some 420km (260 miles) north-west of the Iraqi capital Baghdad, the town's mayor said.At least 12 people were killed as another suicide bomber hit pilgrims heading to a Shia shrine in Baghdad.Iraq has seen a sharp rise in sectarian violence in recent months.More than 50 people were killed on Saturday alone in Baghdad's Adhamiya district as pilgrims walked to a Shia shrine.Almost 1,000 people were killed in Iraq during the past month alone, the UN has said, amid fears of a return to the sectarian conflict that peaked in 2008.Nearly 6,000 have been killed so far this year.Violence rose after an army raid on a Sunni Arab anti-government protest camp in April.</body>

      <body>Egypt's military-backed authorities have released two Canadians held without charge for seven weeks, the Canadian government says.Dr Tarek Loubani and film-maker John Greyson were accused of taking part in deadly political clashes in Cairo.The men insisted Dr Loubani was just helping injured protesters, while Mr Greyson filmed the violence.The releases come hours before fresh demonstrations are expected in central Cairo.Supporters and opponents of ousted President Mohammed Morsi have said they will take to the streetsNo details were immediately available about the reasons for the release of the Canadians. They were detained on the streets of Cairo during the night of a huge crackdown in which hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood supporters were killed and arrested.Dr Loubani's brother Mohammed told the Toronto Star that the pair had not known they were about to be freed."They just came to their cell and said, 'Come with us,' " Mohammed Loubani said."They had no idea what was happening until they arrived at the police station. They were stunned."The pair spent three weeks on hunger strike to protest their innocence.They also said they were treated with brutality while in prison.Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper "welcomes this decision by the government of Egypt" to set the pair free, AFP news agency reported."We look forward to seeing these two Canadian citizens return home in the not-too-distant future," he told reporters in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur.Tahrir Square is once again likely to be the centre point of Egypt's crisis, says the BBC's Quentin Somerville in Cairo.Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to gather to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.There will be a grand display of military hardware in Tahrir Square and across the capital.Extra security including metal detectors and armed troops have been placed around the square in anticipation of protests by Morsi supporters.They view the military-backed government as illegitimate.The interior ministry has said it will deal firmly with any lawlessness.Four people were killed on Friday as Morsi supporters clashed with opponents and security forces.Hundreds of Islamist protesters have died in violence since the Egyptian military deposed Mr Morsi in July, 13 months after he was elected as president.He and other senior Brotherhood figures have been imprisoned and face trial.The authorities are moving to seize the movement's assets after its activities were banned as part of a crackdown.However, Brotherhood supporters have continued to take to the streets to protest - albeit in smaller numbers than before.</body>

      <title>Face blindness: Seeing but not seeing</title>
      <description>What is it like to live with face blindness?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24385650</url>
      <date>1381047931</date>
      <body>Imagine that suddenly you cannot recognise your mother, your partner, your child. You can see them but your brain cannot process the information - you don't know whether they are smiling, or understand their emotions.That is what happened to David Bromley, after he suffered a brain injury that left him with face blindness.David has prosopagnosia. People with this condition can see the eyes, the nose, and the mouth, what is known as the context - but they cannot see them as a whole. They do not recognise gestures or emotions."I can even recognise my wife if I walk into the house and know that she is there," says David."But if I'm in the street and she passes by and I don't know that she is going to be there, I wouldn't recognise her."David, who lives in Essex, had unknowingly been living with eye damage since birth - the arteries and veins were mixed up. This eventually caused a partial loss of sight and damage in the brain which caused the prosopagnosia.Perhaps the most difficult aspect of this condition is that people do not notice right away that something is wrong with them.He remembers when he realised there was a problem."I went to a reunion where I saw friends that I hadn't seen for 30 years. We were pretty close but we went our separate ways."On the way home, he told his brother-in-law: "'Fran and Mickey haven't changed a bit, they are exactly the same!'. And then I said 'hold on, were they wearing tank tops?'"What David was seeing was his memory of their friends back then. "My brain was telling me that there they were and what they looked like, but that wasn't the reality".After that, he discovered he was face blind.There are two main forms of prosopagnosia; developmental - where people fail to develop face processing abilities which is thought to affect around 2% of the population, and acquired, which develops after some form of brain injury and is much rarer.Dr Ashok Jansari, a cognitive neuropsychology expert from the University of East London said: "Acquired prosopagnosia is extremely rare because the type of brain damage is very specific,."It can be caused by damage to the back of the brain on the right-hand side in an area known generally as the right occipito-temporal region."David said: "I don't know what's worse - not being able to ever recognise people or at 56 years old - as it happened to me - suddenly not being able to recognise anybody".He added that the worst part is the social embarrassment."We were on holiday in Cuba and I'd been snorkelling in the sea. I was talking with this guy from Denmark, when this woman swam up and said 'buenos dias' and I went 'hello, pleased to meet you', thinking it was his wife, but it was actually my wife and I hadn't recognised her."David can see people perfectly well - but 10 or 15 minutes later he cannot recognise them.He now tells clients: "If I ignore you, I'm not being rude, it is just that I can't recognise you."Sandra, from London, who only wants to give her first name, is also afraid of social embarrassment.She had encephalitis - inflammation of the brain - 14 years ago, which left her with face blindness.Even though her prosopagnosia is mild - she can recognise people she knew before her illness - she would rather not let people know because she does not want anyone to think she has some sort of incapacity."Life with prosopagnosia is very shameful," she says.She is teacher and at work almost nobody knows that she is face blind."If I see someone every day, I can recognise them. But if one of the children says hi to me on the street, I would know it is a student from the school, but I wouldn't know who."I don't say anything to the children, I just work every day to learn their faces."But she says: "Perhaps the reason why I don't mention it is because I don't want them to think that I cannot do my job, because that's not true. I don't want to feel ashamed or that people think that there is something wrong with me."Dr Jansari understands the feelings and fears of David and Sandra.He knows of cases in which people have lost their jobs because of the condition - including a teacher who had difficulty recognising pupils, causing problems when parents came to pick up their children at the end of the day,Even though prosopagnosia is not recognised as a disability, Dr Jansari thinks it should be treated as such in some cases.This condition has no cure. "In the case of acquired prosopagnosia, once a part of the brain is damaged it is not going to 'grow' back, so it is impossible to fix the problem," he said."With developmental prosopagnosia, we don't know what causes it, but hypothetically in the future if they find that there is a genetic cause, that could be corrected - but that would be a very long way off."Even though people develop strategies to cope - because people change their appearance, they are not foolproof.Dr Jansari says: "Once David thought that a photograph he saw was of George Michael but it was of me, from a time when I used to have a goatee beard and a gold earring!"</body>

      <body>It's easy to campaign to save endangered species like pandas and woolly spider monkeys because they're fluffy and cute. But what about venomous snakes? These are crucial predators in Brazil's Atlantic rainforest ecosystem, and a local doctor has made it his life's work to save one of the most dangerous.Carnival was in full swing in the small Brazilian coastal town of Itacare when a giant snake measuring 6m long slithered down the streets, sending hundreds of revellers screaming into roadside bars. Until recently the snake would have been killed. The police were standing by with shotguns. But instead the local doctor was summoned.Dr Rodrigo Souza moved to the north-eastern state of Bahia 12 years ago and developed a fascination with the rainforest and its wildlife. Now whenever a strange creature ventures into a built-up area, the doctor is called. He was even asked to rescue a group of confused penguins that had been swept up from the Falkland Islands by the mighty South Atlantic current.Souza identifies the carnival incident as a turning point in his battle to save endangered species in this dwindling patch of Atlantic rainforest in which he has made his home.When he first moved to Bahia it was common to see people illegally selling birds, snakes and monkeys at the side of the road. That rarely happens now. The authorities have clamped down and the local people have become more aware of the importance of saving their unique ecosystem. On the day I drove to visit him, someone stopped the traffic in the middle of the road to allow a snake to cross.But Souza's real passion is the Atlantic bushmaster, one of the most poisonous snakes in the western hemisphere. Thick-bodied and up to 3m long, these majestic creatures have distinctive orange and black markings and heat-seeking sensors under the eyes that allow them to lock on to warm-blooded mammals. A human can die within an hour of being bitten unless they receive the right anti-venom injection.There are 35 bushmasters living in Souza's private snake sanctuary, which has a "No Entry" sign on the door bearing a large skull and crossbones.He's been compared by the Brazilian media to Grizzly Man, the American environmentalist who lived among the grizzly bears of Alaska until one of them killed him. Grizzly Man's life and death was the subject of a documentary by the German film-maker Werner Herzog. But Souza resents the comparisons: "I'm under no illusions about my snakes," he says. "They have no idea who I am and I know they would not hesitate to kill me."I admit to feeling absolutely terrified when he invites me into the sanctuary to watch him casually lifting up a 2m-long snake with an instrument resembling a giant metal tuning fork. Before handling them he zips into an insulated bodysuit that stops him from giving off too much heat. Meanwhile I'm standing a safe distance away - trembling with fear - in shorts and a T-shirt.The bushmaster has an almost mythological status amongst the indigenous people of the rainforest. Because of its attraction to heat they called it the "fire extinguisher" and have warned Souza never to sit near an open fire in bushmaster territory - because the snakes can leap a distance of several metres towards a heat source and at very high speed. He was once called to a road traffic accident where a bushmaster snake had attacked the headlamp of a passing motorbike.Rodrigo Souza is the first and probably only person ever to successfully breed the Atlantic bushmaster in captivity. He milks his snakes for venom which he then uses to make an antidote for snake-bite victims. The Bushmaster venom also contains unique medical properties of interest to cancer researchers.However this majestic serpent is now under threat of extinction as its habitat disappears.Along with lion tamarins, cougars and woolly spider monkeys, bushmaster snakes are one of many endangered species unique to Brazil's Atlantic Rainforest. Not to be confused with the mighty Amazon, the Atlantic rainforest once covered the entire coastal region from the north-east to the Argentine border in the south. But now only 6% of it remains, a few tiny islands of green, most in the state of Bahia - and even these are under threat.There are now plans by ENRC, a British-Kazakh mining company, to build a railway right through one of the few remaining areas of virgin Atlantic rainforest.ENRC's aim is to transport iron ore from a mine in the interior to the port of Iheus, despite the region being named by Unesco as a priority region for conservation.It would of course bring jobs. But for Souza, who has been battling for years to preserve this unique ecosystem, it's a slap in the face. For him the railway would be an ecological disaster for the rainforest and his beloved bushmasters.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>The man who dreamed of the atom bomb</title>
      <description>The man who realised the atomic bomb could be built</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24395740</url>
      <date>1380905125</date>
      <body>Leo Szilard was the man who first realised that nuclear power could be used to build a bomb of terrifying proportions. Lisa Jardine considers what his story has to say about the responsibilities of science.The figure of Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard loomed large in our house when I was a child. He was held up to me as an exemplary figure in science - a man who had made fundamental breakthroughs in nuclear physics, but whose acute sense of moral probity led him in the end to denounce the very advances he had helped make. Only later did I learn an alternative version of his story.Almost exactly 80 years ago, in early October 1933, Szilard was in London, in transit from Nazi Germany, when an idea came to him that would lead directly to the ultimate weapon of war - the atomic bomb.An article in the Times two weeks earlier had reported a lecture at the British Association by Lord Rutherford - the Nobel prize-winning British physicist and head of the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. Rutherford had described splitting the atom by bombarding it with protons, but had gone on to say that any suggestion that the energy released might be harnessed as a source of power was "talking moonshine".The report caught Szilard's attention. He pondered it obsessively. Surely Rutherford was wrong? Then, early on a dismal, grey morning, as he waited on foot at a traffic light to cross busy Southampton Row near his hotel, the answer came to him in a flash.If a neutron, fired at an atom, produces the release of (say) two neutrons, each of which hits another atom, which both in turn release two more neutrons, which each go on to collide with two further atoms, a nuclear chain reaction would take place, releasing unimaginable amounts of energy.Szilard tells this story twice, with slightly differing details. But the tale itself is consistent and delightfully vivid. The challenge of Rutherford's remark, the heavy cold that had prevented Szilard's attending the lecture, the days spent thinking about it and the flash of inspiration just as the traffic light changed.Szilard immediately recognised the importance of his idea. To ensure its security he patented it in the name of the British Admiralty. The patent included a clear description of "neutron induced chain reactions to create explosions".In August 1939, by which time Szilard had moved on to America, he wrote to President Franklin Roosevelt to inform him that "a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium" was undoubtedly possible, and could lead to the construction of "extremely powerful bombs of a new type". Germany, he warned, might even now be developing such a weapon. "A single bomb of this type," he wrote, "carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory."The letter was signed by Szilard and Albert Einstein. By the time it reached Roosevelt, Germany had invaded Poland. With war now a certainty, the urgency was not lost on the US president. A committee was set up to pursue the nuclear initiative, out of which emerged what came to be known as the Manhattan Project - the hugely ambitious and massively funded programme to develop a functioning atomic bomb in the shortest possible time.But less than six years later in 1945, Szilard campaigned with equal passion to persuade the American government not to use the atomic bomb against a civilian population. He understood better than anyone the enormity of the devastation such a weapon could cause. But his petition, although signed by a large number of nuclear physicists, never reached the president.So devastated was Szilard at his failure to avert the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (the story I was brought up on concluded) that he refused to do any further work in nuclear physics. Instead he moved research areas entirely, to molecular biology - a field concerned with the origins of life rather than its destruction. To my father this audacious step captured the essence of scientific moral responsibility. And I carried Szilard's story with me as I grew up.Today, however, I know that inspiring as it is, there are problems with this tale. As often happens with history, we have to treat with caution a narrative that fits so neatly the interests and preoccupations of the age in which it is written.At the time I was being told this story, Britain was in the depths of the Cold War. In the post-war years it turned out that Szilard (and indeed my own father) found it impossible to obtain work on any scientific project that involved nuclear physics. Though they were barely aware of the stigma themselves, the communist sympathies of their youth barred them from getting the necessary security clearance.So Szilard did not leave physics of his own accord. At the end of the war he was abruptly dismissed from the Manhattan Project by its military head, Gen Leslie Groves. Groves had always suspected him of having Russian sympathies, and now deemed him too high a security risk. Forced to change field, Szilard was indeed prescient in choosing molecular biology, which less than a decade later would uncover "the secret of life" in the form of the structure of DNA.My father's exemplary tale unravels further when we consider the way it presents the progress towards a functioning atomic bomb. It narrates a smooth development from Rutherford's lecture in London, through Szilard's (and his fellow-emigres') journey from Nazi Germany via London to the United States, and Szilard's single-minded preoccupation with the potential threat of nuclear weapons, to the Manhattan Project, and finally to its very American triumphant - or tragic - outcome.But actually Szilard the Hungarian had carried out the crucial early research with the Italian emigre Enrico Fermi, continuing it with him in the early years of the Manhattan Project, where the two of them succeeded in creating a controlled chain reaction - a prerequisite for a functioning bomb. Meanwhile, independently in Britain considerable progress was being made towards a nuclear weapon (a project code-named "Tube Alloys") with the direct encouragement of the prime minister Winston Churchill (who as Graham Farmelo tells us in a recent book, was surprisingly up-to-date himself in nuclear physics). In September 1940 the so-called Tizard mission delivered the top secret work of Tube Alloys to the Americans, to be developed with the greater manpower and financial resources available in the US. The British work made its own vital contribution to the project.Here is a much more fragmented, syncopated and international story, in which it is entirely unclear whether any one nation ultimately takes the credit or blame for the science and engineering behind the atomic bomb. Nor does it carry the clear didactic message of my original.There is one final twist to what started out as a simple story. Some of you will have noticed that I gave the date of Szilard's eureka moment at that traffic light on Southampton Row as October 1933. You may have had a date in September in your mind. The truth is, Szilard tells the story twice, as I mentioned. In one version he records reading the Times report and immediately having the idea of a chain reaction (on 12 September). In the other he recalls fretting over the problem for weeks in his hotel room and pacing the streets of London deep in thought, until the idea eventually came to him (in early October).So although the beginning of the story comes from the mouth of the man himself, we cannot be certain which version is correct. As a historian I have chosen the second as the more plausible, particularly in view of that heavy cold which Szilard tells us prevented his attending Rutherford's lecture on 11 September. But that remains surmise.Historical narratives are never without their agendas. My father's generation lived under the shadow of Hiroshima and Nagasaki - he had been sent to do reconnaissance there only a few months after the bombs were dropped and had seen the consequences all too close up. He told me a story which redeemed the scientist from the enormity of events brought about by fundamental research in physics. It was a story that held the scientist responsible for lethal applications of "pure" research, and proposed Szilard as an iconic figure, for recognising and taking that responsibility upon himself.My father's story of Leo Szilard may not have been the truth. But it taught me, as a child, a lasting, salutary lesson about science and human values.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Recovering from the Westgate attack</title>
      <description>Nairobi's firms 'resilient' in wake of Westgate attack</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24403698</url>
      <date>1381022446</date>
      <body>The Westgate shopping centre today stands defiantly in the middle of the rich leafy suburb of Westlands.The world's focus was fixed on it for days after gunmen struck at midday on a Saturday, shooting at people - young and old - killing more than 60.Driving down Peponi Road just beside the centre, all seems well from the outside except for some broken glass windows and bullet holes on the wall.But inside, the scenes of chaos, death and looting are all too evident.Shop owners are among the very few people who have been allowed into the shopping centre since the attack.Martin Omondi owns a camera shop on the ground floor."Almost 100% of our cameras - all gone - worth more than a million shillings (US$11,000; £6,863)," he says after collecting what remained in his shop.He cannot say who stole his merchandise, and is waiting for a government investigation.But Serah Wambui, the owner of a salon located on the first floor, blames it all on the security forces."Our small cabinet that we used to display ornaments was looted," she says."They also opened our lockers to see whether we had money. They stole our cash box but our products are still there."Kenya's defence ministry has asked people with evidence of looting to give them that information.Business owners like Omondi and Serah are now pondering their next move.'Mall culture'Other shopping centres in Nairobi have also felt the impact of the attack on Westgate.Hamed Ehsani manages the upmarket Village Market, which is next to the US embassy and the UN headquarters."The first couple of days we were down to 20% of the number of customers," he says."But in the last few days we're up to 60%, and we expect that to increase."Ally Khan Satchu, a business analyst and Nairobi resident, says that people have been going to smaller shops, and shopping centres have been quieter."The whole mall culture is what has excited middle-class shoppers because it has consolidated middle-class demand and allowed retailers to come in, in a big way and service this demand," he says."The question is, is this going to change shopping habits of middle class Kenyans? I don't think it's going to be that long-lasting."Other indicators also point to a resilience within Kenya's economy.The stock market dropped on the two days after the attack, but it has subsequently rallied more than 2% and is not far off its 2013 high."What supported the stock market was international investors," says Mr Satchu."These guys thought this was an opportunity to get supply, so they used that as a liquidity opportunity to buy up a lot of stock."But he says that Kenya's tourism sector, which accounts for 10% of the country's annual economy, is a soft target.Yet so far, says Mike Macharia, the chairman of the Association of Hotel Keepers and Caterers - there have not been significant cancellations in hotel bookings."We were pleasantly surprised to find the level of cancellations was very low - we had two conferences the Monday after the attack and of those two we had only 4% cancellations," he says.At the Karen Blixen museum in Nairobi, tourists who spoke to the BBC were continuing with their holiday plans.Frenchman Andre Mairie says he will not be changing his travel arrangements following the attack."We are used to this kind of things. We had the one at Saint Michel station, we had the one at rue de Rennes, and so what?" he states, referring to previous explosions in his home country, France."People were telling me: 'Why are you going to Kenya? It must be dangerous.'"I said: 'Look, I'm still taking my subway at Saint Michel, I'm still walking at rue de Rennes.'"Kay Headfield and her husband were already en route to Nairobi from New Zealand when the attack at Westgate took place."It's been arranged through Child Fund and the staff there have been very good in advising us and keeping us informed so we carried on," says Mrs Headfield.Mike Macharia attributes the positive reaction from tourists to the messages of support from countries like the United Kingdom - which accounts for some 16% of all visitors to Kenya."The messages that came out of the key source markets were very positive, particularly from the UK."The International Monetary Fund said in the aftermath of the attack that Kenya could withstand a "one-off" attack by Islamist militants.With the second half of the year normally the peak season for tourism, analysts are predicting that the economy is on track for growth of between 4.5% to as much as 6% this year.But analysts warn that if there were to be another Westgate-style attack, then those growth prospects could change.Africa Business Report is broadcast on BBC World News on Fridays at 18:40, Saturdays at 10:10 and 20:10, and Sundays at 00:10 (all times GMT).</body>

      <body>From a busy junction at Stratford High Street in East London, there is a great view of a symbol of one of the UK's most glittering recent successes - the Olympic Park - and the modern station created to go with it.And close by is an unusual school which is striving to bring together the old and the new traditions of England - much like the spectacular opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics.The London Academy of Excellence is a government-funded sixth-form serving the East End of the capital which is trying to bridge the gap between private and state schools.It opened its doors as London basked in the glow of the Olympics last year.In an unusual partnership, pupils there share lessons, sport and teachers with a local community school and several independent fee-paying schools including Eton, Brighton College and Highgate.It is easy to miss the London Academy of Excellence. Its modern building looks like any other shiny office block, perched on the edge of a busy road.It is as far from the green playing fields and quads of Eton and Brighton College as you could imagine - but pupils at these and the other schools involved are sharing more than lessons and aspirations.Through a buddy system, they are getting to know each other during visits and getting a window on each other's lives.Yousef, 17, was one of the first group of sixth-formers to join the academy."I was attracted by the links with Eton and the other schools," he said."This has built a bridge between us and independent schools. It's taught us a lot. It's illustrated that we have far more in common than difference."I get to visit Eton House boys with tailcoats. That was a bit of an experience, out of the ordinary, but behind that we saw a lot of similarities between us."Do the teenagers feel envious when they see the very different surroundings of pupils at the other schools?Curtis, 17, says no."One buddy took us on a tour and I studied a lesson of history with them. There was a similar-sized classroom, a similar way of teaching and talking. I felt at home there," he said."I did not feel envious. I am not that kind of individual. But who would not want to study at Eton?"Some of the sixth-formers say they feel lucky, because they do not have to pay for their education."We have this free. They are paying vast amounts to go to a college similar to ours", says Clinton.Ellie says the students at the other schools seemed really pleased to meet them."They were just as interested in us as we were in them. My buddy was asking so many questions about what we do."Most of their education takes place in the bright modern, business-like surroundings of their academy, in a converted office block.Their "uniform" is a "smart, professional dress code".The walls are white, the furniture bright. Big bold canvases with faces of famous intellectuals, scientists, artists and writers decorate the walls, dotted with their words of inspiration.In front of one of them is the academy's headmaster Robert Wilne, an energetic man, who bubbles over with enthusiasm for his pupils' success, their futures - and the aims of this experimental school."There are many schools doing interesting partnerships," he said."But this is a third way for independent schools, aside from giving bursaries or sponsoring academies."It is an experiment. I would love another city to look at it."It's a genuine, deep-seated partnership between eight schools that are woven in to the DNA of this academy."It's not window dressing or surface gloss."It is an experiment praised by the head of England's schools inspectorate Sir Michael Wilshaw, who in the summer accused many independent schools of living in "splendid isolation" from the state sector.He drew criticism from some in the private school sector this week too, for saying some schools' links with state schools were small, like crumbs from their tables.Some responded angrily, saying that their schools saved taxpayers money by educating children outside of the state sector.Both Labour and coalition governments have called for more links between private and state sector schools.All the academy's funding is from the government, says Mr Wilne and there is no direct funding from private schools.But there is support "in kind" and through links. Some of the governors are from the independent schools in the partnership."We draw on their various expertise and resources," says the headmaster."So if I want a scheme of work [curriculum plan] for maths, I go to to Highgate and ask for that. The head of economics at Brighton College is de facto head of economics here."They have been down and given feedback and mentoring support."Mr Wilne hopes the school will help social mobility."Education is the fuel of social mobility, education changes lives," he says."This 360 degree education we are offering here should fuel that mobility. Students will get the grades that will unlock doors to top universities and they are taking up extra-curricular activities and sports."They are interested in meeting others and they are not going to be daunted by meeting Etonians in the future."Sport, it seems, has also proved to be a good ice-breaker between students at the various schools."We enjoy visiting them as much as the sport," says Yousef.Curtis says he is enjoying trying out new sports."There is so much sport available. We do rowing. In my secondary school, we did rowing on a rowing machine, now we get to go on the water."With the first full exam season under its belt, the academy is now into its second year. The pioneer year looks to be a hard act to follow, having achieved 70% of their AS-levels at grades of A or B.Three students, including Ellie, spent part of the summer in the USA on a summer school after being encouraged to apply."I always wanted to go to university but did not aspire to the top ones," she said.The students say the school has widened their horizons, with encouragement to do so often coming in the shape of one of the many emails pumped out by their headmaster telling them of various opportunities."I get worried if I don't get an email from the head," one teenager says.They are getting help with their university applications and personal statements from one of the visiting teachers from the private sector.Student Harmanpreet says: "Our old head was always saying it's not about where you come from but where you are going."We know we are from a deprived area but LAE has shown us where we want to go."</body>

      <description>Do children need to read more books?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24397801</url>
      <date>1380904450</date>
      <body>Fewer children across the UK are reading in their own time and one in five is embarrassed to be caught with a book, a survey suggests.Just over a quarter of 35,000 children from 188 schools told the National Literacy Trust that they read outside school.A similar number said they did not think their parents cared if they read.The trust says a similar survey in 2005 found one in three children read in their own time.Do children need to read more books, or can they get the same benefits elsewhere?It is important that children and young people read books, as sustained reading is important. The government should reinstate the free-books-for-children scheme and promote the need for libraries in schools.It is a sad fact that there are more libraries in prisons than there are in schools. Reading for pleasure should be an integral part of the school curriculum from primary school upwards.The phonics reading test at the age of five or six years old is also unhelpful when teachers are trying to develop a love of reading not a dread. These measures would ensure that children and young people enjoy reading and will go a long way to getting rid of the idea that it is either an arduous or unnecessary task.It's been shown time and time again that sharing books, particularly at bed time, has beneficial effects on children.But there are numerous other forms in which reading and writing goes on these days, and I'd be keen to advocate their use as well.It's not just about books; it's about sharing the written form in whatever form it takes.Interactive storybooks on [tablets], for instance, have huge benefits - they could be equally as important as traditional book stories.The most important thing is sharing text with a skilled reader, that's the core.There's often a strain of "golden-age-ism"."When we were young the television was rationed so we enjoyed good books, and why shouldn't children today?"It's quite easy to blame new media for making book reading seem old-fashioned or "uncool". [But] we've got more possibilities now, and the more that we can encourage good quality interactive books in different media, the better.There's more reading and writing going on these days with the advent of things like the internet and mobile technology. Kids are growing up in a much richer literacy world, [but] it's not the world that some of us grew up in.Aimee, BBC News School Reporter at Bullers Wood School in KentAs a child I liked flicking through the pages of a book and looking at the pictures in detail.I use a Kindle now because it's easy and I can download a book from anywhere.I do however miss the fun of picking up a real book. I think we need to be encouraged to read more books because it's important to maintain traditions of language.Using the internet is a way of getting us to read, but the sites are often full of slang and it's very easy to get distracted from a reading task.Children are always going to regard computers as "cooler" than books, but it's very worrying that one in five youngsters now regards being seen with a book as "embarrassing".While children do gain vital literacy skills from reading other material like comics, newspapers, magazines and games, reading a book teaches concentration and builds anticipation and a child's imagination like no other format can.Books need to be back in fashion for schools, and parents must work together to make books trendy again. Whether it's discovering exciting new authors who fire a child's imagination like JK Rowling and the Harry Potter series, which every kid was clamouring to read, or accepting that children prefer to digest their books on an eReader rather than in paperback, books must be back on every family's reading list to give all kids an equal chance in life.Jacquie Fisher, in a September article for website Kidsdiscover.comI often hear this question from parents: "What should my child read?" Sometimes parents are asking for book recommendations, but many times they are expressing some frustration that their kids just don't enjoy sitting down to read a book.I understand this struggle. I have two very active kids who didn't like to sit still when they were younger. They considered reading to be a full-contact sport on some days. Sometimes kids just aren't in the mood for a book - so what's a parent to do?My answer: Don't focus on books. Instead, focus on reading! Building literacy skills with children happens in many ways.Like most solitary activities, reading might be seen as "uncool" in the playground.Perhaps now books are regarded as a bit old fashioned next to ebooks on mobiles and Kindles, but young people still love reading, and value reading.Technology is often accused of drawing young people away from books and shortening attention spans, but it's not all about social updates and video games.Technology has inspired young people to write blogs, teach themselves to code, to learn together and socialise with people from all over the world. There are a lot of activities competing for the attention of young people, which affects their reading habits, but young people are still passionate about reading.Skye and Marlies, BBC News School Reporters from Maplesden Noakes School in KentSkye: For me not to be able to read would be like turning the clock back 150 years to a time when women were thought of as servant girls. Not being able to read would mean that young people would not be able to read those fantastic stories that have been written by the great authors. What a waste!Marlies: Reading is even more important today than ever. I am glad that I can read, I think about all the young people around the world who can't, how can their intelligence develop if they have to rely on others for the truth?Reading is about enjoying language, using your imagination to interpret the written word and having the language skills to talk about the story afterwards.Before children can read, they need solid foundations in spoken language and understanding - and we know that one in 10 children will struggle with these skills.Whether children are reading a book, magazine or a Kindle, the fact they are reading and enjoying language is something to be encouraged.We should support children to speak about what they read, in whatever form, to ensure they develop good verbal language, which in turn improves their literacy and numeracy development.Pleasure reading is important for both educational attainment and, arguably, for social mobility.Studies highlight that children who read for pleasure are enhancing and extending their own cognitive development, accounting for factors such as socio-economic background and parental education.All types of reading material are equally valid and important. It is breadth and variety of reading material that is the most significant.It is clear that reading fiction is positively associated with higher reading scores, so it is an important contribution. But it's the young people who read a variety of materials that perform particularly well.A huge part of [encouraging] reading is supporting reading in the home. But another significant element is the focus on reading in the curriculum.My own research has found that whilst primary school teachers do read personally for pleasure, they were insufficiently knowledgeable about children's literature, insofar as being able to recommend books to children.Our teachers don't know enough children's literature. We need teachers who read, and readers who teach.If our focus is the skill to read only, and not the will, we lose the capacity to extend that attainment through focusing on the pleasure.</body>

      <title>Fresh clashes in Egypt 'kill 28'</title>
      <description>At least 28 people are killed and up to 100 hurt in Egypt in clashes between police and supporters of ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.</description>

      <body>At least 28 people have been killed and dozens hurt in Egypt in clashes between police and supporters of the deposed Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.More than 200 members of his Muslim Brotherhood were arrested in Cairo, where 26 of the deaths were reported.Supporters of Mr Morsi marched in several cities, as the military-backed government marked the 40th anniversary of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.Morsi supporters say he was deposed in a military coup in July.Hundreds of people had gathered in Cairo's Tahrir Square to celebrate the anniversary.Jets and Apache helicopters flew overhead in formation, as part of a grand display of military hardware by the government.The crowd cheered the flypasts, a number of people carrying portraits of defence chief Gen Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Some want him to stand as Egypt's next president.But the BBC's Quentin Sommerville in Cairo says supporters of Mr Morsi also took to the streets in their thousands, trying to make their way to the square and calling Gen Sisi a murderer.Security forces used tear gas and fired into the air to stop them.In the upscale Dokki district, a number of protesters were hit by live rounds, some by birdshot. In return they threw rocks at police and soldiers, our correspondent says.The street battles raged for hours, with small fires burning and black smoke rising in several parts of the capital.But the military succeeded in keeping the rival supporters apart, our correspondent says.The interior ministry earlier warned it would confront any "attempts that may disturb the 6 October celebrations", the Mena state news agency reported.In a televised address, Prime Minister Hazem Beblawi described it as a "critical time" for the country and urged Egyptians to "stand together, be optimistic about the future".The health ministry said that in addition to the Cairo deaths, one person was killed in Delga, about 300km (190 miles) south of Cairo, and another in Bani Suef, 80km south of the capital.Hundreds of Islamist protesters have died in violence since the Egyptian military deposed Mr Morsi in July, 13 months after he was elected as president.He and other senior Brotherhood figures have been imprisoned and face trial.The authorities are moving to seize the movement's assets after its activities were banned as part of a crackdown.However, Brotherhood supporters have continued to take to the streets to protest - albeit in smaller numbers than before.</body>

      <title>Syria chemical arms removal begins</title>
      <description>The destruction of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal is under way, monitors from the OPCW international watchdog say.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24419468</url>
      <date>1381080066</date>
      <body>The destruction of Syria's chemical weapons has begun, international monitors have said.The operation is being overseen by a team from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).The mission was established under a United Nations resolution, which was passed after agreement between Russia and the US.The resolution followed international outrage at a chemical weapons attack near Damascus in August.In an interim report, UN chemical weapons inspectors confirmed that the nerve agent sarin had been used in the attack in Ghouta on the outskirts of the city on August 21.It was estimated to have killed hundreds of people and was blamed by the United States and other Western powers on the regime of Bashar al-Assad. But he accuses Syrian rebels of being behind it.It was not clear at which of the chemical weapons sites declared by the government, thought to number about 20, that Sunday's operation took place.An official on the joint OPCW-UN delegation later said: "The first day of destruction and disabling is over and missile warheads, aerial bombs, along with mobile and static mixing and filling units, were dealt with. Work continues tomorrow and in the next few days."The destruction of the stockpile, being carried out by the Syrians, is not expected to be straightforward, as some sites are in combat zones.It is the first time the OPCW - based in The Hague - has been asked to oversee the destruction of a chemical weapons armoury during a conflict.The Syrian government gave details of its chemical weapons arsenal last month to the OPCW under the Russia-US agreement which also provided for Damascus to join the Chemical Weapons Convention.That arsenal is thought to include more than 1,000 tonnes of sarin and the blister agent sulphur mustard among other banned chemicals.Under the terms of the agreement between the US and Russia Syria's chemical weapons capability should be removed by the middle of 2014.The speed with which the team has been able to reach the sites and start the process of destruction underlines the urgency of the mission, says the BBC's Anna Holligan in the Hague.It was hoped that the new climate of co-operation would help bring about a wider conference in Geneva on ending the Syrian conflict.UN-Arab League peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi was quoted on French media on Sunday as saying he was encouraging all parties to come to Geneva in the second half of November but that peace talks were not a certainty.Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has meanwhile suggested Germany could mediate to try to end the 30-month-long civil war.Speaking to Germany's Der Spiegel magazine in an interview to be published on Monday, Mr Assad said he "would be delighted if envoys came from Germany".But he stressed that Damascus would not negotiate with rebels unless they laid down their weapons.Mr Assad again repeated his denial that his troops had used chemical weapons, blaming the rebels instead.More than 100,000 people have died since the uprising began in 2011 and millions more have fled Syria.</body>

      <title>Deadly monster truck crash in Mexico</title>
      <description>At least eight people are killed and dozens injured at a show in Mexico as a modified pick-up known as a monster truck crashes into spectators.</description>

      <body>At least eight people have been killed and dozens injured at a show in Mexico after a modified pick-up known as a monster truck crashed into spectators.At least one child was said to be among the dead.The monster truck - with tyres said to be 1.5 metres (nearly 5ft) high - ploughed into a stand.The vehicle was taking part in a demonstration at an annual air show attended by thousands in the northern city of Chihuahua on Saturday evening.The monster truck was performing a demolition stunt which involved crushing two cars beneath its huge tyres.Eyewitness video showed the truck completing one pass, driving over the cars, then turning for a second attempt.It accelerated much more quickly this time and landed heavily over the second car before veering off to the right and into the stand.A spokesman for the Chihuahua state prosecutors' office, Carlos Gonzalez, put the number of injured at about 80.He said prosecutors were looking at the possibility that mechanical failure meant the driver was unable to disengage the accelerator.But some witnesses said the driver may have lost control after hitting his head on the interior of the truck.Daniel Dominguez told Associated Press he was watching the show with a group of relatives."The driver hit his head and his helmet flew off," Mr Dominguez said. "The truck came directly at where we were.''Another spectator, Jesus Manuel Ibarra, told the agency: "I fell over, and when I turned around I saw the tyre very close. It hit me and threw me to the other side."A call has gone out from local health services for blood donations.The BBC's Will Grant in Mexico says some people are now calling for an investigation into safety measures at events like this and are asking how the audience could be placed so close to trucks performing stunts with only limited barriers in place.</body>

      <title>Libya calls for US raid explanation</title>
      <description>Libya's PM asks Washington to explain the capture of a Libyan terror suspect by US special forces, one of two such raids in Africa on Saturday.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24420767</url>
      <date>1381078013</date>
      <body>Libya's prime minister has called on Washington to explain a special forces raid on its territory, one of two by US commandos in Africa on Saturday.Ali Zeidan's office said he had asked for clarification and stressed Libya was "keen on prosecuting any Libyan citizen inside Libya".The raid captured al-Qaeda leader, Anas al-Liby, whom the US says is "currently lawfully detained outside of Libya".The other raid was in southern Somalia but failed to capture its target.The commando raid there was believed to have focused on a leader of the al-Shebab militant group, which says it carried out last month's attack on the Westgate shopping centre in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, leaving at least 67 people dead.When asked on Sunday whether Somalia had been aware of the raid, Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon Saaid said: "Our co-operation with international partners on fighting against terrorism is not a secret."A press release posted on an official Libyan government website read: "The Libyan government is following the news about the Libyan citizen wanted by the US government."Since we've heard, we have been in touch with the US government and have asked for clarification on this matter."The Libyan government is keen on prosecuting any Libyan citizen inside Libya, no matter what the charges are... the accused are innocent until proven guilty."The statement raises questions about how much, if anything, Libya knew in advance of the raid.A US official had earlier been quoted by CNN as saying that the raid was conducted with the knowledge of the Libyan government.Liby, 49, is believed to have been one of the masterminds behind the 1998 US embassy attacks, which killed more than 220 people in Kenya and Tanzania.He has been indicted in a New York court in connection with the attacks.Liby - whose real name is Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai - has been on the FBI's most wanted list for more than a decade with a $5m (£3.1m) bounty on his head.A Pentagon statement on Sunday said he was "currently lawfully detained under the law of war in a secure location outside of Libya".It said: "The successful capture operation was made possible by superb work and coordination across our national security agencies and the intelligence community, and was approved by President Obama."No American personnel were injured, it said.Anas al-Liby was seized in Tripoli early on Saturday as he was parking outside his house.Three vehicles encircled him, his car window was smashed and his gun was seized before he was taken away, his brother, Nabih, told the Associated Press news agency.On Sunday he told reporters that the US operation was an "act of piracy".Liby's son, Abdullah, said that those he could see taking his father looked Libyan and spoke a Libyan dialect. He said that some were masked.US Secretary of State John Kerry said the operations in Libya and Somalia showed that the US would never stop "in its effort to hold those accountable who conduct acts of terror".Those who attacked American interests "can run but they can't hide", he said.The US defence department also confirmed that special forces had carried out a seaborne operation in Somalia's coastal town of Barawe on Saturday.Pentagon spokesman George Little said the forces had been "involved in a counter-terrorism operation against a known al-Shabab terrorist". He gave no further details.Initial reports in the US media quoted unnamed US officials as saying that the suspect had been captured or killed by US Navy Seals in the pre-dawn raid on a villa.However, the officials later said that the Seals failed to find the intended target, who was not identified.Prime Minister Saiid said on Sunday: "We have collaboration with the world and with neighbouring countries in the battle against al Shabab... our interest is to get a peaceful Somalia, free from terrorism."The raid was carried out by members of Seal Team Six - the same unit that killed al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, a US military official told AP.The official added that in Barawe the commandos had decided to abort the mission after encountering fierce resistance from al-Shabab fighters."The Barawe raid was planned a week and a half ago," a US security official told the New York Times."It was prompted by the Westgate attack," added the official, who was speaking on the condition of anonymity.Al-Shabab earlier told the BBC that "white soldiers" had arrived by boat in Barawe and rebels had repulsed them, losing a fighter.</body>

      <title>Italy divers recover migrant bodies</title>
      <description>Divers in Italy recover more bodies of more than 200 African migrants missing after their boat sank off the island of Lampedusa on Thursday.</description>

      <body>Divers in Italy have been recovering more bodies from the boat of African migrants that sank on Thursday.Seventy bodies were brought out on Sunday, bringing the official death toll to 181. About 200 people are still missing and 155 have survived the accident off Lampedusa island.The authorities have denied allegations that they were slow to mount a rescue.France has called for an urgent EU meeting after Italy requested help to deal with the influx of migrants.Tens of thousands of migrants attempt the perilous crossing from North Africa to Sicily and other Italian islands each year, and accidents are common - but this week's shipwreck was among the deadliest on record.Divers resumed their search on Sunday morning, after 48-hour delay due to bad weather.Many bodies are believed to be trapped in the wreck located in deep water, about 1km (half a mile) off Lampedusa .The survivors are to be placed under investigation for "clandestine immigration", as provided for by a controversial immigration law pushed through by right-wing parties in 2002.The offence carries a 5,000-euro (£4,230; $6,780) fine.Italy has said it will amend immigration laws. Members of parliament have complained that some of its provisions discourage people from helping migrants in distress.The fisherman who arrived first at the site of the accident, Vito Fiorino, has accused the coast guard of wasting time by filming footage of rescue efforts."They refused to take on board some people we'd already saved because they said protocol forbade it," he was quoted as saying by Ansa news agency.A report in local newspaper La Sicilia said two boats belonging to Italy's Financial Guard, which carries out a range of police and rescue duties, had remained in port.The coast guard denied that there was any delay in its rescue effort."After we received the alarm by radio at 07:00 we immediately intervened with out boats, arriving on at the site of the shipwreck at 07:20," it said in a statement.Judicial authorities said they had no evidence of delays. And two of the migrants have told the BBC that boats did rescue them, but it took a while."After swimming for a long time, probably around three hours, boats started to arrive to rescue us. Rescue boats, small boats, all the boats in the area came to save us, they dragged us out of the water," Futsum Mesfa, 20, from Eritrea said."I lost my cousin, who was on the boat with me, I also lost many friends," he added.The head of a fishermen's association, Toto Martello, denied in turn reports that three fishermen sailed straight past the scene of the accident.The 20m (66ft) boat carrying more than 500 people - mostly from Eritrea and Somalia - was approaching Lampedusa early on Thursday when it began taking on water after its motor stopped working.Mr Mesfa told the BBC that the skipper set fire to a piece of material to try to attract the attention of passing ships, only to have the fire spread to the rest of the vessel.The boat - which set sail from the Libyan port of Misrata - is thought to have capsized when everyone moved to one side.</body>

      <body>A South African union representing car workers has agreed a new pay deal, ending a month-long strike that has crippled the industry.The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa accepted a 10% pay rise this year and 8% in the next two years.The strike in the car components industry caused severe disruption, especially to exports.Last week BMW said it had stopped "all future plans" to expand in South Africa because of the industrial action.Under the deal, pay at small-to-medium-sized car parts firms will only rise wages by 9% in the first year, followed by 8% in the subsequent two years."The strike was very hard for us," Irvin Jim, the general secretary of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), told reporters.The car components' strike followed industrial action by workers at car manufacturers themselves, which hit production at BMW, Ford, Nissan and General Motors and cost an estimated $2bn (£1.24bn) in lost output.This year, the mining, construction and aviation sectors have also been hit by strikes, raising concerns about the impact on South Africa's economic growth.Last week, Bodo Donauer, managing director at BMW South Africa, said the company had been unable to produce 11,000 cars while its workers were striking."But more important than these 11,000 cars is the sustainable damage which this [the strike] has made," Mr Donauer said.On Sunday, Mr Jim said BMW's decision to stop future investment was "blackmail" which would be "rejected with the contempt it deserves".</body>

      <body>Russian President Vladimir Putin has taken part in a ceremony in Moscow to launch the torch relay for next year's Winter Olympics in Sochi.The torch will go on a 123-day journey covering some 65,000km (40,000 miles) before the Games start in the Black Sea resort on 7 February.The torch's journey will include a trip into space.Mr Putin said the Games would show Russia's "respect for equality and diversity".The run-up to the Games has so far been marred by controversy over a new Russian law that restricts the spread of information about homosexuality, as well as allegations by rights groups that authorities have rounded up migrant workers who helped build the Games venues in Sochi.The Olympic flame had been flown in from Greece after being lit last Sunday at the birthplace of the ancient Games.Hoisting the flame in Moscow, Mr Putin declared in a ceremony shown live on television that "our shared dream is becoming reality".He said the Games would show "respect for equality and diversity - ideals that are so intertwined with the ideals of the Olympic movement itself".Mr Putin said the relay would show off Russia "the way that it is and the way we love it"."Today is a joyous and momentous day," he said.

      <title>US shutdown starts hitting business</title>
      <description>US Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker warns that business is starting to suffer from the federal shutdown.</description>

      <date>1381060028</date>
      <body>US Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker has warned that business is starting to suffer from the federal shutdown.Her comments at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) came as leaders gathering for the summit voiced worries about the US situation.Philippine President Benigno Aquino said that what happens in the US "affects us all".On Friday, the US defence contractor Lockheed Martin said it would put 3,000 workers on unpaid leave.The US government closed non-essential operations on Tuesday after Congress failed to agree a new budget.And President Barack Obama cancelled a scheduled trip to Asia because of the shutdown."The shutdown is not good for business. It's not good for the economy," Ms Pritzker said. One consequence of the shutdown had been her department's inability to collate vital economic data."We're a huge source of data for American business and that is a problem... It's affecting businesses and it's affecting their ability to get data," she said.From Monday, Lockheed will put 3,000 staff on leave, but the defence giant said this number would rise if the shutdown continued."I'm disappointed that we must take these actions and we continue to encourage our lawmakers to come together to pass a funding bill that will end this shutdown,'' Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed's chief executive and president, said in a statement."We hope that Congress and the Administration are able to resolve this situation as soon as possible," she added.The announcement followed United Technologies' decision to temporarily lay off 2,000 employees.The company, which makes Blackhawk helicopters, said some manufacturing had been halted because there were no government inspectors working to sign off products.Global impactThe widening impact of the shutdown sparked concern at Apec meeting in Bali on Sunday.Mrs Aquino said: "The US economy is the number one economy in the world, what happens there affects all of us."The world economy obviously is not in a position to withstand too much shock at this time when we are just recovering as a global economy."Meanwhile, Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said the US had to confront its fiscal problems "in a better way than they are doing it now with shutting down the government".Mr Obama is refusing to negotiate with the Republicans over the budget issues until they pass a temporary bill to reopen the government.He also wants agreement to raise the $16.7 trillion US borrowing limit, to avoid the country defaulting on its debts.</body>

      <body>Iran's foreign minister is urging world powers to come up with new proposals for talks on its nuclear programme, which are set to resume next week.Mohammed Javad Zarif said the terms offered before Hassan Rouhani was elected president were now "history" and that a "new approach" was needed.The existing proposals seek curbs on uranium enrichment in Iran.Mr Rouhani has vowed to bring a plan to substantive nuclear negotiations due to take place on 15 October.Just over a week ago, he spoke to President Barack Obama by phone in an effort to ease tension over Iran's nuclear ambitions - the first conversation between Iranian and US leaders in more than 30 years.Iran wants talks to result in a lifting of UN sanctions imposed over concerns that it aims to build nuclear weapons clandestinely - an allegation Tehran denies.In another development, a senior Iranian official said the authorities are holding four people believed to be involved in sabotage against Iranian nuclear facilities."The previous plan given to Iran belongs to history and they must enter talks with a new point of view," said Mr Zarif, who is both foreign minister and chief nuclear negotiator."The players must put away this illusion that they can impose anything on the Iranian people," he told Iranian state TV late on Saturday.The election of Mr Rouhani in June and appointment of Mr Zarif have raised hopes that Iran's standoff with the West over its nuclear programme can be resolved.Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei endorsed Mr Rouhani's overtures to the US on Saturday."We support the diplomatic initiative of the government and attach importance to its activities in this trip," he said on his website.Ayatollah Khamenei said that "some of what happened on the New York trip was not appropriate", without being specific."We are pessimistic towards the Americans and do not put any trust in them," he said."The American government is untrustworthy, supercilious and unreasonable, and breaks its promises."Key Iranian nuclear sites</body>

      <body>Egypt's military-backed authorities have released two Canadians held without charge for seven weeks, the Canadian government says.Dr Tarek Loubani and film-maker John Greyson were accused of taking part in deadly political clashes in Cairo.The men insisted Dr Loubani was just helping injured protesters, while Mr Greyson filmed the violence.The releases come hours before fresh demonstrations are expected in central Cairo.Supporters and opponents of ousted President Mohammed Morsi have said they will take to the streetsNo details were immediately available about the reasons for the release of the Canadians. They were detained on the streets of Cairo during the night of a huge crackdown in which hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood supporters were killed and arrested.Dr Loubani's brother Mohammed told the Toronto Star that the pair had not known they were about to be freed."They just came to their cell and said, 'Come with us,' " Mohammed Loubani said."They had no idea what was happening until they arrived at the police station. They were stunned."The pair spent three weeks on hunger strike to protest their innocence.They also said they were treated with brutality while in prison.Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper "welcomes this decision by the government of Egypt" to set the pair free, AFP news agency reported."We look forward to seeing these two Canadian citizens return home in the not-too-distant future," he told reporters in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur.Tahrir Square is once again likely to be the centre point of Egypt's crisis, says the BBC's Quentin Somerville in Cairo.Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to gather to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.There will be a grand display of military hardware in Tahrir Square and across the capital.Extra security including metal detectors and armed troops have been placed around the square in anticipation of protests by Morsi supporters.They view the military-backed government as illegitimate.The interior ministry has said it will deal firmly with any lawlessness.Four people were killed on Friday as Morsi supporters clashed with opponents and security forces.Hundreds of Islamist protesters have died in violence since the Egyptian military deposed Mr Morsi in July, 13 months after he was elected as president.He and other senior Brotherhood figures have been imprisoned and face trial.The authorities are moving to seize the movement's assets after its activities were banned as part of a crackdown.However, Brotherhood supporters have continued to take to the streets to protest - albeit in smaller numbers than before.</body>

      <body>Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has been ordered to take a month off work after bleeding was found on her brain.Ms Fernandez, 60, was undergoing medical checks for another condition when the bleeding - a subdural hematoma - was discovered.Vice-President Amado Boudou is flying back from France to take over her duties.Ms Fernandez has been campaigning ahead of congressional elections.The break from campaigning is considered awkward for the president as some opinion polls have suggested the government could lose control of Congress in the poll on 27 October.Her spokesman, Alfredo Scoccimarro, issued a statement saying her doctors had carried out a brain scan in August after a previously undisclosed trauma - thought to be caused by a fall.However, they found nothing untoward.On Saturday, she went to hospital for checks for an irregular heartbeat and also complained of headaches.A further scan revealed the subdural hematoma - bleeding between the brain and the skull.The condition is said to be "chronic" but not "acute" according to the presidential statement, and Ms Fernandez will not be staying in hospital.Her doctors are to monitor the bleeding using imaging technology.President Fernandez, a centre-left Peronist, was first elected in 2007 and then returned to power by a comfortable majority in 2011.There have been hints that she may seek a third term, though she has never confirmed this.This would also require a change to the constitution - only possible if her party keeps control of Congress.</body>

      <title>Couple saved from borsch-eating bear</title>

      <body>Police in the Siberian region of Irkutsk have rescued a couple after a bear broke into their holiday home, attracted by the smell of fresh soup.A patrol turned up at their dacha near Ust-Ilimsk in the early hours after a neighbour raised the alarm.They found the couple hiding in their bath-house as the bear digested the hot beetroot soup in their garden.A warning shot was sufficient to scare off the intruder. No-one was hurt, although there was damage to the house.According to a police statement, the couple said they had left the soup to cool when they went to bed.Because of decorating work inside the dacha, they were sleeping out in the bath-house, when they woke to "loud banging".Peering out, they saw a bear breaking the windows of their glassed-in porch. It then hauled itself inside and devoured "all of the borsch, which was still hot".After receiving the alert at 01:00 (16:00 GMT Friday), police sent a patrol to the scene. Officers found the bear padding around the snowy garden and fired a shot into the air."Startled, the unwelcome guest bounded off into the forest," the police statement said.Bears, it noted, had been known to come looking for food around dachas in the area before but happily no attacks had been reported.While splashes of the bright red soup were found at the scene, it could not be immediately confirmed whether the bear had indeed not used a spoon.</body>

      <title>Brazil opposition launches alliance</title>
      <description>Former Environment Minister Marina Silva joins the Brazilian Socialist Party after failing to officially register her new party.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-24416480</url>
      <date>1381015539</date>
      <body>In a major political realignment in Brazil, the former senator and Environment Minister Marina Silva has joined the Brazilian Socialist Party.The popular environmentalist joined the Socialists after failing to officially register her new party.The Socialist Party is headed by the state governor of Pernambuco and presidential hopeful Eduardo Campos, who also boasts high approval ratings.Brazilians will choose a successor to President Dilma Rousseff in a year.While Mr Campos is expected to be the Socialist Party's presidential candidate, Ms Silva's role in the ticket is not yet clear.Ms Silva's announcement came after more than a day of intense negotiations.Her Sustainability Network was 50,000 signatures short of the 492,000 required by Brazilian law to be officially registered.Late on Thursday, Brazil's Supreme Electoral Court rejected an appeal to consider about 100,000 signatures that had been considered invalid.As the country's legislation requires potential candidates to be affiliated to a party one year before running for an election, Ms Silva had to join a party until Saturday in order to keep her presidential hopes alive.At an event in the capital, Brasilia, Ms Silva and her closest allies of the Sustainability Network joined the Socialist Party.The former Amazon activist joked that hers was the "first clandestine party founded in democracy"."This is a historic re-alignment, burying once and for all the old republic," Ms Silva said.The president of Socialist Party, which counts former Brazil striker and current federal deputy Romario among its ranks, also said the alliance was "historic".Mr Campos, whose government of the north-eastern state of Pernambuco has one of the country's highest approval ratings, also said the move broke a "false polarisation" in Brazilian politics."Those who understood what happened on the streets in June [during Brazil's massive protests], won't find it hard to understand what is happening here," he told a crowd in Brasilia.Ms Silva came third with nearly 20m votes in her 2010 presidential bid. Recent opinion polls show her trailing only President Rousseff, while Mr Campos has about 4% support.Political analysts are divided as to what impact the alliance could have, with some arguing it will create a more united opposition front, threatening Ms Rousseff's re-election plans, while others say it could actually disappoint potential Marina Silva voters.Ms Silva served as an environment minister for five years, before stepping down in 2008, citing disagreements with the government.Since her surprising success in 2010 as the Brazilian Green Party's presidential candidate, she has seen her political influence grow, even though she left the party a year later.</body>

      <title>Venezuela to tackle travel scammers</title>
      <description>Venezuela's government plans to use fingerprint machines to check passengers at its borders and prevent a popular travel scam known as "the scrape".</description>

      <date>1381021727</date>
      <body>Venezuela's government is planning to use fingerprint checks at its borders to prevent a popular travel scam.Venezuelans travelling abroad are entitled to a foreign currency allowance at a cheaper rate.But amidst the economic crisis, some are only buying travel tickets to sell dollars on the black market and making a profit of nearly 700%.Credit cards will be activated abroad only after checking that the person has left the country, authorities say.Venezuela has been going through an economic crisis, with rising inflation and shortages of basic products, such as milk and toilet paper.Some Venezuelans are reportedly passing their credit cards to friends or family to use them abroad and then send the money back.Officials say there are even gangs operating the scam, known as "el raspao" or "the scrape", which is hurting the economy."These dollars acquired through illicit operations, scraping credit cards, come back to Venezuela and are sold at a high price, which causes an overvaluation of the dollar," Juan Carlos Dugarte, director-general of Venezuela's Administrative Identification, Migration and Immigration, told Globovision TV channel.The travellers allowance of up to $3,000 (£1,870) can be sold at nearly seven times the official price in the black market.Currently, Venezuelans have to present a ticket to a foreign country to get the approval for their foreign currency allowance.But many never use the tickets to travel, according to reports in the local media.Flights are getting fully booked with months in advance, which has reportedly led to an increase in fare prices.But the number of "no-shows" is also said to be on the rise.The government says it is already testing the new fingerprinting scheme.Police controls at airports, ports and border checkpoints would then confirm the exit of the passenger, authorising credit card use in foreign currency.Critics say the scheme will make life unfairly harder for honest travellers.The Venezuelan opposition blames President Nicolas Maduro's policies for the economic crisis the country is facing.The government says there is an orchestrated attempt, led by the opposition, to sabotage the economy.</body>

      <body>Gambian officials have confirmed that the country will not be competing in the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.Last week, the west African nation branded the 54-member grouping, which includes the UK and most of its former colonies, a "neo-colonial institution".At the time it was unclear whether it would still be competing in the Games.However, Games organisers have confirmed The Gambia's withdrawal and said alternative plans would be made for the baton relay.A spokesman for Glasgow 2014 said: "All Commonwealth nations and territories are entitled to compete in the Commonwealth Games."Glasgow 2014 has received confirmation from the Commonwealth Games Federation of the formal withdrawal of The Gambia from the Commonwealth."It is our understanding, therefore, that The Gambia does not intend to enter a team and compete in next year's Games."The spokesman said the Queen's Baton Relay, which visits all nations and territories of the Commonwealth, would no longer go to The Gambia."This planning is now under development in collaboration with the Commonwealth Games Federation and we will provide further information in the near future," he said.</body>

      <title>Kenya mall attack suspects named</title>
      <description>Kenya's military names four men shown in new CCTV footage who it says were killed as they took part in the Nairobi mall attack last month.</description>

      <date>1380994000</date>
      <body>Four men believed to have been involved in the deadly shopping centre attack in Nairobi last month have been named.The Kenyan military said Abu Baara al-Sudani, Omar Nabhan, Khattab al-Kene and Umayr - shown in new CCTV footage - were killed during the standoff.Kenya said previously 10-15 militants had been involved, but the police chief says the figure may now be four to six.The al-Shabab group said it carried out the attack on the Westgate mall on 21 September, leaving at least 67 dead.The al-Qaeda-linked group said the attack was in retaliation for Kenya's military involvement in Somalia.The naming of the men came as CCTV footage was aired showing four attackers calmly walking through a room in the mall holding machine guns.Kenya Defence Forces spokesman Maj Emmanuel Chirchir told Reuters news agency: "I confirm these were the terrorists; they all died in the raid."Reuters quoted Maj Chirchir as saying that al-Sudani was an "experienced fighter" from Sudan and was believed to be the leader of the group.Maj Chirchir said Nabhan was a Kenyan of Arab origin and al-Kene a Somali linked to al-Shabab. Further details about Umayr had not yet been verified, he said.A Kenyan security analyst told the BBC that at least two of the names would be familiar to the Kenyan intelligence services.Kenyan police chief David Kimaiyo told Kenya's KTN television station it was now believed that four to six gunmen had carried out the attack, not 10 to 15."None of them managed to escape from the building after the attack," he said.Mr Kimaiyo also said that wanted British woman Samantha Lewthwaite had not been involved."We have also established that she was not part of the attackers in the building. There was no woman," he said.Ms Lewthwaite, 29, is the widow of one of the four suicide bombers who attacked London on 7 July 2005.Kenya had earlier said five attackers were killed in the security operation and that nine people were in custody.The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse in Nairobi says the latest CCTV footage is from a limited part of the complex and, with some eyewitnesses reporting a two-pronged attack, it is too early to say definitively how many gunmen were in the building.In addition to the 67 people killed in the attack, a further 39 are still missing, according to the Kenyan Red Cross.Al-Shabab is banned as a terrorist group by both the US and the UK and is believed to have between 7,000 and 9,000 fighters.Its members are fighting to create an Islamic state in Somalia.About 4,000 Kenyan troops were sent to Somalia in October 2011 to help pro-government forces end two decades of violence, with clan-based warlords and Islamist militants all battling for control of the country.On Saturday, Islamist fighters in southern Somalia said Western forces had launched a night-time raid on one of their bases.No-one has admitted the attack. US and French special forces have carried out raids in Somalia in recent years.It is not clear whether the raid was linked to Westgate.</body>

      <body>Prince Harry has honoured special forces soldiers killed in the line of duty during an unannounced visit to the headquarters of the Australian SAS.He joined families of fallen Special Air Service Regiment members to lay wreaths at Campbell Barracks in Perth.Prince Harry was accompanied by Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott when he flew into the city for the last engagement of his 36-hour state visit.He is now heading to a Dubai fundraiser for his aids charity, Sentebale.Prince Harry, a captain in the British Army who has served twice in Afghanistan, met and had lunch with current and former members of the Australian SAS unit and toured their base.Wreaths were laid in the Garden of Reflection at the barracks, and he also met members of groups which provide support to the unit.The commanding officer, whose identity was only given as "Lieutenant Colonel G", said the unit was "humbled and grateful" that the prince had "made the time to join us"."Prince Harry knows what it means to serve his nation on operations and most importantly what it means to the families of those serving," he said."Today's visit by His Royal Highness and the prime minister represents a unique opportunity to recognise the broader SAS regimental family that provides the back-up and support at home."Families play a critical role for those serving in the SASR, and indeed the whole of the Australian Defence Force, and we are thankful that the families of some of our serving, former and fallen members were able to be here today."On Saturday, Prince Harry begun his first official trip to Australia by joining celebrations to mark its navy's arrival at Sydney Harbour 100 years ago.He attended the International Fleet Review, featuring some 40 warships from 17 countries, including the Royal Navy's type 45 destroyer, HMS Daring.Thousands of people flocked to the harbour as Prince Harry met crowds before boarding a boat for a reception with Mr Abbott at his official residence in the city.</body>

      <title>New Zealand win Rugby Championship</title>
      <description>New Zealand clinch the Rugby Championship title with a 38-27 victory over South Africa in Johannesburg.</description>

      <body>New Zealand secured the Rugby Championship with a pulsating 38-27 win over South Africa at Ellis Park.After Ben Smith's try put the All Blacks ahead, two Bryan Habana scores gave the Springboks hope only for two tries from Liam Messam to give the visitors a half-time lead.Tries from Willie le Roux and Jean de Villiers put South Africa in front.But scores from Beauden Barrett and Kieran Read earned a sixth win from six games for the All Blacks.South Africa went into the game needing a bonus point victory by more than seven points to claim the trophy.But Kiwi coach Steve Hansen's team never looked interested in winning the title with damage limitation, producing a stylish display to win the tournament for the eighth time in 11 years, including its previous incarnation as the Tri-Nations before Argentina joined last year.South Africa had to be content with second place in the group, while Australia secured third spot after a thumping 54-17 victory of fourth-placed Argentina.Barrett's try - New Zealand's fourth - guaranteed a bonus point and confirmed the trophy with 20 minutes left."We had the belief to hit back when the momentum was against us," said New Zealand skipper Richie McCaw."As an All Black I relish these occasions and winning at this great stadium makes me so proud. We gave everything out there this evening."Springboks captain Jean de Villiers said: "To win rugby matches you have to attack and defend and our defence was not up to scratch in this match."Let us give credit to New Zealand - they deserved to win the match and the Championship after a great advertisement for rugby."Morne Steyn kicked an early penalty but the All Blacks moved ahead when a fine offload from Read was followed by Smith beating two defenders to score.But South Africa responded when Duane Vermeulen made space with a surging run and sent Habana over in the 18th minute.Two minutes later a fine one-handed pass from Francois Louw put Habana into space and the winger chipped over Smith and gathered before touching down in the corner.Habana limped off with what appeared to be a hamstring injury two minutes later and the hosts failed to build on their 15-7 advantage.Heavy pressure from New Zealand resulted in Messam, assisted by Brodie Retallick, bundling over from about a yard.And when South Africa attempted to run the ball out in first-half added time, Read turned the ball over and a slick passing move to the left ended with Messam stepping in to score his second try.Six minutes after the interval Messam was sent to the sin bin and within seconds the hosts took a penalty quickly and fed the ball right for Le Roux to cross, with Steyn's conversion making it 22-21.With 14 men, Ma'a Nonu denied a decisive try and after Barrett's penalty restored New Zealand's advantage, De Villiers barged through three tackles to score.The game swung again within two minutes when Barrett broke through to score a fourth try and end South Africa's chances of winning the trophy.New Zealand's Ben Franks was shown a yellow card but, even with a man down, the outstanding Read was sent over in the corner by Julian Savea.</body>

German officials say they are checking the reports.Yemen is struggling to control general lawlessness, an al-Qaeda insurgency, and divisions within the army.Initial reports suggested that the attack was a failed kidnapping attempt of Germany's ambassador."The ambassador escaped but her bodyguard was killed as he tried to resist the attackers who managed to flee," AFP news agency quoted an unnamed diplomatic source as saying.However, the agency later quoted a Yemeni foreign ministry spokesman as saying that Ms Mueller-Holtkemper was "currently outside the country".The German foreign ministry told the BBC it could not confirm any of the reports.Germany - along with several other Western countries - briefly closed its Yemen embassy in August, after the US warned of a potential major militant attack in the Middle East.</body>

      <title>US shutdown halts EU trade talks</title>
      <description>Negotiations on a sweeping free trade pact between the US and the EU are postponed because of a partial government shutdown in America.</description>

      <body>Negotiations on a sweeping free trade pact between the US and the EU have been postponed because of a partial government shutdown in America.US officials had been due in Brussels next week to discuss the deal aimed at boosting bilateral ties.US President Barack Obama earlier cancelled his trip to Asia because of the shutdown.The US government closed non-essential operations on Tuesday after Congress failed to agree a new budget.Since then hundreds of thousands of government employees have not been working or paid.On Friday, US trade representative Michael Froman informed the EU that financial and staffing constraints made it impossible to send a full negotiating team to Brussels.But he stressed that Washington would continue working with the EU on drawing up the deal, but would have to wait until the shutdown was over.Reacting to the US announcement, European Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht said the delay was unfortunate."But let me underline that it in no way distracts us from our overall aim of achieving an ambitious trade and investment deal," he added.Meanwhile, the White House said that Mr Obama would miss two summits in Asia, including the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) meeting in Indonesia.It said the decision was made due to the "difficulty in moving forward with foreign travel in the face of a shutdown".Mr Obama called Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on Friday and expressed his regret over the cancellation, Indonesian presidential spokesman for foreign affairs Teuku Faizasyah told the BBC.The visit had not been rescheduled, the spokesman added.Secretary of State John Kerry will attend the Apec gathering and the East Asia summit in Brunei in Mr Obama's place, the White House said.President Obama had been due to begin a four-nation Asian trip on Saturday, heading to Bali and Brunei before travelling on to Malaysia and the Philippines.The US government partially shut down operations on Tuesday after Republicans who control the House of Representatives refused to approve a budget, saying they would only do so if Mr Obama's healthcare reform law was delayed or stripped of funding.Mr Obama and the Democrats have refused, noting the law was passed in 2010, subsequently approved by the Supreme Court, and was a central issue in the 2012 election which Mr Obama won comfortably.On Friday, Democrats and Republicans appeared no closer to finding a way out of the impasse.Republican House Speaker John Boehner insisted Mr Obama and Democratic Senate leaders open negotiations on the shutdown."All we're asking for is to sit down and have a discussion," he said. "This isn't some damn game."Mr Obama later said he was happy to hold talks with the Republicans, "but we can't do it with a gun held to the head of the American people"."This shutdown could be over today," he said. "We know there are the votes for it in the House of Representatives. If Speaker Boehner will simply allow the vote to take place, we can end this shutdown."The US also faces running out of money and defaulting on its debt if there is no agreement to raise government borrowing limits later this month.Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said warned earlier that a failure to raise the US debt ceiling would be a far worse threat to the global economy than the current shutdown.She said it was "mission critical" that the US agreed a new debt limit.Ms Lagarde's comments were echoed by the US Treasury.It said a debt default could lead to a financial crisis as bad as 2008 or worse.Meanwhile, the impact of the shutdown was being felt across the country.The National Transportation Safety Board did not send investigators to a deadly church bus crash in Tennessee that killed eight people and injured 14 others.The labour department also postponed the release of the highly anticipated September jobs report.With Tropical Storm Karen bearing down on the Gulf states, the website of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), carried a message saying: "Due to the federal government shutdown, NOAA.gov and most associated web sites are unavailable."It referred visitors to the National Weather Service.However, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) recalled workers to help prepare for the storm.On Friday, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said the House would vote on a measure to re-open Fema as well as the National Weather Service to deal with the impending storm.</body>

      <body>Tunisia's governing Islamist Ennahda party and the opposition have agreed on the appointment of a caretaker government in the coming weeks.Under the deal signed after talks in Tunis, a cabinet of independent figures will be in power until fresh elections.Last month Ennahda agreed in principle to relinquish power, in an effort to end Tunisia's political deadlock.The crisis was triggered by the assassinations of two opposition leaders earlier this year.It has threatened to disrupt a democratic transition that began after Tunisians threw out their decades-old authoritarian government at the beginning of the 2011 uprisings, widely referred to as the Arab Spring.Talks between Ennahda and the National Salvation Front-led opposition are being mediated by the UGTT labour union.Under the agreement signed on Saturday, the two sides are to hold further negotiations on the formation of the new technocratic cabinet within three or four weeks.The caretaker government is to supervise new elections.Correspondents say the agreement represents a setback for the moderate Islamist Ennahda Party, which has run the country since winning elections in October 2011.The opposition has accused Ennahda of pushing an Islamist agenda on a traditionally secular nation.The rivalry intensified after the murders of prominent left-wing figure Chokri Belaid in February and opposition politician Mohammed Brahmi in July.Ennahda condemned the killings but the opposition accused it of failing to rein in radical Islamists.</body>

      <body>Prominent Conservative backbencher Adam Afriyie has said he will try to force the government to hold an early vote on whether the UK should leave the EU.The prime minister has promised to hold an in/out referendum in 2017 if he wins the next general election, but Mr Afriyie said voters were "not convinced" that it would happen.He said he would push for a vote in October 2014 instead.But Home Secretary Theresa May warned that Mr Afriyie had "got it wrong".And a Downing Street spokesman said of Mr Afriyie's plan: "The PM will not let it stand."Mr Afriyie - who has denied newspaper claims he is being groomed to replace party leader David Cameron - said he would table an amendment to the European Union (Referendum) Bill on Monday.Mr Cameron has pledged to renegotiate the UK's relationship with the EU before an in/out referendum in 2017.But, speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics programme, Mr Afriyie said there would be "ample time" to conduct this renegotiation by as early as next year."By having a referendum in 2014, it gives us 12 months to renegotiate," he said. "But more than that, it kick-starts negotiations."EU member states would need to "accommodate" British demands for reforms "if they wish us to remain", he added.He argued: "I think it strengthens the prime minister's hand."The MP said 80% of people wanted a referendum, and more than 50% of people wanted a referendum this side of the election."British businesses need certainty," he said."Look, we can carry on kicking this can down the road forever."But I've had a struggle with my conscience over this one."I don't want to cause any trouble over it, but I think it's absolutely essential that Parliament and MPs have the opportunity to search their souls and to give people a referendum this side of the election."In an article for the Mail on Sunday, he predicted that - without a referendum before 2015 - "large numbers of people will continue to vote UKIP whatever happens - and if they do, there is a distinct danger that Labour will gain a majority and we will never see a referendum at all".UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he would be "absolutely delighted" if Britain could have an early referendum.He told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme on Sunday that a referendum before 2015 would be good for British industry and business."Adam Afriyie has put his finger on the real problem - and that's that four years ago, Mr Cameron gave us a cast-iron guarantee that there would be a referendum."This time last year, he was saying there would not be a referendum, and he is now saying there should be a referendum."People are not quite sure what to believe."But Mrs May, speaking on the same programme, said: "We need to be negotiating that settlement with the European Union and then put to the British people the Europe of the future - not the Europe of the past - and give them that opportunity to say in or out."What is crucial is that we have, at the next election, a Conservative party that will be offering people that renegotiation of a new settlement with Europe, looking to the future and then putting that to the British people in an in/out referendum."Backbench Conservative MP James Wharton is attempting to enshrine his party leadership's referendum pledge in law - without the support of coalition partners the Liberal Democrats - with his European Union (Referendum) Bill.As a private member's bill, it is vulnerable to being delayed by procedural tactics from MPs who oppose it, and will only become law if the government allocates enough parliamentary time for its proponents to overcome any such hurdles.Mrs May warned that Mr Afriyie's amendment to the bill could "jeopardise" its prospects entirely.And Mr Wharton told BBC Radio 5 live the amendment could "kill" his bill."My concern is that any amendment, no matter how well-meaning it might be, is going to make the progress of the bill more difficult and it'll make it easier for those MPs who want to use procedural techniques to slow it down and stop it... that bit more possible."I don't want to see that. I'd like to see my bill go through and I think this harms the chances of that happening."Liberal Democrat deputy leader Simon Hughes, whose party opposes a referendum on the EU unless further powers are handed from Westminster to Brussels, said a 2014 referendum would be a "barmy" distraction from the government's attempts to boost UK economic growth.Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said the Conservative leadership had scheduled a referendum in 2017 due to "internal party management as much as anything else".The PM's promise of a "grand, unilateral renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU" was "deeply flawed and bound to unravel", he added, in pre-released extracts of a speech to be delivered in London on Tuesday.The European Union (Referendum) Bill is due to return to the House of Commons for further debate on 8 November.</body>

      <title>National Crime Agency hailed by May</title>
      <description>The UK's new National Crime Agency will "relentlessly pursue organised criminals", says Home Secretary Theresa May, ahead of the body's launch on Monday.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24418847</url>
      <date>1381075128</date>
      <body>The UK's new National Crime Agency will "relentlessly pursue organised criminals", Home Secretary Theresa May has told the BBC.She said the body, to launch on Monday, would focus on dealing with organised crime, economic crime, border policing, child protection and cybercrime.The new agency will replace the Serious Organised Crime Agency, known as Soca.Labour called the move a "rebranding exercise", and warned the NCA was "not strong enough" for future challenges.It is the third time since 1998 that an organised crime body has been set up.The National Crime Squad was set up 15 years ago, only to be replaced eight years later by Soca - which is now being scrapped.The NCA will work with each of the regional police forces in the UK and similar organisations abroad.The agency will have 4,500 officers and aims to adopt a more visible, joined-up approach than was previously the case.It has significant powers to compel police forces in England and Wales to provide assistance and carry out policing operations.Mrs May told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that the new agency was "designed to be a relentless crime-fighting body which will relentlessly pursue organised criminals".The home secretary said: "Crime is falling in this country, but we can't be complacent - and particularly on organised crime. I don't think the last government put enough emphasis on this.""At the core of the NCA will be intelligence. It will work at local level and regionally across government, not just the police. It will work internationally as well," she said.But shadow policing minister David Hanson said the NCA "doesn't match the government's hype"."Most of the NCA is just the rebranding of existing organisations such as the Serious Organised Crime Agency, but with a substantial 20% cut imposed by the Home Office on their overall budget," he said.Mr Hanson added: "The new organisation is not strong enough to deal with the exponential growth of economic and online crime. It will simply absorb the existing National Cyber Crime but with fewer resources."It is right to have stronger national action on organised crime with the NCA, on child exploitation and on intelligence - but the government has to support this effort and not simply use this as a rebranding exercise to hide substantial policing cuts."However, Mrs May told the BBC she was satisfied that the NCA was "going to be well-resourced".She said changes across policing had shown it was possible to fight crime while being "careful with the budgets that are available", as part of the government-wide commitment to "deal with the deficit".And she rejected comparisons with the US, amid suggestions that an organised crime agency was essentially a British version of the FBI."It is a British approach to dealing with an issue that we face," she said.Each police force in the UK has territorial responsibility for its particular area. Crimes that are carried out across more than one county or area usually involve officers from both areas.The new body will have a strategic role in which it will attempt to look at the bigger picture of organised crime in the UK, how it operates and how it can be disrupted.The NCA will answer directly to the home secretary and will have the same powers in Scotland as it does in England and Wales.The situation will be different in Northern Ireland, where the agency will carry out its border and customs functions, but not other crime-fighting roles.</body>

      <title>Twitter plans to raise $1bn in IPO</title>
      <description>In documents made public for the first time, social networking company Twitter has said it plans to raise $1bn as part of its stock market debut.</description>

      <date>1380856665</date>
      <body>Social networking company Twitter has said it plans to raise $1bn (£619m) in its stock market debut in documents filed with US regulators.In the filing, revealed on Thursday, the seven-year-old company said that it now has 218 million monthly users and that 500 million tweets are sent a day.It made a loss of $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m.It will be the largest Silicon Valley stock offering since Facebook's listing in 2012.Analysts said that the offering was likely to get a good response."Social media is red hot," said Internet analyst Lou Kerner. "Twitter is front and centre benefiting from market enthusiasm for all things social, and remarkably strong metrics."The filing also revealed Twitter's finances for the first time.While the company has never made a profit, its revenue has grown from just $28m in 2010 to $317m by the end of 2012.Around 85% of Twitter's revenue last year came from ad sales; the rest was from licensing its data.The company takes in a significant portion of its ad revenue from mobile devices, an important metric often tracked by analysts.As of 2013, over 65% of the company's advertising revenue was generated from mobile devices. More than 75% of Twitter users accessed the site from their mobile phone during that same time period.Some analysts said that the decision by the firm to raise capital indicated that it was keen on improving the way people enjoy content on its platform and how advertisers connect with its users."Users should be happy about this," said Zachary Reiss-Davis, an analyst with Forrester."It looks like Twitter is looking at how to enrich the experience and it understands that to build a successful service, they have to create something people like and want to come back to and spend time on."Peter Esho from Sydney-based Invast Financial Services, added that Twitter's ease to use had seen it increase its user base, making it an attractive option for advertisers."I think what Twitter has working in its favour is that it's very easy to use: it doesn't eat up too much bandwidth for the average user in places where broadband penetration is low," he said.The filing also revealed that two of the company's co-founders, Evan Williams and Jack Dorsey, own significant stakes in Twitter, and could stand to take in significant sums from the company's stock market listing.Mr Williams owns 12% of shares in the company, while Mr Dorsey owns 4.9%.Benchmark Capital's Peter Fenton, an early investor in the company, is the second-biggest shareholder, with 6.7% of shares.Twitter indicated three weeks earlier that it had filed for a public stock market offering.However, under a new law passed by Congress in 2012, it did not have to reveal its financial documents because it had revenue of less than $1bn.But by releasing the documents publicly, it gave an indication that it hopes to complete its stock sale soon.The company plans to list under the stock symbol TWTR, but it did not reveal which stock exchange, the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange, it had chosen.However, Mr Esho said that the listing was likely to be on the Nasdaq."I was to speculate, I think it would have to be Nasdaq," he said. "That really is the exchange that has seen so many tech names come to the market."Goldman Sachs is the lead bank taking the company public, a coveted position that is often fought for amongst the nation's biggest banks.The other banks helping with the offering are Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, BofA Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank Securities and CODE Advisors.</body>

      <title>Silk Road accused appears in court</title>
      <description>The alleged mastermind behind the online illegal drugs marketplace Silk Road is too dangerous to be bailed, prosecutors say.</description>

      <body>The alleged mastermind behind the online illegal drugs marketplace Silk Road is too dangerous to be bailed, US prosecutors have said.Ross Ulbricht, 29, was arrested this week and is charged with being the administrator of the site which has now been shut down.He is also accused of trying to arrange the killing of one of the site's users."We deny all charges and that is the end of the discussion at this point," Mr Ulbricht's lawyer said.Mr Ulbricht appeared in a San Francisco court on Friday wearing a green T-shirt under red jail clothes and had his ankles shackled.A request from his legal team for his bail hearing to be pushed back was granted - it will now take place on 9 October.Federal magistrate Joseph Spero asked Mr Ulbricht's lawyer Brandon LeBlanc whether seeing the criminal indictment that included a murder-for-hire charge had "changed his calculus" on whether he thought Mr Ulbricht would be granted bail.As part of its criminal complaint, the FBI alleged that Mr Ulbricht had sought to pay a Silk Road user to kill another user who had threatened to expose details of the site's users.Prosecutors opposed the delay, arguing that Mr Ulbricht represented a danger to the community, and that there was a high likelihood that he may attempt to flee.The Silk Road was a well-known destination on Tor, a so-called "dark web" service that anonymises users, making it much more difficult for authorities to track locations.The site sold a range of items, but was most famous for offering a host of illegal drugs, paid for using virtual currency Bitcoin.</body>

      <body>Switzerland's financial regulator is investigating possible manipulation of foreign exchange rates at several Swiss financial institutions.The regulator, FINMA, said several banks, including some from outside Switzerland, could be implicated.It is coordinating the investigation closely with authorities in other countries.It would give no further details on the investigations or the banks potentially involved.Swiss Banking, the group that represents the nation's banks, said it had no further information.The Swiss announcement follows reports in June that the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), was looking into whether traders manipulated benchmark foreign-exchange rates to increase profits.This followed an investigation by Bloomberg News that found that dealers shared information and used client orders to move the rates.The FCA, which does not announce its investigations, only its enforcement actions, said: "We are aware of the allegations and we have been speaking to relevant parties."London is by far the world's biggest market for foreign currency trading, with 41% of global turnover, according to the Bank for International Settlements.New York has a 19% share, followed by Singapore, Tokyo and Hong Kong.Switzerland accounts for 3.2% of foreign exchange trading.</body>

      <title>Vettel nears title with Korea win</title>
      <description>Sebastian Vettel dominates the Korean Grand Prix to put himself on the brink of a fourth consecutive world championship.</description>

      <body>Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel dominated the Korean Grand Prix to put himself on the brink of a fourth consecutive world championship.The German's title rival, Ferrari's Fernando Alonso, could finish only sixth and Vettel will take the title in Japan next Sunday if he wins with Alonso lower than eighth.Lotus drivers Kimi Raikkonen and Romain Grosjean took second and third.Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg fended off Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton for fourth.Hulkenberg's presence in the top placings provided much of the excitement in the race and led to a frenetic last 20 laps after the field had been closed up following two safety-car periods.Hulkenberg, who had spent the first part of the race defending from Alonso and Raikkonen, now found himself under intense pressure first from Hamilton and then from the Mercedes and Alonso, who also had McLaren's Jenson Button and Mercedes' Nico Rosberg close behind.The Sauber was slow around most of the lap but fast on the straights and it led to some thrilling racing.Hamilton actually passed Hulkenberg at Turn One on lap 48, with seven to go, but was re-passed down the straight to Turn Three. Meanwhile, Hamilton was also having to fend off Alonso.Not long afterwards, Hamilton even got on the radio to his team to ask if anyone had any suggestions, a sentiment with which Alonso would have plenty of sympathy.The Sauber's straight-line speed, and ability to come off Turn One faster than his rivals, meant Hulkenberg was able to hang on to fourth place.BBC F1 co-commentator David Coulthard said: "Great display under pressure. I know I sound like I've joined the Nico Hulkenberg fan club, but this is impressive."Hulkenberg had got himself into that position by making a good start from seventh on the grid and moving up to fifth on the first lap, passing Alonso after the Ferrari lost speed up the long straight after getting on to the kerb on the exit of Turn One avoiding Rosberg.Vettel streaked away at the front, totally in control from lap one, while behind him Grosjean edged away from the Mercedes of Hamilton and Rosberg.Vettel said: "Fortunately we had enough pace to get ahead after both safety cars but both Kimi and Romain were very competitive and did better with their tyres."I am really enjoying things at the moment, we have a great team and we are having a great time."Hulkenberg held off Alonso and Raikkonen through the first pit stops before the Finn jumped ahead by bringing forward his second pit stop.The race was then enlivened by two safety-car periods in quick succession.The first was caused by a tyre failure on Sergio Perez's McLaren. At the re-start, Raikkonen passed Grosjean for second place into Turn One, despite a late defensive lunge by the Frenchman.Grosjean said: "I made a small mistake and Kimi overtook me but it was my mistake. But we are back on the podium so it is all good."But then the race had to be halted again after Mark Webber's Red Bull caught fire after being hit by the spinning Force India of Adrian Sutil at Turn Three.Hamilton had dropped from third to fifth as a result of his team leaving him out too long on a worn set of tyres before his second pit stop but after a brief dice with Alonso on the second re-start, the Mercedes driver set about his battle with Hulkenberg.At the front, Vettel was serenely coasting home to his fourth straight win, his only concern the wear on his right front tyre, the same tyre that had failed on Perez's car.Behind him, Grosjean had been urged to race Raikkonen, being told by the team he was faster than the Finn, but was unable to get close enough to try.Rosberg took seventh, delayed by a front wing failure mid-race, ahead of Button and Ferrari's Felipe Massa.Marussia's Jules Bianchi and Caterham's Charles Pic have been given 10-place grid penalties for the Japanese Grand Prix after receiving their third reprimands of the season.Both drivers were adjudged to have failed to slow down sufficiently for yellow flags during the race.Caterham's Giedo van der Garde and Marussia's Max Chilton picked up their first reprimands of the season because they failed to stay above the minimum time set by the FIA during a safety car period.Full race results:</body>

      <body>Rafael Nadal may be set to overtake Novak Djokovic and regain the world number one spot, but he was beaten by his rival in the China Open final.An inspired Djokovic won 6-3 6-4 against his Spanish opponent, who will move to the top of the men's rankings on Monday after reaching the final.The Serb, who broke in each set on his way to winning, said: "I needed this."I wanted to win against Nadal, who has been the best player so far in 2013. It's important for my confidence."Djokovic, who won the China Open for a fourth time, started strongly and set the tone for the match by breaking Nadal's first service game as he raced into a 3-0 lead.The break proved crucial as the Serb produced some impressive tennis, with the timing and depth of his strokes not allowing Nadal the chance to get his game going.Djokovic dragged Nadal out wide with his serve and struck a powerful forehand into open space to wrap up the opening set after 35 minutes.The start of the second set saw Djokovic immediately break the Spaniard again and he continued to hold the initiative in commanding style.He took the following game to love and, as Nadal struggled to put pressure on his serve, went on to secure an emphatic win.Djokovic added: "It's been an incredible week again at the China Open and I still haven't lost a match here - I just love the conditions, the court and the atmosphere that goes around the tournament."I managed to stay tough and not drop my concentration, which I think [happened] in both Montreal and at the US Open in the important moments."I've learnt my lesson from a few very tough and close matches that I lost against Rafa on hard courts, especially the last one in the US Open final."Nadal, who will return to the top of the rankings for the first time since July 2011, failed to engineer a break point as his run of 21 matches unbeaten came to an end in Beijing.He said: "I couldn't see a way to stop him and he was too strong for me."I didn't play my best match. It was difficult to create spin on this ball and he was able to hit all the balls where he wanted."When that's happening against a player like Novak, you are dead - you don't have a chance."</body>

      <body>Photojournalist Bill Eppridge - who took images of the aftermath of Robert Kennedy's assassination - has died aged 75.Eppridge died in hospital in Connecticut from a blood infection caused by a fall.His image of Kennedy lying on the floor of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles is widely considered one of the greatest news photos of all time.He worked for Life Magazine at the time of the shooting in 1968.Friend and fellow photographer David Hume Kennerly said: "He extended a helping hand and a bushel of inspiration to me, and his kindness shaped the course of my career.Born in Buenos Aires, Eppridge moved to the US with his family as a young boy.Working as a staff photographer for Life Magazine from 1964, he covered a wide variety of stories from revolutions in Latin America to the Beatles' arrival in the US.Eppridge followed Kennedy from a campaign event at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles into the back kitchen where a 24-year-old Palestinian Christian, Sirhan Sirhan, shot and killed the 42-year-old presidential hopeful.Eppridge took several black and white images that night, but the most enduring and haunting depicted Kennedy lying on the floor, with a halo of light in the background, with a hotel worker at his side."You are not just a photojournalist, you're a historian," he once explained when asked how he could keep snapping pictures while someone was lying injured in front of him.Commenting on his unforgettable image of Kennedy, he said: "I never hung it on my wall."His 1965 photo essay about a drug-addicted New York couple inspired the Al Pacino film The Panic in Needle Park.After leaving Life in 1972, Eppridge worked for other magazines including Time and Sports Illustrated.Before his death, he and his wife, Adrienne Aurichio, had been putting the finishing touches to a book on the Beatles, to mark next year's 50th anniversary of their arrival to the US.</body>

      <description>Musician Anoushka Shankar says she decided to reveal her own experiences of sexual abuse after the gang rape and murder of a woman in Delhi.</description>

      <date>1380907941</date>
      <body>Musician Anoushka Shankar says she was prompted to reveal her experience of sexual abuse after learning of the gang rape and murder of a woman in Delhi.Shankar, daughter of legendary Indian sitar player Ravi Shankar, said in February she had been abused by "a man my parents trusted" in her childhood.Her revelation followed the fatal attack on an Indian student, for which four men have been sentenced to death."Her story is the apex of millions of stories," Shankar told BBC Radio 4.Speaking on the Front Row programme, she said: "No-one I knew could help being affected by the gravity and intensity of that attack - and if it resonates with something in our experience then obviously it doubles the impact of hearing a story like that."I felt quite conscious as an Indian woman that there was a very unique moment happening where the entire world's attention was on sexual violence and on the role and position of women in India."I felt almost an obligation [to talk about my experience]. It didn't feel dragged out of me. If I was ever going to talk about my story, that felt like the right moment."Shankar, 32, took the decision to talk about her experiences in a video, recorded in her London home, in which she appealed for people to support a campaign in memory of the gang rape victim."As a child I suffered sexual and emotional abuse for several years at the hands of a man my parents trusted implicitly," she said.She added the attacks had included "groping, touching and verbal abuse".Reflecting on the statement, the musician told Front Row's John Wilson: "It was something I never spoke to the media about."It had never felt like something relevant in a public context until this moment where I thought 'hang on, it's important for people to realise that this kind of thing can happen to anyone, anywhere'."I think there's a class issue in India where there can be an assumption that things like this don't happen to people from upper classes or who are privileged. I think part of what shocked people within India was that [the victim] was a middle-class girl. It's so ridiculous."The musician has responded to the attack, and tried to address its causes, with a track on her new album, Traces Of You.She said the song, which references the 23-year-old victim's name in its title, tries to capture a sense of the horror of the attack.The album, recorded with producer Nitin Sawhney and her sister Norah Jones, also addresses the death of her father last year.Shankar said her experiences had informed the spirit of the record, and brought a sense of "resilience" to the music."It's not necessarily about the passing of my father, it's about me passing through the passing of my father."There's a way that we all go through horrible and painful things and I'm not nullifying it in any way when I say we do go on."My childhood experiences were one of the big experiences for me [but] I know as a woman I've come through that."At some cost, but I've come through it."You can hear the full interview with Anoushka Shankar on BBC Radio 4's Front Row at 19:15 BST on 4 October, 2013. It will then be available on the iPlayer.</body>

      <body>Pop star Miley Cyrus has hit back at Sinead O'Connor, after the Irish singer warned her not to be exploited by the music business.In a series of tweets, Cyrus mocked O'Connor, comparing her to US actress Amanda Bynes before alluding to O'Connor's mental health problems.O'Connor responded with another open letter to the singer, accusing her of "irresponsible" behaviour.The Irish singer told her to "remove her tweets immediately".The tit-for-tat conversation began after Cyrus, 20, cited O'Connor's video Nothing Compares 2 U as an inspiration for her explicit Wrecking Ball video.O'Connor, 46, said she was prompted to write, "in the spirit of motherliness" after "phone calls from various newspapers" who wanted the singer-songwriter to comment upon similarities between the two videos.In the video for Nothing Compares 2 U, O'Connor sheds a single tear as she performs the Prince-penned break-up ballad.Cyrus cries in the promo clip for Wrecking Ball, which shares similar lyrical themes to O'Connor's song. But the video also finds her licking a sledgehammer and swinging naked on a metal demolition ball.O'Connor said she was "extremely concerned" that those around Cyrus had led or encouraged her to believe "that it is in any way 'cool' to be naked and licking sledgehammers in your videos".Cyrus, who found fame as the child star of Disney children's show Hannah Montana, has been criticised in recent weeks for her controversial performances, particularly at the MTV Video Music Awards in Brooklyn last month.O'Connor continued: "The message you keep sending is that it's somehow cool to be prostituted.. it's so not cool Miley... it's dangerous."It is in fact the case that you will obscure your talent by allowing yourself to be pimped, whether it's the music business or yourself doing the pimping," added O'Connor.Responding on Twitter, Cyrus wrote: "Top of the mornin to ya."She added a screen shot of O'Connor's tweets from 2012 in which the Irish star, who has bi-polar disorder, referred to her own mental health problems, asking for Twitter followers to recommend a psychiatrist.She compared the singer to former child actress Amanda Bynes, who is currently undergoing psychiatric treatment."I don't have time to write you an open letter cause I'm hosting and performing on SNL this week," Cyrus continued.Cyrus also tweeted a picture of O'Connor ripping up a photograph of the pope, an infamous on-stage stunt by the singer, before asking her to "meet up and talk".Responding to Cyrus in a third open letter, O'Connor said she would take legal action against her if she did not remove the tweets."You have posted today tweets of mine which are two years old, which were posted by me when I was unwell and seeking help so as to make them look like they are recent."In doing so you mock myself and Amanda Bynes for having suffered with mental health issues and for having sought help," said O'Connor.She added: "It is most unbecoming of you to respond in such a fashion to someone who expressed care for you," O'Connor added.</body>

      <title>China schools seek to nip young love in the bud</title>
      <description>How some Chinese schools are trying to nip young love in the bud</description>

      <body>In recent weeks a number of Chinese secondary schools have introduced prescriptive new rules designed to discourage teenage romance. But this has been met with scorn and outrage on both social and official media, as the BBC's Dong Le reportsOn the campus of a secondary school in China's famous silk city of Hangzhou, pupils of the opposite sex have been given a very important new instruction.They must maintain a minimum distance of half a metre (1.64 ft) from each other at all times. In addition, boys and girls are not allowed to go around school premises in pairs.Another school, in the eastern city of Wenzhou, Zhejiang province, has banned what it calls "close interaction" between students of the opposite sex as well as students of the same sex. They do not define what "close interaction" really means.The school authorities in Wenzhou have threatened "severe disciplinary action" against offenders.Secondary schools admit students aged just 11 - they are on the cusp of puberty and just the age when those notoriously raging hormones begin to wreak havoc.And with reports that teenage romance (although not necessarily sex) has become more popular on campuses, school authorities - as well as parents - are worried that children's academic performance is being affected.So some have moved to nip young love in the bud with stringent measures - and they will find support in some quarters.The Chinese regard teenage romance as something undesirable, calling it Zao Lian, which literally means "early love" but in essence it denotes immature love.Schools and education authorities are increasingly bombarding young people with information on the "undesirable effects" of Zao Lian.There are entire websites dedicated to the issue of how to avoid the lure of the opposite sex and focus attention on study. Schools in China also run sex education courses.Both teachers and parents believe that young people in schools must not deviate from learning and must concentrate on studies to lay a good foundation for building a future.The schools in Hangzhou and Wenzhou are doing whatever it takes to achieve that and some believe they should be praised for this.But they have also been greeted by a torrent of angry posts from China's internet users after the rules were uploaded on Weibo microblogs.Many said the rules were "barbaric and oppressive": "How do you keep measuring the space between male and female pupils?" one internet user asked.Mainstream media also added its voice. The state-run newspaper, China Youth Daily, called the measures "absurd, ridiculous and illegal"."It is normal for young people to fall in love. Teenage romance in schools must be discouraged, but it is not advisable to use extreme and oppressive methods to do that," said the paperAnd the BBC spoke to some young people who also weighed into the discussion.A high school graduate in Beijing said that schools had enacted rules banning students from being too intimate with each other, but it was up to teachers to decide how to implement them and some teachers were quite flexible.One student from a high school in Shanghai admitted that campus romance had become a common phenomenon and many students had fallen in love with each other.But, she added, "it isn't a bad thing as some eventually get married after leaving school.""There is nothing wrong with students finding love as long as it is not affecting their academic work," said another student from Beijing.Prof Zhang Yuling from Nanjing University, whose field of expertise is education, told the BBC that efforts backfired because the value of what was acceptable was changing in China."Schools treat pupils like prisoners and people do not agree with that," he said.But Prof Zhang did agree that schools needed to exercise more control over students."Thirty or 40 years ago before China embarked on reforms and opened up to the outside world, people were pure and innocent as far as sex was concerned," he said."But today's young people are exposed to more information and contents than any previous generations."People are particularly concerned over the availability to young people of pornography," Prof Zhang said.Whether or not more schools join in this move to police the feelings and relationships of students, it is unlikely to become less of a talking point.But what many will watch out for is whether the regulations do discourage romances or end up encouraging forbidden love among students with a taste for breaking the rules.</body>

      <title>Taliban profit from illicit uniform sales</title>
      <description>How the Taliban access army uniforms and fake IDs with ease</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-23358411</url>
      <date>1381021129</date>
      <body>At a Kabul market a row of shiny new Afghan military uniforms are on sale.It could have been uniforms such as these that were used in a string of brazen attacks this year, including one near the presidential palace in June, when militants dressed as soldiers penetrated the securest part of the city centre.Such violence has intensified pressure on the authorities to clamp down on the trade in illicit uniforms.June's attack was a sign that they may be losing this battle.For years insurgents have had access to and used the uniforms of Afghan army and police as well as Western forces to evade security checks or to get bombers close to their targets. In the June attack, they even had fake ID cards.This tactic appears to be on the increase as the Taliban focus their attacks on fellow Afghans serving in the security forces and high-profile targets in the capital.This is a countrywide problem: earlier this year militants in uniform also killed 12 policemen in the southern province of Uruzgan and attacked the governor's compound in Panjshir province.And in the latest attack in September, two men dressed as Afghan policemen attacked a Shia mosque armed with AK-47 assault rifles, knives and explosives.But in the Afghan capital you don't have to look far to find a ready source for army outfits.The Pul-e-Kheshti area, the busiest and noisiest part of the city, is home to Kabul's old bazaar, famous for its black-market traders.I quickly found different types of military clothing, ranging from Afghan police uniforms to those of Nato forces.But when the traders saw my camera and reporting equipment, they stuffed their wares away hastily.In the blink of an eye, any trace of the black market trade had disappeared.In one specialist tailor shop for military clothing, an Afghan policeman told me that he bought his uniform from a trader in the area."He didn't ask for anything, no ID card, no military documents, nothing, he just asked for money," Abdul Rahman says while waiting for his trousers to be mended.Mr Rahman says that on the black market, a military uniform costs about 500 Afghanis ($10; £6.50). A policeman's salary starts at about $200 a month.A piece of military insignia, such as the symbol of an Afghan police or army rank, sells for less than $1.Uniforms are usually issued by the interior and defence ministries. But if stocks are low, they issue documentation allowing soldiers and police to have their clothes made at licensed tailors' workshops directly.There are about 50 tailors in Kabul's old bazaar who produce and mend uniforms.The head of the tailor's union, M Hakim, told me that he had full control of the workshops, but that he did need to keep an eye on things."I don't let them do any illegal business," Mr Hakim said. "If I didn't control them, they'd even prepare guns for sale."The authorities are trying to keep a lid on the trade by licensing specific tailors and sewing workshops to manufacture and carry out repairs for the interior and defence ministries.Licensed workshops are supposed to accept orders only from the military or the police.Ibrahim, a tailor on the market who has such a licence, says the system works to some extent - but that the black market is difficult to control:"Licensed tailor shops usually ask for ID cards, a specific address and military documents from their customers," he says, "but on the black market there is no law."And there are a number of sewing workshops where the controls are much more lax.Mohammad Zarif, who runs a small outlet, says he prefers not to request ID cards from people already in uniform."If we don't know the customers then we ask for ID cards, but when we know them and if they are already in military uniforms then we can't ask," he says.When pressed on how he can tell whether a man in uniform is really a member of the military, he told me he didn't think it was any of his business to inquire into that."The government should prevent it - if the government can't prevent it, how can we?"The authorities say they are doing their best to prevent illegal sales, but it is a difficult problem to tackle.Apart from illegal production and sales, there are reports that security force personnel and deserters add to the problem by selling their uniforms on the markets."We increased our intelligence and detection activities after the use of military uniforms increased among insurgents," Siddiq Siddiqi, a spokesman for the Afghan interior ministry, told the BBC."But we have [had] problems so far and will try our best to undermine their access to uniforms."Police and traders say that it is over two years since the last systematic raid on the Kabul black market took place and hundreds of uniforms were confiscated.The interior ministry says it conducts regular check-ups.But with no police on show during the two hours I spent at the market, chances are that some traders will continue to view the illegal trade as a risk worth taking.</body>

      <body>It's easy to campaign to save endangered species like pandas and woolly spider monkeys because they're fluffy and cute. But what about venomous snakes? These are crucial predators in Brazil's Atlantic rainforest ecosystem, and a local doctor has made it his life's work to save one of the most dangerous.Carnival was in full swing in the small Brazilian coastal town of Itacare when a giant snake measuring 6m long slithered down the streets, sending hundreds of revellers screaming into roadside bars. Until recently the snake would have been killed. The police were standing by with shotguns. But instead the local doctor was summoned.Dr Rodrigo Souza moved to the north-eastern state of Bahia 12 years ago and developed a fascination with the rainforest and its wildlife. Now whenever a strange creature ventures into a built-up area, the doctor is called. He was even asked to rescue a group of confused penguins that had been swept up from the Falkland Islands by the mighty South Atlantic current.Souza identifies the carnival incident as a turning point in his battle to save endangered species in this dwindling patch of Atlantic rainforest in which he has made his home.When he first moved to Bahia it was common to see people illegally selling birds, snakes and monkeys at the side of the road. That rarely happens now. The authorities have clamped down and the local people have become more aware of the importance of saving their unique ecosystem. On the day I drove to visit him, someone stopped the traffic in the middle of the road to allow a snake to cross.But Souza's real passion is the Atlantic bushmaster, one of the most poisonous snakes in the western hemisphere. Thick-bodied and up to 3m long, these majestic creatures have distinctive orange and black markings and heat-seeking sensors under the eyes that allow them to lock on to warm-blooded mammals. A human can die within an hour of being bitten unless they receive the right anti-venom injection.There are 35 bushmasters living in Souza's private snake sanctuary, which has a "No Entry" sign on the door bearing a large skull and crossbones.He's been compared by the Brazilian media to Grizzly Man, the American environmentalist who lived among the grizzly bears of Alaska until one of them killed him. Grizzly Man's life and death was the subject of a documentary by the German film-maker Werner Herzog. But Souza resents the comparisons: "I'm under no illusions about my snakes," he says. "They have no idea who I am and I know they would not hesitate to kill me."I admit to feeling absolutely terrified when he invites me into the sanctuary to watch him casually lifting up a 2m-long snake with an instrument resembling a giant metal tuning fork. Before handling them he zips into an insulated bodysuit that stops him from giving off too much heat. Meanwhile I'm standing a safe distance away - trembling with fear - in shorts and a T-shirt.The bushmaster has an almost mythological status amongst the indigenous people of the rainforest. Because of its attraction to heat they called it the "fire extinguisher" and have warned Souza never to sit near an open fire in bushmaster territory - because the snakes can leap a distance of several metres towards a heat source and at very high speed. He was once called to a road traffic accident where a bushmaster snake had attacked the headlamp of a passing motorbike.Rodrigo Souza is the first and probably only person ever to successfully breed the Atlantic bushmaster in captivity. He milks his snakes for venom which he then uses to make an antidote for snake-bite victims. The Bushmaster venom also contains unique medical properties of interest to cancer researchers.However this majestic serpent is now under threat of extinction as its habitat disappears.Along with lion tamarins, cougars and woolly spider monkeys, bushmaster snakes are one of many endangered species unique to Brazil's Atlantic Rainforest. Not to be confused with the mighty Amazon, the Atlantic rainforest once covered the entire coastal region from the north-east to the Argentine border in the south. But now only 6% of it remains, a few tiny islands of green, most in the state of Bahia - and even these are under threat.There are now plans by ENRC, a British-Kazakh mining company, to build a railway right through one of the few remaining areas of virgin Atlantic rainforest.ENRC's aim is to transport iron ore from a mine in the interior to the port of Iheus, despite the region being named by Unesco as a priority region for conservation.It would of course bring jobs. But for Souza, who has been battling for years to preserve this unique ecosystem, it's a slap in the face. For him the railway would be an ecological disaster for the rainforest and his beloved bushmasters.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>'Digital baby' screen for sperm donors</title>
      <description>A service that digitally weaves together the DNA of prospective parents to check for potential disease in thousands of "virtual babies" is set to launch in the US by December.</description>

      <body>A service that digitally weaves together the DNA of prospective parents to check for potential disease in thousands of "virtual babies" is set to launch in the US by December.New York start-up Genepeeks will initially focus on donor sperm, simulating before pregnancy how the genetic sequence of a female client might combine with those of different males.Donors that more often produce "digital children" with a higher risk of inherited disorders will be filtered out, leaving those who are better genetic matches.Everything happens in a computer, but experts have raised ethical questions."We are just in the business right now of giving prospective mothers, who are using donor sperm to conceive, a filtered catalogue of donors based on their own underlying genetic profile," Genepeeks co-founder Anne Morriss told BBC News."We are filtering out the donor matches with an elevated risk of rare recessive paediatric conditions."Ms Morriss, an entrepreneur, gave a presentation on the company at the Consumer Genetics Conference in Boston last week.She was motivated in part by her own experience of starting a family. Her son was conceived with a sperm donor who happened to share with Morriss the gene for an inherited disorder called MCADD.MCADD (medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency) prevents those affected from converting fats to sugar. It can be fatal if it is not diagnosed early. Luckily, in Ms Morriss's case, the condition was picked up in newborn screening tests."My son has a pretty normal life," Ms Morriss said, "but about 30% of children with rare genetic diseases don't make it past the age of five."Genepeeks has formalised a partnership with a sperm bank - the Manhattan Cryobank - and has a patent pending on the DNA screening technology.The start-up benefits from the rapid pace of change in genetic technology.Indeed, six months ago, Genepeeks' founders decided it was able to use a superior system for DNA analysis (called "targeted exon sequencing") than the one originally envisaged - a result, says Anne Morriss, of falling costs and increased flexibility.For couples planning babies, other companies already screen one or both partners for genes that could cause disease if combined with a similar variant - so-called "carrier screening".One academic who studies the use of genetic technology commented: "This is like that, but ramped up 100,000 times."Ms Morriss's business partner, Prof Lee Silver, a geneticist and expert on bioethics at Princeton University, New Jersey, told BBC News: "We get the DNA sequence from two prospective parents. We simulate the process of reproduction, forming virtual sperm and virtual eggs. We put them together to form a hypothetical child genome."Then we can look at that hypothetical genome and - with all the tools of modern genetics - determine the risk that the genome will result in a child with disease. We're looking directly for disease and not carrier status. For each pair of people that we're going to analyse, we make 10,000 hypothetical children."The process will be run for the client and each potential donor one by one, scanning for some 600 known single-gene recessive conditions. In this way, the highest-risk pairings can be filtered out.Anne Morriss added: "At this stage our clients won't be receiving any genetic information back. We're very much focused on the practical utility of helping prospective parents who want to protect their future kids, giving them the option of additional analysis to what is currently being offered in the industry."But the company's founders have plans to expand the screening beyond single-gene recessive disorders to more complex conditions in which multiple genes play a part.Indeed, going to the trouble of simulating thousands of digital children deliberately lays the ground for this: "[It's] impossible to get towards an accurate risk calculation in any other way," said Anne Morriss.And in a video produced by the company, Prof Silver says: "My hope for the future is that any people who want to have a baby can use this technology to greatly reduce the risk of disease being expressed in their child."To some, such a prospect might appear like a step towards designer babies - until now the preserve of science fiction literature and films such as Gattaca, which envisaged a future of genetic "haves" and "have-nots".Bio-ethicists approached by the BBC said Genepeeks was a logical outcome of the increasing demand for more information when making reproductive decisions.However, some raised potential concerns about risk communication and the expansion of screening beyond rare single-gene disorders. But they suggested there were few, if any, regulatory barriers.One ethicist told BBC News: "The biggest question for me, just from the outset, is the understanding of uncertainty. Even people who have been doing genomics for years still have a hard time figuring out exactly what a risk for a particular genetic predisposition really means for a family."Gene-environment interactions can lead to people either having disease or not having disease."Dr Ewan Birney, associate director of the European Bioinformatics Institute in Hinxton, UK, echoed the point: "It's good that they're focusing on the carrier status of these rare Mendelian disorders where it's potentially more clear-cut. That said, these things are more complex than they first seem," he said."I'm sure the scientists appreciate that complexity. But when transmitting that complexity to everyday people, these things can sound more absolute than they really are."He added: "The thing I would want to stress here is just how complex this is. It's great that people are thinking of using this technology in lots of different ways, but our knowledge gap is very large."Risk communication to clients was, said Anne Morriss, "absolutely critical to anyone in this industry"."We have to be crystal clear about what we're testing for, what risks we're helping to reduce; that there's no guarantee you won't give birth to a sick child," she said.Prof Mildred Cho, associate director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics in California, raised questions over whether the sperm donor should also receive information about their genome gleaned from the screening process."Unlike hair colour, occupation or family history - those are things, presumably, the donor already knows - the thing that's different about this that I see is it could create information that the donor doesn't already have. It also has implications for the donor's other biological family members," Prof Cho told BBC News.This week it also emerged that California-based consumer genetics company 23andMe had submitted the patent on a DNA analysis tool for planning a child.Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter</body>

      <title>New shape-shifting metals discovered</title>
      <description>Scientists develop a new family of smart materials that could be used in applications ranging from space vehicles to electronics to jet engines.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24400101</url>
      <date>1380888037</date>
      <body>A new shape-changing metal crystal is reported in the journal Nature, by scientists at University of Minnesota.It is the prototype of a new family of smart materials that could be used in applications ranging from space vehicles to electronics to jet engines.Called a "martensite", the crystal has two different arrangements of atoms, switching seamlessly between them.It can change shape tens of thousands of times when heated and cooled without degrading, unlike existing technology.Currently, martensite metals are made of an alloyed mixture of nickel and titanium.They have the remarkable ability to "remember" their shape and even after being bent will return to their original form. For this, they are called "shape memory" metals.They have been used in spectacle frames and brassiere wires, but also in surgery as frameworks for shaping healing bones, and as "stents" for holding heart arteries open.Martensite metals change shape when heated or cooled through a certain temperature, when the atoms that make up their structure rearrange themselves in a sudden transformation.Some call this a "military transformation" because the rows of atoms that make up the metal crystal click into their new shape in an orderly manner.The transformation means that martensite can be used in smart mechanisms that respond to temperature change.Examples include automatic windows-openers in glasshouses, a means for automatically guiding solar panels to point at the Sun on the Hubble Space Telescope, and, very recently, in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to morph the trailing edge of the engine cowling, making it quieter when it runs hot on take-off.The pitfall of current martensites is that after repeated shape changes, they build up stresses inside that degrade them and eventually break them apart. The new alloy, made of a mixture of zinc, gold and copper, changes back and forth almost indefinitely with little internal damage, opening up a new range of applications for these types of "active materials".The aim is now to apply the lessons learned from the new metal to make a family of ceramic solids that can also be shape-switched back and forth."The real advance is to make the transformations reversible that could be applied in many situations" explains Prof Richard James, one of the authors of the study."You could make devices that convert heat to electricity directly. They could use the waste heat from computers and cell phones to recharge the battery and make them more efficient."As the material cycles through its different atomic arrangements, crystals can be seen at its surface in ever-changing patterns, looking like microscopic rivers.The structures fit together without any stress layers between them, and this seems to be the key to their longevity and potential.The new materials could also be used in improved and efficient microelectromechanical systems - energy harvesting devices, in which small vibrations can be converted directly into power.These sorts of gizmos are already used in tyre pressure-monitoring systems in cars to power the electronics in the sensors.</body>

      <title>Omani owl could be new species</title>
      <description>A team working on a bird call recording project in Oman says it has discovered a new species of owl in the region.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/24374313</url>
      <date>1380868987</date>
      <body>Ornithologists working in Oman say an owl discovered in a remote, mountainous region could be a new species.Wildlife sound-recordist Magnus Robb told BBC News that he heard the bird's call whilst trying to record the call of another type of owl.After repeated trips to the remote site, he and a colleague - naturalist and photographer Arnoud van den Berg - captured photographs of the bird.They have published their observations in the journal Dutch Birding.Mr Robb's first recordings of the bird's unfamiliar hoot were a serendipitous discovery in March of this year."I was listening through my headphones, when I suddenly heard something completely different [to the owl species I was there to record]," he told BBC News."I know the other Arabian owl sounds quite well, and this was clearly something that didn't fit."The bird call expert said he had a "good inkling straight away that this could be something new"."I even phoned a colleague a few minutes later and said, 'I think I've just discovered a new species of owl."Mr Robb, who is involved in an international project called the Sound Approach, which aims to catalogue and understand bird sound, analysed the owls' call in detail.This revealed that the bird was most likely to belong to a genus, or group of species, known as Strix.Dr Wesley Hochachka from Cornell University's lab of ornithology commented that, in the last few decades, it had become "more accepted by ornithologists, particularly in tropical areas, that new species are being discovered based on distinctively different vocalisations".The team plans to gather DNA evidence from the owl's feathers in order to confirm their find genetically.But Prof Ian Newton, a bird expert from the UK's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said he found the evidence that the team had already provided convincing."Based on the recordings of songs and calls and on the good-quality photographs, I was also convinced that it should be placed within the genus Strix, which also contains the Tawny Owl of Britain and Europe," he told BBC News.Mr Robb said he hoped eventually to name the new species the Omani owl, in honour of the Omani people."One of the reasons we've gone through this process of describing and confirming this as a new species so quickly is to get conservation for this owl as soon as possible," he explained to BBC News."Conservation can only start when this species is accepted and given some official status."He hopes to return to Oman later this year in to learn more about the owl, its habitat and its behaviour.So far, he and and his colleagues have found only seven of the birds in a single wadi in the remote, mountainous area of Oman."This suggests that it's a very rare creature indeed," he told BBC News.</body>

      <title>Pollution 'hampers bees' foraging'</title>
      <description>Honeybees' ability to find flowers could be hampered by a chemical in diesel exhaust, say scientists.</description>

      <body>Honeybees' ability to find flowers could be hampered by a chemical in diesel exhaust, say scientists.Tests showed that exhaust degraded some floral scent chemicals the bees "home in on" when they are foraging.The study, published in Scientific Reports, also revealed that a specific group of chemicals found in diesel exhaust, known as NOx, diminished the insects' response to floral scents.They say the results are evidence that air quality should be improved."We got into this, because we were aware of the impacts of airborne pollutants on human health, so it didn't seem so wild that there may be impacts that extended beyond human health," said University of Southampton neuroscientist Dr Tracey Newman, who was involved in the work.To drill down to the chemical effects of pollution on the pollinators, the researchers made a mixture of the volatile, or smelly, chemicals that make up the scent of oilseed rape.They then used a diesel-powered generator to create a mixture of air and exhaust that closely matched levels of exhaust found on a busy road, and mixed this lab-made air pollution with the floral scent mix."We saw that there was loss of two of the components [of the floral odour mixture]," Dr Newman said.The two odour chemicals that were "lost" had chemically reacted with a component of the diesel exhaust, mono-nitrogen oxide, known as NOx.Having worked out how the pollution affected the chemistry of floral scents, the team set out to discover if the bees were affected by this change."Bees need to decipher the chemical messages they're getting [from flowers] to be able to home in on the flowers they know will give the best yield [of nectar]," said Dr Newman.The pollinators, she said, learned to recognise the scents of nectar-rich flowers and this enabled them to forage more efficiently.The team carried out a test that involved teaching bees to associate the smell of a particular chemical with being given a drop of sugary liquid.Bees respond to the taste of the sugar by sticking out their tongues - just as they do when drinking nectar from a flower. So after a few trials where the scent of the odour is followed closely by a sweet drop of liquid, the bees stick out their tongues as soon as they detect the scent."Having trained a bunch of bees, we then tested to see if they would respond in the same way to the mixture that was depleted by exposure to NOx [the reactive chemical in diesel exhaust]," said Dr Newman.When these odour chemicals were degraded by NOx, the bees were much less responsive to their smell and would not stick out their tongues.Biologist and lead researcher Dr Guy Poppy added that the airborne pollution appeared to be interfering with "the complex relationship" that had evolved between plants and animals."Flowers have evolved to produce chemical mixtures that attract pollinators," he told BBC News.Dr Newman added that the study highlighted the need to reduce pollution and improve air quality, in order to protect pollinating insects as well as improve human health.The value to food production of so-called "pollination services" is estimated to be hundreds of millions of pounds per year in the UK alone.Prof James Nieh, who studies honeybee health and behaviour at the University of California San Diego, said that the research posed a "largely unexplored question"."Most research on such contaminants has focused on pesticides," he told BBC News."But bees are subject to a much wider variety of pollutants and contaminants. The influence and potential synergy of these pollutants with pesticides should be studied."</body>

      <title>Uncertainty hampering food security</title>
      <description>More than 600 scientists from around the world have gathered in the Netherlands for a food security conference, described as the first of its kind.</description>

      <body>More than 600 scientists gathered in the Netherlands for a global food security conference, described as the first of its kind.Organisers said science could help end uncertainty surrounding efforts to meet the food needs of future generations.They added that, until now, there were many policy debates on food security but there was no scientific forum for researchers to share knowledge.The next food security conference will be held in the US in 2015."A really key message from the conference for us is that we have got lots of estimates about needs of population growth etc, but at the moment we are so uncertain of the exact numbers - the uncertainty is really very high," said conference co-chairman Ken Giller, professor of plant production systems at Wageningen University."We talk about the current population being seven billion, moving to 9.2 billion in 2050 and the estimate is that we need to increase production 70% or more."But there are many different ways of addressing that. If we don't know what the problem is then we can't get started in addressing them."Appetite for changeProf Giller said there was "unprecedented interest" among the scientific community when details of the conference was first announced."We did anticipate about 250-300 people , but we actually ended up with more than 900 abstracts being submitted," he told BBC News."The conference was basically sold out - we had 600 people and that was all we could accommodate."He explained that the conference was designed to create a forum where representatives from the different branches of science could come together and discuss and debate the issues of global food security."We pulled together a science committee with the real aim to make the conference broad and to include all the main disciplines," he said."We had people on the science committee from economics, nutrition and we had people dealing with food waste, which is a very important topical issue."Prof Giller said that current estimates suggested that 30-40% of the food produced was wasted and not eaten.Other themes that were discussed at the conference included:The organisers hope that the outcomes from the four-day event in Noordwijkerhout, South Holland, will help focus the scientific world's contribution to the UN global policy system.One of the UN's eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) was to "eradicate extreme poverty and hunger" by 2015, which included the target of halving - between 1990 and 2015 - the proportion of people suffering from hunger.Assessments suggest the target is "within reach". However, a 2013 report on the progress of the MDGs warned that one in eight people remained chronically undernourished.UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has announced that he wants to build on the MDGs, replacing them with a suite of Sustainable Development Goals that will run from 2015-2030.He said one of his priorities was to "adopt globally agreed goals for food and nutrition security, mobilise all key stakeholders to provide support to smallholder farmers and food processors and bolster the resilience of communities and nations experiencing periodic food crises".Prof Giller said this presented a "wonderful opportunity for science to get directly engaged in policies and help advise governments".</body>

      <title>Worker error causes Fukushima leak</title>
      <description>Japan's crippled Fukushima nuclear plant has a new leak of radioactive water after workers overfilled a storage tank, its operator says.</description>

      <date>1380817646</date>
      <body>Japan's crippled Fukushima nuclear plant has a new leak of radioactive water after workers overfilled a storage tank, its operator says.The workers miscalculated the tank's capacity as it was tilted on unlevel ground, plant operator Tepco said.It said around 430 litres (100 gallons) of water may have leaked from the tank, and could have flowed into the sea.The plant has experienced several leaks since being crippled by an earthquake and tsunami in 2011.One of the largest leaks took place in August, when Tepco discovered a leak of at least 300 tonnes of highly radioactive water at a different part of the plant.The latest leak was discovered by workers late on Wednesday.Tepco official Masayuki Ono said: "We would like to apologise that we have to announce that we've had another leak in our tanks today.""This is partly because we've had to fill our tanks to the brim in order to deal with the difficult management of rain water overflow following [a typhoon]," he added.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said that Tepco had failed to deal with the leaks successfully."It's actually leaking so of course we can't say that [Tepco] have been properly dealing with the issue. It should not be leaking at all," he said.The 2011 disaster knocked out cooling systems to the nuclear plant's reactors, three of which melted down.Water is now being pumped in to cool the reactors, but storing the resultant large quantities of radioactive water has proved a challenge for Tepco.In September, the government said it would invest hundreds of millions of dollars into building a frozen wall around the plant to stop the leaks.</body>

      <title>Trees in ancient forest are felled</title>
      <description>The felling of diseased trees across an area the size of around 300 football pitches is taking place at Wales' largest ancient woodland.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-24386773</url>
      <date>1380916448</date>
      <body>The felling of diseased trees across an area the size of around 300 football pitches is taking place at Wales' largest ancient woodland.Larch trees at Wentwood Forest, near Newport, have become infected with the fungal disease Phytophthora ramorum.The infection can kill trees and has spread across the UK after being found in south west England four years ago.The Woodland Trust, which owns most of the forest, said the felling of the trees was essential."This is the most serious and devastating action we've had to take on our estate," said the trust's head of woodland management, Andrew Sharkey."It again highlights both the need to tackle tree disease and the importance of restoring as much of our damaged ancient woodland to make it more resilient in decades to come."Felling the infected conifers across an area of 200 hectares (500 acres) will leave the Woodland Trust with a £35,000 bill for replanting in the forest.It also hits restoration work that has been taking place since the trust bought 352 hectares (869 acres) of Wentwood in 2006."Our aim was to prevent clear felling at Wentwood from happening. However, there is no alternative," explained Rory Francis, also from the trust."We are hoping that the action will slow down the spread of the infection or perhaps halt it."Wentwood Forest is the remains of the ancient tree cover that stretched from the River Wye to the River Usk.Conifers were first introduced to the wood in 1880, and much of the forest cleared to provide timber for trenches in World War I.When it was replanted in the 1950s and 1960s, the once abundant broadleaf trees were replaced with imported conifers, ultimately damaging the forest floor and its natural formation.The forest is spread out over 400 hectares (1,000 acres) and is home to 75 species of birds, including turtle doves, nightjars and spotted flycatchers, and is a habitat for dormice, otters, and pipistrelle bats.It is also a home to wild bluebells, wood sorrel and wild daffodils."Every time you have to clear-fell, the risk is that the shock of the sudden change in conditions stresses some of the native species and they could be lost," said Mr Francis."So in the short term, it will have a negative impact. We don't want to do it but it is a legal requirement."Natural Resources Wales (NRW), which manages most of the remaining forest, said it had already invested £500,000 across Wales to halt the spread of the infection, and was setting aside another £2m to tackle the problem.The disease has recently been discovered at Bwlch Nant-yr-Arian near Aberystwyth and at Cwmcarn Forest Drive in Caerphilly county borough.The infection has also spread to parts of north Wales, at Coed Maentwrog near Porthmadog, and at Coed Cymerau near Blaenau Ffestiniog.It has also affected larches across south west England, Northern Ireland and the west of Scotland."The felling in Wentwood Forest is very sad but this prompt action by the Woodland Trust is essential to try to slow the spread of this devastating disease," said John Browne, from NRW."Our ultimate aim is to make our forests more resilient to pests and diseases and we are heartened that the Woodland Trust is to seize this opportunity to undertake change of structure and species within Wentwood Forest by planting native broadleaves."The felled larch trees will be replaced with a mix of oak and cherry trees, and other broadleaf native trees."In some ways it will actually accelerate the work to plant native trees, but it is not in the circumstances we would have preferred," added the trust's Mr Francis.</body>

      <title>Top five physics discoveries chosen</title>
      <description>Quantum computers and science that could enable mobile phone shoe chargers are among the top physics spin-offs chosen by a leading magazine.</description>

      <body>Five physics discoveries with the potential to transform the world have been selected by a leading science magazine for its 25th birthday issue.Quantum computing and science that could enable shoes to charge a mobile phone are among the list compiled by Physics World.A potential new tumour treatment called hadron therapy and the "wonder-material" graphene also feature.The magazine also picked its top five breakthroughs of the last 25 years.In all, the publication compiled five lists of five to examine different aspects of physics.Graphene has been one of the most talked-about discoveries in the last decade.Its strength, flexibility and conductivity make it a potentially ideal material for bendable smartphones and superior prosthetic limbs.But graphene has another, less-heralded property which could help it transform the everyday lives of people around the world.Despite being just one atom thick, it is impervious to almost all liquids and gases.Generating holes in sheets of graphene could therefore create a selective membrane - "the ultimate water purifier" - which might someday create drinking water from the sea."Predicting the future is a mug's game. Of course, we expect to get a few of them wrong," Hamish Johnston, editor of physicsworld.com told BBC News."Grandiose, utopian predictions that never materialise always look faintly ridiculous in years to come - have you seen anyone recently flying to work on a nuclear-powered jet-pack?"Physics World is the monthly magazine of the Institute of Physics and was first published in October 1988.Selecting the five most important breakthroughs of its lifetime was "harder than choosing Nobel laureates", according to reporter Tushna Commissariat."There have been so many eye-popping findings that our final choice is, inevitably, open to debate," she wrote."Yet for us, these five discoveries stand out above all others as having done the most to transform our understanding of the world."They are, in chronological order:The magazine's 25th anniversary issue also highlights five images that have allowed us to "see" a physical phenomenon or effect.They range from the microscopic - electrons on a copper crystal - to the enormous - the Cat's Eye Nebula, as photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope.The list of five "biggest unanswered questions" features some eternal riddles - "is life on Earth unique?" Another is: "what exactly is time?"The final top five is a set of "fiendish physics-themed puzzles" devised by the British signals intelligence agency GCHQ.The first has already appeared online - a jumbled set of letters on a page which need to be deciphered before arriving at a physics-themed answer.A similar puzzle was recently used by GCHQ to attract potential employees.It will be followed by another four problems, one per week throughout October, which will become progressively more challenging."We think the puzzles are going to really stretch even the brightest minds," says Matin Durrani, editor of Physics World."You won't need any physics to solve them, but they are certainly going to make you think and they're a fun way to celebrate our 25th anniversary."I also hope our top fives in the birthday issue will remind everyone just how vital, enjoyable and interesting physics can be."</body>

      <title>Health of oceans 'declining fast'</title>
      <description>The health of the world’s oceans is deteriorating even faster than scientists previously thought, a report says.</description>

      <date>1380777580</date>
      <body>The health of the world’s oceans is deteriorating even faster than had previously been thought, a report says.A review from the International Programme on the State of the Ocean (IPSO), warns that the oceans are facing multiple threats.They are being heated by climate change, turned slowly less alkaline by absorbing CO2, and suffering from overfishing and pollution.The report warns that dead zones formed by fertiliser run-off are a problem.It says conditions are ripe for the sort of mass extinction event that has afflicted the oceans in the past.It says: “We have been taking the ocean for granted. It has been shielding us from the worst effects of accelerating climate change by absorbing excess CO2 from the atmosphere.“Whilst terrestrial temperature increases may be experiencing a pause, the ocean continues to warm regardless. For the most part, however, the public and policymakers are failing to recognise - or choosing to ignore - the severity of the situation.”It says the cocktail of threats facing the ocean is more powerful than the individual problems themselves.Coral reefs, for instance, are suffering from the higher temperatures and the effects of acidification whilst also being weakened by bad fishing practices, pollution, siltation and toxic algal blooms.IPSO, funded by charitable foundations, is publishing a set of five papers based on workshops in 2011 and 2012 in partnership with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN’s) World Commission on Protected Areas.The reports call for world governments to halt CO2 increase at 450ppm. Any higher, they say, will cause massive acidification later in the century as the CO2 is absorbed into the sea.It urges much more focused fisheries management, and a priority list for tackling the key groups of chemicals that cause most harm.It wants the governments to negotiate a new agreement for the sustainable fishing in the high oceans to be policed by a new global high seas enforcement agency.The IUCN’s Prof Dan Laffoley said: "What these latest reports make absolutely clear is that deferring action will increase costs in the future and lead to even greater, perhaps irreversible, losses."The UN climate report confirmed that the ocean is bearing the brunt of human-induced changes to our planet. These findings give us more cause for alarm – but also a roadmap for action. We must use it."The co-coordinator, Prof Alex Rogers from Oxford University has been asked to advise the UN's own oceans assessment but he told BBC News he had led the IPSO initiative because: "It’s important to have something which is completely independent in any way from state influence and to say things which experts in the field felt was really needed to be said."He said concern had grown over the past year thanks to papers signalling that past extinctions had involved warming seas, acidification and low oxygen levels. All are on the rise today.He agreed there was debate on whether fisheries are recovering by better management following examples in the US and Europe, but said it seemed clear that globally they were not.He also admitted a debate about whether overall climate change would increase the amount of fish produced in the sea. Melting sea ice would increase fisheries near the poles whilst stratification of warmer waters in the tropics would reduce mixing of nutrients and lead to lower production, he said.He said dead zones globally appeared to be increasing although this may reflect increased reporting."On ocean acidification, we are seeing effects that no-one predicted like the inability of fish to detect their environments properly. It’s clear that it will affect many species. We really do have to get a grip on what’s going on in the oceans," he said.Follow Roger on Twitter</body>

      <body>A contract to build the UK's first nuclear plant in a generation is said to be "within weeks" of completion.Energy Minister Michael Fallon told the Financial Times he was "working intensely" to seal a deal for the £14bn Hinkley Point C reactor in Somerset.Long negotiations have taken place with France's EDF over the price it could charge for the electricity generated.Government approval to build the first in a planned set of new nuclear sites in the UK was granted in March."We're not quite there yet, but I hope we will be in the next few weeks," Mr Fallon told the FT.Talks between EDF and the government to agree on a contract stalled earlier this year over the guaranteed price at which the electricity could be sold.China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group has a co-operation agreement with EDF and could claim a stake of up to 49% in the project, the FT reports.The government's plan to meet its emissions reduction and renewable energy targets were outlined in last year's Energy Bill.It hopes the UK can become more self-sufficient in its energy by increasing the use of both nuclear and wind power, as well as other forms of clean sources such as biomass.He suggested the deal with EDF, which has not commented on the reports, would pave the way for further negotiations on new nuclear plants planned by Japan's Hitachi in Anglesey and Oldbury, in Gloucestershire.There is also said to be interest in further investment in the UK's nuclear sector from companies in South Korea, China and Japan.Mr Fallon said: "There's intense interest there because people can see that finally we're getting our civil nuclear programme moving again after the long, dead Labour years."However, environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth have raised concerns over the potentially high price for electricity the government will agree to in order to get the new plants built, and the issue of nuclear waste.Hinkley Point C will be the third nuclear plant at the Somerset site and will have the potential to provide power for five million homes.Hinkley A, which is now being decommissioned, began generating in 1965 and was closed down in 1999. Hinkley B, which started generating in 1976, is due to be turned off in 2023.The last nuclear plant built in the UK was Sizewell B in Suffolk, completed in 1995.</body>

      <title>Roman skulls washed down lost river</title>
      <description>Archaeologists working with London's Crossrail project uncover 20 skulls believed to be from the Roman period.</description>

      <date>1380677812</date>
      <body>Archaeologists working with London's Crossrail project have uncovered 20 skulls believed to be from the Roman period.It is likely the bones were washed from a nearby burial site along one of London's "lost" rivers - the Walbrook.In the last year archaeologists in London have also found about 10,000 Roman items at a nearby site.These latest finds could give new insights into the lives of Roman people.Near-intact pottery artefacts were also found which probably travelled along the same route as the skulls. Other bone fragments would not have been washed as easily down the river.Paved over in the 15th Century, the Walbrook river divided the western and eastern parts of the city, its moist muddy walls providing exceptionally good conditions for artefacts to be preserved.The discoveries were found about 3m below ground and underneath the the Bedlam cemetery, a burial ground where hundreds of skeletons have been unearthed.Though they have yet to be forensically dated, Nicholas Elsden from the Museum of London Archaeology said they were likely to be from the 3rd to 4th Centuries AD, as that was when Romans buried their citizens as opposed to cremating them."It's relatively unusual to find so many concentrated [in one area] when you're not in a graveyard. We're 100 yards outside the Roman city walls."Roman law required burial outside the city, explained Mr Elsden, which meant there were burial sites circled around the town."What we're looking at here is how the Romans viewed their dead. You wouldn't imagine modern burial grounds being allowed to wash out into a river," he told BBC News.Don Walker, an osteologist also from the Museum of London Archaeology, said the skulls were probably buried in different environments, shown by their shades of brown and grey."Forensic studies show that when the body disintegrates near a watercourse, the skull travels furthest, either because it floats or it can roll along the base of the river."They were possibly buried in an area where there wasn't much land available. At the moment it looks as though they've collected together through natural processes."From initial observations, Mr Walker said there was no evidence of any "foul play", but details about their sex and age would only emerge through further investigations.He added that chemical markers on the teeth could reveal where these people came from and what sorts of food they ate.Archaeologists believe that the Crossrail Project will lead to further discoveries hidden beneath the streets of London and say it could transform our understanding of Roman London.Other recent findings include several bodies believed to date from the time of the Black Death and wood thought to be evidence of a 3,500-year-old Bronze Age transport route through London.Crossrail currently operates over 40 worksites and archaeological investigations are carried out at each site ahead of main construction works to build the central stations.The project will connect 37 stations from Heathrow Airport and Maidenhead in the west, through central London and out to Abbey Wood and Shenfield in the east and is due to be completed in 2018.</body>

      <title>Body clock 'reset button' found</title>
      <description>The prospect of drugs to rapidly reset the body clock to avoid jet lag and the pains of shift work has moved a step close after research in Japan.</description>

      <body>Drugs that rapidly tweak the body clock in order to avoid jet lag and the pains of shift work have moved a step closer after research in Japan.The team at Kyoto University has found the clock's 'reset button' inside the brain.Their study, published in the journal Science, showed the button could be used to switch the clock to a new time zone in a single day.Experts said the team was "close to the money" in the hunt for a jet lag cure.There are clocks throughout the body and a "master clock" in the brain, keeping the body in sync with the world around it to make people sleepy at night.Anyone who has ever done shift work or a long-haul flight has experienced the disrupted sleep and hunger patterns of a body clock which is out of tune with the rising and setting of the sun.The clock uses light to help keep track of time, but it is naturally stubborn and adjusts slowly.The rough rule is that for every time zone crossed it takes a full day for the body to catch up. Fly from London to Beijing and it would take a week for the body clock to fully adapt.The team in Japan have come up with a way to get the master clock to be a bit more flexible.It is a group of 10,000 brain cells - about the same size as a grain of rice - which constantly talk to each other to keep a strict control over the time.The scientists found that interfering with the vasopressin receptors, essentially a brain cell's ears that allow it to keep in touch with its neighbours, let the clock shift rapidly.Genetically modified mice which had no vasopressin receptors were able to adjust to the clocks being put back eight hours within a single day, while normal mice took six days.When the clocks were put forward eight hours then it took normal mice eight days to adapt, but those without vasopressin receptors adjusted in two.Similar results were then achieved in normal mice using a drug.The study's authors concluded: "Studies have shown that chronic jet lag and rotating shift work can increase an individual's risk of developing hypertension, obesity, and other metabolic disorders."Our results identify vasopressin signalling as a possible therapeutic target for the management of circadian rhythm [body clock] misalignment."Dr Michael Hastings, a Medical Research Council body clock researcher, told the BBC's Science in Action programme: "It's a remarkable study, it really is very exciting for our field."There's been many false dawns when it comes to a cure for jet lag, but I think this time they're close to the money."However, he cautioned that vasopressin receptors were also heavily involved in kidney function so any drug developed would need to be designed carefully to target the body clock without disrupting the kidneys.Dr Hastings added that with an increasingly 24-7 society a drug which can adjust the body clock could, in theory, improve the health of shift workers."The issue here in terms of public health is rotational shift work, the epidemiological evidence that we have now shows that if a worker has spent a working life doing rotational shift work they're at higher risk of contracting certain forms of cancer, cardiovascular disease or metabolic syndrome like diabetes."</body>

      <title>Supervolcanoes ripped up early Mars</title>
      <description>Early Mars may have been wracked by giant explosive volcanoes that spewed billions upon billions of tonnes of rock and ash into the sky.</description>

      <date>1380733767</date>
      <body>Mars may have had giant explosive volcanoes in its ancient past that spewed billions upon billions of tonnes of rock and ash into the sky.Vast areas of collapsed ground in a region of the planet called Arabia Terra are their likely remains, believe Joe Michalski and Jacob Bleacher.The two scientists report their findings in this week's Nature journal.They say such supervolcanoes would have had a profound impact on the early evolution of Mars.Their gases would have influenced the make-up of the atmosphere and perturbed the climate. And the ashfall would have covered the landscape across great swathes of the planet. It is quite likely some of the deposits the rovers are now encountering on Mars have their origin in colossal blasts."Scientists know the planet must have been more active in its deep past, in its first billion years. But we've always struggled to find evidence for these early volcanoes. The supervolcanoes we report in Nature may solve this puzzle," said Dr Michalski, who is affiliated to the Natural History Museum in London, and the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona.Supervolcano is an informal term to describe an immense eruptive event that expels in excess of a 1,000 cu km of rock and ash.Earth has experienced this type of cataclysm numerous times, although not for many thousands of years. The US Yellowstone National Park, for example, sits on top of a past supervolcano.But these behemoths are not so straightforward to identify.Unlike, familiar volcanoes - such as Etna or St Helens on Earth, or indeed Olympus Mons on Mars - supervolcanoes do not build mountains out of layers of lava. Rather, their great scale means that, when they erupt, the whole landscape lets go with multiple vents and fissures. And after the eruption, the ground will fall back into the void left by all the ejected material, producing a large bowl or caldera.Michalski and Bleacher, from Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center, have identified a number of potential supervolcanoes in an area of Mars's northern hemisphere known as Arabia Terra. It is assumed to be one of the oldest terrains on the planet.The researchers say their calderas are unlikely to be old meteorite impacts sites because they are irregular in shape, and lack the raised rim and central peak often found at impact craters. Neither do they have an apron of ejected material, another classic impact trait."Our best example is Eden Patera," Dr Michalski told the BBC's Science In Action programme."Thousands of cubic kilometres of material would have been erupted, and that's a minimum. In terms of size, it would be very similar to Yellowstone - about 70km across. So, imagine driving for an hour; it would take you most of that time to get across this hole in the ground."The supervolcanoes' gases would certainly have influenced the composition of the early atmosphere and the evolution of the climate thereafter. But they may also have had an impact on Mars' potential for habitability, by pulling up substantial quantities of water and the essential elements needed for life from deep inside the planet.These are ideas that can be tested by Nasa's Curiosity rover, which is heading for a large mountain in the middle of Gale Crater on Mars' equator.No-one knows how this mountain formed, but some fraction of its layers may well be ashfall, possibly from the Arabia Terra supervolcanoes; and if not these particular volcanoes then perhaps other giants that have yet to be identified in satellite images."If future work shows that supervolcanoes were present more widely on ancient Mars, it would completely change estimates of how the atmosphere formed from volcanic gases, how sediments formed from volcanic ash and how habitable the surface might have been," emphasised Dr Michalski.Commenting on the research, Mars expert Dr Peter Grindrod, from Birkbeck, University of London, said: "Understanding ancient terrains on Earth is extremely difficult because of subsequent processes hiding or removing the evidence - attempting to understand the earliest periods of Mars' history is even more challenging, as in addition we are limited to data returned from spacecraft."However, this study is a fascinating example of just what can be achieved with data from recent missions. This study is important because, if correct, it not only tells us something about Mars' early geological history, but can also help explain the source of later sedimentary deposits, many of which are important in studies of habitability on Mars."And planetary geologist Dr Dave Rothery, from the Open University, proffered: "It is entirely plausible that the few, slightly anomalous, large craters that Michalski and Bleacher have highlighted are volcanic rather than impact craters. If so, then their size would suggest that they could well have erupted in the style of supervolcanoes on Earth."We know that such eruptions have had profound but short-lived effects on the Earth's climate."Were such an event to happen on Mars, it could either cool the globe (because of a global ash and aerosol cloud) or warm it (because of erupted greenhouse gases). The latter could lead to episodes of surface water flow, responsible for carving some of the medium-size valley systems on Mars."Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos</body>

      <title>Plastic ingredient spied on Titan</title>
      <description>The Cassini probe detects propene - a common constituent of common Earth plastics - on Saturn's moon Titan.</description>

      <date>1380622324</date>
      <body>The Cassini probe has detected propene, or propylene, on Saturn's moon Titan.On Earth, this molecule, which comprises three carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms, is a constituent of many plastics.It is the first definitive detection of the plastic ingredient on any moon or planet, other than our home world, says the US space agency (Nasa).The discovery, made by Cassini's infrared spectrometer, is reported in Astrophysical Journal Letters."This chemical is all around us in everyday life, strung together in long chains to form a plastic called polypropylene," said Conor Nixon, a Nasa planetary scientist from the agency's Goddard Space Flight Center. A classic example would be the plastic boxes used to store food in kitchens worldwide.Titan is dominated by hydrocarbons - principally methane, which after nitrogen is the most common component of the atmosphere.Sunlight drives reactions that break apart the methane, allowing the fragments to join up and form even bigger molecules.Other common species seen at the moon as a result are propane, which on Earth is used in portable cooking equipment, and ethane, which is the raw material for another ubiquitous plastic - polyethylene.But the likes of methane, propene, propane and ethane are dwarfed by some truly colossal hydrocarbons that have been detected in Titan's atmosphere.When the effects of ultraviolet light are combined with the bombardment from particles driven in Saturn's magnetic field, it becomes possible to cook up some very exotic chemistry.Cassini's plasma spectrometer has seen evidence for hydrocarbons with an atomic mass thousands of times heavier than a single hydrogen atom.</body>

      <title>Cygnus freighter reaches station</title>
      <description>The new Cygnus cargo ship arrives at the International Space Station carrying about 700kg of food and other supplies for the platform's astronauts.</description>

      <body>The new Cygnus freighter has arrived at the International Space Station (ISS) carrying about 700kg (1,500lb) of food and other supplies.Astronauts on the platform reached out with a robotic arm and grabbed the vessel at 11:00 GMT.Cygnus is on a demonstration mission to prove its technology.It is one of two commercial ventures seeded by Nasa to pick up America's ISS re-supply requirements following the retirement of the space shuttles.The new vehicle, developed by the Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC), made its approach using a mix of GPS, inertial navigation and lidar.It parked itself a little over 10m under the station, within reach of the Canadarm2.Operated by astronauts Italian Luca Parmitano and American Karen Nyberg, the robotic limb then grappled the freighter, pulling it into the ISS's Harmony module.Capture - the securing of bolts mating Cygnus to Harmony - occurred at 1244 GMT, when the ISS was moving over the Indian Ocean.Cygnus has arrived at the station a week later than planned after an initial attempt last Sunday encountered software problems.This left the freighter unable to establish the correct communications and navigation links with the space station.Cygnus was commanded to loiter more than 2,000km from the ISS while engineers developed, tested and uploaded a patch. The arrival mid-week of a new crew at the station then pushed the second berthing attempt back even further.Astronauts will wait a day before entering the freighter to start removing its stores.The current schedule calls for Cygnus to stay at the platform for about a month, after which it will be sent into a destructive dive into the atmosphere.Nasa is attempting to hand over routine human spaceflight operations in low-Earth orbit to commercial industry, in a way similar to how some large organisations contract out their IT or payroll.The carriage of freight is the first service to be bought in from external suppliers; the transport of astronauts to and from the station will be the second, later this decade.The US space agency hopes these arrangements will save it money that can then be invested in exploration missions far beyond Earth, to destinations such as asteroids and Mars.To this end, it offered Orbital a series of incentive payments to help it develop a cargo-delivery system, with the carrot of a bumper, eight-flight, $1.9bn (£1.2bn) operational contract once it was up and working.Nasa has also seeded California's SpaceX company in the development of its Dragon capsule. This vehicle has already completed two missions in a 12-flight, $1.6bn contract.Cygnus has significant European involvement. The pressurised vessel that holds the cargo is produced in Turin, Italy, by Thales Alenia Space (TAS).Its design is based on the logistics modules that TAS produced for the space shuttles when the orbiters ran cargo deliveries to the station.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos</body>

      <title>Distant planet's clouds are mapped</title>
      <description>Astronomers have created the first map of the clouds on a planet outside our Solar System.</description>

      <date>1380624354</date>
      <body>Astronomers have created the first map of the clouds on a planet outside our Solar System.The planet in question is Kepler-7b, a large gaseous world like Jupiter, roughly 1,000 light-years away.The researchers used data from Nasa's Spitzer and Kepler space telescopes to study the exoplanet, which orbits close to its parent star.Their results suggest the hot giant is marked by high clouds in the west and clear skies in the east.The findings have been accepted for publication in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters."By observing this planet with Spitzer and Kepler for more than three years, we were able to produce a very low-resolution 'map' of this giant, gaseous planet," said co-author Brice-Olivier Demory of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, US."We wouldn't expect to see oceans or continents on this type of world, but we detected a clear, reflective signature that we interpreted as clouds."Astronomers have previously been able to make temperature maps of planets orbiting other stars, but this is the first look at cloud structures on a distant world. Kepler-7b is something of an oddity - bigger than Jupiter, but lower in mass - with a density about the same as polystyrene.The Kepler telescope's visible-light observations of this distant world's moon-like phases led to a rough map of the planet that showed a bright spot on its western hemisphere. But these data were not enough on their own to decipher whether the bright spot was coming from clouds or heat.So the team used Spitzer to gather further clues about the planet's atmosphere. They determined that light from the planet's star was bouncing off cloud tops located on the west side of Kepler-7b."Kepler-7b reflects much more light than most giant planets we've found, which we attribute to clouds in the upper atmosphere," said Thomas Barclay from Nasa's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, US, who works on the Kepler telescope team."Unlike those on Earth, the cloud patterns on this planet do not seem to change much over time - it has a remarkably stable climate."Nasa says the findings are an early step towards using similar techniques to study the atmospheres of exoplanets that are more like Earth in composition and size.Paul Hertz, director of Nasa's astrophysics division in Washington DC commented: "We're at a point now in exoplanet science where we are moving beyond just detecting [them], and into the exciting science of understanding them."The Kepler mission has now ended because of problems with the spacecraft's reaction wheels - the spinning components that aid fine-pointing of the satellite. But astronomers are still studying the data it gathered; the mission has so far discovered more than 150 bona fide exoplanets and thousands of other candidate worlds.</body>

      <title>Turbines 'threaten' Dark Sky Park</title>
      <description>Astronomers and land charities warn that Britain's only Dark Sky Park is being threatened by applications for wind turbines.</description>

      <date>1380501539</date>
      <body>Astronomers and land charities have warned that Britain's only Dark Sky Park is being threatened by applications for wind turbines.Galloway Forest Dark Sky Park secured its status in 2009.But the Astronomer Royal for Scotland, the John Muir Trust and the Scottish Wild Land Group have written to the Scottish government, asking it to rule out wind farms in the vicinity.There have been nine proposals for turbines near the park's observatory.These include plans from energy companies such as E.ON and RWE npower renewables, among others.Mark Gibson, chairman of the board of trustees of the Scottish Dark Sky Observatory, said that while some applications had been rejected, having one approved could open the door for further development.Ministry of Defence and Aviation Authority safety requirements mean that wind turbines must be illuminated by infra-red light and, in some areas used regularly for training or search and rescue, visible light illumination may also be needed.Turbines near the park could fall into the latter category, and the campaigners said it would affect both the ability of astronomers to use sensitive equipment, and the visibility of stars, galaxies, comets and northern lights.The group has called for the park to be given protection similar to that afforded to areas of wild land, and has called on the Scottish government to update planning policy to rule out the construction of wind farms around the park.The facility is the only Dark Sky Park in Britain - although both Exmoor and the Brecon Beacons national parks have been awarded Dark Sky Reserve status - and is home to the world's only publicly accessible, research-grade observatory within a Gold Tier Dark Sky Park.The observatory was officially opened by First Minister Alex Salmond last year.Prof John Brown, Astronomer Royal for Scotland, said: "Installing any large structures that require illumination (whether visible or infra-red) would be akin to putting a factory in Glen Coe or electricity pylons along the Cuillin Ridge."Our first minister was instrumental in helping to secure funding for the observatory and he opened it with much passion and aplomb in October last, praising Scotland for leading the world with this fine public and educational facility."But Mr Salmond is also an ardent advocate of wind farms and so faces a dilemma."I, for one, would call upon him now to prove his sincere interest in our wild lands and skies by ensuring wind farms and other dark sky contaminants are excluded from the entire Galloway Forest Dark Sky Park."This would lay down a benchmark for future decisions on all similar wild land sites where wind farms are wholly inappropriate."However, Jeremy Sainsbury of the renewable energy consultancy, Natural Power, said studies had shown that the type of beacons used did not contribute in any significant way to light pollution."This is low level background infra-red - visible to pilots but it does not penetrate the upper atmosphere," he said."It only stays within the clutter of the lower atmosphere so is very, very localised to wind turbines."He said wind farm and studies had confirmed this to be the case.A Scottish government spokesman said: "The Scottish government consulted on the draft Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) earlier this year."It included proposals to guide local authorities in the preparation of spatial frameworks for wind energy development."We received a large number of responses to the consultation, including many views on onshore wind, and will take these responses into account when we publish the finalised SPP next year."</body>

      <title>Mystery eruption traced to Indonesia</title>
      <description>Scientists think they have found the volcano responsible for a huge eruption in the 13th Century that perturbed the climate worldwide.</description>

      <body>Scientists think they have found the volcano responsible for a huge eruption that occurred in the 13th Century.The mystery event in 1257 was so large its chemical signature is recorded in the ice of both the Arctic and the Antarctic.European medieval texts talk of a sudden cooling of the climate, and of failed harvests.In the PNAS journal, an international team points the finger at the Samalas Volcano on Lombok Island, Indonesia.Little remains of the original mountain structure - just a huge crater lake.The team has tied sulphur and dust traces in the polar ice to a swathe of data gathered in the Lombok region itself, including radiocarbon dates, the type and spread of ejected rock and ash, tree-rings, and even local chronicles that recall the fall of the Lombok Kingdom sometime in the 13th Century."The evidence is very strong and compelling," Prof Clive Oppenheimer, from Cambridge University, UK, told the BBC's Science In Action programme.Co-worker Prof Franck Lavigne, from the Pantheon-Sorbonne University, France, added: "We conducted something similar to a criminal investigation."We didn't know the culprit at first, but we had the time of the murder and the fingerprints in the form of the geochemistry in the ice cores, and that allowed us to track down the volcano responsible."The 1257 eruption has been variously linked with volcanoes in Mexico, Ecuador and New Zealand.But these candidates fail on their dating or geochemistry, the researchers say. Only Samalas can "tick all the boxes".The team's studies on Lombok indicate that as much 40 cubic kilometres (10 cubic miles) of rock and ash could have been hurled from the volcano, and that the finest material in the eruption plume would likely have climbed 40km (25 miles) or more into the sky.It would have had to be this big in order for material to be carried across the entire globe in the quantities seen in the Greenland and Antarctic ice layers.The impact on the climate would have been significant.Medieval texts describe atrocious weather the following summer in 1258. It was cold, and the rain was unrelenting, leading to flooding.Archaeologists recently put a date of 1258 on the skeletons of thousands of people who were buried in mass graves in London."We cannot say for sure these two events are linked but the populations would definitely have been stressed," Prof Lavigne told BBC News.In comparison with recent catastrophic blasts, Samalas was at least as big as Krakatoa (1883) and Tambora (1815), the researchers believe.The ice cores do hold clues to yet another colossal event in about 1809, but, like Samalas before it, finding the source volcano has been difficult.Prof Oppenheimer said: "It's outstanding that we haven't come across evidence for it. Where in the world could you bury such bad news?"Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos</body>

      <title>Baby born after ovaries 'reawakened'</title>
      <description>Doctors say they have made a breakthrough in helping women who had a very early menopause to have children, with one baby born and another expected.</description>

      <date>1380569780</date>
      <body>A baby has been born through a new technique to "reawaken" the ovaries of women who had a very early menopause.Doctors in the US and Japan developed the technique to remove the ovaries, activate them in the laboratory and re-implant fragments of ovarian tissue.The technique, reported in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, has resulted in one baby being born, with another expected.The findings were described as early, but a "potential game-changer".The 27 women involved in the study became infertile around the age of 30 due to "primary ovarian insufficiency". The condition affects one in 100 women who essentially run out of eggs too young, leading to an early menopause.Women have a fixed number of eggs at birth and those with the condition tend to use them up too quickly or are born with far fewer eggs in the first place.Eggs in the ovaries are not fully formed; rather, they stay as follicles and some mature each month.The teams at Stanford University, US, and St Marianna University School of Medicine, Japan, were trying to activate the last few remaining follicles, which may be present.They removed the ovaries from the women and used a combination of two techniques to wake up the sleeping follicles. First they cut the ovaries into fragments, which has been used in the past as a fertility treatment. Then a chemical to "take the brakes off" egg development was applied.The fragments were put back at the top of the fallopian tubes and the women were given hormone therapy.Following the treatment, residual follicles started to develop in eight women. Eggs were taken for normal IVF and so far one couple has had a baby and another woman is pregnant.Prof Aaron Hsueh, from Stanford, told the BBC: "It has to be improved to figure out the best way to do it, but we estimate it could help 25 to 30% of the women."We think it could help in two other forms of infertility. Cancer survivors after chemotherapy or radiotherapy; if there's any follicles left there's a chance this will help."And also women aged 40 to 45 with an irregular menstrual cycle."The implications for women with early menopause are still unclear as the technique will require further testing and refinement before it could be used in clinics.Prof Charles Kingsland, from Liverpool Women's Hospital and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: "It's really clever, but will it work for everyone? We don't know."It's potentially really, really, interesting, but we need a lot more investigation to confirm this is not another false dawn."I will see primary ovarian insufficiency on a regular basis in my clinic so if it's effective in the long term, it's something we'd be interested in."Prof Nick Macklon, from the University of Southampton, told the BBC: "Finding a new way to get new eggs by waking up sleeping follicles is very promising. It's potentially a game-changer."It's a very important and very exciting piece of science, but it is not ready for the clinic. It still needs good randomised control trial data."He added that performing the technique outside of a research study would be unfeasible, but a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of egg development could lead to new medications.</body>

      <title>Earlier origin for flowering plants</title>
      <description>Flowering plants may have originated more than 100 million years earlier than previously thought, scientists suggest.</description>

      <body>Flowering plants may have originated more than 100 million years earlier than previously thought, according to scientists in Switzerland and Germany.The previously oldest known flowering plant-like pollen dates from the Early Cretaceous period.But the team described six types of fossil pollen grains from older Middle Triassic core samples that closely resemble these earliest examples.The research is published in the journal Frontiers in Plant Science.Flowering plants - also known as angiosperms - are the most numerous and diverse group of seed-producing plants on land.All seed-producing plants make pollen, with each grain enclosing the developing male cell used in sexual reproduction."That's why plants developed a very tough and resistant wall of organic matter to protect them," explained Professor Peter Hochuli from the University of Zurich, Switzerland."In the fossil record we find only this protective wall of the pollen grains."Based on the increase in abundance and diversity of flowering plants during the Early Cretaceous - approximately 140 million years ago - it has been assumed that they originated in this period.In the older Triassic samples, Prof Hochuli and his team used confocal laser scanning microscopy to obtain high resolution, three-dimensional images and identified six distinct types of fossilised flowering plant-like pollen based on size, patterning and structure."With a few differences...the pollen from the Middle Triassic look exactly the same as the angiosperm pollen from the Early Cretaceous," explained Prof Hochuli.Taken with previous reports of pollen in Triassic sediment from the Barents Sea with similar features to these suggests that flowering plants originated over a 100 million years earlier in the Middle Triassic period - circa 243 million years ago."The number of species found in Switzerland and the from the Barents Sea suggest a rather high diversity and that the group might originate from the Early Triassic or the Late Palaeozoic era," he said.However, this does leave a period of 100 million years for which there are no records of flowering plant-like pollen."I think part of it is a gap in the observation, one finds what is already known. Without my experience from the Barents Sea, I think I would have missed the few tiny grains," Prof Hochuli told BBC Nature.As the described pollen grains were rare, making up less than 1% of the pollen count, they cannot tell us much about the period's climate.But according to Prof Hochuli: "The accompanying pollen assemblages tell us that during the Middle Triassic the climate was warm/hot and arid in Central Europe/Switzerland and still warm, but more humid in the Barents Sea area."In the future they could go on to describe these pollen types as new species. But Prof Hochuli is more interested in finding evidence from other places and from even older sediments, such as the Early Triassic, "that's our next step".</body>

      <body>Bangladesh has begun building the first of two new nuclear power plants north of the capital, Dhaka.The plants - each with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts - are being constructed with Russian help as Bangladesh looks to close a yawning power deficit.Inaugurating the project, PM Sheikh Hasina said that "utmost priority" would be given to nuclear safety".The $2bn project is funded by $500m of Russian credit and is expected to be fully completed by 2022.Prime Minister Hasina said the plant would be constructed so that natural disasters could not damage or destroy it."Regarding the design of the plant, we are following the guidelines of the International Atomic Energy Agency," she said.The plants will implement new safety features following the nuclear accident in Fukushima in Japan, officials say.Under the terms of the construction deal, Russia's state-run Rosatom nuclear energy corporation will build, operate and provide fuel for the plant in addition to processing its spent fuel in Russia.Correspondents say that the project is part of an export drive backed by Russian President Vladimir Putin that includes Rosatom building plants in Iran and Turkey.The reactors at Rooppur in Pabna district, 120km (75 miles) north of Dhaka, are expected to operate for 60 years with options to extend by another 20 years.Bangladesh currently relies on dilapidated gas-fired plants for its power supplies and experiences daily electricity shortfalls.Erratic electricity supplies have been blamed for hampering industrial production and economic growth.</body>

      <body>Attacks by hornets in northern China have killed 41 people since July, state-run media report.More than 1,600 people have also been injured by stings in Shaanxi province, according to China News Agency.It says 206 people are still being treated in hospital, with 37 patients remaining in a critical condition.Local officials have been quoted as saying that drier and warmer weather this year may have contributed to a rise in hornet numbers in the area.Environmental activists have also blamed rapid urbanisation for worsening the problem as more rural land is swallowed up for urban development, intruding into habitats where hornets hunt and build their nests.The cities of Angkang, Hanzhong and Shangluo have been worst affected by the spate of attacks over the past three months.The provincial government has dispatched pest control experts to help deal with the situation.China News Agency says local police and fire-fighters have been given equipment and protective clothes to help remove and destroy hornet nests.Hornet attacks are a recurring problem in Shaanxi province in particular, but the authorities have released no casualty figures for previous years.Zhao Fang, a city government official in Ankong, told the China Daily newspaper that hornet attacks had increased in recent years as the "local ecological environment improved".Winters have been getting milder and summers hotter and more humid in Shaanxi, which may have helped caused hornet numbers there to rise.The Chinese term for hornets is "hu feng" - those behind the deadly attacks this summer appear to be the Asian giant hornet, or Vespa mandarinia.They can grow up to 5cm long with a 6mm sting.The area is also home to the smaller Asian hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax.</body>

      <title>Award for UK food security pioneer</title>
      <description>British geographer John Anthony Allan is one of three scientists to be awarded a Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation Award.</description>

      <body>British geographer Prof John Anthony Allan has received an award from the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation for his work on water security.He introduced the idea of "virtual" water, whereby the amount of water used in food production can be traded when that food is imported or exported.The awards were presented a ceremony in Monaco on Monday evening.The two other winners were US environmental scientist Jane Lubchenco and Spanish geologist Jeronimo Lopez.Dr Lubchenco is the most recent chief of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Prof Lopez is president of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (Scar).The purpose of a virtual water market is to account for all of the water embodied in the production of food.As Prof Allan explained during his acceptance speech, "it takes 1,000 tonnes of water to raise a tonne of wheat, and it takes 16,000 to raise a tonne of beef".The ultimate aim of a global market for virtual water, he said, would be to "trade our way into food security" as water-intensive commodities are traded from places where they are economically viable to produce, to more water-scarce places where they are not.At the awards ceremony, Prince Albert said that Prof Allan had "opened up new perspectives in the management of water stocks and their trade, in particular in regions suffering from [water] shortage, such as the Middle East.Prof Allan, who is based at King's College London, said: "Accountants could save the world if we enable them to put accounting rules into and reporting rules into this food supply chain, which looks as if it's a market, but it has no accounting rules or reporting rules for water".This was the sixth annual Prince Albert II Foundation awards.The three awards represent each of the research areas the prince has named as priorities for his foundation: climate change, biodiversity and water.Dr Lubchenco, who received the climate change award for her work on ocean acidification, told BBC News that she hoped the award would help draw attention to the fact that climate change was "happening now and in our own back yards"."The recent IPCC (UN climate panel) report provides very compelling evidence that that is the case, but that evidence has not yet translated to sufficient action to reduce carbon emissions, and we need that if we are to transition to a better place."</body>

      <title>Russia charges Greenpeace 'pirates'</title>
      <description>Russia charges 14 Greenpeace activists, including a British videographer, with piracy over a protest on an Arctic oil rig.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24362817</url>
      <date>1380722852</date>
      <body>Fourteen Greenpeace activists, including at least four from the UK, have been charged with piracy by the Russian authorities.They were among a 30-strong crew on a Greenpeace ship that was protesting against oil drilling in the Arctic.The group was arrested last month after two of the protesters tried to board an oil platform owned by the Russian state-controlled firm Gazprom.Greenpeace has called the charges "irrational, absurd and an outrage".The 14 activists were taken from jail to the Murmansk office of the Investigative Committee, the Russian equivalent of the FBI, the BBC's Daniel Sandford reports from Moscow.There they were formally charged with "piracy of an organised group", an offence that carries a 15-year prison sentence.Those charged include Kieron Bryan, a freelance video producer from London; Anthony Perrett from Newport in Wales; Alexandra Harris, originally from Devon, and Philip Ball from Chipping Norton.Greenpeace said more activists are expected to be formally charged on Thursday.The group's international executive director, Kumi Naidoo, said the charges were "extreme and disproportionate"."A charge of piracy is being laid against men and women whose only crime is to be possessed of a conscience. This is an outrage and represents nothing less than an assault on the very principle of peaceful protest," Reuters news agency quoted Mr Naidoo as saying.Mr Naidoo said the way Russian officials had treated the protesters represented "the most serious threat to Greenpeace's peaceful environmental activism" since the bombing of the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior in New Zealand in 1985, when the group was campaigning against French nuclear testing in the Pacific.Russian President Vladimir Putin had previously said the activists were "not pirates", but may have broken international law.The Investigative Committee said earlier this week that peaceful aims would not justify what it has described as an "attack" that posed a threat to the rig and its personnel.Last month the Greenpeace ship approached the Prirazlomnaya platform, Russia's first offshore oil rig which is scheduled to start operating by the end of the year.Two activists tried to climb up onto the platform and tie themselves onto it, in an attempt to draw attention to the issue of the expansion of oil and gas exploration in the Arctic Ocean.They were detained after a short skirmish in inflatable dinghies in which armed Russian FSB officers in balaclavas fired warning shots into the water.Greenpeace has released cameraphone images it says show the moment Russian security forces boarded the Arctic Sunrise ship.The ship, with its crew comprising 18 nationalities, was then towed to Murmansk.Mr Bryan's parents, Andy and Ann, from Devon, said they were very worried."Our son is a very kind, caring individual and environmental issues have always been very close to his heart," they said.Andy Bryan had spoken of his shock at the actions the Russians had taken against what he said was a peaceful organisation.</body>

      <body>Hidden cameras have captured the moment London Zoo's first tiger cub for 17 years was born.Five-year-old Sumatran tiger Melati gave birth to the cub on 22 September after a six-minute labour.The pregnancy, which lasted about 15 weeks, was kept secret by zookeepers who are "over the moon" about the cub.It was born six months after the opening of the "tiger territory", designed to encourage the endangered sub-species of tiger to breed.BBC correspondent Emma North said the cub was the product of a "whirlwind romance".Senior zookeeper Paul Kybett explained: "They came from opposite ends of the globe. Melati joined us from Perth at the end of September last year."Jae Jae came from Ohio. When they first saw each other they made the lovely sneezy purr kind of noise that they make."When we introduced them for the first time he trotted up to her and gave her a big head rub so we knew we were going to be getting something quite special."He added: "When it came to her due date, we were all watching our monitors with bated breath."The actual birth happened very quickly and Melati's maternal instincts kicked in immediately."We couldn't have asked for a smoother birth."It's still very early days, so we're leaving Melati to take care of her adorable baby, and our cameras allow us to watch them both from a distance."So far she's proving to be a doting mum."Malcolm Fitzpatrick, curator of mammals at the zoo, said the birth was very important for the global zoo tiger population.He said: "This tiger's one of the most important births in Europe this year."Zookeepers do not yet know the sex of the cub, which is in the exhibit's cubbing den with its mother and will remain away from the public for several weeks.The cub is the grandchild of the zoo's last tiger cub, Hari, the father of Melati.</body>

      <body>A rescue operation to save up to 500 ducks caught up in an oil spill on a lake is continuing in Denbighshire, says the RSPCA.Nearly 200 have been rounded up so far following the incident in Glyndyfrdwy, between Corwen and Llangollen.Most of the birds are heavily coated in engine oil and are being taken to the RSPCA's wildlife centre in Taunton, Somerset, for treatment.The rescue started on Monday after last week's oil spill.Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said the spill was confined to the lake and there was no impact on the wider environment.The agency was called out to investigate the incident on Thursday and Friday and advised the landowner how to clean up the oil.The ducks were originally reared for shooting but had been signed over to the RSPCA, said its officials.It said they would be rehabilitated and survivors released back into the wild.RSPCA Inspector Keith Hogben said: "Oil can be incredibly damaging to birds - affecting their plumage and so their ability to stay warm and dry. It can also cause a lot of internal injuries if ingested."The RSPCA said the birds were being washed in Taunton and kept on pools so staff could check that their feathers were waterproof and there were no long-term effects from the oil.Peter Venn, RSPCA centre manager, said: "So far they all seem to be doing well which is good news."He said the oil was coming off easily with washing up liquid and the ducks seemed relatively strong."Fingers crossed we can get as many of them as possible fighting fit and ready for release," he added.People with information about the oil spill can contact the RSPCA in confidence on 0300 123 8018.</body>

      <title>Mammals threatened by fragmentation</title>
      <description>Small mammals affected by rainforest fragmentation are likely to be wiped out more quickly than previously thought, scientists warn.</description>

      <date>1380224144</date>
      <body>Species affected by rainforest fragmentation are likely to be wiped out more quickly than previously thought, scientists have warned.A study found that some small mammal species on forest islands, created by a hydroelectric reservoir, in Thailand became extinct in just five years.It also showed that populations in the fragmented habitats were also at risk from another threat - invasive species.The findings have been published in the journal Science.Results showed that almost all small mammals disappeared from patches of fragmented forest smaller than 10 hectares (25 acres) within just five years, and larger plots - measuring up to 56ha - recorded the loss of small animals within 25 years.Co-author Luke Gibson from the National University of Singapore said the team was very surprised by the findings, describing it "like an ecological Armageddon"."None of us expected such a dramatic change from 20 years ago," he told the BBC's Science in Action programme."Our study focused on small mammals but what we did not report was a similar near-complete extinction of medium to large-sized mammals, such as elephants, tigers and tapirs, which are now completely absent from these islands in the reservoir."All of these animals were all in the forest landscape before the creation of the reservoir."'Natural laboratory'The researchers carried out their studies at the Chiew Lan (or Larn) Reservoir in southern Thailand. About 160 sq km of the Khao Sok National Park was flooded in the mid-1980s to create the reservoir.The rising water also created in excess of 100 islands of tropical forest, which the team called a "natural laboratory".The researchers carried out a survey of small mammals found on 16 of the islands, which ranged in size from 0.3ha to 56.3ha, five to seven years after the reservoir was created. They then repeated the survey 25-26 years after the islands were formed.Co-author Prof William Laurance, one of the world's leading ecologists on habitat fragmentation, said there were probably two factors that drove the rapid demise of small mammals on the isolated habitats."Native mammals suffered the harmful effects of population isolation, and they also had to deal with a devastating invader - the Malayan field rat," he said.The team found the population of the invading rat species became so abundant in just a few years that it displaced the native small mammals.The field rat is known to invade disturbed habitats, such as fragmented forests.Habitat fragmentation is widely recognised as one of the main global threats to biodiversity. Although it can occur naturally as a result of natural disasters, the main threat today comes via human activities, such as urbanisation and pressure for agricultural land.Mr Gibson said he expected the trend of fragmentation in tropical landscapes to become increasingly common in the coming decades."One example [of a] highly fragmented forest region is in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil where more than 80% of fragments are smaller than 50ha in area," he observed."The bottom line is that we must conserve large, intact habitats for nature. That is the only way we can ensure biodiversity will survive."</body>

      <title>Himalayas still uphill for climate report</title>
      <description>Data on Himalayan glaciers remains poor</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24396330</url>
      <date>1380882233</date>
      <body>Although the latest global update on climate change says the vast majority of glaciers worldwide have continued to shrink, scientists have admitted that the Himalayas remain an area where they still have very limited information.Glaciologists involved in the cryosphere chapter of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) first phase report, launched last week, said there was no good sample of Himalayan glaciers that could help them forecast their future behaviour."The Himalayas are one of the areas we really are data-poor," said Prof David Vaughan from Cambridge University, UK, and one of the two lead coordinating authors of the ice chapter in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)."We really need good samples of lots of glaciers and their measurements; we would like to have a larger number of benchmark glaciers," he told BBC News.The Himalayas received scant coverage in past IPCC reports.Until its Third Assessment Report in late 2001, the supreme authority on climate science called the Himalayan region a "white spot" because of the lack of information.Its Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 courted huge controversy when it mistakenly said that most of the Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035.After the IPCC put its hand up on this error, there was an expectation that AR5 would contain something more, particularly from the ground.But scientists involved in the latest IPCC report said there had been very little ground-truthing of the satellite imagery obtained for the Himalayas."Ground measurements are still very few, and, in addition, these few are usually limited to very small and not very representative glaciers," said Prof Georg Kaser, a University of Innsbruck, Austria, glaciologist and a lead author on AR5's cryosphere chapter."Field work on these glaciers is extremely difficult and also dangerous on an unacceptable scale. There is no way to overcome this, and this fact is also one of the reasons why we knew so little about these glaciers - giving thus also good reasons for [exaggerated] guesses."The Himalayas cover about one million square km, and there are more than 15,000 glaciers in the region according to several studies.The first-phase instalment of AR5 has significant detail on the Arctic, Greenland and the Antarctic.On the Greenland ice sheet, for instance, it said: "There is very high confidence that the Greenland ice sheet has lost ice during the last two decades."Combinations of satellite and airborne remote sensing together with field data indicate with high confidence that the ice loss has occurred in several sectors, and that large rates of mass loss have spread to wider regions than reported in AR4."But there is nothing like this on the Himalayas - the largest body of ice outside the northern and southern polar regions - and scientists say the main reason is the lack of studies on the ground.Even countries in the region have not been able to expand upon the few field studies they have initiated in limited pockets.India's Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology has been monitoring less than half-a-dozen glaciers within the Indian Himalayas."There are also strategic reasons behind the lack of ground work," says WIHG director Prof Anil Gupta, who was also a review editor on AR5's paleoclimate chapter."For instance, China and India share borders in the Himalayas and so because of the sensitivities on both the sides, it becomes difficult to reach these areas."WIHG has found that one of the reasons behind the recent catastrophic floods in Uttarakhand State of northern India was a breach of a glacial lake."The heavy precipitation led to the melting of the soft snow and even old ice in the Chorabari and companion glaciers that fed to the Chorabari Lake, which got breached due to excessive water intake from the glaciers," Prof Gupta explained."The mixing of glacial moraine, or debris, with glacial melt water mainly impacted the town of Shri Kedarnath and downstream towns of Gauriganga, Ramban, etc in the Kedarnath Valley."Prof Vaughan said that updates on the state of nearby glaciers were crucial for people living in such valleys in the Himalayas."If you live in a valley below one glacier, you really don't care what the global average [of glacial retreat] is; you just want to know what's happening to that particular glacier that's affecting your water security.According to the United Nations Environment Programme, there have been at least 35 events of glacial lake outbursts in Nepal, Pakistan, Bhutan and China during the last century.To minimise future risks, Prof Vaughan said scientists urgently needed more data on Himalayan glaciers."If they are going to start retreating then some of them will leave these kinds of glacial lakes that can then be quite dangerous if they burst out."We could actually predict which glaciers are likely to have that kind of behaviour in the future if only we can get on the ground and get some details."</body>

      <title>Hydrogen: The car fuel of the future?</title>
      <description>Could hydrogen power the cars of tomorrow?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24381812</url>
      <date>1380843391</date>
      <body>A small British firm is looking forward to a day in which we will take our cars to the garage and fill them with hydrogen.Acal Energy, based in Runcorn in Cheshire, says it has developed a chemistry that could make hydrogen fuel cells much cheaper and longer-lasting than current technologies.It wants to license its chemistry to the world's car-makers, opening the way for hydrogen vehicles to sell in large volumes in 10 or 20 years' time."We believe this is one of the breakthrough technologies," says Brendan Bilton, the company's chief commercial officer."We're pretty confident and excited... that this will start unlocking the barriers," he continues, "Allowing fuel cells to be in products for mass market applications."It is a bold dream but not a crazy one.The automotive industry is already far advanced with plans for a first generation of hydrogen cars.Hyundai, the South Korean manufacturer, has said it will soon start selling a hydrogen-powered version of its ix35 model.Meanwhile, the Japanese giant Toyota is expected to unveil its first nearly-production-ready foray into the territory at next month's Tokyo motor show.Other big names - including Daimler and Volkswagen - are thought to be on track to get hydrogen vehicles into showrooms by 2017.But few expect these first-generation hydrogen cars to sell in very large numbers.Acal Energy is pitching its technology as the enabler for a second generation of less costly, more durable vehicles which could - if all goes to plan - pose a serious challenge to the long domination of the internal combustion engine from about 2020 onwards.To begin with, consumers may take a bit of persuading.Hydrogen is widely seen as a dangerous fuel - an image underpinned by that grainy newsreel footage of the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg airship bursting into flames in the 1930s.But actually, experts do not seem daunted by this particular technical challenge.They point out that hydrogen is already used and managed on a routine basis in industrial processes.The main reason anyone bothers with it as a fuel for the future is because it is emission-free at the point of use.The hydrogen is combined with oxygen in a bit of kit called a fuel cell. This process generates electricity to power the engine in the vehicle.The waste products are heat and harmless water.Water is benign, unlike the global warming-inducing, carbon dioxide emissions that spew from even the most efficient petrol and diesel vehicles.The car industry has been developing fuel cells that use costly platinum as the catalyst for generating power from hydrogen for many years.Acal Energy claims the problem with this current technology is that it results in fuel cells that are either prohibitively expensive because of the high platinum content, or prone to degrade quickly.To get round these issues, the company has developed what Mr Bilton describes as a "liquid catalyst" composed of "a dissolved solution of metal salts".As well as being a lot cheaper than a platinum catalyst, the liquid doubles up as a coolant and a cleaning agent that extends the life of the fuel cell by taking away damaging by-products as it circulates through a "regenerator"."We have a solution that both increases durability and reduces cost," says Mr Bilton.The company has its offices in a science park that until a few years ago was the research and development centre for the British chemicals giant ICI, now shrunken in size and foreign-owned.Intriguingly, the ideas behind Acal Energy's patented "FlowCath" technology derive from techniques developed to clean clothes more efficiently.The founder of the company, Dr Andrew Creeth, now its chief technology officer, spent much of his career working as a scientist for the washing powder giant Unilever.Development of the product is taking place in an environment not unlike a gigantic school chemistry lab - full of bubbling chemicals, complicated equipment and clever looking people in white coats.The company has already raised £15m ($24m) to finance its work from a mixture of private investors and government sources.It is currently hoping to raise another £15m or so from a new funding round, with the outcome due to be announced soon.Eventually, Acal Energy aims to earn profits from the business model pioneered by the successful British micro-chip designer Arm Holdings.Arm's technology is embedded in most of the chips used in the world's smartphones and tablet computers.It receives a small royalty payment every time anyone upgrades their mobile device.Acal Energy dreams of equal success from licensing its technology to car manufacturers in decades to come.The big questions, though, are does the technology work and will it be the breakthrough that the company claims?Prof Nigel Brandon of Imperial College in London, a leading academic in hydrogen energy, is well qualified to comment."The core technology looks very exciting," he says."There are some components in their system they need to improve. I don't see any reason why they can't do that but they've still got to do it," Prof Brandon adds.It is guarded optimism that could equally be applied to the whole field of hydrogen fuel cell energy.The big advantages over battery-powered electric vehicles are hydrogen cars can be refuelled in a just a few minutes, they can run for 300 or 400 miles between refuelling and they have the environmental benefits of battery driven cars with the same range and convenience as those with petrol or diesel engines.But there are also significant snags.Among them is the need to create a hugely expensive new infrastructure of hydrogen filling stations to replace garages.Hydrogen enthusiasts often quote the example of the internet.Once the demand was proven, a global network of optical fibre cables to carry data traffic was rapidly built despite the cost.Major players in the car industry are betting - but not yet on a truly large scale - that hydrogen energy will follow the same pattern.</body>

We lie all the time and are remarkably bad at detecting when other people are deliberately deceiving us.There are lots of urban myths about lie detecting, such as the claim that liars tend to look away, twitch their feet or touch their noses when lying (the so-called Pinocchio effect).In study after study, it has been shown that professionals such as policemen are no more reliable at detecting liars than the rest of us. So it's not surprising that for many years scientists have been working to develop "truth drugs" - drugs that will make you open up and tell all you know to an interrogator.One of the oldest and best known of these truth drugs is sodium thiopental. Although it was first developed in the 1930s, it is still used today in a range of settings, including, in some countries, by the police and the military.I was intrigued but also extremely sceptical about the claims that sodium thiopental, originally developed as an anaesthetic, could make people speak the truth if they chose not to. So I decided, as part of a series I've been making on the extraordinary history of pharmaceuticals, to try it out.Sodium thiopental is part of a group of drugs called barbiturates, drugs widely used in the 1950s and 60s to help people sleep better. They are no longer used for that purpose because they are extremely addictive and potentially lethal - Marilyn Monroe famously died from a barbiturate overdose.I decided to take a low dose of sodium thiopental under proper medical supervision, with anaesthetist Dr Austin Leach monitoring my vital signs throughout. Barbiturates work by slowing down the rate at which messages travel through the brain and spinal column. The more barbiturates there are, the harder it is for chemical messages to cross the gaps between one neuron and the next.Your whole thinking process slows down until you fall asleep. With thiopental, that happens very quickly indeed.Although it was originally developed as an anaesthetic, it was soon noticed that when patients were in that twilight zone halfway between consciousness and unconsciousness, they became more chatty and disinhibited. After the drug had worn off, the patients forgot what they had been talking about.It was decided that sodium thiopental might form the basis for a truth drug, an interrogation tool. But does it really work?I decided that I would have a go at trying to maintain the fiction that rather than being Michael Mosley, science journalist, I would be Michael Mosley, famous heart surgeon. We started with a very low dose. Immediately I felt extremely light-headed, intoxicated. But would this make me more inclined to speak the truth?There is an expression, "in vino veritas" (in wine there is truth). Alcohol is an anaesthetic and it depresses some of our higher centres, areas like the cerebral cortex where a lot of thought processing occurs. It reduces inhibitions but also slows thought processes, making it difficult to think clearly. The Roman historian Tacitus claimed that Germanic tribes held their important councils while drunk, as they thought it made effective lying harder.One theory about sodium thiopental is that it works in much the same way. Because lying is generally more difficult and complicated than telling the truth, if you suppress higher cortical functions you are more likely to speak the truth, simply because it's easier.I'm not sure if I lied effectively while under the influence of low dose thiopental, but I found that I could still lie."I am a cardiac - ha ha ha! - cardiac surgeon, a world famous cardiac surgeon," I shouted out when Dr Leach asked me what I did for a living."Would you like to tell me what the last operation you carried out was?" he enquired, politely."It was a heart bypass," I improvised. "They survived, yeah, I was awesome."Not convincing, but I had just about managed to stick to my fictional story. But what would happen when the dose was upped?At this point I felt some trepidation. There was a risk that I might say something that I really didn't want the world to know, but, confident in my ability to keep on lying, I told Dr Leach to go ahead.I was given another slightly larger dose of sodium thiopental and this time I actually felt more sober, more in control. So what happened next was a complete surprise.Again Dr Leech asked me my name and my profession. This time there was no hesitation."I'm a television producer. Well, executive producer, well, presenter, some, mix of the three of them.""So you don't have any history of performing cardiac surgery?" he asked gently."None whatsoever. None whatsoever"I'm still confused about what happened because one effect of the drug is to distort short-term memory. But I think the reason that I spoke the truth on this occasion is because the thought of lying never occurred to me.So does it work? Well my conclusion after trying it out and speaking to experts is that it will certainly make you more inclined to talk, but that when you are under the influence you are also in an extremely suggestible state. The reason you become more suggestible is probably because the drug is interfering with your higher centres, like your cortex, where a lot of decision making goes on. There is a serious risk you will say what your interrogator wants to hear rather than the truth.The truth is we don't have a reliable truth drug yet. Or if there is one out there, nobody's telling.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>10 heat secrets caught on camera</title>
      <description>Tech provides unique perspective on nature</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/24269057</url>
      <date>1380724825</date>
      <body>Have you ever seen a foraging badger being followed by a bat? A nightjar clapping for attention? Or a cloud of bats feeding over a lake?These are just some of the fascinating insights filmmakers captured for BBC One series The Great British Year thanks to state of the art thermal imaging equipment.The military might have led the development of this technology but since cameras have become commercially available, researchers have started exploring the unique perspective on the natural world they can provide.Using infra-red radiation to visualise differences in temperature has delivered some surprising sights, here are 10 of the most remarkable revelations.Figuring out whether a giant panda is pregnant is one of the biggest challenges in animal medicine but staff at San Diego Zoo have successfully used thermal imaging to give them a new perspective."Thermal imaging is a useful tool for detecting activity in the giant panda uterus prior to the time a foetus can be visualised with ultrasound," says Dr Barbara Durrant who has led the technology's use at the zoo.By monitoring a panda's abdomen, the team were able to visualise heat changes as early indicators of the animals preparing for pregnancy.Dr Durrant explains that the advantage of thermal imaging is that the animals can be monitored without restraints or anaesthetic for a broad, non-invasive view before more specific methods are administered.Wildlife vets have also embraced thermal imaging as a tool to monitor animals without getting too close.High temperatures in specific body parts can indicate inflammation and such information has proven useful in the diagnosis of conditions from arthritis in elephants to rabies in raccoons.Interestingly, while higher nose temperatures sound alarm bells in racoons, a cooler face has been identified as an indicator of rabies in big brown bats.A team of French and Scottish scientists investigating emperor penguins in Antarctica discovered that the animals can actually have a colder surface temperature than the surrounding air.Via thermal images of the penguin colonies, researchers identified that the outer layer of feathers was 4 to 6 C colder than the air.Dr Dominic McCafferty from the University of Glasgow explained that this was due to "extreme radiative cooling" whereby the penguins lose heat to the clear sky where heat escapes rapidly from our atmosphere.The specialised structure of their feathers acts as an insulator however to keep these dangerously low temperatures away from the penguins' skin.Thermal technology was used to study Asian elephants living at Busch Gardens zoological park, US.African elephants are known to keep cool using their large ears where huge volumes of blood are circulated close to the skin's surface so heat can dissipate.Asian elephants however have much smaller ears and are known to cool off overnight so they start the day at a lower temperature.Rather than losing heat through their ears, thermal images showed that overnight heat loss is greatest from Asian elephants' trunks.The titan arum (Amorphophallus titanum) is the stinking giant of the plant world. It has the world's largest flowering head growing up to 3 metres tall and smells like a rotting corpse.Researchers discovered that the plant emits puffs of this odour to attract carrion eating insect pollinators from across its Sumatran jungle home.Thermal imaging revealed that the puffs are achieved by a build up of heat in the plant's stem resulting in regular releases of steam which carry the odour through the canopy to attract insects.Bees are known for their stings but Japanese honeybees have another form of defence against predatory giant Asian hornets.If they find an intruder in the nest, the bees swarm around it to form a bee ball - the inside of which reaches 46 C.Thermal cameras indicate that the temperature inside the bee ball is maintained by the bees at the optimal level so that they can defeat their nemesis without overheating themselves.Biologists are tracking the movements of whales without even dipping a toe in the water.Instead they survey the seas for "spouts" of warmer water released by the whales as they take a breath.The technology provides valuable data on grey whales as they pass California on their annual migrations, particularly their previously unseen night-time movements.Last year, researchers reported the first use of thermal imaging in an automated system that aims to protect whales from underwater noise by alerting when their spouts are sighted near mining or naval activities.A further bizarre discovery about Madagascar's mysterious lemur the aye-aye was made using thermal imaging cameras.The animals are known for their unusual extra-long finger which they use to tap trees when foraging for grubs.Scientists discovered that the aye-aye's super sensitive digit is kept cool when not in use but heats up by 6 C when in action.The finger is packed with nerve endings and experts suggest the ability to "switch" its temperature on and off saves the lemur essential energy.In the past, bats have proven difficult to study because most of their activity takes place after dark but thermal imaging has revealed a wealth of information about their behaviour.When researchers found high numbers of dead bats below wind turbines in both the US and Europe, they turned to thermal imaging for an explanation.US researchers recorded footage that identified bats actively investigating and foraging around the turbines.Scientists suggest insects are attracted to the structures with a knock on effect for the bats and birds that feed on them.Experts studied common seals off the coast of Scotland to understand more about their habits during the annual moult.Through thermal imaging they found that the seals' skin heats up to help them shed and regrow their hair.With increased blood flow to their skin to aid the moult, the seals choose to stay out of the water to avoid a chill and save energy.The Great British Year begins on Wednesday 2 October 2013 at 2100 on BBC One.Join BBC Nature on Facebook and Twitter @BBCNature.</body>

      <title>Letter from Africa: Elephants' end?</title>
      <description>The battle to save Africa's elephants from cyanide slaughter</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24352104</url>
      <date>1380761882</date>
      <body>In our series of letters from African journalists, filmmaker and columnist Farai Sevenzo considers the plight of the African elephant.Our world has become a more dangerous one for man and beast alike, with murder and murderers dominating recent news.I was struck these past few days by the callous murder of some 80 elephants in Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park.Poachers, it has been reported, poured cyanide into the drinking and salting wells frequented by some of Zimbabwe's 80,000 elephants with the sole aim of killing them and removing their ivory tusks for sale to buyers in Asia.The National Parks say a thorough search of the surrounding villages has already yielded 19 tusks together with cyanide poison and the authorities have made arrests.Across the continent, poachers have been killing elephants in greater and larger numbers - a family of 11 was slain in Kenya's Tsavo East National Park back in January, and, according to The International Fund for Animal Welfare, some 400 elephants were slaughtered in the first three months of 2012 in Cameroon's Bouba Ndjida National Park.While over in Gabon, a country whose green credentials are the envy of many, 11,000 forest elephants are said to have been killed by poachers from 2004 to 2013 because they were after the pink-tinged ivory of Gabon's forest elephants which is said to fetch high prizes and much in demand by jewellers and their customers in Asia.A pattern seems to be emerging here where Africa's close encounter with new economic giants like China has meant all resources are on the negotiating table; but ivory, long protected by international law, can only be obtained by the illegal poaching of Africa's most majestic beasts.It is difficult to know where the blame begins for this sudden elephant murder spree.African detective novelists might lead their protagonists from the urban hotels where an encounter with a Chinese businessman will tempt a poor worker to head to his village and inform his relatives that a little hunting will benefit the whole family.But in reality it will impoverish these African nations as a whole and the sight of elephant carcasses strewn across the savannah with their tusks removed confirm the suspicion that people are the worst guardians of this planet and should not be trusted to hand it over to future generations without unbelievable damage.And so it was heartening to hear Zimbabwe's Environment Minister Saviour Kasukuwere talking of changing the law so that poachers may be punished more severely for their outrageous disregard for the nation's heritage."We are responding with all our might because our wildlife, including the elephants they are killing, are part of the national resources… that we want to benefit the people of Zimbabwe," the minister said.This particular cyanide slaughter will have affected not just the elephants - birds, lions, leopards, giraffes and many other beasts that used the same watering holes will have perished and the body count will rise as hyenas, jackals and vultures feasting on the remains will ingest the cyanide poison which human hands laid in the water for a few miserable dollars.Ironically, since the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) banned ivory sales in 1989, loxondanta Africana - African elephants - have had a tough time holding on to their tusks and their lives.Before such a ban, China even gifted the United Nations, in 1974, a magnificent sculpture of exquisite craftsmanship depicting the Chengdu-Kunming Railway.But today we would recognise that that piece was made out of eight enormous elephant tusks, four elephant lives and dozens of repercussions for their grieved offspring.The minister of environment in Zimbabwe is at pains to call this a global problem and he is right.The green concerns of the modern day are alive to the possibility that there may be none of these awesome beasts left should poaching and the markets for ivory be allowed to go unchecked.Rather than turn Zimbabwe's Victoria Falls into a tacky Disney World theme park in an effort to attract tourism, the government would be better off pulling in the elephants' friends to their beautiful parks.For elephants are not short of sympathisers and half a million people in 15 cities across the globe will be marching to draw attention to the plight of the African elephant this October.The cyanide slaughter awoke the social media generation from teenagers to vegetarians to international footballers.The Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey - whose current form has delighted fans in north London and Africa's massive Arsenal following - tweeted a few days ago: "Just read about elephants being poisoned for their ivory in Zimbabwe. Absolutely shocking."The minister was aware of this famous tweet and told the BBC that Mr Ramsey would be welcome to see for himself the efforts under way to save his tusked friends.But if Minister Kasukuwere is to be the saviour of the elephants, he must punish the buyers too, and not flinch at the possibility of poisoning the poachers themselves - the life of a poacher who cannot think of the future beyond a few hundred dollars surely deserves poison too?For the lives of 80 elephants lost so brutally would have replenished the national coffers with their enormous weight in gold 80 fold through resurgent tourism.In the end, the government threw the law book at the poachers - 15 years in jail and a fine of $800,000 (£493,000).But someone bought that cyanide, someone funded the brutal operation and someone somewhere has more of those tusks missing from those elephant carcasses.There is more to be done.If you would like to comment on Farai Sevenzo's column, please do so below.</body>

      <title>What have we learned from Fukushima?</title>
      <description>A return to the site of Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24332346</url>
      <date>1380586014</date>
      <body>Since moving to Japan in 2012, I have reported on the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear disaster - speaking to experts, visiting the site and watching the clean-up. For the Editors, a programme which sets out to ask challenging questions, I consider what I have learned.Firstly, Fukushima was not an unavoidable natural disaster. For many outside Japan it is easy to draw the conclusion that Fukushima is unique, as very few places experience such huge earthquakes and tsunamis as Japan. So, the logic goes, there are no real lessons to be learned for other countries.Much the same was said after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine in 1986. Chernobyl was a bad design, a similar accident could not happen in Japan, which has Western-designed reactors. But it did.Prof Kiyoshi Kurokawa chaired the Japanese parliamentary inquiry in to the Fukushima disaster and his conclusions are devastating. It was, he told me: "Man-made, and made in Japan."Tatsujiro Suzuki, the deputy head of Japan's Atomic Energy Commission, has also been damning."There were studies which showed a one-in-1,000-year probability of the Fukushima coast being hit by a 10m tsunami," he said. "Unfortunately, those studies were dismissed. The nuclear industry didn't think it would happen, so they didn't prepare for it," he said.For me, this is the most revealing and shocking part of the Fukushima story. When the earthquake and tsunami hit on 11 March 2011 there was no plan for how to deal with such a large and complex disaster. How was this allowed to happen?Prof Kurokawa blames what he calls "regulatory capture", a process by which the nuclear power industry "captured" the bureaucracy that was supposed to regulate it.Put crudely, the "poachers" and the "gamekeepers" were far too close. Many senior bureaucrats from Japan's Nuclear Industry Safety Agency would take lucrative jobs in the nuclear industry after leaving government.The result was a nuclear industry imbued with a culture of arrogance, secrecy and complacency. Lessons learned after Chernobyl and Three Mile Island in the US were not implemented here. When disaster struck, Japan was woefully ill-prepared.An investigation by Japan's NHK broadcaster last year found that simple equipment, things like mobile generators and battery packs that could have helped prevent the meltdowns, were sitting at a depot just 25 miles (40km) from the Fukushima plant.After the tsunami knocked out the plant's electrical system there was still time to bring in the back-up equipment. Army helicopters were on standby. But there was no plan. Chaos ensued.A senior company official in charge of logistics was asked by the NHK team why he had not dispatched the equipment. "We had a very long list of things they needed. We had no way to prioritise which should go first," he said.And so the back-up equipment stayed in the depot, and the reactor cores melted down.Nor was there any evacuation plan. In the little town of Namie, five miles (8km) north of the plant, Hirohisa Suzuki was clearing up debris from the quake when the order came to leave."People were just told to head north west," he told me, "but that was exactly the same direction the radiation cloud was moving. Some people were evacuated to an area where the radiation was even higher than here."In retrospect, Mr Suzuki agrees the whole town was far too trusting. They were told the plant was safe, so no-one had ever asked whether there was a disaster plan.Two and a half years later, Mr Suzuki and the 26,000 people who lived in Namie are still nuclear refugees as radiation in parts of the town is still too high for residents to return. His family's 150-year-old miso and soy sauce business may never reopen.This is the other thing I have learned: cleaning up a nuclear disaster is extremely difficult. That may sound obvious, but just how complex only becomes apparent when you see how it is done.In the large town of Minamisoma, 19 miles (30km) north of the plant, they are cleaning virtually every house. I watch a team of men using high-power sprayers to clean the roof of a farmhouse, surrounded by plastic sheets to catch the waste water, which is then pumped into a nearby tanker.Another team of men is removing topsoil from the garden and putting it in huge plastic bags. The garden is then covered in a 2in (5cm) layer of fresh sand. Behind the house, shrubs and bamboo are being cut down and bagged. It will take a team of 20 men two days to finish this one house.But much of Fukushima prefecture is covered in densely-forested mountains. How do you clean forest? The answer is you cannot. So large areas may have to be declared out of bounds for decades.Finally, there is the waste. Already the clean-up is generating huge quantities. I was taken to a "temporary" dump deep in the mountains near the little town of Kawauchi. This single dump contains 50,000 cubic metres of waste. Kawauchi alone already has four dumps this size, and it is building a fifth.Just how temporary these dumps really are is another question Japan's government is unable to answer. The radiation in the dumps will gradually fall. In 30 years it will be half the level it is today. But the Caesium 137 and Strontium 90 will not be gone completely for 300 years.Finally let me end by quoting again Tatsujiro Suzuki, the deputy head of Japan's Atomic Energy Commission. I asked him why, if the nuclear industry knows there is a possibility of a disaster, does it continue to tell the public nuclear power is safe?"We need to be prepared for the worst case. We need to tell the public this is the worst case. But if we tell the worst case, the public says ,'Don't build the reactor near here.' So that was the dilemma. And if you want to continue building nuclear power plants you have to keep telling people the reactors should be safe. But now that myth is gone."BBC News: The Editors features the BBC's on-air specialists asking questions which reveal deeper truths about their areas of expertise.

      <title>Why does the human brain create false memories?</title>
      <description>Why does the brain create false memories?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24286258</url>

      <body>Human memory constantly adapts and moulds itself to fit the world. Now an art project hopes to highlight just how fallible our recollections are.All of us generate false memories and artist AR Hopwood has been "collecting" them.For the past year he has asked the public to submit anecdotes of fake recollections which he turns into artistic representations.They have ranged from the belief of eating a live mouse to a memory of being able to fly as a child.One man who wrote in wrongly believed his girlfriend had a sister who died while at the dentist. So strong was his conviction that he kept all his dentist visits secret.He wrote: "Over dinner one day she said she was going to the dentist the next week. It all went quiet at the table and my mum said it must be hard for her to visit the dentist after what had happened."This is hardly a rare case. Neuroscientists say that many of our daily memories are falsely reconstructed because our view of the world is constantly changing.Subtle cues can easily steer our memories in the wrong direction.A famous experiment carried out by Elizabeth Loftus in 1994 revealed that she was able to convince a quarter of her participants they were once lost in a shopping centre as a child.Another similar experiment in 2002 found that half of the participants were tricked into believing they had taken a hot air balloon ride as a child, simply by showing them doctored photographic "evidence".This work was carried out by Kimberley Wade at the University of Warwick, UK. For the current project she was asked by Mr Hopwood to take part in a real hot air balloon ride, video and images of which are now exhibited in his show. She says she was very excited to take part."I've been studying memory for more than a decade, and I still find it incredible that our imagination can trick us into thinking we've done something we've never really done and lead us to create such compelling, illusory memories," she says.The reason our memories are so malleable, Kimberley Wade explains, is because there is simply too much information to take in."Our perceptual systems aren't built to notice absolutely everything in our environment. We take in information through all our senses but there are gaps," she adds."So when we remember an event, what our memory ultimately does is fills in those gaps by thinking about what we know about the world."For the most part false memories are about everyday situations with no real consequences except the occasional disagreement with a friend or partner about trivial things like who lost the keys, again.But sometimes, false memories can have more serious ramifications. For example, if an eyewitness testimony in court contributes to a false conviction.Forensic technology has now led to many such convictions being overturned. The Innocence Project in the US campaigns to overturn eyewitness misidentification and lists all the people who have subsequently been acquitted.The project reports that there have been 311 post-conviction DNA exonerations in the US, which includes 18 people who were sentenced to death before DNA evidence was able to prove their innocence.Christopher French of Goldsmiths University in London says there is still a lack of awareness of how unreliable human memory is, especially in the legal system."Although this is common knowledge within psychology and widely accepted by anybody who has studied the literature, it's not widely known about in society more generally," he says."There are still people who believe memory works like a video camera as well as people who accept the Freudian notion of repression - that when something terrible happens the memory is shoved down into the subconscious."But the evidence of repressed memories, he adds, is "very thin on the ground".Prof French was also involved in the memory project. He hopes it will create more awareness of the malleability of human memory.So too does AR Hopwood. He says he was fascinated to learn that people could strongly believe in an entirely imagined event."What's interesting is that the submissions become mini-portraits of the person (albeit anonymously) yet the only thing you are finding out about this person is something that didn't actually happen. So there's a lovely paradox there which I'm very drawn to as an artist," he says.According to another researcher, the errors the human brain makes can sometimes serve a useful purpose.Sergio Della Sala, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Edinburgh, UK, says it can be thought of in the following way. Imagine you are in the jungle and you see some grass moving. Humans are likely to panic and run away, with the belief that there could be a tiger lurking.A computer, however, might deduce that 99% of the time, it is simply the wind. If we behaved like the computer, we would be eaten the one time a tiger was present."The brain is prepared to make 99 errors to save us from the tiger. That's because the brain is not a computer. It works with irrational assumptions. It's prone to errors and it needs shortcuts," says Prof Della Sala.False memories are the sign of a healthy brain, he adds. "They are a by-product of a memory system that works well. You can make inferences very fast."The False Memory Archive, supported by the Wellcome Trust, opened at The Exchange in Penzance on Saturday 28 September</body>

      <body>He was one of the most intrepid explorers of the 19th Century, leading five expeditions to the Arctic and surviving for 10 months after his ship was crushed between two ice floes. But 100 years after his death, Benjamin Leigh Smith is now largely forgotten.Somewhere in the Arctic Ocean, about halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole, there's an archipelago where Benjamin Leigh Smith's name marks its easternmost point.The likes of Captain Robert Falcon Scott, Sir Ernest Shackleton and Sir Henry Morton Stanley were superstar explorers, men who earned great renown and who had sought great renown.On the other hand, Leigh Smith was a modest man. The cape and adjacent glacier bearing his name (Kapp Leigh Smith and Leighbreen) are some of the few lasting tokens of his historic expeditions.Unlike so many of his contemporaries, even unlike today's explorers, he never sought fame for discovering new places. He didn't publish any detailed account of his explorations and he shunned public appearances, often sending someone else in his place.Born in 1828, the Briton was one of the first explorers to take ships to the high Arctic, where extensive sea ice - the thin frozen surface of the ocean, a few metres in thickness - made conditions very hostile."He saw and mapped areas and islands that were being observed for the first time," says Prof Julian Dowdeswell, director of the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge University."The high Arctic had much more sea ice a century ago than it does now, which made navigating through it difficult."He received the Patron Gold Medal - one of the two highest awards the Royal Geographical Society gives - for his achievements, so was hugely eminent," he says.As well as his advances in scientific exploration, Leigh Smith was at the centre of a survival feat that is arguably a match for the later exploits of the much more famous Shackleton.In 1881, Leigh Smith's purpose-built research vessel Eira was crushed between two ice floes and sank off another Arctic archipelago, Russian Franz Josef Land, north of Siberia.The crew survived for 10 months in makeshift huts, living off provisions salvaged from the ship and hunting walrus and polar bear. Leigh Smith then led a voyage of escape in boats with sails made from table cloths, before they were ultimately rescued.Every single man survived."This remarkable Arctic journey was executed with as much grace as that of Shackleton 40 years later," says Peter Capelotti, author of Shipwreck at Cape Flora: The Expeditions of Benjamin Leigh Smith, England's Forgotten Arctic Explorer."His leadership was so successful that the veteran Arctic whaling captain David Gray was moved to call him the very model of 'quiet, cool, thoroughbred English pluck'," he says.When it came to accepting medals for his achievements, however, Capelotti says Leigh Smith "always begged off"."Explorers as a rule are self-obsessed people who love to talk about themselves, but not this one. He once told his brother-in-law that if Queen Victoria herself asked to see his Arctic photographs, he would send his expedition photographer around to the palace with them."Capelotti puts part of Leigh Smith's low profile down to his family background. While he came from a wealthy family, his father, who was an MP, never married his mother, an unusual and potentially scandalous situation.And although he studied law at Jesus College, Cambridge, he couldn't get a degree immediately because it was difficult for anyone but practising members of the Church of England to gain degrees at the time."He was always at odds with upper society," says Capelotti. "He didn't fit in."Leigh Smith's great-great-great niece Charlotte Moore, who lives in Sussex, agrees."He was both establishment but also separate because he was illegitimate and from a dissenting family, so he never received a knighthood or got that kind of honour, which is probably a factor in why his story is not better known," she says.In fact, it was only after Leigh Smith's father died, and another man left him money, that he embarked on his first expedition to the Arctic, according to Moore."The first one was a sporting cruise really. All polar expeditions were from the Royal Navy, but Ben wanted to do a private non-naval expedition, so he hired a ship."Then he realised he was interested in the scientific side of Arctic exploration and brought back specimens for the British Museum and Kew. He even brought back live polar bears for London Zoo," she says.By his fourth expedition, Leigh Smith's enthusiasm for Arctic exploration was so advanced that he had his own vessel - Eira - specially built. He also named a lot of the places he mapped after friends and family."Mabel Island is named after a niece, Amabel. And the hut the 25 shipwrecked crew made out of driftwood, rocks and masts of ships on his last expedition was named Flora Cottage after his cousin Florence Nightingale," says Moore.With the famous nursing pioneer for a first cousin and a father active in the campaign against the slave trade, Leigh Smith came from an outspoken family.He was also overshadowed by his sister Barbara, a leading feminist and activist for women's rights, which may be part of the reason why he didn't like to talk about his accomplishments, according to Capelotti.But Moore says although Leigh Smith was a private man of few words when it came to his expeditions, with his log books a "bare record - simple, factual and unemotional", he was seen as a forceful character in the family home."In my family he's seen as both a hero and a villain. His Arctic stuff is heroic, but he tried to prevent the marriage of one of his nieces and laid down rules over that."They did marry after they were 21, but the same forceful character that led people to safety at sea could apparently be uncomfortable within the family and the feud with Ben went on for many years. At the same time, people were in awe of him."You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Silk Road accused appears in court</title>

      <body>The alleged mastermind behind the online illegal drugs marketplace Silk Road is too dangerous to be bailed, US prosecutors have said.Ross Ulbricht, 29, was arrested this week and is charged with being the administrator of the site which has now been shut down.He is also accused of trying to arrange the killing of one of the site's users."We deny all charges and that is the end of the discussion at this point," Mr Ulbricht's lawyer said.Mr Ulbricht appeared in a San Francisco court on Friday wearing a green T-shirt under red jail clothes and had his ankles shackled.A request from his legal team for his bail hearing to be pushed back was granted - it will now take place on 9 October.Federal magistrate Joseph Spero asked Mr Ulbricht's lawyer Brandon LeBlanc whether seeing the criminal indictment that included a murder-for-hire charge had "changed his calculus" on whether he thought Mr Ulbricht would be granted bail.As part of its criminal complaint, the FBI alleged that Mr Ulbricht had sought to pay a Silk Road user to kill another user who had threatened to expose details of the site's users.Prosecutors opposed the delay, arguing that Mr Ulbricht represented a danger to the community, and that there was a high likelihood that he may attempt to flee.The Silk Road was a well-known destination on Tor, a so-called "dark web" service that anonymises users, making it much more difficult for authorities to track locations.The site sold a range of items, but was most famous for offering a host of illegal drugs, paid for using virtual currency Bitcoin.</body>

      <title>'Terminator' cube robots unveiled</title>
      <description>As MIT scientists unveil cube-shaped self-assembling robots, does a future of Terminator-style "liquid steel" androids come a step closer?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24397880</url>
      <date>1380895882</date>
      <body>Cube-shaped robots that can flip, jump and assemble themselves into different shapes have been unveiled by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).The small robots, known as M-Blocks, have no external parts but can move using an internal flywheel mechanism.They stick together using magnets.The scientists envisage miniaturised "swarmbot" versions self-assembling like the "liquid steel" androids in the Terminator films.More realistically, the researchers at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), believe armies of such cubes could be used for making temporary repairs to bridges or buildings, or as self-assembly, re-configurable scaffolding.Modular robots have the advantage of being able to adapt to whatever task or terrain is presented to them.John Romanishin, one of the research scientists at CSAIL leading the project, said: "We want hundreds of cubes, scattered randomly across the floor, to be able to identify each other, coalesce, and autonomously transform into a chair, or a ladder, or a desk, on demand."The M-Blocks are currently controlled by computer instructions sent over wireless radio, but in future the researchers hope algorithms can be loaded on the blocks directly, making them entirely autonomous and capable of adapting to different environments.Blocks equipped with sensors and cameras would be able to work out how to accomplish specific tasks in combat or emergency situations, the scientists hope.</body>

      <title>Adobe confirms data security breach</title>
      <description>As Adobe confirms hackers have accessed personal data belonging to 2.9 million customers, experts warn that the theft of source code could be far more serious.</description>

      <body>Adobe has confirmed that 2.9 million customers have had private information stolen during a "sophisticated" cyber attack on its website.The attackers accessed encrypted customer passwords and payment card numbers, the company said.But it does not believe decrypted debit or credit card data was removed.Adobe also revealed that it was investigating the "illegal access" of source code for numerous products, including Adobe Acrobat and ColdFusion."We deeply regret that this incident occurred," said Brad Arkin, Adobe's chief security officer."Based on our findings to date, we are not aware of any specific increased risk to customers as a result of this incident," he said.But Chester Wisniewski, senior adviser at internet security company Sophos, told the BBC: "Access to the source code could be very serious."Billions of computers around the world use Adobe software, so if hackers manage to embed malicious code in official-looking software updates they could potentially take control of millions of machines."This is on the same level as a Microsoft security breach," he added.Adobe said it had been helped in its investigation by internet security journalist Brian Krebs and security expert Alex Holden.The two discovered a 40GB cache of Adobe source code while investigating attacks on three US data providers, Dun and Bradstreet, Kroll Background America, and LexisNexis.Mr Krebs said the Adobe code was on a server he believed the hackers used.Adobe said that it is resetting passwords for the customer accounts it believes were compromised, and that those customers will get an email alerting them to the change.It is also recommending that, as a precaution, customers affected change their passwords and user information for other websites for which they used the same ID.For those customers whose debit or credit card information is suspected of being accessed, Adobe is offering a complimentary one-year subscription to a credit-monitoring programme.Finally, the company said it had notified law enforcement officials and is working to identify the hackers.</body>

      <body>More than two million people in China are employed by the government to monitor web activity, state media say, providing a rare glimpse into how the state tries to control the internet.The Beijing News says the monitors, described as internet opinion analysts, are on state and commercial payrolls.China's hundreds of millions of web users increasingly use microblogs to criticise the state or vent anger.Recent research suggested Chinese censors actively target social media.The report by the Beijing News said that these monitors were not required to delete postings.They are "strictly to gather and analyse public opinions on microblog sites and compile reports for decision-makers", it said. It also added details about how some of these monitors work.Tang Xiaotao has been working as a monitor for less than six months, the report says, without revealing where he works."He sits in front of a PC every day, and opening up an application, he types in key words which are specified by clients."He then monitors negative opinions related to the clients, and gathers (them) and compile reports and send them to the clients," it says.The reports says the software used in the office is even more advanced and supported by thousands of servers. It also monitors websites outside China.China rarely reveals any details concerning the scale and sophistication of its internet police force.It is believed that the two million internet monitors are part of a huge army which the government relies on to control the internet.The government is also to organise training classes for them for the first time from 14 to 18 October, the paper says.But it is not clear whether the training will be for existing monitors or for new recruits.The training will have eight modules, and teach participants how to analyse and judge online postings and deal with crisis situations, it says.The most popular microblogging site Sina Weibo, launched in 2010, now has more than 500 million registered users with 100 million messages posted daily.Topics cover a wide range - from personal hobbies, health to celebrity gossip and food safety but they talso include politically sensitive issues like official corruption.Postings deemed to be politically incorrect are routinely deleted.</body>

      <body>Thirteen alleged members of hacktivist group Anonymous have been indicted, accused of carrying out cyber-attacks.They have been charged in the US with conspiring to intentionally cause damage to protected computers.They were said to have targeted firms that refused to process payments for WikiLeaks, the whistle-blowing site founded by Julian Assange.The group flooded services with large amounts of traffic in an attempt to overwhelm the sites.This method - known as a Distributed Denial of Service attack, or DDoS - is a typical tactic of the hacktivist movement.The accused allegedly targeted groups or businesses they felt did not share the philosophy of Anonymous to make all information free for everyone, regardless of copyright laws or national security considerations.Those hit included governments, trade associations, law firms and financial institutions.Court documents said that from September 2010 to January 2011, Anonymous members waged a campaign they dubbed Operation Payback.In December 2010, the conspirators are alleged to have discussed possible targets related to WikiLeaks, the whistle-blowing site that struggled to receive funding after several payment processing companies, including Mastercard and Visa, refused to facilitate the transfer of donations to the group.The Swedish prosecutor's office was also hit, in connection with arrest warrants for sexual crimes issued for Mr Assange.The accused were also said to have gone after music industry bodies in retaliation for action taken against The Pirate Bay, a Sweden-based file sharing website devoted to the illegal downloading of copyrighted material.</body>

      <title>Twitter plans to raise $1bn in IPO</title>
      <description>In documents made public for the first time, social networking company Twitter has said it plans to raise $1bn as part of its stock market debut.</description>

      <date>1380856665</date>
      <body>Social networking company Twitter has said it plans to raise $1bn (£619m) in its stock market debut in documents filed with US regulators.In the filing, revealed on Thursday, the seven-year-old company said that it now has 218 million monthly users and that 500 million tweets are sent a day.It made a loss of $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m.It will be the largest Silicon Valley stock offering since Facebook's listing in 2012.Analysts said that the offering was likely to get a good response."Social media is red hot," said Internet analyst Lou Kerner. "Twitter is front and centre benefiting from market enthusiasm for all things social, and remarkably strong metrics."The filing also revealed Twitter's finances for the first time.While the company has never made a profit, its revenue has grown from just $28m in 2010 to $317m by the end of 2012.Around 85% of Twitter's revenue last year came from ad sales; the rest was from licensing its data.The company takes in a significant portion of its ad revenue from mobile devices, an important metric often tracked by analysts.As of 2013, over 65% of the company's advertising revenue was generated from mobile devices. More than 75% of Twitter users accessed the site from their mobile phone during that same time period.Some analysts said that the decision by the firm to raise capital indicated that it was keen on improving the way people enjoy content on its platform and how advertisers connect with its users."Users should be happy about this," said Zachary Reiss-Davis, an analyst with Forrester."It looks like Twitter is looking at how to enrich the experience and it understands that to build a successful service, they have to create something people like and want to come back to and spend time on."Peter Esho from Sydney-based Invast Financial Services, added that Twitter's ease to use had seen it increase its user base, making it an attractive option for advertisers."I think what Twitter has working in its favour is that it's very easy to use: it doesn't eat up too much bandwidth for the average user in places where broadband penetration is low," he said.The filing also revealed that two of the company's co-founders, Evan Williams and Jack Dorsey, own significant stakes in Twitter, and could stand to take in significant sums from the company's stock market listing.Mr Williams owns 12% of shares in the company, while Mr Dorsey owns 4.9%.Benchmark Capital's Peter Fenton, an early investor in the company, is the second-biggest shareholder, with 6.7% of shares.Twitter indicated three weeks earlier that it had filed for a public stock market offering.However, under a new law passed by Congress in 2012, it did not have to reveal its financial documents because it had revenue of less than $1bn.But by releasing the documents publicly, it gave an indication that it hopes to complete its stock sale soon.The company plans to list under the stock symbol TWTR, but it did not reveal which stock exchange, the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange, it had chosen.However, Mr Esho said that the listing was likely to be on the Nasdaq."I was to speculate, I think it would have to be Nasdaq," he said. "That really is the exchange that has seen so many tech names come to the market."Goldman Sachs is the lead bank taking the company public, a coveted position that is often fought for amongst the nation's biggest banks.The other banks helping with the offering are Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, BofA Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank Securities and CODE Advisors.</body>

      <title>Fury over Sindh messaging ban plan</title>

      <body>Internet freedom activists in Pakistan have expressed anger over proposals by the government of Sindh province to ban messaging apps including Skype, Viber and WhatsApp for three months.The provincial government says the move is necessary as a security measure.It says the move "detaches criminals from modern communication means".But the proposal has to be approved by the central government before it is implemented and so far no decision has been taken.Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan has said that he was not in favour of such a move."But I will go through the Sindh government's application in favour of the ban to see how much weight it carries," Mr Khan was quoted by local media as saying.Scores of social media users have condemned the proposals arguing that they are infringements of personal freedom and will impede small businesses and entrepreneurs from working effectively."The ban on Skype, Viber and WhatsApp in Sindh is a cyber-drone attack from the government," social media user Umer Pirzada tweeted.Another critic wrote: "This is when you know the country has gone down the drain. Blocking WhatsApp, Skype, What's next? Blocking oxygen?"But senior Pakistan People's Party (PPP) leader Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has spoken out in favour of the move arguing on Twitter that it was necessary to "catch some terrorists and save some lives".Sindh has been plagued by serious militant, sectarian and criminal violence throughout 2013 with the port city of Karachi being especially badly hit.Technology experts have pointed out that the proposed restrictions may be doomed to failure because they could easily be circumvented by criminals.Correspondents says that Pakistan's mobile network has been switched off about 12 times over the last year.Former PPP Interior Minister Rehman Malik frequently shut down cellular networks for extended periods on important national and religious holidays to "ensure the safety of the people".A ban on video sharing website YouTube - deemed by the authorities to be blasphemous - was introduced by the central government in September 2012.</body>

      <body>The photo sharing service Instagram announced it will start placing ads in US users photo streams in a posting on its website."We have big ideas for the future, and part of making them happen is building Instagram into a sustainable business," it said.Ads will appear in a few months and involve just a handful of firms.Instagram was bought by Facebook for $1bn (£619m), but has never made a profit.The company, which now has 150 million users, has been a favourite among consumers but has long left analysts wondering how it could turn enthusiasm among photographers into a business model.Early efforts by Instagram to generate revenue were met with user backlash, such as when the company changed the terms of service to seemingly indicate that it would own user images and could sell those images to advertisers.The failure of this move was acknowledged in the company's posting."As always, you own your own photos and videos. The introduction of advertising won't change this," it said.In an interview earlier this year with the BBC, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom said that Instagram must "fund its own future."Social media advertising is a booming business in the US.According to research firm eMarketer, advertisers will spend $9.5bn on social network ads worldwide this year.Facebook has boosted its efforts to gain a larger share of this ad spending.This year, the company's share of global mobile ad revenues will rise to 15.8% from 5.35% last year.</body>

      <body>Campaigners are trying to force a change in UK law after accusations of mass UK internet surveillance.Three privacy campaign groups have open legal proceedings in Europe in a bid to alter UK bugging legislation.The groups are trying to get the court to decide if UK surveillance rules give spies too much leeway to collect huge volumes of data.UK signals intelligence agency GCHQ declined to comment on Thursday.Three privacy groups have launched a bid to take the UK government to court in Europe after revelations of mass surveillance schemes.Under Tempora, UK agencies allegedly tapped cross-Atlantic fibre-optic cables to scoop up data headed for the US.The scheme was revealed by the Guardian newspaper in June.According to leaked documents, the UK also participated in the US Prism scheme, which allowed law enforcement access to detailed mass records of smartphone and internet activity.The campaigners allege that internet communications taps collected huge amounts of data traffic in a way that went against European human rights law.The groups want the European Court of Human Rights to force the UK government to tighten up a UK bugging law called the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa).Big Brother Watch, the Open Rights Group, and the English Pen campaign groups opened legal proceedings with the European Court of Human Rights this week.The groups sent a detailed letter to the court stating their concerns, Daniel Carey of Deighton Pierce Glynn solicitors told the BBC.Mr Carey, who is acting on behalf of the groups, said that the court could make a decision within two to three months about whether it will take the proceedings any further.</body>

      <body>Samsung Electronics, the world's biggest mobile phone and TV maker, has forecast record profits for the July-to-September quarter.It expects operating profit of 10.1 trillion won ($9.4bn; £5.8bn) for the quarter, a 25% jump from a year ago.The profit guidance beats many analyst forecasts.Samsung has enjoyed tremendous success with its Galaxy range of smartphones, but there had been concerns recently that its growth rate may be slowing."The company is doing a phenomenal job of continuing its growth rate," said Andrew Milroy, an analyst with consulting firm Frost and Sullivan."One would have expected that its growth rate may be hit by the emergence of other cheaper mobile phone makers."But it doesn't seemed to have happened, at least not yet," he added.The success of its Galaxy range of smartphones has seen Samsung become the leading player in the global mobile phone market.Analysts say the company's policy of catering to the low and high-end segments of the market has proved particularly effective.Samsung has launched top-end products such as the Galaxy S4 in a bid to take on the likes of Apple's iPhone.It has also introduced low-cost smartphones targeted at customers in emerging markets such as India and China.Many mobile phone operators in those markets do not subsidise phones, making low-cost devices a much more attractive option for many consumers."Samsung realises that growth opportunities in emerging markets are key to overall success of their business, and they have been smart enough to tap into it," said Mr Milroy."They have covered both ends of the spectrum really well."Last month, Samsung said that it is planning to launch handsets with curved displays.It exhibited prototype products with bendy and extendable screens in January this year, but there are doubts as to how this technology can be mass-produced cheaply and reliably.The firm also launched a smartwatch, the Galaxy Gear, last month - beating Microsoft, Apple and Google in the race to bring this type of technology to market.The smartwatch has a colour screen that can show alerts, be used for voice calls and run apps.</body>

      <body>A US patent for a database that uses DNA testing to tell prospective parents which traits their future offspring may inherit has been criticised by experts.23andMe says its Family Traits Inheritor Calculator can predict the risk of inheriting specific diseases as well as details such as height, weight, eye colour and even personality.Couples send the firm a saliva sample to see what their babies might be like.But critics have called the project "ethically and socially treacherous".The patent suggests the database could also be used by fertility clinics to find appropriate donors.But the Mountain View, California-based firm was quick to say this was no longer part of its plan."At the time 23andMe filed the patent, there was consideration that the technology could have potential applications for fertility clinics so language specific to the fertility treatment process was included in the patent," it said in a blog post."The company never pursued the concepts discussed in the patent beyond our Family Traits Inheritance Calculator, nor do we have any plans to do so."Instead it described the tool for prospective parents as "an enjoyable way to dip their toes into genetics".But critics remain concerned that such technology could be misused."It would be highly irresponsible for 23andMe or anyone else to offer a product or service based on this patent," said Marcy Darnovsky, executive director of the Center for Genetics and Society."It amounts to shopping for designer donors in an effort to produce designer babies."We believe the patent office made a serious mistake in allowing a patent that includes drop-down menus for which to choose a future child's traits."A project like this would also be ethically and socially treacherous."</body>

      <body>Scotland's largest health board has yet to fully assess the financial cost of a two-day IT systems crash which saw 709 appointments and procedures cancelled.NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (GGC) said it would be premature to speculate what caused the problem while diagnostic checks were continuing.The crash meant that 599 outpatient appointments were postponed along with 62 planned inpatient procedures and day cases and 48 chemotherapy treatments.The system was restored on Thursday.Problems with the health board's computer system were identified on Tuesday following the local September holiday weekend.Despite round-the-clock efforts from NHS GGC's own IT teams, with input from suppliers at Microsoft and Charteris, the issue was not resolved until Thursday.The delay and widespread nature of the problems saw NHS GGC chief executive Robert Calderwood issue an "unreserved apology" to patients who had appointments and treatments at 11 hospitals postponed.In the aftermath of the crash, BBC Scotland asked the health board how much the problem was likely to cost, who would pay and the likelihood of any legal action.In reply, a spokeswoman for NHS GGC said: "Our IT teams and our external experts are running full diagnostic checks to try and understand exactly what caused the problem in the first place and until a cause it identified it would be premature to speculate on what element of the system was responsible."The focus to date has been on resolving the issue and getting our systems back online and as such the cost implications have yet to be fully assessed."The input by our main IT suppliers is covered under existing contractual arrangements."</body>

      <body>The value of bitcoins has dropped after the closure of the clandestine Silk Road online marketplace.The FBI seized bitcoins worth approximately $3.6m (£2.2m) on Tuesday.The price of a bitcoin, a virtual currency for use online, fell steeply after the arrest of suspected website administrator Ross Ulbricht.Investor confidence may have been shaken by the association of bitcoins with illegal activity, according to a security expert."When there's a big bust, that's going to knock people's confidence in investing," said Rik Ferguson, a senior researcher at security company Trend Micro."The more a currency is associated with illegal activity, the more people will be nervous about using it," he said.Silk Road, which allowed users to trade in illegal drugs, required transactions to be made using the virtual currency.News of the closure was followed by a rapid drop in the price of bitcoins, according to figures from the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange.The going rate for the virtual currency dropped from more than $140 (£86) to around $110, before climbing back up to $123 (£75).Investors may have been concerned about the FBI's ability to confiscate bitcoins, said Mr Ferguson."Knowing that a currency could be seized or shut down could pressure people to look for alternative investment vehicles," he said.The FBI seized the virtual currency by getting hold of encryption keys for the bitcoins, according to Jerry Brito, George Mason University's technology policy director.The keys were made available through seized computer equipment, Mr Brito said in a blog post.The FBI then transferred the bitcoins to an address controlled by the US government, according to the seizure order (PDF).</body>

      <body>Taiwanese mobile phone maker HTC has reported its first ever loss as it continues to lose ground to rivals.It made a net loss of 2.97bn Taiwan dollars ($100m; £62m) in the three months to September.Its numbers are in sharp contrast with rival Samsung, which has forecast record profit for the same period.HTC was one of the early market leaders in Android smartphones, but has lost market share to rivals such as Samsung and Apple in recent years.It has launched new products, such as the HTC One, in an attempt to regain some of the lost ground.While the firm has claimed that the response to those products has been encouraging, analysts have warned that prospects of a recovery continue to remain weak.Laura Chen, an analyst at BNP Paribas, said that there were "no signs" of a recovery anytime soon.The company's shares have fallen more than 50% over the past 12 months amid concerns over its future growth.</body>

      <body>The number of children owning mobile phones has fallen for the first time, according to figures from the regulator, Ofcom.43% of youngsters aged five to fifteen now own a mobile, compared to 49% in 2012.Does this mean children are playing outside more, or huddling around monopoly boards?No. Instead of using mobiles, they are turning to tablet computers.Ofcom said that tablets have become " a must have device" for children of all ages.26% of children between the ages of twelve and fifteen now own a tablet, up from just 7% in 2012.The statistics also suggest that the next generation is getting tech savvy not long after getting out of nappies: 28% of infants between the ages of three and four now use a tablet computer at home.</body>

      <title>Lightning powers Frankenstein phone</title>
      <description>Scientists at the University of Southampton have harnessed the power of lightning strikes to charge a mobile phone.</description>

      <body>Some 200 years after Mary Shelley used lightning to breathe life into Frankenstein's monster, scientists have copied her idea to power a phone.The proof-of-concept experiment was conducted at the University of Southampton in collaboration with Nokia.The mobile firm warned users "not to try this at home".Harnessing nature in this way could provide power sources where electricity is in short supply, said experts.Using a transformer, the team recreated a lightning bolt in the lab by passing 200,000 volts across a 30cm (12in) air gap."We were amazed to see that the Nokia circuitry somehow stabilised the noisy signal, allowing the battery to be charged," said Neil Palmer, from the University of Southampton's high voltage laboratory."This discovery proves devices can be charged with a current that passes through the air, and is a huge step towards understanding a natural power like lightning and harnessing its energy."Lightning is a discharge of static electricity that occurs when there is an imbalance in the electrical charge between a cloud and the earth's surface.On average three people die in the UK each year from lightning strikes, according to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (Rospa)."We obviously aren't recommending people try this experiment at home, but we are always looking to disrupt and push the boundaries of technology," said Chris Weber, executive vice-president for sales at Nokia.Finding new ways to charge mobile phones and extend battery life is one of the number one priorities for the mobile industry."It's certainly a striking idea," said Ben Wood, of analyst firm CCS Insight."Nokia has been among the forerunners of device-charging technology for some time. It's also very committed to caring for the environment. So it's perhaps not surprising that the company's involved in what might appear to be a wacky idea."He thinks the concept might be useful in areas without reliable electricity."If you live in a remote village in India you might welcome the possibility of a communal device that charges phones."</body>

      <title>Delta gives pilots Microsoft tablets</title>
      <description>An American airline is using the latest Microsoft tablets in an effort to create paperless cockpits.</description>

      <body>American airline Delta is to equip 11,000 of its pilots with Microsoft Surface 2 tablets, in a bid to eliminate paper resources.The recently launched Surface 2, which runs the Windows RT 8.1 platform, will provide crews with key charts and navigation tools via a customised app.The tablets will replace the 17kg (2st 10lb) flight bags currently carried by pilots, reducing fuel consumption.The company expects all its cockpits to be paperless by the end of 2014.Delta had previously tested Apple iPads as potential Electronic Flight Bags (EFB), but has recently embraced Microsoft devices.It equipped 19,000 of its flight attendants with Nokia Lumia 820 smartphones in August, which run on a Windows operating system.The sight of pilots wheeling heavy cases through airports is a familiar one, but electronic alternatives have been around for decades.Many commercial airlines now use tablets as EFBs, and the devices are even common among single-seat, or recreational pilots.Delta pilots had been using their own tablet devices in the cockpit, but now only the Surface 2 will be allowed - a move that has been unpopular with some employees, who vented their frustrations on online forums.A Delta spokesman told the BBC that crews will be allowed to run personal applications on the Surface 2, as long as they use a separate profile.Delta's senior vice president, Capt Steve Dickson, said the Surface tablets would "minimise time spent looking for flight information", and allow pilots the "opportunity for greater situational awareness in the air and on the ground".The tablets will feature a custom-built app called FliteDeck Pro, developed by aerospace technology company Jeppesen, a subsidiary of Boeing.They will contain thousands of electronic documents, charts, navigational aids, checklists and other key reference materials.A spokesman for Delta said the company chose the Surface 2 "because of its ease of integration into existing IT systems as well as training and communications programs".Delta says it will roll out the device to pilots on its Boeing 757 and Boeing 767 fleets later this year, subject to approval by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).The airline estimates the weight reduction resulting from the switch to a paperless cockpit will reduce fuel usage by 1.2 million gallons per year - leading to a reduction in carbon emissions of 26 million pounds (12 million kg).Aviation consultant Chris Yates told the BBC the weight of flight bags "have been an issue for a while".</body>

      <title>Can we trust the spying state?</title>
      <description>Assessing the impact of Edward Snowden</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24399213</url>
      <date>1380887494</date>
      <body>How worried should we be by the state's capability to spy on us?Top secret documents, leaked by former American intelligence analyst Edward Snowden, have revealed the huge capacity of Britain and America's intelligence agencies - GCHQ and the NSA - to capture communications.Snowden and his supporters have argued that the public should know more about what is happening, while governments have argued that exposure has endangered national security.Four months after the first revelations in the Guardian newspaper, a picture has emerged of Britain and America's intelligence-gathering capabilities.Taken together, the reports point to an ambition to be able to reach into the vast global tide of digital communications and be able to pick out any message and read it, as well as to conduct wide-ranging searches of billions of records to look for patterns and connections."Even if you're not doing anything wrong you're being watched and recorded," argued Edward Snowden. "You should decide if they should be doing this."Those who have worked inside the secret state say that the power is vital for national security and only used for national security."You have to have a powerful capability to find the small amount you're looking for - but that doesn't mean the state is reading everyone's emails," former GCHQ director Sir David Omand told the BBC."What the state needs and law enforcement needs is the possibility of accessing the communications of the terrorists, the criminals, the kidnappers, the proliferators, the paedophiles. But those communications are all mixed up with everyone else's communications - there are 204 million emails a minute buzzing around the globe."So you have to have a powerful capability to find the small amount that you are looking for. But it doesn't mean that the state is reading everyone's emails, nor would that conceivably be feasible."But can we trust the state with this power?Technology allows it to do things it could never have done before - collecting and sifting through billions of records using data mining to find a connection or reconstructing a person's social interactions from the trail they leave behind online.The lack of sufficient oversight worries those who have campaigned on civil liberties."Part of the problem here is an age problem," says David Davis, a former Conservative Shadow Home Secretary."My generation of politicians - up to ones 20 years younger than me - don't really understand the extent to which we are intruding into people's privacy."Mr Davis believes the current system of oversight and accountability is not strong enough, especially when access to metadata about communications and interactions only requires internal authorisation within an intelligence agency - and not the warrant that is required to intercept the actual content of communications."There is no need to trust the state unless it has got a good reason and they must justify that to someone else - a judge or a magistrate or someone who is outside their system and can check they are using it properly," he argues.The claim that encryption standards have been deliberately weakened or had so-called "backdoors" added to allow access by intelligence agencies caused particular anger among those who have spent their careers trying to improve internet security and ensure the privacy of communications."The NSA's actions have done more than undermine online security - they've threatened to break the internet," Ross Anderson, Professor in Security Engineering at Cambridge University says of its attempts to ensure access."In order to do this they have compromised in various ways the protocols on which the internet relies. When you introduce these vulnerabilities, they are not just for the spies to use. They are available for bad guys to use as well."The Snowden documents have surprised many, including Prof Anderson, in terms of the scale of what they reveal."To find that they had built this machine and got it working is an eye-opener," he told the BBC.Critics of the intelligence agencies believe the disclosures have been important in starting a public debate about whether we know enough about the state's capability and whether there are enough controls and oversight.But many of those inside the intelligence world point to the damage which they say the revelations have done. They fear that since Edward Snowden is in Russia, the Russian state will have found some way of accessing the information."Part of me says that not even the KGB in its heyday of Philby, Burgess and Maclean in the 1950s could have dreamt of acquiring 58,000 highly classified intelligence documents," Sir David Omand told the BBC.The concern is also that the more that is revealed in public, the more the targets of surveillance adapt their behaviour. Sir David believes Snowden's actions will do real damage to national security."My fear is that we are now going to witness a slow-motion car crash in which gradually sources dry up, targets such as terrorists and cybercriminals will work out what are the kind of capabilities we have, and they will adopt their methods and be harder to track down," says the former GCHQ director.In the last week, the BBC was given direct access to a small selection of original documents held outside the UK that form the basis of stories the Guardian newspaper has already published.The scale of the capability they reveal - and the secrets they contain - make clear there are serious issues involved in balancing the public interest and national security. That balance lies at the heart of this debate - between the public interest and the right to know about what the state can do and the need for the state to protect its secrets and its capabilities for the sake of national security.The question remains - who gets to decide?</body>

      <title>How does Twitter make money?</title>
      <description>How does Twitter make its money?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24397472</url>
      <date>1380892903</date>
      <body>On Thursday, Twitter announced that it wanted to raise $1bn (£619m) by listing on the US stock markets, making it the biggest initial public offering (IPO) from a technology company since Facebook went public in May 2012.The giant micro-blogging site, founded just seven years ago, has been valued at about $10bn.So, how does Twitter make its money and how can we explain its high valuation?Twitter may have more than 218 million monthly users, but the company does not make money - yet.In papers filed with US regulators, it was revealed for the first time that Twitter made a loss of $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m.But analysts say the company is showing strong signs of growth, with revenue rising from just $28m in 2010 to $317m by the end of 2012.One research firm, eMarketer, estimates that Twitter's revenues from advertising sales will increase by more than 100% by the end of this year.Almost all of Twitter's revenue - about 85% of it - comes from advertising on its site.There are three main ways for a company or an individual to advertise on Twitter: by promoting a tweet that will appear in people's timelines, promoting a whole account, or promoting a trend.Twitter tends to charge its advertisers according to the amount of interaction their content generates.A budget is usually set at the start of the campaign and then the advertiser pays per click or per retweet.It also has a "bidding" system in which advertisers compete with each other to have their content appear in a particular space."One of the advantages of Twitter for marketers over traditional display advertising is they have worked really hard to make sure that advertising on Twitter is not interruptive," says Lara O'Reilly, senior reporter at Marketing Week.Anything that disrupts the user experience might reduce engagement from users, which in turn can put off advertisers, Ms O'Reilly says."It's not a flashy banner that gets in the way of something. It looks very native," she explains.Also, the company takes in a significant portion of its advertising revenue from mobile devices - in contrast with Facebook, which had not fully developed its mobile strategy at the time of its listing.As of 2013, more than 65% of Twitter's advertising revenue was generated from mobile devices.More than 75% of Twitter users accessed the site from their mobile phone during that same time period."Because Twitter was born as a mobile platform they already have this part sorted," Ms O'Reilly adds. "In investors' eyes, they have a mobile strategy."Data licensing is Twitter's second major revenue stream.The micro-blogger sells something known as the "firehose", its public data, which often adds up to about 500 million tweets each day.Companies can dive deep into the data to analyse consumer trends and sell their insight on to other brands and companies.Because the tweets are public, consumers also have access to this data.But Nick Halstead, founder of DataSift, one of the only two companies with access to the firehose, says that with sophisticated analysis companies can learn detailed and specific information about their users that, because of the volume of data, an ordinary user or company would not be able to get.Firms could use the data to do simple things, he says, like monitoring sentiment towards their brand or product.But the data can also be used in a much more complex way."One of my favourites is around stock levels," Mr Halstead says."For example, in the US football teams will analyse the popularity of players by region to work out how much they should buy of a particular football top to stock them in shops."He adds: "In the UK we all rush out and buy barbecue equipment on particular weekends, and supermarkets want to stock up when that happens, but they need three or four days to do that."You can use Twitter for modelling when people are planning to hold those kind of events."While Twitter may have proved it has the potential to make money, analysts say there are still hurdles to profitability.The company is spending a lot of money investing in advertising technology and expanding its team, says Clark Fredericksen, vice president at eMarketer.And it plans to keep spending after going public."We can expect that they will continue to make those investments because they're looking long-term," he says.But Mr Fredericksen adds Twitter needs to show it can monetise its international users and work with small businesses."When Twitter goes to advertisers a big part of their pitch is using Twitter to work with other media," he says, adding that the site gets huge traction with users around events like the Oscars or episodes of popular television shows such as Breaking Bad."Whether that formula will translate in smaller TV markets needs to be seen."</body>

      <title>Hydrogen: The car fuel of the future?</title>
      <description>Could hydrogen power the cars of tomorrow?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24381812</url>
      <date>1380843391</date>
      <body>A small British firm is looking forward to a day in which we will take our cars to the garage and fill them with hydrogen.Acal Energy, based in Runcorn in Cheshire, says it has developed a chemistry that could make hydrogen fuel cells much cheaper and longer-lasting than current technologies.It wants to license its chemistry to the world's car-makers, opening the way for hydrogen vehicles to sell in large volumes in 10 or 20 years' time."We believe this is one of the breakthrough technologies," says Brendan Bilton, the company's chief commercial officer."We're pretty confident and excited... that this will start unlocking the barriers," he continues, "Allowing fuel cells to be in products for mass market applications."It is a bold dream but not a crazy one.The automotive industry is already far advanced with plans for a first generation of hydrogen cars.Hyundai, the South Korean manufacturer, has said it will soon start selling a hydrogen-powered version of its ix35 model.Meanwhile, the Japanese giant Toyota is expected to unveil its first nearly-production-ready foray into the territory at next month's Tokyo motor show.Other big names - including Daimler and Volkswagen - are thought to be on track to get hydrogen vehicles into showrooms by 2017.But few expect these first-generation hydrogen cars to sell in very large numbers.Acal Energy is pitching its technology as the enabler for a second generation of less costly, more durable vehicles which could - if all goes to plan - pose a serious challenge to the long domination of the internal combustion engine from about 2020 onwards.To begin with, consumers may take a bit of persuading.Hydrogen is widely seen as a dangerous fuel - an image underpinned by that grainy newsreel footage of the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg airship bursting into flames in the 1930s.But actually, experts do not seem daunted by this particular technical challenge.They point out that hydrogen is already used and managed on a routine basis in industrial processes.The main reason anyone bothers with it as a fuel for the future is because it is emission-free at the point of use.The hydrogen is combined with oxygen in a bit of kit called a fuel cell. This process generates electricity to power the engine in the vehicle.The waste products are heat and harmless water.Water is benign, unlike the global warming-inducing, carbon dioxide emissions that spew from even the most efficient petrol and diesel vehicles.The car industry has been developing fuel cells that use costly platinum as the catalyst for generating power from hydrogen for many years.Acal Energy claims the problem with this current technology is that it results in fuel cells that are either prohibitively expensive because of the high platinum content, or prone to degrade quickly.To get round these issues, the company has developed what Mr Bilton describes as a "liquid catalyst" composed of "a dissolved solution of metal salts".As well as being a lot cheaper than a platinum catalyst, the liquid doubles up as a coolant and a cleaning agent that extends the life of the fuel cell by taking away damaging by-products as it circulates through a "regenerator"."We have a solution that both increases durability and reduces cost," says Mr Bilton.The company has its offices in a science park that until a few years ago was the research and development centre for the British chemicals giant ICI, now shrunken in size and foreign-owned.Intriguingly, the ideas behind Acal Energy's patented "FlowCath" technology derive from techniques developed to clean clothes more efficiently.The founder of the company, Dr Andrew Creeth, now its chief technology officer, spent much of his career working as a scientist for the washing powder giant Unilever.Development of the product is taking place in an environment not unlike a gigantic school chemistry lab - full of bubbling chemicals, complicated equipment and clever looking people in white coats.The company has already raised £15m ($24m) to finance its work from a mixture of private investors and government sources.It is currently hoping to raise another £15m or so from a new funding round, with the outcome due to be announced soon.Eventually, Acal Energy aims to earn profits from the business model pioneered by the successful British micro-chip designer Arm Holdings.Arm's technology is embedded in most of the chips used in the world's smartphones and tablet computers.It receives a small royalty payment every time anyone upgrades their mobile device.Acal Energy dreams of equal success from licensing its technology to car manufacturers in decades to come.The big questions, though, are does the technology work and will it be the breakthrough that the company claims?Prof Nigel Brandon of Imperial College in London, a leading academic in hydrogen energy, is well qualified to comment."The core technology looks very exciting," he says."There are some components in their system they need to improve. I don't see any reason why they can't do that but they've still got to do it," Prof Brandon adds.It is guarded optimism that could equally be applied to the whole field of hydrogen fuel cell energy.The big advantages over battery-powered electric vehicles are hydrogen cars can be refuelled in a just a few minutes, they can run for 300 or 400 miles between refuelling and they have the environmental benefits of battery driven cars with the same range and convenience as those with petrol or diesel engines.But there are also significant snags.Among them is the need to create a hugely expensive new infrastructure of hydrogen filling stations to replace garages.Hydrogen enthusiasts often quote the example of the internet.Once the demand was proven, a global network of optical fibre cables to carry data traffic was rapidly built despite the cost.Major players in the car industry are betting - but not yet on a truly large scale - that hydrogen energy will follow the same pattern.</body>

      <description>Avoid big costs for using the net on your phone when abroad</description>

      <body>You would have a shock if you received a £5,858 phone bill following a trip abroad.That's what Claude Douglas from Aldershot got because he forgot to turn off the data roaming function on his handset.Smartphones and tablets automatically seek out mobile connections in order to install updates so it's easy to run up a high bill.Here are some ways to avoid a nasty surprise when you get home.Check the data roaming prices for the country you are visiting with your network provider before you leave.Ask them about data bundles and packages which could make your bill cheaper.When you connect your mobile to a network abroad you are charged for the data you send and receive.The price for data is usually based on the volume you use, which is measured in kilobytes (KB) or megabytes (MB).Print out anything you need, such as local maps or places to eat and drink before you leave.If you only plan to make calls or send texts, switch your data roaming off before you leave home.You can do this in your device settings.If you're planning to access the internet reset your device's data usage counter then keep an eye on it.Try to stay within your allowance.Mobile operators must send customers a text message or email when they reach 80% and 100% of the agreed limit, according to Uswitch.There is a price cap on data roaming charges in the European Union (EU).In the EU, phone companies can charge no more than €0.45 (around 38p) per MB of data. This will then fall to €0.20 in July 2014.Data roaming costs can be significantly higher outside Europe.Try to avoid data heavy activities such accessing maps or downloading updates.Take advantage of free wi-fi in airports, cafes or hotels. Turn off data roaming on your device, just in case.If you have a free wi-fi connection its an especially good time for contacting friends and family through apps such as Google+ Hangouts, Facetime, Skype or Viber.Consider buying a local pay-as-you-go SIM card in the country you visit, for local prices. Beware though, it won't work if your phone is locked to a particular network.If you are a frequent traveller you can buy a global SIM. You can usually purchase these in your local mobile phone shop or supermarket.First of all, contact your network provider to look into the unexpected charges.You can make a formal complaint to them if you can't reach an agreement. Check the guidelines outlined on the back of your bill or on the company website.You can take your complaint to the Communications and Internet Services Adjudication Scheme (CISAS) or Ombudsman Services: Communications if you still don't resolve it.These are free services which provide an independent decision in a dispute for customers of communications companies.Watchdog is broadcast on BBC One, Wednesdays at 20:00.</body>

      <body>Every night, 16-year-old SJ arrives home from her school in London and gets back to running her global media empire.She is one of the UK's most famous Directioners - as fans of heart-throb boy band One Direction are known.And while she would never go so far as to call herself 1D's biggest fan - that's just asking for trouble - her Harry Styles-inspired account, @STYLATORARMY, is certainly up there: 850,000 followers and counting."I think it's just because I tweet the content other fans want to see and can relate to," she explains, deftly simplifying a social media strategy for which marketing agencies routinely charge thousands."Also because I talk to a lot of other fans on there and don't ignore people - that makes them like my account, spread the word and follow me."Her account is a mixture of news about the boys, dialogue with other fans, and general adoration for the X-Factor runners-up who have seemingly taken over the world.She is the epitome of the modern day super-fan - because in 2013, loving popstars means a lot more than simply running down the road after the Beatles.No, in an age where so-called "big data" is changing business, it's also changing what it means to idolise as well.And not only can music fans say they merely love an artist, but they can demonstrate that love with black and white statistics - and use it to their advantage.Buddybounce, a London-based start-up, is seeking to provide something of an idolisation dashboard for both fans and artists alike, taking into account the millions of plays, tweets and other interactions that take place every day."It is a modern-day fan club that allows fans to get their dream, really, of being the biggest fan and get closer to their idols," explains Emma Obanye, one of the company's co-founders, who has fond memories from her teens of standing outside BBC Television Centre, waiting for the Backstreet Boys.When a fan signs up to Buddybounce, they are given the option to plug in various different services to monitor how often they interact with an artist.The site can monitor how often you tweet about the band, or watch a YouTube clip, or listen to an album on Spotify, and a whole host of other things.To get noticed, it means hours and hours of effort to clock up the points.For the labels that use it, Buddybounce is a tool that is attempting to make sense of the thousands of digital acts of fandom that come an artist's way every day."We have developed a way for artists to keep track of who has been rewarded as a fan," explains Giulia Piu, Ms Obanye's business partner, where "rewards" mean some kind of reciprocal interaction from a band member."So instead of basing it on luck, we give them a way to try and interact with as many fans as possible."It is this idea of "luck" which causes perhaps the most friction within fan communities.Fans often go to extreme lengths to catch an artist's eye, says Directioner SJ."People come up with all sorts of ideas to get their attention. Sometimes people throw their phones on stage - once a girl hid in a bin!"It didn't work. The boys went inside... and then security took her out of the bin."Naturally, faced with the noise, it's hard for artists to spot the real devotees - and getting it wrong can cause great upset."Justin Bieber once mentioned someone on Twitter who had just listened to his album once, but wasn't much of a fan, and said, 'This album's all right,'" explains Ms Obanye."Justin retweeted her - and there was so much hate from within his fan base because they were like, 'Oh my god, you should be noticing us' and this, that and the other."For fans now, that kind of interaction is so sought after - a mention, a follow... it's a reward, it's what they dream, what they really want."The company has teamed up with artists, including Conor Maynard, who has granted highly sought-after meet-and-greets to fans with the best Buddybounce scores.So for fans like SJ, having such a huge following may see them rewarded by getting closer to the band.But being a "famous" fan has some dangerous downsides."Recently, I've had emails from a team of people," SJ says, "pretending they were from 1D's management.""They made it look like it was coming from them - it had [official domain] onedirectionmusic.com in the email address."Then they pretended to be [the band's record label] Syco as well, basically emailing me saying, 'We have an amazing opportunity for you.'"What followed was a stream of emails, spoofed tweets and messages with the sole intention of gaining control of SJ's account.It wasn't an isolated incident - fake accounts are set up frequently, capitalising on fans' dreams of meeting their idols, even if such offers do raise alarm bells as seemingly too good to be true.Social networks have put in place efforts to make spotting scams easier, the most obvious of which is Twitter's "blue tick" system - an added logo showing an account has been checked and is legitimate.It's a problem that artists and their labels need to remain on top of if they are to make sure that social media remains a key part of the marketing machine, up there with making music videos or even going on tour."It was the UK fans' excitement about One Direction that really got them started," argues Sunil Singhvi, Twitter's head of entertainment for the UK."The fans' ability, via Twitter, to tell Europeans about One Direction really catapulted them there, then from Europe to America, and now it's a global phenomenon."Sonny Takhar, chief executive for Syco Records, is equally enthused: "Social media has become the new radio, it's never broken an act globally like this before."And unsurprisingly, Directioner SJ agrees: "The boys have said themselves how social media has been part of their success, because if we make a 'trend' about them, you can see that worldwide - so it spreads the message to other nations."So while the super-fan of 2013 may have their work cut out to stay digitally popular, their efforts might not be in vain, even if they never do get to meet the subject of their adoration."There are a few others like SJ who are benefiting right now, from a young age," says SJ's mum, Rebecca."That is a credit to all those fans out there who have done so well in learning how to use Twitter as a tool to communicate with their idol, but at the same time within their own community as well."Quite a lot of young people are going to be getting very good jobs in that field very soon."Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC</body>

      <title>Tory MP pushes for early EU vote</title>
      <description>A prominent Conservative backbench MP says he will try to force the government to hold an early referendum on whether the UK should leave the EU.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24417670</url>
      <date>1381073991</date>
      <body>Prominent Conservative backbencher Adam Afriyie has said he will try to force the government to hold an early vote on whether the UK should leave the EU.The prime minister has promised to hold an in/out referendum in 2017 if he wins the next general election, but Mr Afriyie said voters were "not convinced" that it would happen.He said he would push for a vote in October 2014 instead.But Home Secretary Theresa May warned that Mr Afriyie had "got it wrong".And a Downing Street spokesman said of Mr Afriyie's plan: "The PM will not let it stand."Mr Afriyie - who has denied newspaper claims he is being groomed to replace party leader David Cameron - said he would table an amendment to the European Union (Referendum) Bill on Monday.Mr Cameron has pledged to renegotiate the UK's relationship with the EU before an in/out referendum in 2017.But, speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics programme, Mr Afriyie said there would be "ample time" to conduct this renegotiation by as early as next year."By having a referendum in 2014, it gives us 12 months to renegotiate," he said. "But more than that, it kick-starts negotiations."EU member states would need to "accommodate" British demands for reforms "if they wish us to remain", he added.He argued: "I think it strengthens the prime minister's hand."The MP said 80% of people wanted a referendum, and more than 50% of people wanted a referendum this side of the election."British businesses need certainty," he said."Look, we can carry on kicking this can down the road forever."But I've had a struggle with my conscience over this one."I don't want to cause any trouble over it, but I think it's absolutely essential that Parliament and MPs have the opportunity to search their souls and to give people a referendum this side of the election."In an article for the Mail on Sunday, he predicted that - without a referendum before 2015 - "large numbers of people will continue to vote UKIP whatever happens - and if they do, there is a distinct danger that Labour will gain a majority and we will never see a referendum at all".UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he would be "absolutely delighted" if Britain could have an early referendum.He told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme on Sunday that a referendum before 2015 would be good for British industry and business."Adam Afriyie has put his finger on the real problem - and that's that four years ago, Mr Cameron gave us a cast-iron guarantee that there would be a referendum."This time last year, he was saying there would not be a referendum, and he is now saying there should be a referendum."People are not quite sure what to believe."But Mrs May, speaking on the same programme, said: "We need to be negotiating that settlement with the European Union and then put to the British people the Europe of the future - not the Europe of the past - and give them that opportunity to say in or out."What is crucial is that we have, at the next election, a Conservative party that will be offering people that renegotiation of a new settlement with Europe, looking to the future and then putting that to the British people in an in/out referendum."Backbench Conservative MP James Wharton is attempting to enshrine his party leadership's referendum pledge in law - without the support of coalition partners the Liberal Democrats - with his European Union (Referendum) Bill.As a private member's bill, it is vulnerable to being delayed by procedural tactics from MPs who oppose it, and will only become law if the government allocates enough parliamentary time for its proponents to overcome any such hurdles.Mrs May warned that Mr Afriyie's amendment to the bill could "jeopardise" its prospects entirely.And Mr Wharton told BBC Radio 5 live the amendment could "kill" his bill."My concern is that any amendment, no matter how well-meaning it might be, is going to make the progress of the bill more difficult and it'll make it easier for those MPs who want to use procedural techniques to slow it down and stop it... that bit more possible."I don't want to see that. I'd like to see my bill go through and I think this harms the chances of that happening."Liberal Democrat deputy leader Simon Hughes, whose party opposes a referendum on the EU unless further powers are handed from Westminster to Brussels, said a 2014 referendum would be a "barmy" distraction from the government's attempts to boost UK economic growth.Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said the Conservative leadership had scheduled a referendum in 2017 due to "internal party management as much as anything else".The PM's promise of a "grand, unilateral renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU" was "deeply flawed and bound to unravel", he added, in pre-released extracts of a speech to be delivered in London on Tuesday.The European Union (Referendum) Bill is due to return to the House of Commons for further debate on 8 November.</body>

      <title>National Crime Agency hailed by May</title>
      <description>The UK's new National Crime Agency will "relentlessly pursue organised criminals", says Home Secretary Theresa May, ahead of the body's launch on Monday.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24418847</url>
      <date>1381075128</date>
      <body>The UK's new National Crime Agency will "relentlessly pursue organised criminals", Home Secretary Theresa May has told the BBC.She said the body, to launch on Monday, would focus on dealing with organised crime, economic crime, border policing, child protection and cybercrime.The new agency will replace the Serious Organised Crime Agency, known as Soca.Labour called the move a "rebranding exercise", and warned the NCA was "not strong enough" for future challenges.It is the third time since 1998 that an organised crime body has been set up.The National Crime Squad was set up 15 years ago, only to be replaced eight years later by Soca - which is now being scrapped.The NCA will work with each of the regional police forces in the UK and similar organisations abroad.The agency will have 4,500 officers and aims to adopt a more visible, joined-up approach than was previously the case.It has significant powers to compel police forces in England and Wales to provide assistance and carry out policing operations.Mrs May told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that the new agency was "designed to be a relentless crime-fighting body which will relentlessly pursue organised criminals".The home secretary said: "Crime is falling in this country, but we can't be complacent - and particularly on organised crime. I don't think the last government put enough emphasis on this.""At the core of the NCA will be intelligence. It will work at local level and regionally across government, not just the police. It will work internationally as well," she said.But shadow policing minister David Hanson said the NCA "doesn't match the government's hype"."Most of the NCA is just the rebranding of existing organisations such as the Serious Organised Crime Agency, but with a substantial 20% cut imposed by the Home Office on their overall budget," he said.Mr Hanson added: "The new organisation is not strong enough to deal with the exponential growth of economic and online crime. It will simply absorb the existing National Cyber Crime but with fewer resources."It is right to have stronger national action on organised crime with the NCA, on child exploitation and on intelligence - but the government has to support this effort and not simply use this as a rebranding exercise to hide substantial policing cuts."However, Mrs May told the BBC she was satisfied that the NCA was "going to be well-resourced".She said changes across policing had shown it was possible to fight crime while being "careful with the budgets that are available", as part of the government-wide commitment to "deal with the deficit".And she rejected comparisons with the US, amid suggestions that an organised crime agency was essentially a British version of the FBI."It is a British approach to dealing with an issue that we face," she said.Each police force in the UK has territorial responsibility for its particular area. Crimes that are carried out across more than one county or area usually involve officers from both areas.The new body will have a strategic role in which it will attempt to look at the bigger picture of organised crime in the UK, how it operates and how it can be disrupted.The NCA will answer directly to the home secretary and will have the same powers in Scotland as it does in England and Wales.The situation will be different in Northern Ireland, where the agency will carry out its border and customs functions, but not other crime-fighting roles.</body>

      <body>Tottenham Hotspur fans have ignored a police warning not to use the word "Yid" in chants at a match against West Ham United.Spurs supporters chanted "We'll sing what we want" and "Yid Army" at White Hart Lane, in north London.Before the match, the Met Police warned fans using the term could be arrested. One fan was arrested at half-time.Spurs have a strong Jewish following and have been the target of abuse from opposition fans.However, some Spurs supporters use the term themselves in an act of defiance.Before the game, which West Ham won 3-0, match commander Ch Supt Mick Johnson said "racism and offensive language have no place in football".A police spokesman said officers were speaking with fans on their way into the stadium about the issue.The Met Police said one Tottenham fan had been arrested for a public order offence and was in custody at a north London police station.The Football Association has warned supporters the use of such words could result in a banning order or criminal charges.Last month, the chairman of the footballers' union, Clarke Carlisle, said fans should be banned for using the word, but Prime Minister David Cameron has said people should not be prosecuted unless it is used as an insult.On Friday, the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust said they believed no Spurs fan "uses the term 'yid' in an offensive or insulting way".However, it said the distinction between the use of the term as a "badge of honour and a call to arms" and the "anti-Semitic abuse levelled at our fans by supporters of opposing teams, appears to have been dismissed by the FA and the Metropolitan Police".Before the game, West Ham United also warned supporters that "unacceptable conduct" at the match could lead to fans being banned from attending games.</body>

      <body>Former cabinet minister Liam Fox successfully claimed 3p of taxpayers' money for a car journey of about 100 metres, expenses documents show.Mr Fox's office made the claim after he travelled a distance recorded as 0.06 miles in October 2012.He had visited a concrete firm before heading within his north Somerset base to a constituency surgery in Yatton.The ex-defence secretary made another 15 claims of under £1 for car travel approved in 2012-13, the files showed.These included 24p for a 0.54-mile journey from a constituency surgery to a school competition in Clevedon, and 44p for a 0.98-mile journey from a local politics event at Winford Manor to Winford School.Under the current system, MPs can claim 45p per mile.MPs claimed a total of £23m in personal expenses in the year to April.Paperwork from the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) shows Mr Fox claimed £3,866.31 in travel expenses - including rail fares - in the last financial year.The claim for the car journey to Yatton was paid last December, according to the notes.Mr Fox told the Sunday People: "I don't do my expenses. My office does them. But they are all done according to the rules for travel distances."Last year, the Conservative MP had to repay £3,000 of expenses after it was found he had allowed his friend Adam Werritty to live at his taxpayer-funded second home for a year rent-free.He was also criticised for allowing their Atlantic Bridge think tank to be run from his parliamentary offices.Mr Fox resigned from his cabinet position in October 2011 over his relationship with Mr Werritty.</body>

      <title>'Over half of schools failing in RE'</title>
      <description>More than half of schools in England are failing pupils on religious education, says Ofsted.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24399813</url>
      <date>1381051158</date>
      <body>More than half of England's schools are failing pupils on religious education, the schools watchdog Ofsted has said.Its report accuses schools and the government of failing to focus effectively on the subject.It adds that six in 10 schools are not "realising the subject's full potential" in an increasingly globalised and multicultural century.The Religious Education Council for England and Wales called the findings disappointing but not surprising.The report highlights low standards, weak teaching, weak examination provision and confusion about the purpose of RE.In particular, it says the recent introduction of the English Baccalaureate measure for pupils who achieve grade C or above in English, mathematics, science, a language and either history or geography, ignores RE and has further marginalised the subject.The report echoes comments by the Education Secretary Michael Gove. In July he told religious leaders RE had "suffered" because of government changes.He said he had thought that because schools have a statutory duty to provide RE lessons the subject was protected.Ofsted's report, Religious Education: realising the potential, says the subject "plays a key role in promoting social cohesion and the virtues of respect and empathy, which are important in our diverse society" but it finds "many pupils leave school with scant subject knowledge and understanding".It adds: "Moreover RE teaching often fails to challenge and extend pupils' ability to explore fundamental questions about human life, religion and belief."Inspectors visited a sample of 185 schools, both primary and secondary, between September 2009 and July 2012.They found achievement and teaching in RE was less than good in six out of 10 primary schools, and in fewer than half of secondary schools and that not enough had been done to improve provision since a previous report in 2010.Teaching in primary schools was "not good enough because of weaknesses in teachers understanding of the subject", they found.Standards were higher for GCSE and sixth form students but even at GCSE level teaching often "failed to secure the core aim of the examination specifications, that is to enable pupils to adopt an enquiring, critical and reflective approach to the study of religion."The authors urge the Department for Education (DfE) to consider whether the quality and quantity of statutory RE provision should be left to schools to decide - or specified by central government.They want the DfE to work with professional RE teaching associations to "clarify the aims and purposes of RE" and to improve teacher training.Schools should ensure that teaching deepens "pupils' understanding of the nature, diversity and impact of religion and belief in the contemporary world," they urge.John Keast, chairman of the Religious Education Council for England and Wales said they had been warning "for some time about the poor state of religious education in many schools".He said they would publish their own report and RE curriculum later in October."It is now vital that the DfE works with the Religious Education Council on putting things right. We can do better than this."Stephen Evans of the National Secular Society said the recommendations did not go far enough."With the freedom to determine their own syllabus for RE, many schools with a religious character abuse the subject and use it for missionising."Young people would be better served by a new national curriculum subject for all pupils that covers a variety of religious, non-religious and secular philosophies and world views."Meanwhile, Gail Larkin from the National Association of Head Teachers said consecutive governments were responsible for schools placing less emphasis on the subject.She said: "Some of the major policy changes that we've had, the impact has been to convey the message that RE is of less value than other subjects."So, as a head teacher... we are concentrating more - as we've been told to do by consecutive governments - on core subjects and subjects that can be measured.""Unfortunately", she added, "I think RE has fallen off the radar".</body>

      <title>McCanns 'encouraged' by new inquiry</title>

      <body>The parents of missing Madeleine McCann have said they are "greatly encouraged" by new information about their daughter's disappearance.Madeleine was three when she went missing in Portugal, in May 2007.A reconstruction of events surrounding her disappearance will be broadcast on the BBC's Crimewatch on 14 October.Kate and Gerry McCann said "pieces of the jigsaw" had started fitting together since Scotland Yard opened its own investigation in July.Police have said the Crimewatch appeal, which will also be broadcast in the Netherlands and Germany, is based on the "latest, most detailed understanding" of events.It comes after police said phone records may be key to the case.Officers from the Metropolitan Police are analysing data from phones belonging to people who were in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz at the time of Madeleine's disappearance. They say 41 people of interest have been identified.Madeleine, from Rothley, Leicestershire, went missing from a holiday apartment as her parents dined at a nearby tapas restaurant with friends at the Algarve resort.Her parents said: "We are greatly encouraged by new information coming to light with pieces of the jigsaw now fitting together."We're really hopeful the forthcoming Crimewatch appeal will bring further new evidence which will take us a step closer to finding Madeleine and to bringing those responsible for her abduction to justice."The Metropolitan Police also said they hoped the reconstruction would produce new lines of inquiry.Detectives, who have interviewed 442 people as part of their investigation - codenamed Operation Grange - are attempting to track down as many people present in the Portuguese resort around 3 May 2007, when Madeleine disappeared, as possible.Senior investigating officer, Det Ch Insp Andy Redwood, said: "We now believe we have the most complete picture to date of the events surrounding her disappearance."We are making targeted and new appeals for help from the public."I truly believe there are people out there who hold the key to Madeleine's disappearance, and that so far they may be completely unaware of that fact."A three-year-old actress will play Madeleine in the Crimewatch reconstruction. A small production team from the programme spent a week filming abroad for the new appeal.The McCanns and Mr Redwood will also speak to presenter Kirsty Young live in the studio.The Portuguese investigation officially closed in July 2008, but authorities are backing the Scotland Yard inquiry and officers from both countries will work together pursuing new leads.The Metropolitan Police now has a team of six Portuguese detectives based in Faro who are carrying out inquiries on its behalf.</body>

      <body>Gambian officials have confirmed that the country will not be competing in the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.Last week, the west African nation branded the 54-member grouping, which includes the UK and most of its former colonies, a "neo-colonial institution".At the time it was unclear whether it would still be competing in the Games.However, Games organisers have confirmed The Gambia's withdrawal and said alternative plans would be made for the baton relay.A spokesman for Glasgow 2014 said: "All Commonwealth nations and territories are entitled to compete in the Commonwealth Games."Glasgow 2014 has received confirmation from the Commonwealth Games Federation of the formal withdrawal of The Gambia from the Commonwealth."It is our understanding, therefore, that The Gambia does not intend to enter a team and compete in next year's Games."The spokesman said the Queen's Baton Relay, which visits all nations and territories of the Commonwealth, would no longer go to The Gambia."This planning is now under development in collaboration with the Commonwealth Games Federation and we will provide further information in the near future," he said.</body>

      <body>Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham will not accept "slurs on his character" from his Conservative counterpart Jeremy Hunt, a Labour spokesman has said.Mr Hunt had suggested on Twitter that Mr Burnham attempted to "cover up" NHS failings when he was in government.As a result, the Labour MP instructed his lawyers to write to the heath secretary, the spokesman confirmed.A Conservative spokesman described Mr Burnham's move as "astonishing".Labour believes that Mr Hunt's tweet was "a step too far" and is seeking a retraction and apology unless Mr Hunt can provide evidence to substantiate his allegation, BBC political correspondent Alan Soady said.The Labour spokesman said: "Instead of focusing on what he should be doing and tackling the AandE crisis, Jeremy Hunt has spent all year orchestrating a smear campaign against Andy Burnham. On Friday, he went a step too far."This is behaviour unbecoming of a secretary of state. Andy Burnham is not prepared to accept these unfounded slurs on his character and the last government. He has therefore instructed lawyers to act on his behalf."In response, a Conservative source told our correspondent: "It's astonishing that Labour are still trying to deny the clear link between [England's health watchdog] the CQC's decision not to expose poor hospital care under the last government and the political pressure applied to the CQC by Labour ministers."Mr Hunt's tweet is understood to relate to a CQC investigation into Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which was placed in "special measures" in July after recording above-average death rates.Conservative MP Steve Barclay has said a series of emails - which he obtained and published on Friday after making a freedom of information request to the CQC - showed that Mr Burnham had put "pressure on the regulator to water down its concerns" about the trust when he was health secretary under Labour.</body>

      <body>Prince Harry has honoured special forces soldiers killed in the line of duty during an unannounced visit to the headquarters of the Australian SAS.He joined families of fallen Special Air Service Regiment members to lay wreaths at Campbell Barracks in Perth.Prince Harry was accompanied by Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott when he flew into the city for the last engagement of his 36-hour state visit.He is now heading to a Dubai fundraiser for his aids charity, Sentebale.Prince Harry, a captain in the British Army who has served twice in Afghanistan, met and had lunch with current and former members of the Australian SAS unit and toured their base.Wreaths were laid in the Garden of Reflection at the barracks, and he also met members of groups which provide support to the unit.The commanding officer, whose identity was only given as "Lieutenant Colonel G", said the unit was "humbled and grateful" that the prince had "made the time to join us"."Prince Harry knows what it means to serve his nation on operations and most importantly what it means to the families of those serving," he said."Today's visit by His Royal Highness and the prime minister represents a unique opportunity to recognise the broader SAS regimental family that provides the back-up and support at home."Families play a critical role for those serving in the SASR, and indeed the whole of the Australian Defence Force, and we are thankful that the families of some of our serving, former and fallen members were able to be here today."On Saturday, Prince Harry begun his first official trip to Australia by joining celebrations to mark its navy's arrival at Sydney Harbour 100 years ago.He attended the International Fleet Review, featuring some 40 warships from 17 countries, including the Royal Navy's type 45 destroyer, HMS Daring.Thousands of people flocked to the harbour as Prince Harry met crowds before boarding a boat for a reception with Mr Abbott at his official residence in the city.</body>

      <body>UKIP leader Nigel Farage has confirmed he is planning to stand as an MP at the next general election, due in 2015.Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, he insisted that the 2014 elections to the European Parliament were his main priority.But the UKIP leader revealed he had been considering a bid to become MP for Folkestone and Hythe.He also said he thought PM David Cameron and his cabinet colleagues regarded UKIP as "the lower orders".Mr Farage refused to be drawn on speculation that he would stand in another Kent constituency, South Thanet."I was thinking about Folkestone," he replied."But it doesn't really matter. I'm not going say where I'm standing. I'm not even going to think about where I'm standing."I am going to stand, but let's get the European elections out the way first."On the subject of whether there was likely to be any deal between UKIP and the Conservatives at the next general election, he said: "It's perfectly clear that Mr Cameron and the cabinet view us as being part of the lower orders, and we're really not good enough for them."He said he was "perfectly relaxed" about his party co-operating with the Conservatives at the local level, but he added: "I don't think it will happen."The current MP for Folkestone and Hythe, the Conservatives' Damian Collins won a 10,122-vote majority at the general election in 2010 on nearly 50% of the vote.The UKIP candidate won 4.6% of the vote, but in the May 2013 county council elections three UKIP members were voted in to represent Folkestone.Mr Farage explained his party's general election strategy: "We will target our resources where we won county council seats, where we won district council seats following the model that the Lib Dems used under Paddy Ashdown building on local strength."If you can win at council level, you can win at parliamentary level."Mr Collins took to Twitter to comment: "Nigel Farage says 'it doesn't really matter' whether he commits to stand to be an MP in Folkestone or Thanet."He's got no commitment."</body>

      <body>Lord Sugar has been investigated by police after he was accused of posting a racist message on Twitter.The businessman and star of The Apprentice posted a photo of a child apparently of Chinese origin crying.He wrote: "The kid in the middle is upset because he was told off for leaving the production line of the iPhone 5."Merseyside Police said it had investigated a complaint but said "no criminal offences" had taken place.Lord Sugar's spokesman said he would not be commenting on the complaint.Liverpool shop owner Nichola Szeto had taken offence about the reference to the Asian factories where the mobile phones are produced and complained about the "racist tweet" to the Metropolitan Police.She was then contacted by Merseyside Police and went to a Liverpool police station to make a statement about the tweet, which was posted on 30 September.A police spokesman said: "Merseyside Police can confirm officers received a complaint in relation to the tweet sent on the evening of Sunday September 30."The communication has been examined by the force's specialist hate crime investigation team and at this time it has been recorded as a hate incident and no criminal offences have taken place."Officers from the specialist team will be contacting the person who made the initial complaint to discuss this."</body>

      <body>An athletics track to replace the Don Valley facility where Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill trained has opened in Sheffield.About £325,000 has been spent on cleaning and refurbishing the Woodburn Road facility, which has been closed for two years.New floodlights have been installed, seating added and improvements have been made to the track.Don Valley Stadium closed at the end of September and is to be knocked down.The Woodburn Road track has been leased by Sheffield Hallam University and will be called the Sheffield Hallam University City Athletics Stadium.Capacity is much lower than at the Don Valley Stadium. It can seat about 150 people compared to its predecessor's 25,000.The city council provided £150,000 towards the improvements, with the same amount provided by Sport England and the balance from England Athletics.The Woodburn Road stadium had been criticised by Ennis-Hill's coach Toni Minichello, who previously said he thought it was "unlikely" to meet a "standard that would cater for all the athletic events".He said the running track was up to standard, but claimed the facilities for javelin throwing and other parts of the heptathlon were not good enough and could force Olympic champion Ennis-Hill to seek alternative training venues.But Mark Swales, director of estates and facilities at the university, said the new stadium would be successful."We'll be working in partnership with Hallamshire Harriers, Sheffield Athletics Club and Sheffield City Council to really make Woodburn a centre of excellence for athletics for the Sheffield city region," he said."We'll be working with English Athletics as well, they want to bring some of their regional events here."We've already got substantial booking in here from schools, school competitions, school athletics as well for next summer."</body>

      <title>Homes evacuated after pub blaze</title>

      <date>1381054502</date>
      <body>A number of homes had to be evacuated on Saturday evening after a fire at a derelict pub in Cornwall.The blaze at the Old Ship in Garret Street, Cawsand, started at about 19:30 BST.The pub, which was in the middle of a row of terraced houses, was destroyed by the fire. Crews had to pump water directly from the sea to prevent the fire spreading.No-one was injured and an investigation into the cause of the fire has begun.About 12 residents from at least five nearby properties were forced to leave their homes and spend the night with friends and family.A structural engineer is due to assess the stability of the pub and adjoining houses later.Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service spokesman Mark Blatchford said difficult access to the narrow street meant pumps and engines had to park about 200m (650ft) away from the burning building."The property was well alight with flames and smoke coming out of every window and door," he said."The pub was pretty much gone when we arrived, our priority was to stop the fire spreading up and down the street, so we had to evacuate the properties nearby."Water supplies aren't great. We had to set a base pump into the sea but fortunately it was high tide."Anyone who witnessed the beginning of the fire has been asked to contact Devon and Cornwall Police."We are investigating with Cornwall Fire Service, but it's too early to speculate on how the fire started," a police spokesman said.</body>

      <title>'No NHS pay freeze' in Scotland</title>
      <description>Scottish Health Secretary Alex Neil pledges not to impose a pay freeze on NHS workers in Scotland.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-24419314</url>
      <date>1381054422</date>
      <body>The Scottish government has pledged not to impose a pay freeze on NHS workers in Scotland.It came after the Department of Health (DoH) at Westminster urged UK-wide pay review bodies to cancel a planned 1% pay rise next year.It said the rise was unaffordable and the money should instead be used to help maintain safe staffing levels.But Scottish Health Minister Alex Neil said he had "no intention" of withholding the rise in Scotland.He said the Scottish government had made its own proposals to the pay review bodies, proposing that the 1% rise is implemented in 2014/15 as well as giving further help to those on low wages by ensuring no one employed by the health service earns less than the Scottish Living Wage.Mr Neil accused Westminster counterpart Jeremy Hunt of "bad faith" and said withholding the pay rise would be a "betrayal of the NHS".He added: "To steal the pay rise back from workers' hands will destabilise the NHS across the UK and damage morale."The Scottish government has no intention of following Jeremy Hunt and we will use our independence over the health service to block this move."But with UK wide agreement to Agenda for Change - which established pay policy in the health service - this damaging right wing approach could hit Scottish services, and under the current funding settlement could drive down Scotland's budget in the future."My message to Hunt is unequivocal - Scotland rejects your politics, your attack on staff, and your desire to destroy the real NHS."The health secretary said he would be meeting with unions "to ensure this ludicrous proposal finds no foundation in Scotland."On Saturday it emerged the DoH had made a written submission to the NHS Pay Review Body in which it said the proposed 1% rise was unaffordable alongside the current system, which sees many staff automatically receive incremental annual rises.The move has been criticised by Labour and the unions.The DoH has stressed no decisions on changes to pay have been taken, and said independent bodies will make their recommendations in February or March next year.However, in its submission, the DoH pointed to a staff survey suggesting high levels of motivation and morale, and said there should only be basic pay increases if there is "strong evidence" recruitment, retention, morale or motivation issues require this.The submission said: "Employers cannot pay staff more, improve quality and productivity and protect jobs."Careful and prudent management of the NHS pay bill is critical if we are to maintain the right number of frontline staff with the right skills. We believe more affordable employment contracts can help deliver better care and improve job security."The NHS Pay Review Body makes recommendations on the remuneration of all staff paid under Agenda for Change and employed in the NHS.Its recommendations apply to about 1.5 million staff in NHS Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with the exception of doctors, dentists and very senior managers.It reports separately to the health ministers in each country of the UK, who can accept, reject or modify its recommendation.</body>

      <body>A couple have solved the mystery of who owned an oil painting depicting an "ugly" woman which was posted to them without explanation.Keith and Sue Webb received the unmarked portrait at their home in Winchester, Hampshire on Wednesday.It had no covering letter and Mrs Webb banished it to the garage, calling the woman pictured a "horrid old crone".A relative in Australia has told Mr Webb she recognised it from his late uncle's house, where it once hung.Mr Webb, an 82-year-old industrial property landlord, now hopes to keep the portrait in the family, having initially shown a dislike to it.But he still does not know who sent the painting in the post."I believe it's a portrait of my great, great grandmother," Mr Webb said."Alison, my late cousin's wife in Perth, Western Australia saw the initial story about Sue and I being sent the picture and solved the mystery."She remembered staying with my uncle, Charles Webb, in Winchester in the 1970s and that the painting used to hang on his bedroom wall."Her daughters were absolutely terrified of it and wouldn't go near it."Mr Webb was his uncle's executor when he died, but understands the picture was given to his younger brother Leigh."Having initially been so rude about the painting, it now turns out it's come from within the family," he added."There's been interest from one of my children who might like to hang it in a holiday home he lets."But in the meantime, Sue's insisting it's not moving from the garage."Mr and Mrs Webb took the portrait to a local auctioneers who told them it was between 200 and 300 years old and worth about £200.</body>

      <body>Tickets for next year's Glastonbury Festival have sold out in record time, according to organisers.Michael and Emily Eavis issued a joint statement confirming all 120,000 remaining tickets had been sold in just one hour and 27 minutes.They said they were "blown away" by the numbers logging on and were "genuinely sorry" that so many had missed out.Ticketing website See Tickets had earlier apologised to customers on Twitter for "technical difficulties".The site, which had been managing the sale of tickets for Glastonbury, wrote that the issues had led to "a very difficult half an hour" before the site stabilised, later adding that it was selling 3,000 tickets a minute.Prices for the 2014 event had been increased by £10 to £210, plus a booking fee, but festival-goers could pay a deposit of £50 before settling their bill in April.For the first time, coach packages were available three days earlier, with all 15,000 tickets selling out in half an hour.A statement by the father and daughter Eavis team, Michael and Emily, was posted on the festival's own Twitter feed, saying: "We genuinely try to make the ticket system as fair as it can be, but when demand outstrips supply, it is an unfortunate inevitability that some people will be left disappointed."They went on to thank people for their "incredible support", adding: "We really don't take it for granted and we are exceedingly fortunate to have that loyalty."No acts have yet been confirmed to play at the festival at Worthy Farm between 26 and 29 June next year, but there is already speculation about who will headline.David Bowie is one of the bookies' favourites, with other rumours including Foo Fighters and Fleetwood Mac.This year saw Arctic Monkeys, Rolling Stones and Mumford and Sons top the bill on the festival's famous Pyramid Stage.</body>

      <title>Parade protests 'must be peaceful'</title>
      <description>A senior member of the Democratic Unionist Party says any parade protests must be peaceful, after an Orangeman talks about a possible campaign of civil disobedience.</description>

      <body>A senior member of the Democratic Unionist Party has defended the right of Protestants to protest about parades but said they must be peaceful.Arlene Foster's comments come after a senior Orangeman said protests over a contentious Orange Order parade could include "civil disobedience".William Mawhinney made the comments at a protest rally over restrictions to a 12 July parade in north Belfast.Ms Foster urged young people not to get involved in criminal activity.Northern Ireland's enterprise minister told the BBC's Sunday Politics programme: "We very much defend the right of people to protest on any issue."But what must happen, and I do make this very clear, is that people must remain within the law of the land when they engage in protest," she said."Some people, during the flags protest, went out to protest and things went further than they should have gone and therefore those young people now have a criminal conviction"I do not want to see young people, whether in Belfast or anywhere else in Northern Ireland, blighted with a criminal conviction for something that they will regret for the rest of their lives."The Orange Order has been staging a protest in the Woodvale area every Saturday since part of its parade was stopped in July.It was prevented from returning along part of the Crumlin Road separating loyalist and nationalist communities. Several nights of violence ensued.Addressing a crowd of about 500 people on the Woodvale Road on Saturday, Mr Mawhinney said the parade protests would be "up-scaled... right up to civil disobedience if that's what it takes".The County Grand Secretary in Belfast added: "The camp and the protests continue as strongly as they ever did from when they first began."Mr Mawhinney was flanked by a number of politicians, including her party colleague Nelson McCausland of the Democratic Unionist Party.When asked about Mr McCausland's appearance at the rally, Ms Foster, told the BBC: "I know that Nelson will have been there, and he will have been exercising his right, but he will also have been exercising his responsibility as he always does in those occasions."He will have been bringing calm to the area and talking to people to make sure that things did not get out of hand and I very much defend the right of Nelson to be there."The Orange Order has not said exactly what it means by civil disobedience, but has insisted it doesn't mean violence.Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said positive leadership was needed within unionism to take a stand against "illegal marches, sectarianism and violence, and the provocative actions of the Orange Order in Belfast"."The lack of real leadership by unionist leaders has had a negative effect on public opinion and confidence in the power-sharing institutions is being undermined," he said.</body>

      <body>A new course record has been set at Cardiff's annual half marathon, with Kenyan Lentaknai Lengurisi completing the 13.1 mile (21km) race in sub 62 minutes.His official time was 61 minutes and 51 seconds, running 4 minute and 44 second miles.The women's race was won by Kenyan Purity Kimetto in 1 hour 14 minutes and 22 seconds.First Welshman Dewi Griffiths finished in 65 minutes and two seconds.The race, in its 11th year, attracted 19,000 runners on Sunday.Most runners are continuing to cross the finish line in the city centre.The course's personal best comes as Cardiff Council bids to hold the IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in 2016.The Welsh government, UK Athletics and the council have agreed a funding package of £910,000 to host the biennial event.Proposals will go before the council, which said the event could boost the city's economy by £1m, next week.Another £2m would be raised for charities and good causes through race sponsorship, the council said.UK Athletics and the Welsh government will jointly provide up to £360,000, with the Welsh government giving a further £400,000 contingency for the successful delivery of the race.The council will contribute £150,000 from its corporate initiatives fund if the bid is successful.Councillor Ramesh Patel, cabinet member for sport, said: "The Lloyds Bank Cardiff Half Marathon is now a major event for Wales and shows the city has the capacity, infrastructure and draw to be able to host the World Half Marathon Championships."It would be hugely exciting for Cardiff to host this event which further compliments the city's vast sporting event portfolio, promoting it to an international audience."Before the start of the marathon, there was a minute's applause in tribute to Paralympian wheelchair athlete Chris Hallam, who died in August.Hallam, from Pontypool, won medals at three Paralympic Games as well as twice winning the London Marathon.A number of roads are closed until 14:00 BST.King Edward VII Avenue, from Boulevard de Nantes to its junction with City Hall Road will be shut until 18:00 BST on Monday.Rolling road closures will be applied along the half marathon's route. Roads around the route are also affected, including North Road, which leads to the start line on Castle Street. Diversions are in place.</body>

      <body>Companies in Wales could do more to export goods to new markets, according to the South Wales Chamber of Commerce.Director Graham Morgan said businesses should create more opportunities to tap into emerging markets.Wales exported £633m worth of goods to the Middle East in 2012, making it the fourth most popular destination.The Welsh government said international trade remains a priority. A Royal Bank of Scotland report said firms could use markets like Mexico and Brazil more.Mr Morgan told BBC Wales Today: "There are certainly a range of mechanisms in place to move into new markets."I think there's probably a shortfall in the number of businesses that have fantastic products and fantastic services but don't appreciate that they can now be sold in overseas markets."And the more we can get business proprietors to think in terms of where they can be making headway in what has been a difficult economic market, the better for Wales."Chris Howarth, managing director of confectionery company Bon Bon Buddies in Blackwood, Caerphilly county, said it was challenging trading across different parts of world.He said: "You have to get it right in a completely different cultural environment so you have to be committed to learning a different set of rules of the game... every single market is different."The Welsh government said they have a programme of trade missions and exhibitions in place which will take in markets including China, India, Brazil and Russia.</body>

      <body>Some of the world's top athletes joined thousands of people taking part in the Great Scottish Run.About 23,000 club, fun and charity runners took part in the half-marathon and 10k events in Glasgow.Ethiopian former Olympic and World champion Haile Gebrselassie won the half marathon event with a new course record of 61 minutes and nine seconds.A number of roads were closed for the races, which started at George Square and finished at Glasgow Green.Three Scots finished in the first four of the women's half marathon, with Leeds-based Susan Partridge beating Freya Ross to the line. Kenya's Pauline Wanjiku third and Steph Twell fourth.Following his victory, Gebrselassie said: "After losing out in the last mile at the Bupa Great North Run I had to get clear today and decided to make my move when I did and it worked so well, I'm happy with this win."Scottish Finance Minister John Swinney was among those due to run the half marathon course.World champion swimmer Keri-Anne Payne, Celtic manager Neil Lennon and Emmerdale stars Chris Chittell and Eden Taylor Draper were due to run in the 10k.Olympian Katherine Grainger started runners off from George Square while paralympian Richard Whitehead was at the finish line.Both courses took runners past city landmarks including the Riverside Museum, Finnieston Crane, Clyde Arc and the new Hydro venue.The half-marathon route also included a loop through Bellahouston Park.Late running engineering work delayed some runners travelling to the event by train, but Scotrail later said the service was back to normal.Network Rail said signalling works on the main Edinburgh to Glasgow line had been going on overnight and had been due to finish at 07:45 but had overrun to 09:30.A spokeswoman apologised for any inconvenience.Separately, a number of ScotRail services were affected by industrial action by some train drivers.The Aslef members voted to take action after rejecting a pay offer of 6.4%.ScotRail said routes likely to be affected were Glasgow Central to East Kilbride, Larkhall, Gourock, Neilson, Newton, and Wemyss Bay, and also Helensburgh to Edinburgh via Bathgate.On Saturday about 3,000 children took part in Super Saturday events for families and juniors.The Great Scottish Run was first held in 1982 and has grown each year, with 24,089 people taking part in the 2012 events.</body>

      <body>A loss of power at a city dockyard had "potential nuclear implications", a Ministry of Defence (MoD) report said.The 90-minute power-loss, at Devonport in Plymouth, could have been "catastrophic", a nuclear analyst said.Caused by a central nuclear switchboard fault at the yard, it was the most potentially dangerous of 50 "events" recorded in 2012.The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) has now issued an improvement notice on the dockyard.Power is essential at the dockyard to ensure reactors on the nuclear submarines are kept cool.The incident, in July 2012, was regarded as code-B on the sliding scale of "severity" - code A being the most severe.John Large, an engineer and independent nuclear analyst, said: "The loss of power was a catastrophic event, which is what happened before the Fukushima meltdown."According to the improvement notice the dockyard, which is operated by Babcock Marine, has until 31 March 2014 to meet its own operating rules and instructions.No-one from the operating firm has been available for comment.However, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said it took all safety concerns "extremely seriously" and was aware of the ONR improvement notice.In a statement issued to BBC News, the MoD said it understood Babcock Marine had agreed an improvement programme with the ONR to "enable the identified issues to be addressed in a timely manner"."We will continue to work with Babcock Marine and safety regulators to ensure that safety is managed effectively across the wider Devonport site," a spokesperson said.The ONR said Devonport Royal Dockyard Limited had taken action to remedy some of the problems identified and it was satisfied there was "no immediate impact on safety", but it believed the improvement notice was "necessary".In the "site event" report for HM Naval Base Devonport, the MoD said 50 events in 2012 was higher number than the two previous years, but "broadly similar" to the number recorded in 2008 and 2009.The report said it was "reasonable" to expect a rise in the number of events as there had been a corresponding increase in the number of "submarine" days in specially-designed nuclear dockyard berths."With more routine and non-routine nuclear activity, it is reasonable to expect an associated increase in the number of events," the report said.The report said previously unidentified faults in standby diesel generators meant the secondary power source was unable to re-supply power for more than 90 minutes."Through a combination of factors and additional unidentified defects, this defect was revealed, and resulted in an event with potential nuclear implications," the report said.An earthquake and tsunami off the coast of Japan in March 2011 knocked out cooling systems to reactors at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, three of which melted down.Devonport resident Ian Avent, who is also the organiser of the Campaign Against Nuclear Storage and Radiation, described the loss of power as "scary".Oliver Colvile, the Conservative MP for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, said he was very concerned about the situation and intended to speak to Babcock Marine about the actions it was taking.He said he expected the "highest levels of safety" to be maintained at the dockyard.</body>

      <body>A hospital patient whose death has prompted a murder inquiry was a "really brilliant man", say neighbours.Police are investigating whether James May, 76, had been given a drugs overdose before he died at the James Paget Hospital, in Norfolk.A hospital worker was arrested on suspicion of murder on Saturday and has been bailed until November.Neighbours of Mr May, who died on 20 September, described the Great Yarmouth man as "humble and welcoming".Paying tribute to him, Matthew Palmer, 21, also said Mr May was a "good neighbour", "enthusiastic" and a "really brilliant man."Mr May, a retired driving instructor, moved to Great Yarmouth about 10 years ago from London, in search of a quieter pace of life.Diane Halliday, 67, also of Great Yarmouth, had known Mr May since he retired to the town and said he was a "genuinely nice chap"."It was so sad to think that he'd died, but to have all this [the investigation] as well is just unbelievable.""He could have had a good few more years left... it knocks you back a bit to think this could have happened... you can't take it all in."The James Paget University Hospital reported an allegation of medical malpractice in connection with Mr May's death, 10 days after the incident in September.Det Ch Insp Paul Durham, from the Norfolk and Suffolk Major Investigation Team, said: "We are investigating an allegation that a drugs overdose was administered to a patient, leading to his death."A Home Office post-mortem, carried out earlier this week, determined the cause of Mr May's death as heart failure and we now await the results of further toxicology tests which will help inform our inquiry."Mr May lived with his terrier-cross dog Polly and was a keen member of the Hemsby short mat bowls club. He also enjoyed time in his boat on the Norfolk Broads.</body>

      <description>Ravel Morrison scores a superb solo goal as West Ham defeat Tottenham to climb out of the Premier League's bottom three.</description>

      <body>Ravel Morrison scored a superb solo goal as West Ham earned a vital win against Tottenham to climb out of the Premier League's bottom three.Winston Reid's close-range effort just after the hour gave the Hammers a first away goal of the season.A ricochet off Ricardo Vaz Te doubled the lead before Morrison ran the length of the Spurs half to chip in.Tottenham's best chances fell to Jermain Defoe but he was denied by West Ham goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen.West Ham's first away win in nine Premier League games was their first at White Hart Lane since 1999 and lifts them to 13th in the table. Meanwhile, Spurs' second defeat of the season ended a six-game unbeaten run and sees them drop to sixth.It was more of a surprise given that Andre Villas-Boas's side had the joint-tightest defence in the league, having conceded only twice before this encounter.But the day arguably belonged to Morrison, 20, who capped a confident and hard-working display with a goal that underlined a talent that many observers have spoken of in glowing terms.The former Manchester United player was called into the England Under-21 squad last week and this performance showed that the youngster could perhaps now turn the corner after having questions asked of his temperament.Before Morrison's move to East London in January 2012, then United boss Sir Alex Ferguson said: "He's got a great talent but it's how to deal with it that is important."West Ham boss Sam Allardyce took the unusual step of naming no recognised strikers in his side, as Morrison rotated with Mohamed Diame as the furthest player forward but it proved a masterstroke.Morrison was the visitors' most potent player in the first half and they almost took the lead when he was tripped near the edge of the box.Rather than take a shot, Mark Noble enterprisingly scooped the ball over the wall and Kevin Nolan volleyed just wide from an angle.At the other end, Andros Townsend gave watching England manager Roy Hodgson something to think about ahead of the World Cup qualifiers with another performance of direct running and confident dribbling.But, despite several decent crosses from the right, Defoe could not make contact on his first Premier League start of the season.Despite their tight defence, Villas-Boas's side have only scored six goals in six games prior to this match and their frustrations in front of goal continued after the break when Jaaskelainen twice thwarted Defoe.James Tomkins had a header well saved by Hugo Lloris from a corner, yet it was Tottenham who began to show the greater purpose and Reid's opener on 66 minutes came against the run of play.Reid expertly headed Stewart Downing's corner towards goal only for it to be blocked by Nolan on the line. The ball bounced back to the Kiwi and he made no mistake with the rebound.Vaz Te added a privileged second soon after. The Portuguese was found by Noble and his tame shot hit Loris before bouncing back to him and in off his knee.There was nothing lucky about Morrison's goal, though. He collected Diame's clever flick and ran with the ball before taking on Michael Dawson and signalling his talent with a wonderfully composed finish.</body>

      <description>Jack Wilshere earns Arsenal a point at West Brom to return the Gunners to the top of the Premier League.</description>

      <body>Jack Wilshere's second-half strike earned Arsenal a point at West Brom and returned the Gunners to the top of the Premier League on goal difference.The Baggies took the lead when an unmarked Claudio Yacob headed home Morgan Amalfitano's cross.Nicolas Anelka missed two good chances to double the home side's lead shortly before Wilshere's deflected 20-yard shot levelled for Arsenal.Olivier Giroud almost won it for the visitors but Boaz Myhill denied him.Defeat would have been harsh on Steve Clarke's side, who followed last weekend's victory against champions Manchester United with a slick performance which saw them become the first team to take points off Arsenal since Aston Villa won at Emirates Stadium on the opening day.The Baggies were composed in possession and a constant threat in the final third as the fluid movement and creativity of their front four continually exposed the Arsenal defence.England Under-21 international Saido Berahino, who scored the winner at Old Trafford last week, produced another excellent display up front while Amalfitano and Stephane Sessegnon linked well with Anelka to cause the visitors problems.But Arsenal also had their moments and showed a resilience which is marking them out as genuine title contenders.They were indebted to goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny early on, the Pole getting down well to deny Berahino, who cut inside and fired in a low shot.At the other end, Aaron Ramsey had Arsenal's best opportunity and the impressive Myhill reacted instinctively to beat the ball clear after his fellow Welshman's shot found its way through a crowd of players.That save lifted the hosts, who went straight up to the other end and took the lead - Amalfitano putting an inch-perfect cross into the box from the right for Yacob to head home from six yards out.The hosts pressed for a second after the break and former Arsenal striker Anelka miscontrolled in the area after Berahino powered past Per Mertesacker on the left.Mertesacker was having a shaky 10 minutes - which led to him being shifted from the right side of central defence to the left - and Anelka sprinted past the German before curling a shot agonisingly wide.Arsene Wenger's side gradually began to assert their authority in midfield and equalised in impressive style when Tomas Rosicky and Giroud combined to tee up Wilshere for his first Premier League goal in almost three years.The England midfielder was now snapping into the tackle and spraying passes around - his clever ball forward splitting the Baggies defence and putting Giroud through, but Myhill saved well as the Frenchman tried to round him.Both sides continued to drive forward but struggled to break through, settling for a hard-earned point which sends Arsenal into the two-week international break at the league's summit and lifts West Brom up to 12th.</body>

      <description>Kristian Thomas wins bronze in the vault to claim Great Britain's first ever medal in the event at the World Championships.</description>

      <body>Kristian Thomas won bronze in the vault to claim Britain's first ever medal in the event at the World Gymnastics.The London 2012 team bronze medallist delivered his two vaults to near-perfection on Sunday in Antwerp.Thomas, 24, finished with an average score of 15.233, behind South Korea's Yang Hak-Seon (15.533) and American Steven Legendre (15.249)."To make the final was the first aim, so I'm over the moon. I'm really happy and proud," said Thomas."Once again, the British gymnasts have proved how good we are and I'm delighted to have contributed to that success."The Wolverhampton gymnast has long been considered a vital contributor in the team event, exemplified by the stunning vault he produced during London 2012's team final, helping GB to bronze.But unlike world medallists Louis Smith, Daniel Keatings, Dan Purvis and most recently Max Whitlock, the podium had eluded him in individual competition until now.Nor had 2013 shaped up well for Thomas, who missed much of the year - including the European Championships in April - through a fractured tibia."Three weeks ago I didn't even know if I'd be coming to the World Championships," he told BBC Sport."It's been a real rollercoaster of a year. Three weeks ago I was still battling to try to get into the team. To nail the first vault the way I did was so special."Yang, the defending world and Olympic champion and the last to compete, cemented his dominance of the apparatus with another victory.Britain finish this year's World Championships with two medals, supplied by Thomas's vault and Whitlock on the pommel horse.Add to that two near-misses - Whitlock's fourth place in an exceptionally competitive all-around final on Thursday, with Purvis narrowly missing bronze in the men's floor event - and British Gymnastics can be satisfied that the men are building on last year's Olympic success."Today, watching Kristian's final on the vault was really good. For GB to come away with two medals is amazing," said Whitlock, a double bronze medallist at London 2012 yet making his Worlds debut this year.Elsewhere on Sunday, 16-year-old Simone Biles completed a hugely successful week for both her and the United States squad with victory in the women's floor final.Biles, already the all-around champion, scored 15.000 to beat Italy's Vanessa Ferrari, her nearest challenger with 14.633.The first-year senior also won silver on the vault and bronze on the balance beam at these championships.The US won an unprecedented 12 world medals in Belgium, three more than the previous American record set in Melbourne eight years earlier.The US men contributed four medals without winning a world title, while the women won at least one medal in every event - Kyla Ross taking three silvers and McKayla Maroney lifting the world vault title.Russia's Aliya Mustafina won the beam event for her first world title in three years, and Japanese all-around champion Kohei Uchimura shared parallel bars gold with China's Lin Chaopan.Sunday's concluding final, on the high bar, lived up to expectations as Olympic champion Epke Zonderland once again stunned the crowd with a daring and difficult routine.The Dutchman scored 16.000 for his first world title, beating German friend and arch-rival Fabian Hambuechen, who could only manage 15.933 in response.</body>

      <title>Why is a children's book about rabbits being read at weddings?</title>
      <description>More and more people are including children's books in their wedding readings. Why?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24379830</url>
      <date>1380845753</date>
      <body>More and more people are including children's books in their wedding readings. Why?When Hannah Larkin married her husband Jason, she had three readings, but one stood out - a reading from Guess How Much I Love You by Sam McBratney.In her late teens, Larkin had fallen in love with the story of Big Nutbrown Hare and Little Nutbrown Hare and their attempt to articulate their love. It remained one of her favourite books.Said hares try to outdo each other in their hyperbolic declarations of love for each other.A sample section runs: '"I love you all the way down the lane as far as the river," cried Little Nutbrown Hare. "I love you across the river and over the hills," said Big Nutbrown Hare.'It might seem saccharine stuff to a hardened cynic but many brides and grooms seem to feel differently."Although it's a children's book, it resonates with adult life because it's about the infinite nature of genuine love," says Larkin. At the wedding at a hotel in the New Forest, her sister read the entire book. Her husband's goddaughter Amelia looked up at her, mesmerised by the story.The "classic" Christian wedding reading is 1 Corinthians 13, with its ruminations on faith, hope and love (or charity), but modern couples are varying their readings, says Bernadette Chapman, director of the UK Alliance of Wedding Planners."That's the big thing with weddings now... it's about [the couple's] personalities," says Chapman. Children's literature has become so popular because it's inter-generational and everyone can relate to it."They're trying to choose readings that are easy to understand, that are fun to read and fun to listen to and just bring a smile to people's faces."Chapman says readings from children's books have become popular among remarrying couples who want to give children from previous relationships a key role by reading from a favourite story.One of the most popular readings is taken from The Velveteen Rabbit by Margery Williams. It tells the tale of a small stuffed rabbit and its longing to become real through the love of a human.When actress Drew Barrymore married Will Kopelman in 2012, Kopelman's sister read a passage from the book. Prince William and Prince Harry read alternate lines from it at the wedding of Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall.The growing popularity of wedding blogs has prompted more creativity in the choice of reading, Chapman says.But why does children's literature continue to have such resonance? Prof Maria Nikolajeva, director of the University of Cambridge-Homerton Research and Teaching Centre for Children's Literature, says that children's books give us a shared experience.Nikolajeva's daughter had a reading from The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery at her wedding and Nikolajeva read from The Velveteen Rabbit during the ceremony.She says children's books are adept at expressing profound thoughts and philosophy about life in a very concise manner, which makes them ideal for wedding readings.Books like The Velveteen Rabbit take on existential questions, such as what it means to be a human being, in a way that we can connect with."As we grow up we are exploring the world and we very often explore the world through the characters of literature because it offers us an experience that we cannot always find in the everyday world," says Nikolajeva.She says children love to revisit books as they grow older because as they change, they "interact with the text each time, understanding it more and getting involved with it more".Children's books can be harder to write than longer form fiction, the theory goes, because an author has to articulate a concept in a way that can be reinterpreted as we develop.Even as adults, we can find new meaning in children's literature.When Andrea Dell married her husband Robert at a hotel in Wigan, she opted for a reading from The Owl and the Pussycat by Edward Lear, a poem she remembered from childhood. For Dell, it took on new meaning with its references to getting married."It was just an opportunity to make everybody smile and something that was familiar to them and also was quite evocative with the imagery in it, and also I'm a huge cat fan," says Dell.She says it is something they can share with their children in years to come and might even be a reading her daughter chooses for her wedding."People are moving away from the traditional; they like to mix things up a bit. We had some music from Star Wars in our proceedings," says Dell, whose husband is a big Star Wars fan."I think there is so much variety in children's literature. I think people are looking a bit further afield to try and make it a bit more interesting and a bit more unique to them."You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>A lost city captured on film</title>
      <description>Photographer Andrei Pandele captured a dramatic period of change for Romania under communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. For many, his pictures are now a painful reminder of what they lost.</description>

      <body>Andrei Pandele was a young architect when he began photographing his home country, Romania, in the 1970s. His camera captured a period of huge change under communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. For some, his stunning photos are now a painful reminder of a time of destruction, and a life lost."It's cool! I really like it." Born in the year of the 1989 Revolution, Paul is one of a new generation of Romanians - multilingual, well-educated and ambitious for his country.He is understandably proud of the giant House of the People, once Ceausescu's palace. After all, it's now home to Romania's fledgling democracy and only trumped in size by the Pentagon building in the US.We are hovering in one of its many airless, pointlessly large halls, waiting for a conference on sustainable tourism to finish in the never-ending room next door.I don't share Paul's sentiments. The vast slabs of marble feel suffocating - we may as well be stuck in the centre of an outsized wedding cake.Photographer Andrei Pandele is emphatic: "The Palace? Ha! It is a wall in the way of the people. A dam, even."We have met in a tea shop in the old Jewish quarter of Bucharest. There are photographs from his collection on every wall.They're exceptional images rarely caught on camera, but then Andrei is an exceptional man - tall, dignified and handsome at 65.It is thanks to his fearless vision that Ceausescu's relentless attack on Bucharest can be seen stage by stage - as if peeling away the layers of an onion."I was an architect," he explains. "I could find plans [and] approximate what they would destroy. Not exactly, no-one knew that. They were wild, totally out of control."Seven square kilometres of the city centre were destroyed to make way for the Palace of the People. Andrei wanted to take some pictures before old Bucharest disappeared altogether.I've been coming to Romania for 20 years but I have never seen images like these.A city caught in its very own Armageddon. Andrei preserved a Bucharest that no longer exists - the exquisite glass-covered market, the archways, cobbled streets, the vine-clad villas, the city once called the "little Paris of the East".But in many of the pictures the mighty onslaught has already begun - innumerable cranes chewing their way through people's lives, the facade of the crazy palace looming up over the threatened cityscape. And then, in some others, there's just snow or dust and the desert of demolition.Not a verbose man, in front of his pictures, Andrei becomes almost chatty."After two years of photographing the architectural destruction I decided that it was very bad, but it was even worse that they were ruining the lives of 22 million people. So I began to take pictures of everyday life. I think they are much more striking."The next series of photographs showing everyday life under Ceausescu is like a haunting silent movie. We see desolate streets when there was no petrol, queues for food that never came, trams straddled by desperate commuters, useless cars buried under snow and a wedding party picking their way through the streets. No-one is smiling.I can't decide which is more astonishing - the photographs or the photographer? How did he get away with taking pictures which so openly "denigrated the socialist reality", a crime that carried a six-year prison sentence in communist Romania?Andrei explains that he was a part-time sports photographer, so he had a state-sanctioned excuse to carry a camera.And he tells me I must understand the strange psychology of the state policemen: "Tessa, they are very aggressive with those who are afraid, but much less aggressive with people who are not at all afraid. I was confident. Don't hide if you don't want to get caught."Andrei's brazen behaviour captured a vital slice of Romania's painful past.Yet it took a full 18 years before he could show his photographs to an astonished Romanian public.The people in power did not want to be reminded of what they had got so wrong. He had to wait.Andrei shrugs: "I have seen women over 40 exploding in tears in front of my photographs, because they saw their life had been destroyed, but they realised it 20 years too late. And a lot of teenagers laughed neurotically - because they recognised something in the pictures that their parents had told them, but they had never seen for themselves."My young friend Paul represents the generation that escaped that hell.He's silenced by Andrei - his experience, his audacity, his pictures.Later, as we walk back through the centre of Bucharest, taking in its schizophrenic appearance with fresh eyes, Paul quietly concedes: 'It is a pity Ceausescu had to build the palace complex right in the middle of the old city."From Our Own Correspondent: Listen online or download the podcast.BBC Radio 4: Saturdays at 11:30 and some Thursdays at 11:00BBC World Service: Short editions Monday-Friday - see World Service programme schedule.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>The man who dreamed of the atom bomb</title>
      <description>Lisa Jardine tells the story of Leo Szilard, physicist and key pioneer in the development of the atomic bomb.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24395740</url>
      <date>1380905125</date>
      <body>Leo Szilard was the man who first realised that nuclear power could be used to build a bomb of terrifying proportions. Lisa Jardine considers what his story has to say about the responsibilities of science.The figure of Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard loomed large in our house when I was a child. He was held up to me as an exemplary figure in science - a man who had made fundamental breakthroughs in nuclear physics, but whose acute sense of moral probity led him in the end to denounce the very advances he had helped make. Only later did I learn an alternative version of his story.Almost exactly 80 years ago, in early October 1933, Szilard was in London, in transit from Nazi Germany, when an idea came to him that would lead directly to the ultimate weapon of war - the atomic bomb.An article in the Times two weeks earlier had reported a lecture at the British Association by Lord Rutherford - the Nobel prize-winning British physicist and head of the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. Rutherford had described splitting the atom by bombarding it with protons, but had gone on to say that any suggestion that the energy released might be harnessed as a source of power was "talking moonshine".The report caught Szilard's attention. He pondered it obsessively. Surely Rutherford was wrong? Then, early on a dismal, grey morning, as he waited on foot at a traffic light to cross busy Southampton Row near his hotel, the answer came to him in a flash.If a neutron, fired at an atom, produces the release of (say) two neutrons, each of which hits another atom, which both in turn release two more neutrons, which each go on to collide with two further atoms, a nuclear chain reaction would take place, releasing unimaginable amounts of energy.Szilard tells this story twice, with slightly differing details. But the tale itself is consistent and delightfully vivid. The challenge of Rutherford's remark, the heavy cold that had prevented Szilard's attending the lecture, the days spent thinking about it and the flash of inspiration just as the traffic light changed.Szilard immediately recognised the importance of his idea. To ensure its security he patented it in the name of the British Admiralty. The patent included a clear description of "neutron induced chain reactions to create explosions".In August 1939, by which time Szilard had moved on to America, he wrote to President Franklin Roosevelt to inform him that "a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium" was undoubtedly possible, and could lead to the construction of "extremely powerful bombs of a new type". Germany, he warned, might even now be developing such a weapon. "A single bomb of this type," he wrote, "carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory."The letter was signed by Szilard and Albert Einstein. By the time it reached Roosevelt, Germany had invaded Poland. With war now a certainty, the urgency was not lost on the US president. A committee was set up to pursue the nuclear initiative, out of which emerged what came to be known as the Manhattan Project - the hugely ambitious and massively funded programme to develop a functioning atomic bomb in the shortest possible time.But less than six years later in 1945, Szilard campaigned with equal passion to persuade the American government not to use the atomic bomb against a civilian population. He understood better than anyone the enormity of the devastation such a weapon could cause. But his petition, although signed by a large number of nuclear physicists, never reached the president.So devastated was Szilard at his failure to avert the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (the story I was brought up on concluded) that he refused to do any further work in nuclear physics. Instead he moved research areas entirely, to molecular biology - a field concerned with the origins of life rather than its destruction. To my father this audacious step captured the essence of scientific moral responsibility. And I carried Szilard's story with me as I grew up.Today, however, I know that inspiring as it is, there are problems with this tale. As often happens with history, we have to treat with caution a narrative that fits so neatly the interests and preoccupations of the age in which it is written.At the time I was being told this story, Britain was in the depths of the Cold War. In the post-war years it turned out that Szilard (and indeed my own father) found it impossible to obtain work on any scientific project that involved nuclear physics. Though they were barely aware of the stigma themselves, the communist sympathies of their youth barred them from getting the necessary security clearance.So Szilard did not leave physics of his own accord. At the end of the war he was abruptly dismissed from the Manhattan Project by its military head, Gen Leslie Groves. Groves had always suspected him of having Russian sympathies, and now deemed him too high a security risk. Forced to change field, Szilard was indeed prescient in choosing molecular biology, which less than a decade later would uncover "the secret of life" in the form of the structure of DNA.My father's exemplary tale unravels further when we consider the way it presents the progress towards a functioning atomic bomb. It narrates a smooth development from Rutherford's lecture in London, through Szilard's (and his fellow-emigres') journey from Nazi Germany via London to the United States, and Szilard's single-minded preoccupation with the potential threat of nuclear weapons, to the Manhattan Project, and finally to its very American triumphant - or tragic - outcome.But actually Szilard the Hungarian had carried out the crucial early research with the Italian emigre Enrico Fermi, continuing it with him in the early years of the Manhattan Project, where the two of them succeeded in creating a controlled chain reaction - a prerequisite for a functioning bomb. Meanwhile, independently in Britain considerable progress was being made towards a nuclear weapon (a project code-named "Tube Alloys") with the direct encouragement of the prime minister Winston Churchill (who as Graham Farmelo tells us in a recent book, was surprisingly up-to-date himself in nuclear physics). In September 1940 the so-called Tizard mission delivered the top secret work of Tube Alloys to the Americans, to be developed with the greater manpower and financial resources available in the US. The British work made its own vital contribution to the project.Here is a much more fragmented, syncopated and international story, in which it is entirely unclear whether any one nation ultimately takes the credit or blame for the science and engineering behind the atomic bomb. Nor does it carry the clear didactic message of my original.There is one final twist to what started out as a simple story. Some of you will have noticed that I gave the date of Szilard's eureka moment at that traffic light on Southampton Row as October 1933. You may have had a date in September in your mind. The truth is, Szilard tells the story twice, as I mentioned. In one version he records reading the Times report and immediately having the idea of a chain reaction (on 12 September). In the other he recalls fretting over the problem for weeks in his hotel room and pacing the streets of London deep in thought, until the idea eventually came to him (in early October).So although the beginning of the story comes from the mouth of the man himself, we cannot be certain which version is correct. As a historian I have chosen the second as the more plausible, particularly in view of that heavy cold which Szilard tells us prevented his attending Rutherford's lecture on 11 September. But that remains surmise.Historical narratives are never without their agendas. My father's generation lived under the shadow of Hiroshima and Nagasaki - he had been sent to do reconnaissance there only a few months after the bombs were dropped and had seen the consequences all too close up. He told me a story which redeemed the scientist from the enormity of events brought about by fundamental research in physics. It was a story that held the scientist responsible for lethal applications of "pure" research, and proposed Szilard as an iconic figure, for recognising and taking that responsibility upon himself.My father's story of Leo Szilard may not have been the truth. But it taught me, as a child, a lasting, salutary lesson about science and human values.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Gove pressed over Muslim free school</title>
      <description>Labour asks the education secretary to explain what checks his department have carried out on the Al-Madinah Muslim free school.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24417085</url>
      <date>1381015587</date>
      <body>Michael Gove is coming under pressure to explain what checks his department carried out on a Muslim free school which has been closed since Tuesday.Al-Madinah, in Derby, cited "health and safety concerns" when it shut last week. It is due to reopen on Monday.But Labour called on the education secretary to "reassure the public" amid persistent concerns over the school.The Department for Education was already investigating allegations against the school, a spokesman said.Free schools - which can be opened by anyone - are state-funded but not overseen by the local authority.Al-Madinah says it has a "strong Muslim ethos" and when it opened last year claimed to be the first such school in the country for pupils from reception age to 16.Preliminary findings from an Ofsted inspection into the school gave it the lowest possible rating.The Department for Education had asked Ofsted to bring their inspection forward. Allegations had been made by parents and staff that pupils at Al-Madinah had been told to follow strict Islamic practices.Former staff have claimed non-Muslim female teachers came under pressure to wear the hijab head-scarf.It has also been reported that girls were made to sit at the back of class.The school denies pupils have been segregated and says its dress code was made clear to anyone wanting to work at the school.Sources have told the BBC the closure was due to incomplete records of child protection checks being done on all staff.But ahead of the school re-opening to pupils on Monday, shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said the situation must be "urgently clarified in order to reassure the public".In a letter to Mr Gove the Labour MP said: "This is, of course, not the first time that there have been questions surrounding your department's oversight of a free school."While I understand that there is an ongoing investigation, the reports concerning this school are of extreme concern to parents and the wider community."Given the confusion as to why the school has closed, and that pupils may be returning to the school on Monday, I would ask that these matters be clarified urgently in order to reassure the public."He called on the department to say what "due diligence" was carried out when the school was approved.And he asked whether there had been "appropriate vetting" of staff and what oversight ministers had had since it opened.Interim principal Stuart Wilson closed the school after Ofsted inspectors shared their preliminary findings with him."While unfortunate, my decision to close the school related to a short-term health and safety issue that has now been completely resolved and will not reoccur," a statement on the school's website read.The school "will be open as normal on Monday," Mr Wilson added.A Department for Education spokesman said: "We were already investigating this school before the allegations became public."We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection. We are waiting for Ofsted's final report and considering all legal options."Mr Twigg also questioned what would happen to children at the school if it did not reopen on Monday or had to close again.</body>

      <title>Union anger at health pay proposal</title>
      <description>Unions criticise government moves to halt a 1% pay rise for all NHS staff in England, arguing they deserve to be rewarded for holding the health service together.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24408681</url>
      <date>1380991958</date>
      <body>Unions have criticised government moves to halt a 1% pay rise for all NHS staff in England.The Department of Health said the increase was unaffordable alongside the current system which sees many staff automatically receive incremental annual rises.It has urged the NHS pay review body to withhold the rise for 1.3m staff.Rachael Maskell, of the Unite trade union, said staff deserved the pay reward for "holding the NHS together".Health trusts are currently under pressure to make savings and the NHS wage bill accounts for around 40% of its budget.All public sector pay increases are capped at 1%.The Department of Health (DoH) proposes using the funding intended for the rise to "modernise" pay structures.It says automatic increments - linked to length of service and satisfactory performance - add £900m to salary costs.The DoH has stressed no decisions on changes to pay have been taken, insisting independent bodies will make their recommendations in February or March next year.But the plans, outlined in the DoH's submission to two independent pay review bodies, have been criticised by Unite and Labour.Ms Maskell, of Unite, said: "The Department of Health have got other choices. They're entering into a reorganisation which is costing £3bn, which nobody asked for and isn't adding anything to patient care."It is about choices and the NHS staff have already had two years of a pay freeze - 1% last year - and, quite frankly, are really falling behind inflation now with their wages."Staff moraleShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme motivation and morale was down among frontline health workers "at this very difficult time".However, in its submission the DoH points to a staff survey suggesting high levels of motivation and morale and says there should only be basic pay increases if there is "strong evidence" recruitment, retention, morale or motivation issues require this.Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the NHS reorganisation had taken money out of front-line services."There has to be pay restraint in the NHS as well as other public services... but the NHS has been through some very difficult years - so have NHS staff - and this was a modest increase to recognise the pressure that all families are under."To take it away, to break that promise, is just another kick in the teeth."Staff representatives have also reacted angrily to the plans."What they have done is inflammatory," said Christina McAnea, head of health at Unison and joint chairwoman of the NHS Staff Council."We are not going to negotiate while a gun is held to our head for a paltry 1% pay rise - our members will not react well to that."Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association council said this would not result in staff leaving in their "droves".However he added: "We're going to find it increasingly hard to recruit, partly for the specialist skills and partly for the numbers of staff that we'd need to bring into the health service to implement the safe minimum staffing levels."Health minister Anna Soubry defended the government 's stance telling the BBC: "This is about making sure we pay our NHS staff well and we reward their improvement in skills."This system works in other public sectors and the private sector. People want to make sure that they are getting good quality, first class services especially at a time when the NHS faces challenges."Earlier a DoH spokeswoman said: "Many NHS staff have continued to receive pay rises of up to 3.5% and we want to keep working with the trade unions and employers on affordable pay."The measures we are proposing will help increase quality for patients and help us realise our vision of an affordable seven-day service."In June Chancellor George Osborne said ministers were working to "remove automatic pay rises" for teachers, health professionals, prison and police staff.The DoH drew attention to Mr Osborne's comments and confirmed it wanted NHS pay to have "stronger links to performance, quality and productivity".</body>

      <title>Rail minister Burns stands down</title>
      <description>Transport Minister Simon Burns resigns from the government to run for the position of deputy Commons Speaker.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24396224</url>
      <date>1380897834</date>
      <body>Transport Minister Simon Burns has resigned from the government to run for the position of deputy Commons Speaker.The MP for Chelmsford has been responsible for the controversial HS2 rail link during the past year, having previously been a health minister.One of the three deputy Speaker positions is vacant after previous incumbent Nigel Evans stood down to fight sexual assault charges.Mr Burns has clashed with Speaker John Bercow several times in the past.On one occasion, Mr Burns described the man under whom he now seeks to serve as a "stupid sanctimonious dwarf".BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said the Conservative MP had apologised afterwards - but only to groups of people who felt insulted, not necessarily to the Speaker himself.Were he to be elected, relations between the pair would not be altogether comfortable, our correspondent added.There are plenty of Conservatives who do not support Mr Bercow and might vote for Mr Burns just to irritate him, he continued.MPs are elected to the role of deputy Speaker, under reforms proposed by Mr Bercow shortly after he took on his role in 2009.To stand for election, MPs need to be sponsored by at least six other MPs.One of the other candidates for the role is Nadine Dorries, who in 2009 described the Speaker as "oily" and suggested he was "mistrusted by up to half of the House".Conservative backbenchers Eleanor Laing and Brian Binley have also been named as potential candidates.The successful applicant will join existing deputies, former Labour MPs Dawn Primarolo and Lindsay Hoyle, in helping to chair Commons business.Mr Burns' decision comes ahead of an expected reshuffle of middle-ranking Conservative ministerial ranks in coming weeks.In his resignation letter to Prime Minister David Cameron, he wrote: "It has been a privilege to serve in your administration for the past three and a quarter years and I will be forever grateful to you for giving me that opportunity in both the Departments of Health and Transport."You can rest assured that I will continue to support your leadership of both the Conservative Party and the government."The PM's response described the MP as a "loyal, dedicated and committed colleague".Mr Cameron said: "I know that this will not have been an easy decision for you to make, and one you will have given a huge amount of thought to."After serving the government so ably for over three years, you will certainly be missed, but I completely understand and respect your decision."</body>

      <body>When Thea Davies finishes the Chester marathon on Sunday it will not be the end of a race so much as a labour of love.It is her 10th marathon to raise funds in memory of her partner Stephen Healey from Cardiff.Capt Healey was the 415th UK serviceman to die in Afghanistan, killed by a roadside bomb in Helmand in 2012.Ms Davies, from Pembrokeshire, vowed to run 415 miles, a goal she will achieve.Capt Healey, a former Swansea City apprentice, was commanding his platoon in the 1st Battalion, The Royal Welsh (Royal Welch Fusiliers). from a lead vehicle when it ran over and detonated an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) in May 2012."For the first couple of months after Steve died I didn't know what to do. I just moped around," said Ms Davies."Eventually the padre who repatriated Steve - who co-incidentally is also Steve - took me to watch the Olympics, completely reluctantly at the time."I already knew I wanted to do some sort of fundraising for Steve's favourite charity,"And I knew it had to have a symbolic significance. But it wasn't until I watched the Brownlees winning gold and bronze in the triathlon that the idea of running 415 miles came to me."Capt Healey fundraised for Blind Veterans UK because it supported soldiers who had lost their sight through IED explosions in Afghanistan.Before his last tour he organised a blindfolded sponsored walk to its rehabilitation and training centre in Llandudno, Conwy.Ms Davies' year of running has seen her raise about £14,000 for the charity.Chief executive Robert Leader said her support has been inspirational."At a time of enormous personal tragedy for her she chose to take up Stephen's mantle and continue the amazing work that he had done to support ex-servicemen and women, blinded both in action and later life."We owe both her and Stephen a huge debt of gratitude and what they have done for our people will never be forgotten".Her feat has seen her compete in 20 races - 10Ks, half and full-length marathons, triathlons, and even a half-iron man event.Completing the challenge in Chester will also be highly significant."I hadn't planned it all the way along that the challenge would finish in Chester, but I'm extremely glad that it's worked out that way."As well as Steve's regiment being based here in the Dale Barracks, two years ago Chester was the first marathon Steve dragged me around, just over six months before he died."With the end of this challenge, she is already planning her next project."It suddenly struck me a few weeks ago that it's nearly all over. That panicked me a bit - it certainly made me very emotional because the running has been my way of coping with it all I suppose.""I'm so grateful to everyone who's supported me throughout. Not just my family, but also Blind Veterans UK, and particularly the thousands of ordinary people who've donated and given me such a sense of purpose.""This was for Steve, but the next challenge is for myself. I'm off to New Zealand next year to take part in an ultra iron man event," she said.</body>

      <title>The state school sixth formers twinned with Eton</title>
      <description>State and public school sixth formers twinned</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24289105</url>
      <date>1381016264</date>
      <body>From a busy junction at Stratford High Street in East London, there is a great view of a symbol of one of the UK's most glittering recent successes - the Olympic Park - and the modern station created to go with it.And close by is an unusual school which is striving to bring together the old and the new traditions of England - much like the spectacular opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics.The London Academy of Excellence is a government-funded sixth-form serving the East End of the capital which is trying to bridge the gap between private and state schools.It opened its doors as London basked in the glow of the Olympics last year.In an unusual partnership, pupils there share lessons, sport and teachers with a local community school and several independent fee-paying schools including Eton, Brighton College and Highgate.It is easy to miss the London Academy of Excellence. Its modern building looks like any other shiny office block, perched on the edge of a busy road.It is as far from the green playing fields and quads of Eton and Brighton College as you could imagine - but pupils at these and the other schools involved are sharing more than lessons and aspirations.Through a buddy system, they are getting to know each other during visits and getting a window on each other's lives.Yousef, 17, was one of the first group of sixth-formers to join the academy."I was attracted by the links with Eton and the other schools," he said."This has built a bridge between us and independent schools. It's taught us a lot. It's illustrated that we have far more in common than difference."I get to visit Eton House boys with tailcoats. That was a bit of an experience, out of the ordinary, but behind that we saw a lot of similarities between us."Do the teenagers feel envious when they see the very different surroundings of pupils at the other schools?Curtis, 17, says no."One buddy took us on a tour and I studied a lesson of history with them. There was a similar-sized classroom, a similar way of teaching and talking. I felt at home there," he said."I did not feel envious. I am not that kind of individual. But who would not want to study at Eton?"Some of the sixth-formers say they feel lucky, because they do not have to pay for their education."We have this free. They are paying vast amounts to go to a college similar to ours", says Clinton.Ellie says the students at the other schools seemed really pleased to meet them."They were just as interested in us as we were in them. My buddy was asking so many questions about what we do."Most of their education takes place in the bright modern, business-like surroundings of their academy, in a converted office block.Their "uniform" is a "smart, professional dress code".The walls are white, the furniture bright. Big bold canvases with faces of famous intellectuals, scientists, artists and writers decorate the walls, dotted with their words of inspiration.In front of one of them is the academy's headmaster Robert Wilne, an energetic man, who bubbles over with enthusiasm for his pupils' success, their futures - and the aims of this experimental school."There are many schools doing interesting partnerships," he said."But this is a third way for independent schools, aside from giving bursaries or sponsoring academies."It is an experiment. I would love another city to look at it."It's a genuine, deep-seated partnership between eight schools that are woven in to the DNA of this academy."It's not window dressing or surface gloss."It is an experiment praised by the head of England's schools inspectorate Sir Michael Wilshaw, who in the summer accused many independent schools of living in "splendid isolation" from the state sector.He drew criticism from some in the private school sector this week too, for saying some schools' links with state schools were small, like crumbs from their tables.Some responded angrily, saying that their schools saved taxpayers money by educating children outside of the state sector.Both Labour and coalition governments have called for more links between private and state sector schools.All the academy's funding is from the government, says Mr Wilne and there is no direct funding from private schools.But there is support "in kind" and through links. Some of the governors are from the independent schools in the partnership."We draw on their various expertise and resources," says the headmaster."So if I want a scheme of work [curriculum plan] for maths, I go to to Highgate and ask for that. The head of economics at Brighton College is de facto head of economics here."They have been down and given feedback and mentoring support."Mr Wilne hopes the school will help social mobility."Education is the fuel of social mobility, education changes lives," he says."This 360 degree education we are offering here should fuel that mobility. Students will get the grades that will unlock doors to top universities and they are taking up extra-curricular activities and sports."They are interested in meeting others and they are not going to be daunted by meeting Etonians in the future."Sport, it seems, has also proved to be a good ice-breaker between students at the various schools."We enjoy visiting them as much as the sport," says Yousef.Curtis says he is enjoying trying out new sports."There is so much sport available. We do rowing. In my secondary school, we did rowing on a rowing machine, now we get to go on the water."With the first full exam season under its belt, the academy is now into its second year. The pioneer year looks to be a hard act to follow, having achieved 70% of their AS-levels at grades of A or B.Three students, including Ellie, spent part of the summer in the USA on a summer school after being encouraged to apply."I always wanted to go to university but did not aspire to the top ones," she said.The students say the school has widened their horizons, with encouragement to do so often coming in the shape of one of the many emails pumped out by their headmaster telling them of various opportunities."I get worried if I don't get an email from the head," one teenager says.They are getting help with their university applications and personal statements from one of the visiting teachers from the private sector.Student Harmanpreet says: "Our old head was always saying it's not about where you come from but where you are going."We know we are from a deprived area but LAE has shown us where we want to go."</body>

      <title>Breeding tigers in a rural shire</title>
      <description>The former circus owner who bred 120 of the big cats</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-24387281</url>
      <date>1380996795</date>
      <body>Following the birth of the first tiger at London Zoo in 17 years, a former circus owner talks about his life breeding tigers in rural Lincolnshire.At the height of his career in the 1970s, Martin Lacey was known as the "man that fear forgot" - being the only one to put his head inside a lion's mouth.That was just part of his work to run the now-closed Great British Circus, which has also included breeding more than 120 tigers at his home in Keal Cotes.Now aged in his 70s, Mr Lacey plans to retire, with most of the tigers will now go to his sons' circus in Germany.His work has included starring in the children's TV show Magpie and training some of the tigers used in the Esso adverts.He said he had enjoyed a fantastic career and "had certainly done his bit" to help with tiger conservation."This year we've had 12 cubs in Lincolnshire and 12 in Germany," he said."Most will go to my sons' circus, but we are able to let any surplus go to zoological gardens, which reduces the need to bring in any animals from the wild."We are definitely doing well in the conservation stakes - we also bred reindeer here this year, and that's not easy."However, changes in public attitudes to performing animals mean he has faced criticism in recent years.The UK government has announced that a ban prohibiting the use of wild animals in circuses in Britain would come into effect in 2015.Under the terms of the draft Wild Animals in Circuses Bill, the ban will cover any creature not normally domesticated in Britain.The RSPCA said public opinion has been against the practice for some time because "lions and tigers performing do not have a place in today's society."However, Mr Lacey says his tigers enjoy the highest standards of care and described the animal's time in the circus ring as "organised play"."They run and jump - just as they would in the wild," he said."I believe there is a mass of support for animals in entertainment and people should have the freedom of choice - you can only watch so many jugglers before it gets a bit boring."We are breeding them specifically for work and are looking for intelligent animals."Just as some strains of Alsatian look fantastic but are a little bit thick - our animals have to be intelligent and look good as well."However, the closure of the Great British Circus in 2012 was welcomed by the Captive Animals Protection Society.Director Liz Tyson said: "The door is firmly closing on the inherently cruel and unethical practice of using animals in circuses in this country."But, Mr Lacey said: "We've wiped out 90% of the wild population of tigers, so the only place you are going to find these wonderful creatures is in a zoo or circus."The only other alternative is stuffed in a museum and I know which I'd like my great, great grandchildren to see."The Lacey family currently has about 80 big cats in its care, including Indian tigers and white lions.He said: "As well as providing shade for them during the summer months, I've got a very good slaughterhouse which lets me take things like pig's heads, hearts, liver and trotters."He also described security at his home as much better than "Parkhurst"."We've never had an escape and we can't ever have an escape," he stressed.Mr Lacey, who was training up until the age of 70, said he was retiring because "[the tigers] are moving a little bit faster than I am these days".</body>

      <body>Robin van Persie has made world-class quality his trademark - so it was no surprise he headed straight to Manchester United's precocious teenager Adnan Januzaj amid the celebrations at the Stadium of Light.Van Persie's relatively brief United career has been sprinkled with match-winning moments and he will have recognised something of himself in the manner of 18-year-old Januzaj's spectacular contribution to a vital 2-1 win against Sunderland.And while there have been whispers about Januzaj's quality around Old Trafford for some time, they turned to a scream once he had produced the decisive contribution and announced the arrival of a special talent.United - despite manager David Moyes' fanciful claims that they more or less dominated the whole game against the Black Cats - were only in the process of exerting their superiority when Januzaj ensured some of the clouds gathering over the Premier League champions and their new manager rolled away into the Wearside night.Januzaj, who had already impressed with his passing and subtle attacking play, showed composure to send a thumping side-footed shot past Keiren Westwood from Patrice Evra's cross after 55 minutes - but it was his winning goal six minutes later that carried the real hallmark of all outstanding players.Yes, there was a danger when John O'Shea half-cleared a cross, but the punishment was heavy as Januzaj adopted the perfect position and faultless technique to send a low left-foot volley into the bottom corner and snuff out all the resilience that had given Sunderland's interim head coach Kevin Ball so much encouragement.It was the sort of finish Van Persie has delivered countless times in his career and his appreciation was clear as he embraced Januzaj in front of United's joyous supporters after the final whistle.Moyes, who gave Wayne Rooney his debut at 16 at Everton and already places Januzaj in the same bracket at that stage of his career, also came across to offer his own words after the final whistle.And various items are now on the Manchester United manager's agenda.Moyes must judge how to develop and nurture Januzaj, whose performance loudly demanded a place in the United starting line-up - certainly when placed alongside another fitful performance from Nani.He must also do it while Januzaj wrestles with pressing issues regarding his future for club and country.The boy prodigy who was signed by Anderlecht at 10 and moved to Manchester United in March 2011 will be in high demand, even more so after lacing his first Premier League start with such brilliance.Moyes' main concern will be tying Januzaj to a new contract once his present Old Trafford deal expires at the end of this season. He made all the right noises about Manchester United's pedigree and track record of promoting young players - but their efforts to secure his signature must now take on added urgency.For all Moyes' optimism, it does not take a huge leap of the imagination to suspect forces from Europe's other footballing superpowers will be at work while there is the slightest chance of prising him away from Old Trafford.Securing the new contract must now be near the top of United's priorities after watching the way in which Januzaj was the catalyst for a victory that at least goes some way to banishing the bitter memories of Premier League losses to Manchester City and West Bromwich Albion.Januzaj's background makes him eligible for Albania, Kosovo, Turkey and Belgium. It is believed the player's family have advised him against making a commitment until he has secured a first-team place at club level.He has now done that at United - and Moyes revealed the Football Association has already made inquiries about Januzaj's eventual availability for England based on residency.It sounds like a desperate shot in the dark by the FA but it cannot be blamed for trying - even though there are serious factors weighing against them.A player of such quality and ambition is unlikely to wait to qualify for England when there is the opportunity to play for Belgium, emerging so quickly as a force with a new generation of players capable of making an impact at next summer's World Cup in Brazil.Not great timing for England's declaration of interest.For now, United can celebrate the addition of such a gifted new star to their ranks and how they needed him.The graceful Januzaj illustrated a wide range of passing, a willingness to take players on and also a determination to shoot when the opportunity arose. He did it with deadly effect despite the fact that close Old Trafford observers report his finishing as one of the weak elements of an almost-complete attacking game.If Januzaj, understandably, claims the headlines, goalkeeper David de Gea was not far behind because Moyes could have been discussing an entirely different story had it not been for a magnificent save with United trailing to Craig Gardner's early goal.Emanuele Giaccherini was turning away to celebrate when De Gea flew away to his right to show outstanding athleticism and anticipation to turn his header away. It kept United in the game and enabled Januzaj to shape later events so spectacularly.This was not a flowing United but victory was all that mattered.And, even though the season is in its infancy, it was clear they needed a spark from somewhere to act as ignition.Januzaj, the bright new star of Old Trafford, may just have provided it.</body>

      <title>Glastonbury 2014 tickets sell out</title>
      <description>Glastonbury Festival organisers Michael and Emily Eavis say they are "blown away" by demand as tickets for 2014 sell out in one hour 27 minutes.</description>

      <body>Tickets for next year's Glastonbury Festival have sold out in record time, according to organisers.Michael and Emily Eavis issued a joint statement confirming all 120,000 remaining tickets had been sold in just one hour and 27 minutes.They said they were "blown away" by the numbers logging on and were "genuinely sorry" that so many had missed out.Ticketing website See Tickets had earlier apologised to customers on Twitter for "technical difficulties".The site, which had been managing the sale of tickets for Glastonbury, wrote that the issues had led to "a very difficult half an hour" before the site stabilised, later adding that it was selling 3,000 tickets a minute.Prices for the 2014 event had been increased by £10 to £210, plus a booking fee, but festival-goers could pay a deposit of £50 before settling their bill in April.For the first time, coach packages were available three days earlier, with all 15,000 tickets selling out in half an hour.A statement by the father and daughter Eavis team, Michael and Emily, was posted on the festival's own Twitter feed, saying: "We genuinely try to make the ticket system as fair as it can be, but when demand outstrips supply, it is an unfortunate inevitability that some people will be left disappointed."They went on to thank people for their "incredible support", adding: "We really don't take it for granted and we are exceedingly fortunate to have that loyalty."No acts have yet been confirmed to play at the festival at Worthy Farm between 26 and 29 June next year, but there is already speculation about who will headline.David Bowie is one of the bookies' favourites, with other rumours including Foo Fighters and Fleetwood Mac.This year saw Arctic Monkeys, Rolling Stones and Mumford and Sons top the bill on the festival's famous Pyramid Stage.</body>

      <body>Funding for the BBC's arts coverage will go up by 20%, the broadcaster's director general is to announce.Tony Hall - who used to run the Royal Opera House - says he wants to return the arts to the corporation's "heart".It will mean plays, art exhibitions and more live music from around the UK being broadcast on the BBC.Among Lord Hall's proposals are a new "BBC Arts at" brand and new television series fronted by historian Simon Schama and broadcaster Andrew Marr.The director general, formerly the BBC's head of news, returned to the corporation following the Jimmy Savile scandal.He wants to see the BBC collaborate more with arts institutions around the country.In a speech on Tuesday he is expected to unveil new partnerships with London's British Museum, the Tate and the Manchester International Festival.The plans mean that more opening nights, major exhibitions and arts events will be shown live on television.An experimental digital service known as The Space, developed by the BBC and Arts Council England, is also due to be relaunched in 2014."Arts programming sits right at the heart of the BBC and is a vital part of who we are, but I want us to to be much more ambitious," Lord Hall said."We need to showcase more of the incredible talent that this country has to offer to the widest possible audiences.He is due to announce major new television series featuring two faces familiar to BBC audiences.Mr Schama will front a five-part series in partnership with the National Portrait Gallery exploring the history of Britain through portraiture.A series looking at the greatest writers in Scotland will be presented by journalist Mr Marr.And there will be a series of six BBC One programmes seeking to uncover the "hidden heroes" of British art, with 10 amateurs competing for the title of Britain's best artists.The announcement is part of the director general's new strategy for the BBC and comes as the corporation looks to cut 2,000 jobs over five years after the freezing of the licence fee.</body>

      <body>Tributes are being paid to Italian director Carlo Lizzani, 91, who died on Saturday after falling from a third-floor balcony at his house in Rome.Local news agencies said authorities were investigating if it was suicide.Lizzani, who was head of the Venice Film Festival for four years, directed 1968 film The Violent Four and worked on Rossellini's Germany Year Zero.Fellow Italian director Ettore Scola told the ANSA news agency: "This is a time of great sadness."President Giorgio Napolitano, who had known Lizzani for decades, honoured the filmmaker for his contributions to "cinema, to culture and to the democratic development of our country".Lizzani started out as a film critic and then screenwriter for famous neo-realist, Rossellini.As well as a writing credit on his 1948 film, Germany Year Zero, Lizzani also earned an Oscar nomination for his work on Giuseppe De Santis' 1950 film Bitter Rice.He was awarded best director by the Academy of Italian Cinema in 1968 for his own film The Violent Four about a manhunt for bank robbers.He won its best screenwriter award for 1996 film Celluloide about the making of Rossellini's masterpiece, Rome, Open City.Throughout his career Lizzani collaborated with film directors including, Jean-Luc Godard, Marco Bellocchio, Bernardo Bertolucci and Pier Paolo Pasolini.He directed the Venice Film Festival from 1979-1982, and was a member of the jury of the Berlin Film Festival in 1994.Paolo Baratta, president of the Biennale - which includes the film festival - praised Lizzani's work."The Biennale is crying on the day of Carlo Lizzani's death," said Baratta."He knew how to give the festival new energy. He knew how to create a nucleus of young students and experts that would represent in future years the true elite. The world of Italian cinema owes him a lot."Lizzani began his career just after World War II in 1948 with a documentary about Italian Communist Party leader Palmiro Togliatti.His death comes nearly three years after another well-known director, Mario Monicelli, died after jumping from a hospital window in Rome.</body>

      <title>Cyrus and O'Connor row escalates</title>
      <description>Pop star Miley Cyrus hits back at Sinead O'Connor, after the Irish singer warned her not to be exploited by the music business.</description>

      <body>Pop star Miley Cyrus has hit back at Sinead O'Connor, after the Irish singer warned her not to be exploited by the music business.In a series of tweets, Cyrus mocked O'Connor, comparing her to US actress Amanda Bynes before alluding to O'Connor's mental health problems.O'Connor responded with another open letter to the singer, accusing her of "irresponsible" behaviour.The Irish singer told her to "remove her tweets immediately".The tit-for-tat conversation began after Cyrus, 20, cited O'Connor's video Nothing Compares 2 U as an inspiration for her explicit Wrecking Ball video.O'Connor, 46, said she was prompted to write, "in the spirit of motherliness" after "phone calls from various newspapers" who wanted the singer-songwriter to comment upon similarities between the two videos.In the video for Nothing Compares 2 U, O'Connor sheds a single tear as she performs the Prince-penned break-up ballad.Cyrus cries in the promo clip for Wrecking Ball, which shares similar lyrical themes to O'Connor's song. But the video also finds her licking a sledgehammer and swinging naked on a metal demolition ball.O'Connor said she was "extremely concerned" that those around Cyrus had led or encouraged her to believe "that it is in any way 'cool' to be naked and licking sledgehammers in your videos".Cyrus, who found fame as the child star of Disney children's show Hannah Montana, has been criticised in recent weeks for her controversial performances, particularly at the MTV Video Music Awards in Brooklyn last month.O'Connor continued: "The message you keep sending is that it's somehow cool to be prostituted.. it's so not cool Miley... it's dangerous."It is in fact the case that you will obscure your talent by allowing yourself to be pimped, whether it's the music business or yourself doing the pimping," added O'Connor.Responding on Twitter, Cyrus wrote: "Top of the mornin to ya."She added a screen shot of O'Connor's tweets from 2012 in which the Irish star, who has bi-polar disorder, referred to her own mental health problems, asking for Twitter followers to recommend a psychiatrist.She compared the singer to former child actress Amanda Bynes, who is currently undergoing psychiatric treatment."I don't have time to write you an open letter cause I'm hosting and performing on SNL this week," Cyrus continued.Cyrus also tweeted a picture of O'Connor ripping up a photograph of the pope, an infamous on-stage stunt by the singer, before asking her to "meet up and talk".Responding to Cyrus in a third open letter, O'Connor said she would take legal action against her if she did not remove the tweets."You have posted today tweets of mine which are two years old, which were posted by me when I was unwell and seeking help so as to make them look like they are recent."In doing so you mock myself and Amanda Bynes for having suffered with mental health issues and for having sought help," said O'Connor.She added: "It is most unbecoming of you to respond in such a fashion to someone who expressed care for you," O'Connor added.</body>

      <title>C4's Hunt denies age discrimination</title>
      <description>Channel 4's Jay Hunt denies racing pundit John McCririck claims that she was a "serial age discrimination offender".</description>

      <body>Channel 4's Jay Hunt has denied racing pundit John McCririck's claims that she was a "serial age discrimination offender".Speaking at an employment tribunal in London, Ms Hunt said she felt there was "no correlation" between younger presenters drawing younger audiences.She accused Mr McCririck of making "false allegations".The 73-year-old - who was dropped by the channel last year - is accusing his former employers of age discrimination.Ms Hunt - chief creative officer at Channel 4 - told the tribunal she had instigated voluntary training courses on discrimination at the broadcaster after she joined from the BBC, adding that she had "learned her lesson" from the Miriam O'Reilly case.Ms O'Reilly, who was in her 50s when she was dropped from the BBC's Countryfile programme, won an age discrimination case against the corporation in 2011.Mr McCririck had cited Moira Stuart's decision to leave the BBC while Ms Hunt was the BBC's controller of daytime. Ms Hunt said she had no involvement in the Stuart decision.In a statement, Ms Hunt noted: "John McCririck's allegation that I am a 'serial age discrimination offender' is untrue."I have been responsible for a channel or part of a channel for the past eight years. In that time, hundreds of on-screen talent decisions have been run past me by those making them."Only one of those decisions has ever led to a claim of age discrimination and, contrary to what John McCririck says, I have learnt from that case."She added: "I had no reason to believe that anyone in the team which worked up the new programme had acted on the grounds of John McCririck's age, and that remains the position."'Chauvanistic extraordinaire'Jamie Aitchison, Channel 4's commissioning editor for sport - who was responsible for dropping Mr McCririck from the channel's horse-racing coverage - told a tribunal earlier this week that the pundit's "exaggerated tone" was "out of step" with the channel's coverage.His opinion was echoed by a senior television producer, giving evidence on Friday, who had previously called for Mr McCririck to be dropped from the revamped racing line-up.Carl Hicks, part of production company IMG - which is also being sued by Mr McCririck - told the central London hearing that the commentator "was not appropriate and there was not an appropriate role for him"."John was an eccentric and seen, at worst, as a loud-mouthed and chauvinistic extraordinaire which was not what I wanted to be part of the team to broaden racing."He also told the hearing that Mr McCririck was inclined to upset his fellow colleagues.In his tribunal witness statement, he said: "My view remained that John McCririck was not right for the programme and I thought he should not be included in any capacity."I was fully aware that John was one of the most recognisable faces in horseracing," adding that he held the pundit's expertise for the subject in the highest regard."However, I did not think his exaggerated presentation style was consistent with a more serious programme and was aware that he had a potential to offend and alienate viewers and potential viewers.In March 2012, Channel 4 secured the rights to broadcast all UK horse racing events for the following year, including "crown jewel" events such as Royal Ascot and the Grand National. A new-look team, fronted by Clare Balding, took over last year.The hearing continues.</body>

      <title>Shankar addresses Delhi gang rape</title>
      <description>Musician Anoushka Shankar says she decided to reveal her own experiences of sexual abuse after the gang rape and murder of a woman in Delhi.</description>

      <date>1380907941</date>
      <body>Musician Anoushka Shankar says she was prompted to reveal her experience of sexual abuse after learning of the gang rape and murder of a woman in Delhi.Shankar, daughter of legendary Indian sitar player Ravi Shankar, said in February she had been abused by "a man my parents trusted" in her childhood.Her revelation followed the fatal attack on an Indian student, for which four men have been sentenced to death."Her story is the apex of millions of stories," Shankar told BBC Radio 4.Speaking on the Front Row programme, she said: "No-one I knew could help being affected by the gravity and intensity of that attack - and if it resonates with something in our experience then obviously it doubles the impact of hearing a story like that."I felt quite conscious as an Indian woman that there was a very unique moment happening where the entire world's attention was on sexual violence and on the role and position of women in India."I felt almost an obligation [to talk about my experience]. It didn't feel dragged out of me. If I was ever going to talk about my story, that felt like the right moment."Shankar, 32, took the decision to talk about her experiences in a video, recorded in her London home, in which she appealed for people to support a campaign in memory of the gang rape victim."As a child I suffered sexual and emotional abuse for several years at the hands of a man my parents trusted implicitly," she said.She added the attacks had included "groping, touching and verbal abuse".Reflecting on the statement, the musician told Front Row's John Wilson: "It was something I never spoke to the media about."It had never felt like something relevant in a public context until this moment where I thought 'hang on, it's important for people to realise that this kind of thing can happen to anyone, anywhere'."I think there's a class issue in India where there can be an assumption that things like this don't happen to people from upper classes or who are privileged. I think part of what shocked people within India was that [the victim] was a middle-class girl. It's so ridiculous."The musician has responded to the attack, and tried to address its causes, with a track on her new album, Traces Of You.She said the song, which references the 23-year-old victim's name in its title, tries to capture a sense of the horror of the attack.The album, recorded with producer Nitin Sawhney and her sister Norah Jones, also addresses the death of her father last year.Shankar said her experiences had informed the spirit of the record, and brought a sense of "resilience" to the music."It's not necessarily about the passing of my father, it's about me passing through the passing of my father."There's a way that we all go through horrible and painful things and I'm not nullifying it in any way when I say we do go on."My childhood experiences were one of the big experiences for me [but] I know as a woman I've come through that."At some cost, but I've come through it."You can hear the full interview with Anoushka Shankar on BBC Radio 4's Front Row at 19:15 BST on 4 October, 2013. It will then be available on the iPlayer.</body>

      <body>Photojournalist Bill Eppridge - who took images of the aftermath of Robert Kennedy's assassination - has died aged 75.Eppridge died in hospital in Connecticut from a blood infection caused by a fall.His image of Kennedy lying on the floor of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles is widely considered one of the greatest news photos of all time.He worked for Life Magazine at the time of the shooting in 1968.Friend and fellow photographer David Hume Kennerly said: "He extended a helping hand and a bushel of inspiration to me, and his kindness shaped the course of my career.Born in Buenos Aires, Eppridge moved to the US with his family as a young boy.Working as a staff photographer for Life Magazine from 1964, he covered a wide variety of stories from revolutions in Latin America to the Beatles' arrival in the US.Eppridge followed Kennedy from a campaign event at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles into the back kitchen where a 24-year-old Palestinian Christian, Sirhan Sirhan, shot and killed the 42-year-old presidential hopeful.Eppridge took several black and white images that night, but the most enduring and haunting depicted Kennedy lying on the floor, with a halo of light in the background, with a hotel worker at his side."You are not just a photojournalist, you're a historian," he once explained when asked how he could keep snapping pictures while someone was lying injured in front of him.Commenting on his unforgettable image of Kennedy, he said: "I never hung it on my wall."His 1965 photo essay about a drug-addicted New York couple inspired the Al Pacino film The Panic in Needle Park.After leaving Life in 1972, Eppridge worked for other magazines including Time and Sports Illustrated.Before his death, he and his wife, Adrienne Aurichio, had been putting the finishing touches to a book on the Beatles, to mark next year's 50th anniversary of their arrival to the US.</body>

      <body>Crime writer Alexander McCall Smith has become the latest contemporary writer invited to reinterpret the work of Jane Austen for a modern audience.The Edinburgh-based author said being asked to write a 21st Century version of Emma was "like being asked to eat a box of delicious chocolates".McCall Smith's take on Emma will be published next autumn, 199 years after the original's debut.Joanna Trollope's version of Sense and Sensibility is due out this month.Val McDermid's interpretation of Northanger Abbey will follow next year, while a new version of Pride and Prejudice by US writer Curtis Sittenfeld comes out in 2015.The names of two more writers who are taking part in the six-book Austen Project will be announced later this year."Writing a contemporary version of Emma is both a privilege and a real challenge," said McCall Smith, best known as the author of The No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency."Not only is Emma one of the finest novels in the English language, but it is possibly Jane Austen's most thought-provoking and interesting book."Trollope said it was "wonderful to hear" that McCall Smith was taking on Emma, a heroine she said would "benefit" from being "handled by a man".The project's authors have to stick with their individual novel's existing plot and characters, but are free to make some changes.Emma tells of an immature young woman whose attempts to play matchmaker backfire both on herself and those she attempts to bring together.Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Beckinsale are among those to have played the character on screen, while the story was successfully transplanted to a modern setting in 1995 film Clueless.Mansfield Park and Sense and Sensibility are the other two titles that will be adapted as part of the Harper Collins project, one of several attempts to adapt or continue Austen's works.Others include Death Comes to Pemberley, a 2011 sequel to Pride and Prejudice by P D James that is currently being turned into a BBC TV series.</body>

      <body>Morrissey's autobiography is to be published later this month after the former Smiths singer resolved a dispute with his publisher that had threatened to derail the book's release.Last month, the singer claimed "a last-minute content disagreement" with Penguin had led the deal to "collapse".Despite initially saying he was seeking a new publisher, Morrissey has now patched up relations with Penguin.Penguin Classics said Autobiography by Morrissey would come out on 17 October.That is a month later than the original publication date of 16 September.A Penguin spokesperson declined to comment on the cause of the dispute and the delay.The memoir is expected to lift the lid on the 54-year-old's life growing up in Manchester and his relationship with his former bandmates in The Smiths, one of the most important bands in British music.He has enjoyed a successful solo career since the band split up in 1987 and is also known for outspoken views on animal cruelty, politics and the royal family.This year, the singer suffered a series of what he referred to as "medical mishaps" which led to him cancelling his US tour.He was also forced to cancel part of his South American tour in July due, he said, to a "lack of funding".</body>

      <body>Oscar-winning actress Jane Fonda is to be recognised with the American Film Institute's lifetime achievement award.She follows in the footsteps of her father, Henry Fonda, who was handed the AFI's highest honour in 1978.Fonda has made more than 40 films, winning Academy Awards for both Klute in 1971 and 1978's Coming Home.She returned to acting in 2005 after a 15-year hiatus and has recently been seen in HBO drama The Newsroom and as Nancy Regan in Lee Daniels' The Butler."Jane Fonda is American film royalty," said chair of the AFI board, Howard Stringer, in a statement."A bright light first introduced to the world as the daughter of Henry Fonda, the world watched as she found her own voice and forged her own path as an actor and a cultural icon."Today she stands tall among the giants of American film."Off screen Fonda is well known as a political activist, protesting against the war in Vietnam in the 1970s, and campaigning for other causes such as equal rights and the environment.The actress was also a prominent figure in the aerobics craze of the 1980s, releasing two dozen workout videos and numerous books.She received an Emmy nomination earlier this year for her role as Leona Lansing in Aaron Sorkin drama The Newsroom, which also stars Jeff Daniels and Emily Mortimer.Her autobiography, My Life So Far, topped the New York Times bestseller list.The Fondas are the first father and daughter to both be recognised by the AFI, although several other families have received double honours, including father and son Kirk and Michael Douglas and brother and sister Warren Beatty and Shirley MacLaine.Fonda made her film debut in 1960 comedy Tall Story but it was her performance in 1969 depression-era drama They Shoot Horses, Don't They? that earned her her first Oscar nomination.The actress, whose other film credits include Barbarella, The China Syndrome and The Morning After, will be presented with the honour at a gala ceremony in Los Angeles next year.</body>

      <body>More than £2.3m has been raised for charity as dozens of Gromit statues were auctioned in Bristol.All 81 of the sculptures were sold for Wallace and Gromit's Grand Appeal, which is raising £3.5m for an expansion of Bristol Royal Hospital for Children.One lot, Gromit Lightyear, designed by animation studio Pixar and based on the Toy Story character, sold for £65,000.Nick Park, who created the Gromit character, said he was "stunned" by how much had been raised."I couldn't wait to see the Pixar Gromit Lightyear go because obviously that was a top runner," Mr Park said."It just kept going up. When the first few started climbing I started tingling. It was double the target."It is obviously for the children's hospital, everyone has been so generous, the people in the room, on the internet and the artists," he added.Bidders packed into a specially erected pavilion at Bristol's Cribbs Causeway shopping centre, with almost 2,000 more taking part in the action online.One of the unsuccessful bidders was five-year-old Thom Clarke from Fishponds.He wrote a letter to the "Gromit keepers" to say he had visited all of the statues over the summer and Blossom was his favourite."I have £11.57 saved up and I would like to bid my money on Blossom please."I hope I win," he said.The Grand Appeal hopes to fund state-of-the-art equipment, family facilities and child-friendly artwork to complement a £31m investment by the NHS.Last month a pre-auction show of the Gromit sculptures, called The Greatest Dog Show On Earth, drew crowds of about 22,000.They had previously been displayed around the city during the summer and quickly became a popular tourist attraction.While the majority of the sculptures were based around Bristol, there were others at London Paddington station, Westonbirt Arboretum in Gloucestershire, Cheddar Gorge in Somerset and Hawkesbury Upton, South Gloucestershire.The trail attracted visitors from numerous countries across Europe, the Americas and Asia.</body>

      <body>The Duchess of Cornwall is to present this year's prestigious Man Booker Prize.Six writers have been shortlisted for the prize, with Jim Crace, Colm Toibin and Eleanor Catton among the nominees.Camilla supports a number of organisations which promote literacy, including the National Literacy Trust.She will present the prize, which comes with a cheque for £50,000, during a ceremony at the Guildhall in the City of London on 15 October.Crace's Harvest is the bookmakers' favourite to win. He was previously shortlisted for the Booker in 1997 for Quarantine.The other shortisted authors are NoViolet Bulawayo, Jhumpa Lahiri and Ruth Ozeki.Last year the award was won by Hilary Mantel for the second time, for her Wolf Hall sequel Bring Up the Bodies.Launching the National Literacy Trust's campaign to identify literary heroes on Wednesday, the Duchess said: "I firmly believe in the importance of igniting a passion for reading in the next generation."In a world where the written word competes with so many other calls on our attention, we need more literacy heroes to keep inspiring young people to find the pleasure and power of reading for themselves."</body>

      <body>Fewer children across the UK are reading in their own time and one in five is embarrassed to be caught with a book, a survey suggests.Just over a quarter of 35,000 children from 188 schools told the National Literacy Trust that they read outside of school.About the same number said they did not think their parents cared if they read.The trust says a similar survey in 2005 found one in three children read in their own time.The survey for the trust involved children filling in online questionnaires last winter.Half of those taking part said they enjoyed reading either "very much" or "quite a lot" and a high proportion (four out of five) agreed with the statement "the more I read, the better I become".Nearly two in five agreed reading was "cool", but about one in three said they only read when they had to.Report author Christina Clark, from the Literacy Trust, said young people who enjoyed reading very much were four times as likely to read above the level expected for their age compared with those who did not enjoy reading at all.Those who read outside of class every day were five times as likely to read above the expected level compared with those who never did.And children who do not think "reading is cool" were four times more likely to be below-average readers, the report says.National Literacy Trust director Jonathan Douglas said: "Our research not only reveals that children are reading less and developing more negative attitudes towards reading, but also that there is a clear correlation between this and their performance in reading tests."The study, of children aged from eight to 16, found that the proportion who read e-books outside of school had doubled since 2010 to 12%.Reading is most popular among eight to 11-year-olds, the survey suggests, although teenagers are more likely to read for longer.The charity released the research to coincide with a new campaign to find the UK's "literacy heroes".It is asking the public to name people who might have inspired a love of books or helped to improve reading skills.Anyone from a parent, teacher or young person who has overcome a personal literacy problem to a favourite author or celebrity can be nominated, the Literacy Trust said.The campaign is being supported by the Duchess of Cornwall, who said: "I firmly believe in the importance of igniting a passion for reading in the next generation."In a world where the written word competes with so many other calls on our attention, we need more literacy heroes to keep inspiring young people to find the pleasure and power of reading for themselves."</body>

      <title>Crystal Palace £500m plans unveiled</title>
      <description>Plans to build a replica of the Crystal Palace on the site of the original Victorian building in south London will create 2,000 permanent and temporary jobs, say investors.</description>

      <date>1380805135</date>
      <body>Plans to build a replica of the Crystal Palace on the site of the original Victorian building in south London have been unveiled.ZhongRong Group wants to build a new cultural attraction and restore the surrounding park in Bromley.The original was built in 1851 in Hyde Park but moved to Crystal Palace in 1854. It burnt down in 1936.The Chinese investment group announced its plans at an event with the mayor and leader of Bromley Council.The project is expected to create more than 2,000 permanent and temporary jobs as well as attract wider investment into the local high streets.ZhongRong Group chairman Ni Zhaoxing said: "London is renowned across the world for its history and culture and the former Crystal Palace is celebrated in China as a magnificent achievement."This project is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to bring its spirit back to life by recreating the Crystal Palace and restoring the park to its former glory."Mayor of London Boris Johnson welcomed the announcement and said together with Bromley Council, he would work closely with the ZhongRong Group to progress the plans.However, London assembly Green Party member Darren Johnson said it was a "poorly-timed" proposal.He said: "While I'm sure many people would love to see the Crystal Palace raised from the ashes, this precious parkland isn't the right place for it."When the palace was moved there in the 1850s the newly-laid out park was near countryside, but today it's an urban park with a lot of space already taken up by the national sports centre, car parks, roads and the caravan site."Labour London assembly member Val Shawcross said: "I would be particularly concerned about the impact of two million additional visitors per year on local transport and road networks."It is anticipated the new building will be the same size and scale as the original palace, which was designed by Joseph Paxton.The cast-iron and plate-glass building housed The Great Exhibition, which featured more than 14,000 exhibitors from around the world showing off Britain's industrial achievements.The palace and the grounds became the world's first theme park, offering education, entertainment, a rollercoaster and cricket matches, and even staged 20 FA Cup Finals between 1895 and 1914.While the palace was in existence it was the largest glass structure in the world.There will be a year of consultation and design development before plans are formally submitted in autumn 2014.</body>

      <title>Diana reviews 'devastated' director</title>
      <description>The director of Diana says he has "no regrets", despite the film's "devastating" reviews in the UK.</description>

      <date>1380793310</date>
      <body>The director of Diana says he has "no regrets", despite the film's poor reception in the UK.Oliver Hirschbiegel told the BBC that the movie's critical mauling was "devastating, but when you make a film you don't think about the reactions".The Telegraph described the film "a special class of awful", while the Mirror called it "cheap and cheerless".Hirschbiegel admitted the reviews had put off audiences, but he still hoped people would "make their own minds up"."In all the other places where it's opened - in Poland, the Czech Republic, Turkey and Slovakia - it's been very strong," he said."I think for the British, Diana is still a trauma they haven't come to terms with."Starring Naomi Watts, the film depicts Princess Diana in the final years of her life, with a focus on her affair with heart surgeon Hasnat Khan, played by Lost's Naveen Andrews.It entered the UK chart at number five in its opening weekend, taking £623,000 at the box office. This week, it dropped to number nine.Hirschbiegel, who previously made Downfall, a German-language film about the last days of Hitler, called his experiences with Diana "deja vu, because it has the same reactions in the UK as Downfall had in Germany on release"."I hope it is a matter of stepping back and looking at it afresh in a year or so, because it is a very British story and I am a very German director."He added that Diana "was the most complex character I have ever tried to depict - more complex than Hitler. The one thing they both had in common was they were born actors".Earlier this week, at the Zurich Film Festival, Hirschbiegel described the film as "very un-British" and described the critical reaction as harking back "to what newspapers like the Daily Mail would write about her back then - really vile things. So I guess I succeeded."The film has been sold to distributors in more than 40 countries and will be released in the US on 1 November, 2013.</body>

      <title>Farrow paternity story 'absurd'</title>
      <description>Speculation that Frank Sinatra and not Woody Allen may be the father of Mia Farrow's 25-year-old son Ronan is dismissed by both Allen's spokesman and Sinatra's widow.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24379383</url>
      <date>1380797137</date>
      <body>Speculation that Woody Allen may not be the father of Mia Farrow's son Ronan has been dismissed as "absurd" by the director's spokesman.The claims are "so fictitious and extravagantly absurd that he is not going to comment," said his spokesman.Farrow's admission to Vanity Fair that Ronan may "possibly" have been fathered by ex-husband Frank Sinatra has also been rubbished by the singer's widow."It's just a bunch of junk," Barbara Sinatra told the Desert Sun newspaper."There's always junk written - lies that aren't true," the 85-year-old said on Wednesday. "It sounds like a phony to me."Ronan Farrow, 25, has made his own comment on the story, tweeting: "Listen, we're all *possibly* Frank Sinatra's son."Mia Farrow's comments came in a lengthy article in Vanity Fair's November issue, which also contains quotes from eight of the actress's children.In excerpts released ahead of its publication, Farrow claims she and Sinatra "never really split up" following the end of their two-year marriage in 1968.Farrow subsequently married, and divorced, the composer Andre Previn, with whom she had three children and adopted three more.The actress went on to have both a professional and personal relationship with Allen, with whom she had Ronan - originally named Satchel - in 1987.The revelation that Allen was having a secret affair with Farrow's adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn caused the break-up of their 12-year relationship in 1992.This led to a bitter custody battle in which Allen was accused of molesting their adopted daughter Dylan, charges Allen denied and which have never been proved.Dylan, who now goes under the name Malone, refers to the alleged molestation in the Vanity Fair article, claiming she had been "scared" and had "wanted it to stop"."I have never been asked to testify," she is quoted as saying. "If I could talk to the seven-year-old Dylan, I would tell her to be brave, to testify."The article offers further insights into how Farrow and Allen's acrimonious break-up has impacted on their biological and adopted children.Fletcher Previn, it is revealed, used Photoshop to remove Allen from every family photo and edited him out of the Farrow's home videos.Speaking in 2005, Allen confirmed he no longer had relationships with the three children from his relationship with Farrow.Ronan Farrow, now a human rights campaigner and journalist, is reportedly in talks to host his own show on US channel MSNBC.</body>

      <body>Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal's new film Prisoners has repeated its US success by topping the UK box office in its opening weekend.The kidnap drama made £1.37m, overtaking the Formula One film Rush, which took second place with £987,549.Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine came third despite only opening across 188 screens, compared to Prisoners' 400 and Rush's 512 screens.Filth, starring James McAvoy, enjoyed a strong start in Scotland.Based on Irvine Welsh's book of the same name, the film has been praised for McAvoy's powerful performance as a hard-drinking, morally repugnant Edinburgh policeman.It took £247,860 across just 38 locations in Scotland, coming 12th overall, but ending up as the biggest movie of the week in terms of attendance.The per cinema average of £6,523 was nearly double the figure achieved by Prisoners - but the film may struggle to replicate that performance in the rest of the UK, where it is released on Friday.Fourth place in this week's chart went to Runner Runner, starring Justin Timberlake, Ben Affleck and Gemma Arterton, while Horror sequel Insidious 2 rounded out the top 5.Prisoners stars Jackman as a father who takes matters into his own hands when his daughter and her friend go missing, while Gyllenhaal plays the small-town police detective working the case.Cate Blanchett has already been tipped for Oscar success after critics praised her performance in Blue Jasmine.The film, Allen's 46th as a writer-director, recalls Tennessee Williams' classic play A Streetcar Named Desire, with Blanchett playing a depressed New York socialite whose wealthy husband (Alec Baldwin) ends up in jail.Richard Curtis's time travelling romance About Time was in sixth place, with action movie White House Down in seventh.Animations Justin and the Knights of Valour and Monsters University both stayed in the top ten; while controversial biopic Diana, starring Naomi Watts, slipped to ninth place in its second week of release.</body>

      <body>An inquiry has been launched after £2m of public money was used to buy Beatles memorabilia later revalued at £300,000.The review of the 2008 purchase by Merseytravel began when auditors found a conflict of interest between the valuer and seller.KPMG said "serious failures" occurred when the transport authority bought items including John Lennon's glasses for The Beatles Story museum.Merseytravel said "due process" was not followed but changes had been made.The authority took over the running of the museum in 2008.It bought Lennon's wire-rimmed glasses for a permanent exhibition at The Beatles Story museum which it runs along with two other Merseyside visitor attractions.The glasses and other exhibits including handwritten studio notes from Beatles producer George Martin were revalued as part of an internal scrutiny process.When the valuation was put at £300,000, Merseytravel started its own investigation. The auditor, KPMG, also found two areas of concern over the purchase.The combined report said: "The person carrying out the valuation had been a company director with the person selling the Beatles' items."Although the conflict was identified, the lawyers were still instructed to proceed with using this valuer."Both issues represent a serious failure in corporate governance."KPMG recommended a "full investigation into the Beatles memorabilia valuation and the authority should take appropriate action".Merseytravel chairman Liam Robinson confirmed its initial investigation showed elements of "due process" were not followed.He said: "We will look to take action if we establish that we were let down by those we were relying on at the time and that the interests of the taxpayer were not well served in the original negotiation."This could not happen now. Our new governance and scrutiny processes would not allow it."Mr Robinson added The Beatles Story was "unaffected by this revaluation" and "remains profitable".KPMG concluded it was "satisfied" that Merseytravel had "proper arrangements in place for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in their use of resources."</body>

      <body>Glee star Cory Monteith died of a fatal cocktail of heroin and alcohol, a coroner's report has concluded.The 31-year-old star, who played Finn Hudson on the hit TV show, was found dead in a Vancouver hotel in July.Investigators at the scene found drug paraphernalia, including "a spoon with drug residue and a used hypodermic needle, along with two empty champagne bottles and multiple glasses".Coroner Claire Thompson concluded that Monteith's death was "accidental".The final findings support the initial coroner's report into the death of the Canadian actor on 13 July.At the time of his death, Monteith had an alcohol level of 0.13 percent, with a "moderate" level of intoxication. The report also pointed to the presence of morphine, codeine and "6-monoacetylmorphine," a by-product of heroin.Hotel video footage showed the actor returning alone to his room in the early hours of 13 July, marking the final time he was seen alive."He had checked in to the hotel on July 6 and had been expected to check out on the 13th," the report stated. "When he had not done so, hotel staff checked his room and found him unresponsive on the floor."The report concluded the actor had been dead for several hours: "Mr Monteith was clearly deceased and resuscitation was not attempted."Monteith, who had been in Glee since its inception in 2009, was admitted to rehab earlier this year having struggled with addiction since he was a teenager. The coroner's report said the actor's "periods of abstinence ranged from years to months in duration".The report found that his erratic drug use contributed to his death, adding that "after a period of cessation from opiod drug use, a previously tolerated drug concentration level may become toxic and fatal".Glee, which follows a group of American high school misfits who form a singing club, will pay tribute to Monteith in a special episode to be broadcast in the US next week."[The] third episode will deal with the Finn Hudson character being written out of the show," Fox's Kevin Reilly told reporters at a Television Critics Association meeting in August.The show - now in its fifth series - is known for its upbeat pop covers and cameo appearances by celebrities.</body>

      <body>Former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis has appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court to face two further sexual offence charges.Mr Travis, 68, of Mentmore, Bucks, is alleged to have indecently assaulted a woman aged over 16 between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 1993.These are in addition to 12 counts he already faces.Mr Travis, who has indicated he will contest all charges, spoke to confirm his name, address and date of birth.He previously appeared in court to face 12 charges, which are said to have taken place between 1977 and 2007 against nine alleged victims aged between 15 and 29.Leaving the court in central London, Mr Travis, whose real name is David Patrick Griffin, did not make any comment to reporters.Mr Travis was first arrested in November 2012 and charged on 15 August as part of Operation Yewtree, the police investigation which followed the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal, but the accusations against him are not connected with the disgraced ex-DJ and TV presenter.He was charged with the two fresh counts on 1 October.Mr Travis was released on bail following an appearance at the Old Bailey on 6 September on condition that he lives at his Buckinghamshire home and does not contact the alleged victims.Mr Justice Sweeney adjourned the case for a plea and case management hearing on 21 October and fixed a trial date for 4 March 2014.Mr Travis faces the following counts:</body>

      <title>McAvoy: 'I toy with the audience'</title>
      <description>James McAvoy says his new film is "not for the fainthearted"</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24373354</url>
      <date>1380933124</date>
      <body>James McAvoy's latest role as a drug-fuelled corrupt Scottish police officer in Filth will not be for everyone - but the actor tells the BBC that's exactly why he signed up."It's full on and definitely not for the fainthearted, and there's not a lot of that in the film industry," he explains."The character represented an opportunity to take an audience and really toy with them."Filth sees McAvoy as detective sergeant Bruce Robertson, a man whose average day involves casual drug-taking, obscene phone calls, blackmailing young women into sex or sleeping with his friends' wives."You're making somebody laugh, and they know they shouldn't be. And then you're kind of wagging your finger going, 'Shame on you for laughing!'" he continues."Then, when they're feeling bad about themselves, you try and make the audience feel some sympathy. And they're like, 'Oh, there's depth to him! Of course, of course!'"And then you just go, 'No, there's not any depth to me! And you should feel bad about yourself for liking me again'."That just seemed really good fun. To be able to toy with whether they were enjoying it or were repulsed by it or not," he says.Based on the 1998 novel by Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh, some cinema-goers will find plenty to be repulsed by in McAvoy's immoral copper, whose antics become more and more outrageous as he loses touch with reality.Jamie Bell and Imogen Poots play colleagues competing for a promotion, while Jim Broadbent is his psychiatrist and Eddie Marsan a tormented friend.Originally branded "un-filmable", it was relative newcomer Jon S Baird's screenplay that finally convinced Welsh that Filth could be brought to the big screen. But neither was convinced McAvoy was suitable the role."He looked very young this particular day," remembers director Baird, sitting in the very seat at London's Soho Hotel where McAvoy first changed his and Welsh's minds."But 20 minutes after talking to him, he had morphed into this middle-aged, grizzled, alcoholic divorcee. It was pretty mad."He started talking about his experience with mental illness, and that's the thing that bonded us. He had experience of that with somebody he grew up with."As soon as I knew he understood that, it was game over. It was like, 'He is the guy'. We offered him the part the same day."For The Last King of Scotland and Atonement star, it was "a cathartic experience" to portray Bruce as he slowly unravelled.But the star, who recently took a beating in Danny Boyle's psychological thriller Trance, found himself being roughed up again for Filth - except this time he was in drag."I hated being in that outfit," grimaces McAvoy."There's something about being covered in blood and cold and you're having to act all mashed up - it makes me feel abused and not nice."Then he laughs: "And yeah, you look at yourself with a wig on and a beard and blood all over your face and just go, 'How am I ever going to get my wife to fancy me again?'"The pain was worth it - if you believe the cinema-going public in Scotland, where the film was released a week ahead of the rest of the UK and took £250,000 at just 38 screens."Trying to get this thing made over the years, I'm so relieved now that it didn't get made earlier, because it would never have been as good," confesses Welsh, who calls McAvoy's performance "off the scale"."I'm still astonished by it, to be honest. Thinking about all the great iconic solo performances that I've seen in my lifetime, I just can't think of anyone that betters it."He's got to convey loss and pathos, aggression and violence, hatred and manipulation. It's like watching a great Shakespearean."As one of the film's many producers (who also include Trudie Styler), McAvoy got to see that fearless performance of his up close in the edit suite - and even sent some scenes to the cutting-room floor."I'd be saying to Jon, 'Get rid of that bit. I know you love it, I know you think that's great but it's slowing everything down,'" he says."And you're like, 'I've just told him to cut a bit of my performance!' I never thought I'd see the day that happens, you know?"Filth also provided McAvoy with another first - acting alongside his sister, Joy."It was amazing, she's an amazing actress. She's got her own approach and her own on-screen and on-stage charisma, which I'm in thrall of at times," he says."Once the camera started rolling she was there, she was in it; and I was there and I was in it; and we just kind of went for it. That's the McAvoy way, maybe!"Next May, audiences will see McAvoy return to the land of big budget blockbusters in his second X-Men film, Days of Future Past, which he finished shooting around a month ago.He plays a younger Charles Xavier alongside the likes of Hugh Jackman and Michael Fassbender, and has a scene with the "original" Charles, Patrick Stewart."It was good, it was really good," says McAvoy. "We got to almost physically, but still metaphorically a little bit, pass the baton."The star has already moved on to his next film - a new take on Mary Shelley's classic novel Frankenstein, in which he plays Victor Von Frankenstein to Daniel Radcliffe's Igor."Me and him met last week," reveals McAvoy. "We had our first rehearsal, it was awesome.""The monster isn't so much trying to come to terms with his existence as he is in the Kenneth Branagh one," he explains."It's an adventure, and the backbone of the adventure is the relationship between me and Daniel. It's more about those two - brothers in science and brothers in adventure."He pauses, and laughs: "It sounds like I'm pitching 'Weird Science: The Movie' here!"</body>

      <description>Paul McCartney on how happiness inspired new album</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24388317</url>
      <date>1380881740</date>
      <body>As Sir Paul McCartney prepares to release his first solo album in six years he tells of how his happiness with his wife Nancy Shevell has inspired his writing, how he struggles not to repeat the past and how his wedding DJ ended up as a producer on the album New.Is New a joyful album?This is a happy period in my life, having a new woman - so you get new songs when you get a new woman. But in actual fact there is a lot of sadness mixed in on the record - the more you listen to it you'll find pain getting changed to laughter - there is quite an undercurrent of that. But generally I'm having a good time so I hope that's made it onto the record.Why did you chose the four producers for this album?Mark Ronson DJ'd at our wedding. He's a really good DJ and we like to dance and a lot of our friends do - so we had a little dance floor and there was kind of disco situation at the reception. He was DJing and putting on great music and it just kept us all going and I knew I liked him. I'd also met him on and off because he's friends with Sean Lennon.I've known Giles Martin (son of Beatles producer George Martin) since he was a little kid. Ethan Johns (Ryan Adams and Kings of Leon) was the son of Glyn Johns one of my Beatles and Wing's producers. Paul Epworth (Adele, Florence and the Machine) I didn't really know but I knew his work.But I was mainly really looking at their work and if you look at any of those producers they've all done great work recently. It's not just something they did in the past and that's what I was looking for. I just really enjoyed working with each one of them, but in a different way every time.Could they say no to you?I always make it one of the first things we talk about when we're sitting down and just settling in and I say OK lets get this straight everyone in this room has got an opinion and don't be frightened to tell me, particularly the producer because that's his job.I say 'tell me if you don't like it or I'm doing it lousy' and I will refer to them and say 'was that any good?' So they do have a voice and I encourage the voice. I say 'please don't be frightened just because I've done that or I've done that, don't worry about it let's just start fresh and you tell me'.But can they challenge you as much as John Lennon did?No. We were just kids that had grown up together, so any of the guys in the Beatles just could tell each other 'I don't like that' and then it meant it had to go.Do you wish you could release this album without people knowing your past work?In an impossible world it would be nice if no-one knew what I had done - and there are a lot of young people who don't know what I've done. But mainly people are looking at what I'm doing now as a continuation of all the other stuff.But I don't really worry about it. The main thing I try and do is not copy what I've done in the past. I've found myself once or twice, picking up a guitar and thinking I'm going to write a new Eleanor Rigby - I have to stop myself trying to do that.There is the past but I don't see it as a burden, I see it as something I'm very lucky to have. But when you do a show - you can't just do new songs, if I don't do Hey Jude I've missed an opportunity. In Las Vegas (performing at the iHeartRadio music festival) we were mainly doing our new songs and it was going down well, but man when we got to Live and Let Die the audience responded - we basically blew them up and they loved that.Are you trying to make a statement with the track Early Days?When I write songs I don't always think I'm going to make a statement. On the day (I wrote the track Early Days) I was thinking about the past, particularly me and John in Liverpool in the early days so I just ran with that. I started to get images of us in the record shop listening to early rock and roll and looking at the posters and the joy that that gave me remembering all those moments.So that song just evolved around that and then I found that one of the things that came was - you can't take it away from me, even though you can say 'hey this is what happened in Liverpool in the late 1950s but I'm going to say 'were you there or did you just read about it?' Because I was there and I was walking down that street - so it's that kind of song. It gets a bit of a dig at people who say they know what it was all about but they weren't there - but mainly it's just fond memories for me.Are you going to open the World Cup in Brazil, as has been rumoured?That's just a rumour - there's no truth to it. I know somebody asked me to be involved in the (Rio) Olympics. Every time these great occasions come up it's great that they think about me, I love it and I'm very flattered, but you can't just be the guy on all of them. It's going to get boring for the audience 'oh no not him again here we go again na na na na, nananana'.Are you cool?I never feel cool. I'm just me. I recently went to Las Vegas to do iHeartRadio (music festival) and there's a lot of cool people on that and so because they're in Las Vegas they all walk around with their entourage and their security and everyone's very serious about how cool they are.And course there's me and I'm going 'Hi Miley' and I think 'oh god what am I doing I sound like a fan, I should try to be cool'. But they didn't even notice me. Actually, the security noticed me and they doubled back and she came and said hello.New is released on 14 October (15 in US)</body>

      <title>The bumpy road to the National Theatre</title>
      <description>Did its early difficulties aid the National Theatre's vibrancy?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24382746</url>
      <date>1380846771</date>
      <body>The National Theatre may be approaching its 50th anniversary on 22 October, but did the delays and obstacles it encountered during its creation result in a more versatile and creative establishment than elsewhere in Europe?Disdain and hostility are not uncommon responses to major new cultural projects in the UK, but the venomous attacks levelled, over two centuries, against the idea of a national theatre leave a sour taste in the mouth even today.Seymour Hicks, an early 20th Century dramatist and star of musical comedies, was against it being created and said: "The National Theatre! I wonder if there are really half a dozen people insane enough to think it will ever come into existence. We have national taxes, national schools, national horrors of every kind - spare us a national theatre!"France has had a national theatre since 1680, Denmark since 1748 and Greece since 1901. The National Theatre in London is a youngster by comparison, which seems surprising, perhaps, for the country of Shakespeare. But this is a complex and singularly British story in which the arts, history, politics and changing ideas about national identity share the stage.The story begins in 1848, when the radical publisher Effingham Wilson published a pamphlet called A House for Shakespeare.His passionate plea for a national theatre seized the imagination and support of figures such as Charles Dickens and Matthew Arnold, but there was fierce opposition from powerful West End actor-managers who liked the non-subsidised status quo.National Theatre associate director Michael Blakemore said the real reason there was not a national theatre earlier was because the language was English."Now, if you run a theatre in say Denmark, then the performances and the productions' lives end at the border, since very few people in Europe speak your language, so the only way you can support a national theatre is with public money," he said."But in England, what happened was that a great actor like Henry Irving and all the great 19th Century actors had another market for their work and that market was the US and Australasia. They all went on tour and made a fortune so they didn't need to be supported by public money."Meanwhile, in the countries where there was a theatre subsidised by the state or court - such as the Comedie Francaise in France - the same classic plays tended to be performed again and again in the same old way.So, perhaps it helped that the London National was not established earlier by the state?Nicholas Hytner, the outgoing artistic director of the National, is proud of the range of its productions and wholeheartedly agrees."It was a very good thing that it was never set up by the court or by competing principalities looking to express their prestige through their theatres and opera houses and orchestras and dance companies. It's a good thing that it always bubbled up organically from underneath," he said.This bubbling up still took a surprisingly long time - with two World Wars intervening.Playwright Michael Frayn says the optimism of the period immediately after World War Two when other national institutions were established may have been key in getting the National Theatre off the ground."The war fostered the idea that you could actually collaborate as a nation, you could get together to think about how to live your life," he said."And this made possible after the war a lot of things like the National Health Service and the so-called welfare state which would have been impossible in the context of the 1930s, and maybe the National Theatre rode on the back of that."James Naughtie, the presenter of BBC radio programme Road to the National Theatre, believes in the powerful symbolic value of a third event."Post-war Britain was austere but exciting. From the rubble and the broken homes something better had to emerge. The National Theatre would become part of that process," he said,"The Festival of Britain, the centrepiece of post-war culture, was erected in 1951, on the anniversary of the Great Exhibition, intended as a symbol of recovery and a confident trumpet call."At long last, during that year, a foundation stone was laid. It still took until 1963 for the establishment of the National Theatre, and the Denys Lasdun building on the South Bank did not open its doors to audiences until 1976.What would Seymour Hicks - with his notion that less than half a dozen people believed in the idea of National Theatre - make of its success today?Last year, one and a half million people attended National Theatre shows, either on the South Bank or at West End transfers such as War Horse, One Man, Two Guvnors or The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.And that is not to mention the latest venture - National Theatre Live - which last year beamed performances of productions such as Frankenstein and Hamlet to more than three million people in cinemas across the globe.The road may have been long, hard and boulder-strewn but, at a youthful 50, the National Theatre is more vibrant than ever.Listen to the Road to the National Theatre on BBC Radio 4 on 6 and 13 October at 13:30 BST, or hear it on iPlayer.</body>

      <title>Obituary: Tom Clancy</title>
      <description>Author Tom Clancy remembered</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24362892</url>
      <date>1380734127</date>
      <body>Tom Clancy, who has died aged 66, was one of the world's best-selling - and wealthiest - thriller writers.His books - which included The Hunt for Red October and Patriot Games - inspired both blockbuster films and best-selling video games.The American author's other bestsellers included Red Storm Rising, Clear and Present Danger, The Sum of All Fears and Without Remorse.Clancy once said his dream had been to publish a book so he could be "immortal" in the Library of Congress catalogue.Born in Baltimore on 12 April 1947, Clancy studied physics at college but switched to English, saying later that he wasn't clever enough for the challenges of science.His novels, however, were rich with authoritative scientific and technical detail, something Clancy put down to his enthusiasm for reading military journals.Clancy joined the US Army Reserve at university, but poor eyesight thwarted his ambition to serve in the Vietnam war. After graduation in 1969, he married and joined his wife's family's insurance business.Writing in his spare time as an insurance salesman, Clancy had an immediate success in 1984 with his first novel The Hunt for Red October. He sold the manuscript to the Naval Institute Press, which had never ventured into original fiction.President Ronald Reagan, who received the book as a Christmas present, said it was his favourite thriller, an endorsement that Clancy said helped put him on the New York Times best-seller list.Red October told the Cold War story of a Soviet navy captain who decides to defect to the United States with his nuclear submarine.It was made into an Oscar-winning film in 1990, starring Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan - a recurring hero of Clancy's - and Sir Sean Connery as Soviet submarine captain Marko Ramius.Clancy followed it up with Red Storm Rising and Patriot Games, which told of a fictional IRA splinter group that plots to kidnap the Prince and Princess of Wales.The latter title became the second Jack Ryan novel to be filmed, this time with Harrison Ford as the CIA analyst who, in Clancy's later works, was eventually elevated to President of the United States.Clancy's thrillers - he usually turned out one a year - made him one of the wealthiest writers in the world, with annual earnings of about $30m (£19m) in the mid-1990s.In a 2007 interview with US TV network AMC, Clancy attributed his success to dogged persistence and deep research."You learn to write the same way you learn to play golf," he said. "You do it, and keep doing it until you get it right."A lot of people think something mystical happens to you, that maybe the muse kisses you on the ear. But writing isn't divinely inspired - it's hard work.""I don't write about super-heroes," he told Verbosity magazine. "I want my protagonists to be recognisably human, with real human concerns."Some of my characters are based on real people. One's even based on me."Clancy also ventured into the world of video gaming, spawning best-selling titles that included the Ghost Recon and Splinter Cell series."What happened to me was pure dumb luck," Clancy told AMC TV. "I'm not the new [Ernest] Hemingway."Of course, fortune does favour the brave. In battle, you forgive a man anything except an unwillingness to take risks. Sometimes you have to put it on the line."What I did was take time away from how I earned my living. My wife gave me hell - 'Why are you doing this?' - but she doesn't complain anymore."I wanted to see my name on the cover of a book. If your name is in the Library of Congress, you're immortal."Despite several of his books making it to the big screen, Clancy admitted to having a sometimes rocky relationship with Hollywood."Books and movies are different art forms with different rules. And because of that, they never translate exactly," he said in an interview on CNN."Their view of my books frequently takes different paths from the way I think about it. But that's to be expected."They pay me money and buy the book. When they buy the book, they buy rights to play with the plot."The only person who has artistic control is the director, and 'director' is how you spell God in Hollywood."</body>

      <title>Ian McEwan on the appeal of Brazil</title>
      <description>Atonement author Ian McEwan on the appeal of Sao Paulo</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24339869</url>
      <date>1380764444</date>
      <body>The city of Sao Paulo would provide a rich setting for a book, offering infinite possibilities to an author, writer Ian McEwan has told the BBC World Service.McEwan was giving a rare interview ahead of a festival of Brazilian literature, FlipSide, in Suffolk this weekend.It has been co-founded by former director of Bloomsbury publishing Liz Calder, as a British counterpart to the original Flip festival, which takes place in the pretty coastal town of Paraty.In the past it has attracted the likes of Martin Amis, Margaret Atwood, Salman Rushdie, Hanif Kureishi and Will Self - as well as McEwan himself - to Brazil.The author of Atonement and Enduring Love began his interview by singing the praises of a young Brazilian writer Tatiana Salem Levy.Her story, Lost Time, is included in an anthology of Brazilian writers which will be launched during the Suffolk event.What appealed to you about Tatiana Levy's story, Lost Time?I thought it was a wonderful story that wears its symbolism very lightly.It's about a woman who is invited to a funeral: She is 60 years old, the funeral is without a body. It is [the funeral] of her lover who died 40 years ago. They were both fighters in the resistance.He's died, disappeared, there are no documents about him, so the family and friends have gathered to bury him in a coffin that is empty.She returns to the coffin a little amulet that he gave her on the night that he disappeared. And yet she drives away smiling, full of a sense that she is in charge of time.I was very touched by that, I thought in the space of six, seven pages, this writer, a young writer, catches something quite profound about a country that has come out of a dictatorship, a totalitarian, military state and is now on the edge of being a world power.You've been friends with Liz Calder for many years. Can you remember the first time she spoke about Brazil?It was about 12 years ago. I was very surprised when she told me she had bought a place just outside Paraty. Then, the next thing, I find myself with my wife and our younger son Greg in Paraty. Then the fun started.Greg said at breakfast, after the first night: "I have found my second country. This has been the best 12 hours of my life!" He later went back to Brazil and became fluent in Brazilian Portuguese.We had an amazing week at this festival. It had only been going one year but it was already apparent that the festival was going to turn around the fortunes of this rather sleepy, colonial, extremely pretty, coastal town.How much impact does Brazilian culture have in the UK?It is difficult to quantify but things are about to change, with the World Cup and the Olympics. There will be a fantastic focus on all things Brazilian.We have watched the protests in Brazil with interest. And there is a huge Brazilian community in London.But there is an age-old problem - translation. We don't even read much French modern literature and they [the French] are only a few miles away.We have both the fortune and misfortune to speak a world language and with that comes a kind of blindness. If you are at the centre of an empire, you become incurious. But I think it will change.You are a fan of the work of American poet Elizabeth Bishop. Have you read the poems she wrote about Brazil? Have any of them stayed with you?We had a private tour of her house in Ouro Preto. There's a poem that she wrote as if she is catching snatches of conversations from her window (Under the Window: Ouro Preto). A wonderful celebration of a place, it couldn't be anywhere else. Rather like when one reads the poetry of Wordsworth in a particular location.She used to call herself shy. Yet in her letters to friends she said she felt very welcome in Brazil, and surrounded by the warmth of the people. Did you feel the same?I'm cautious about dealing in cliche, but it is the case that any visitor to Brazil almost immediately feels this warmth. It's a very good country to be a traveller in. People are so immediately pleasant, it is quite extraordinary.Would you ever set one of your books in a foreign land?Only if I needed to and in the terms of staying within the circle of my ignorance. In other words, I couldn't pretend to inhabit and understand from the inside a foreign culture.But to send a character through a landscape with the impressions that might be mine or invented, absolutely, one needs that freedom.So, imagine a character travelling through Brazil. What would he see through the window?My first thought is about the city. I think 85% of the Brazilian population lives in cities. I spent a few days in Sao Paulo and felt almost as if I was on another planet. Almost twenty million people, maybe only Mexico City is bigger. You are looking at a human agglomeration on another scale from London or New York. So, to make this thought experiment I would have one of my characters get lost in Sao Paulo. Get lost and either get frightened or full of wonder, or possibly both.There are two lines of thought about these colossal cities. One line is that they contain a vast human and social tragedy of slums and so on. The other view, more optimistic, is cities are the great engines of vitality and innovation. That there is more organisation in a slum than social anthropologists ever dream.That paradox is one that a foreigner would be interested in. Some time in the late 80s, on planet Earth, suddenly more people lived in the cities than in the countryside. It was a huge turning point and we are still living through a big revolution in human consciousness: the vast flight from the countryside to the city.This has certain positive aspects. Women tend to have fewer children when they move to the cities, so they can flourish more, and children tend to get better education in the cities, even in poorer circumstances, than in the countryside. Also, this leaves open a lot of land, for agriculture and wilderness. Yet, at the same time, there are gangs, violence, drugs, deprivation, homelessness and so on.We still face a population explosion but sometime in the 21st century the population will age and shrink. That, too, may be a fantastic opportunity. It's an open question.That book of yours sounds very interesting. So, to finalise, there will be music at the festival. Have you heard any Brazilian music?I bid at a charity auction for a wonderful classical guitarist, Craig Ogden, to play at my house. We had friends come around and after he played, he gave his guitar to our friend, who sang these beautiful Brazilian love songs. Everyone was a bit tearful around the table. Well, they were softened up by some very good red wine!I thought: "Yes, it's time to get back to Brazil."The Flipside Festival begins on Friday 4 October.Radio 4's short story series Brazilian Bonanza also kicks off on Friday with Lost Time by Tatiana Salem Levy at 1545.</body>

      <description>A profile of horse racing pundit John McCririck</description>

      <date>1380729045</date>
      <body>He has made a career as the loud, garish and eccentric face of Channel 4's racing coverage, and is as recognisable for his signature deerstalker hat as his reality TV appearances.John McCririck, 73, once described by television critic Nina Myskow as having "all the charm of an armpit", was a waiter, bookmaker and British Press Award-winning journalist before going on to become a racing pundit for ITV.In 1984, Channel 4 took over TV racing coverage and he went on to become the flamboyant figurehead of Channel 4 Racing for 29 years and 5,000 broadcasts.The fast-talking, wildly gesticulating tipster was raised in Jersey by wealthy parents and educated at Harrow.Known for his energetic dispatches from the racecourse - clad in tweed and gold jewellery, clutching giant Havana cigars - to his followers he is "Big Mac" and the punter's friend.However, he told The Guardian in 2001 that he was only on television because he "failed at everything else" - including being sacked by the Dorchester Hotel for spilling soup over a customer, and being dismissed by Sporting Life in 1984.He was, he declared, "a failed punter, a failed bookmaker, a failed journalist". But he also insisted that his on-screen character was "the real me"."You are as you are on the telly," he said. "I think it's the real me. Anyone who tries to put on an act on telly over the years wouldn't get away with it."At his tribunal, though, he also said he played a "pantomime villain" during appearances on reality TV programmes Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity Wife Swap."This is a different persona," he said of his bombastic and "domineering" image. "You are putting on a performance, you are doing a pantomime act."Celebrity Wife Swap revealed his recumbent lifestyle at home in London with his wife Jenny - referred to by McCririck as "the booby".He told the Guardian in 2004 that this was in reference to a South American bird that is "stupid and pathetically easy to catch and squawks a lot".He appeared with Jenny on Celebrity Coach Trip in 2011, becoming the only couple to be voted out unanimously, twice.Before that he lasted just 12 days in the Celebrity Big Brother house in 2005, before being evicted amid accusations of sexism and misogyny.Yet McCririck has denied allegations he is "anti-women", saying he was never asked to tone down his language on air.''It's a very public school thing, it's a bit immature but it lightens up the programme," he said at the end of the first tribunal hearing.Five Live presenter and former Channel 4 racing commentator Derek "Tommo" Thompson worked with McCririck - also known as "Big Mac" - for 30 years before also being dropped from Channel 4 in October."John is without doubt the most professional man I've ever worked with," he said. "He does his homework. He has two race cards in case he loses one, and two watches in case one stops. He is meticulous."Thompson described McCririck as "on the ball" and maintained that his views were "provocative but not far-fetched"."He's razor sharp," he said. "He talks a lot of sense. His ideas have helped punters across the world."Fellow former racing presenter Lesley Graham - who told the tribunal on Tuesday that she believed a reduction in her working hours was because of her age - also pointed to a difference between McCririck's on- and off-screen personas."He's not like he appears," she said. "He's no shrinking violet, but off-camera he is quite quiet and private."However, she added: "I wouldn't go as far as to say it's all an act. There's a reasonable male chauvinist in there! But Mac is just more open about expressing that than other people."When I first joined Channel 4 there were not many other women on TV, and John was the one person to call me and wish me luck."He is very much like Marmite - but whether you love him or hate him, he did give our sport a wider profile. TV is entertainment and what Mac brought to our sports programme was colour and controversy."McCririck was replaced in October by a new presenting team headed by Clare Balding.Yet he has historically described himself as "the face of racing alongside Frankie Dettori"."I acknowledge I antagonise people, as twice in the Celebrity Big Brother House proved," he told the Daily Telegraph last October."Yet as Clare Balding, a terrific choice to head the new young team, said recently, I've become the face of racing alongside Frankie Dettori and now, of course, Clare herself."</body>

      <title>US shutdown starts hitting business</title>
      <description>US Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker warns that business is starting to suffer from the federal shutdown.</description>

      <date>1381060028</date>
      <body>US Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker has warned that business is starting to suffer from the federal shutdown.Her comments at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) came as leaders gathering for the summit voiced worries about the US situation.Philippine President Benigno Aquino said that what happens in the US "affects us all".On Friday, the US defence contractor Lockheed Martin said it would put 3,000 workers on unpaid leave.The US government closed non-essential operations on Tuesday after Congress failed to agree a new budget.And President Barack Obama cancelled a scheduled trip to Asia because of the shutdown."The shutdown is not good for business. It's not good for the economy," Ms Pritzker said. One consequence of the shutdown had been her department's inability to collate vital economic data."We're a huge source of data for American business and that is a problem... It's affecting businesses and it's affecting their ability to get data," she said.From Monday, Lockheed will put 3,000 staff on leave, but the defence giant said this number would rise if the shutdown continued."I'm disappointed that we must take these actions and we continue to encourage our lawmakers to come together to pass a funding bill that will end this shutdown,'' Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed's chief executive and president, said in a statement."We hope that Congress and the Administration are able to resolve this situation as soon as possible," she added.The announcement followed United Technologies' decision to temporarily lay off 2,000 employees.The company, which makes Blackhawk helicopters, said some manufacturing had been halted because there were no government inspectors working to sign off products.Global impactThe widening impact of the shutdown sparked concern at Apec meeting in Bali on Sunday.Mrs Aquino said: "The US economy is the number one economy in the world, what happens there affects all of us."The world economy obviously is not in a position to withstand too much shock at this time when we are just recovering as a global economy."Meanwhile, Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said the US had to confront its fiscal problems "in a better way than they are doing it now with shutting down the government".Mr Obama is refusing to negotiate with the Republicans over the budget issues until they pass a temporary bill to reopen the government.He also wants agreement to raise the $16.7 trillion US borrowing limit, to avoid the country defaulting on its debts.</body>

      <title>South African car deal ends strike</title>
      <description>A South African union representing car workers agrees a new pay deal, ending a month-long strike that has crippled the industry.</description>

      <body>A South African union representing car workers has agreed a new pay deal, ending a month-long strike that has crippled the industry.The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa accepted a 10% pay rise this year and 8% in the next two years.The strike in the car components industry caused severe disruption, especially to exports.Last week BMW said it had stopped "all future plans" to expand in South Africa because of the industrial action.Under the deal, pay at small-to-medium-sized car parts firms will only rise wages by 9% in the first year, followed by 8% in the subsequent two years."The strike was very hard for us," Irvin Jim, the general secretary of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), told reporters.The car components' strike followed industrial action by workers at car manufacturers themselves, which hit production at BMW, Ford, Nissan and General Motors and cost an estimated $2bn (£1.24bn) in lost output.This year, the mining, construction and aviation sectors have also been hit by strikes, raising concerns about the impact on South Africa's economic growth.Last week, Bodo Donauer, managing director at BMW South Africa, said the company had been unable to produce 11,000 cars while its workers were striking."But more important than these 11,000 cars is the sustainable damage which this [the strike] has made," Mr Donauer said.On Sunday, Mr Jim said BMW's decision to stop future investment was "blackmail" which would be "rejected with the contempt it deserves".</body>

      <title>'Nuclear implications' of power loss</title>
      <description>A loss of power for more than 90 minutes at Devonport Dockyard had potential nuclear implications, a Ministry of Defence report says.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-24421402</url>
      <date>1381079044</date>
      <body>A loss of power at a city dockyard had "potential nuclear implications", a Ministry of Defence (MoD) report said.The 90-minute power-loss, at Devonport in Plymouth, could have been "catastrophic", a nuclear analyst said.Caused by a central nuclear switchboard fault at the yard, it was the most potentially dangerous of 50 "events" recorded in 2012.The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) has now issued an improvement notice on the dockyard.Power is essential at the dockyard to ensure reactors on the nuclear submarines are kept cool.The incident, in July 2012, was regarded as code-B on the sliding scale of "severity" - code A being the most severe.John Large, an engineer and independent nuclear analyst, said: "The loss of power was a catastrophic event, which is what happened before the Fukushima meltdown."According to the improvement notice the dockyard, which is operated by Babcock Marine, has until 31 March 2014 to meet its own operating rules and instructions.No-one from the operating firm has been available for comment.However, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said it took all safety concerns "extremely seriously" and was aware of the ONR improvement notice.In a statement issued to BBC News, the MoD said it understood Babcock Marine had agreed an improvement programme with the ONR to "enable the identified issues to be addressed in a timely manner"."We will continue to work with Babcock Marine and safety regulators to ensure that safety is managed effectively across the wider Devonport site," a spokesperson said.The ONR said Devonport Royal Dockyard Limited had taken action to remedy some of the problems identified and it was satisfied there was "no immediate impact on safety", but it believed the improvement notice was "necessary".In the "site event" report for HM Naval Base Devonport, the MoD said 50 events in 2012 was higher number than the two previous years, but "broadly similar" to the number recorded in 2008 and 2009.The report said it was "reasonable" to expect a rise in the number of events as there had been a corresponding increase in the number of "submarine" days in specially-designed nuclear dockyard berths."With more routine and non-routine nuclear activity, it is reasonable to expect an associated increase in the number of events," the report said.The report said previously unidentified faults in standby diesel generators meant the secondary power source was unable to re-supply power for more than 90 minutes."Through a combination of factors and additional unidentified defects, this defect was revealed, and resulted in an event with potential nuclear implications," the report said.An earthquake and tsunami off the coast of Japan in March 2011 knocked out cooling systems to reactors at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, three of which melted down.Devonport resident Ian Avent, who is also the organiser of the Campaign Against Nuclear Storage and Radiation, described the loss of power as "scary".Oliver Colvile, the Conservative MP for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, said he was very concerned about the situation and intended to speak to Babcock Marine about the actions it was taking.He said he expected the "highest levels of safety" to be maintained at the dockyard.</body>

      <title>Tory MP pushes for early EU vote</title>
      <description>A prominent Conservative backbench MP says he will try to force the government to hold an early referendum on whether the UK should leave the EU.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24417670</url>
      <date>1381073991</date>
      <body>Prominent Conservative backbencher Adam Afriyie has said he will try to force the government to hold an early vote on whether the UK should leave the EU.The prime minister has promised to hold an in/out referendum in 2017 if he wins the next general election, but Mr Afriyie said voters were "not convinced" that it would happen.He said he would push for a vote in October 2014 instead.But Home Secretary Theresa May warned that Mr Afriyie had "got it wrong".And a Downing Street spokesman said of Mr Afriyie's plan: "The PM will not let it stand."Mr Afriyie - who has denied newspaper claims he is being groomed to replace party leader David Cameron - said he would table an amendment to the European Union (Referendum) Bill on Monday.Mr Cameron has pledged to renegotiate the UK's relationship with the EU before an in/out referendum in 2017.But, speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics programme, Mr Afriyie said there would be "ample time" to conduct this renegotiation by as early as next year."By having a referendum in 2014, it gives us 12 months to renegotiate," he said. "But more than that, it kick-starts negotiations."EU member states would need to "accommodate" British demands for reforms "if they wish us to remain", he added.He argued: "I think it strengthens the prime minister's hand."The MP said 80% of people wanted a referendum, and more than 50% of people wanted a referendum this side of the election."British businesses need certainty," he said."Look, we can carry on kicking this can down the road forever."But I've had a struggle with my conscience over this one."I don't want to cause any trouble over it, but I think it's absolutely essential that Parliament and MPs have the opportunity to search their souls and to give people a referendum this side of the election."In an article for the Mail on Sunday, he predicted that - without a referendum before 2015 - "large numbers of people will continue to vote UKIP whatever happens - and if they do, there is a distinct danger that Labour will gain a majority and we will never see a referendum at all".UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he would be "absolutely delighted" if Britain could have an early referendum.He told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme on Sunday that a referendum before 2015 would be good for British industry and business."Adam Afriyie has put his finger on the real problem - and that's that four years ago, Mr Cameron gave us a cast-iron guarantee that there would be a referendum."This time last year, he was saying there would not be a referendum, and he is now saying there should be a referendum."People are not quite sure what to believe."But Mrs May, speaking on the same programme, said: "We need to be negotiating that settlement with the European Union and then put to the British people the Europe of the future - not the Europe of the past - and give them that opportunity to say in or out."What is crucial is that we have, at the next election, a Conservative party that will be offering people that renegotiation of a new settlement with Europe, looking to the future and then putting that to the British people in an in/out referendum."Backbench Conservative MP James Wharton is attempting to enshrine his party leadership's referendum pledge in law - without the support of coalition partners the Liberal Democrats - with his European Union (Referendum) Bill.As a private member's bill, it is vulnerable to being delayed by procedural tactics from MPs who oppose it, and will only become law if the government allocates enough parliamentary time for its proponents to overcome any such hurdles.Mrs May warned that Mr Afriyie's amendment to the bill could "jeopardise" its prospects entirely.And Mr Wharton told BBC Radio 5 live the amendment could "kill" his bill."My concern is that any amendment, no matter how well-meaning it might be, is going to make the progress of the bill more difficult and it'll make it easier for those MPs who want to use procedural techniques to slow it down and stop it... that bit more possible."I don't want to see that. I'd like to see my bill go through and I think this harms the chances of that happening."Liberal Democrat deputy leader Simon Hughes, whose party opposes a referendum on the EU unless further powers are handed from Westminster to Brussels, said a 2014 referendum would be a "barmy" distraction from the government's attempts to boost UK economic growth.Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said the Conservative leadership had scheduled a referendum in 2017 due to "internal party management as much as anything else".The PM's promise of a "grand, unilateral renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU" was "deeply flawed and bound to unravel", he added, in pre-released extracts of a speech to be delivered in London on Tuesday.The European Union (Referendum) Bill is due to return to the House of Commons for further debate on 8 November.</body>

      <title>Demand for Royal Mail shares strong</title>
      <description>Demand for Royal Mail shares is high enough for the government to sell them near the top of its hoped-for price band.</description>

      <body>Demand for Royal Mail shares is high enough for the government to be able to sell them near the top of its hoped-for price band.The government had priced the shares at between 260-330p, but demand is outstripping supply and they will be sold for between 300-330p.BBC business editor Robert Peston says applications for the shares are a "few times" the value of those on offer.Labour says there is a danger the privatisation undervalues the business.Shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, expressed concern over the possible sale of Royal Mail sites after the privatisation."Royal Mail has a huge property portfolio in prime development sites in London and across Britain and there is nothing to stop the privatised company making a quick buck by flogging off these assets for development," he said.He also said that if sites are sold customers could face longer trips to collect their mail.The government is selling up to 62% of the business and will keep the rest.Under the terms of the share sale a 10% stake in the business has been reserved for Royal Mail employees.Members of the Communication Workers Union are currently voting on whether to strike over the government's privatisation plan.The ballot closes on 16 October. The earliest a strike could be held would be 23 October.Members of the public can apply for Royal Mail shares online until 8 October. Shares will begin trading in full on 15 October.The minimum application for the public wishing to purchase shares is £750, or £500 for eligible Royal Mail employees.The government said it might also sell an additional 15% of its stake in what is called an "over-allotment" option, if the demand for shares was very high.In the official prospectus for the share issuing, the Royal Mail warned that industrial action posed a potential risk for the share price.The statement said: "National industrial action, or the threat of national industrial action... could also have a material adverse effect on the success of the offer and, if it occurs after admission, could cause the price of ordinary shares to fall significantly."</body>

      <title>Bank card fraud 'highest since 2009'</title>
      <description>Card fraud hits its highest half-yearly level since 2009 as fraudsters tricked consumers into handing over details, an industry group says.</description>

      <body>Card fraud hit its highest half-yearly level since 2009 as fraudsters tricked consumers into handing over details.Some £216m on credit and debit cards was lost to fraudsters in the first six months of the year, a 17% increase on the same period in 2012.Financial Fraud Action, which represents the financial services industry, said this was still well below the peak of £304m in 2008.Some con-artists have posed as police officers to gather vital information.Others have posed as bank fraud investigators to deceive people into handing over their cards or four-digit Pin.The figures show a 23% rise in the level of fraud on telephone, online and mail order shopping, as the trend of buying over the internet continues.Meanwhile, ID theft has risen by 24% and counterfeiting was up 15% when people's cards were cloned or skimmed.In June, Financial Fraud Action warned about "shoulder surfing", when thieves look over a person's shoulder while they key in their number at cash machines and then distract them as the card comes out of the ATM, enabling the thief to snatch it."The move towards these low-tech crimes of deception highlights the importance of consumers knowing how they can protect themselves," said Detective Chief Inspector Dave Carter, head of the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit."Whether victims are targeted on the phone or online, we know that these professional conmen are highly persuasive."He urged people to keep their Pin safe, shield it when using a cash machine, and check that a website is secure - featuring a padlock icon - when shopping online.He stressed that banks and police officers would never call or email to ask for a Pin number, or full login details.</body>

      <body>Nestle has won a court battle with confectionery rival Cadbury, over Cadbury's attempt to trademark the purple colour of its Dairy Milk bars.Last year Cadbury won a legal case to stop other chocolate firms using the colour - known as Pantone 2865c.But Swiss firm Nestle, the world's biggest food company, has now won an appeal against that earlier ruling."Cadbury's formulation does not comply with the requirements for [trademark] registration," said the UK court.The Court of Appeal also said the trademark application lacked "the required clarity, precision, self-containment, durability and objectivity to qualify for registration".The legal battle has been running since 2008, when Nestle first opposed Cadbury's initial trademark application.Cadbury - bought by US food giant Kraft in 2010 - has been using a purple colour on its chocolate wrappers since the early 20th century."We are disappointed by this latest decision but it's important to point out that it does not affect our long held right to protect our distinctive colour purple from others seeking to pass off their products as Cadbury chocolate," said a Cadbury spokesman."Our colour purple has been linked with Cadbury for a century and the British public has grown up understanding its link with our chocolate."We are studying this particular ruling and will consider our next steps which includes the possibility of an appeal."Nestle said it welcomed the court decision, which it believed "was the right outcome from a legal perspective".</body>

      <body>The auction house Sotheby's has put in place a defence to ward off takeovers, just days after an attack on its leadership by an activist investor.It gives existing shareholders rights to double their shareholding should any investor's stake go above 10%.The "poison pill" would make it much more expensive for Mr Loeb to build a stake of more than 10%.This week investor Daniel Loeb, who has a 9.3% stake, said Sotheby's was a painting desperately needing restoring."Poison pill" defences are so-called because they should make a target company unpalatable to predators.Through his hedge fund, Third Point, Mr Loeb targets what he considers to be underperforming companies.Previously his fund has taken significant stakes in Sony and Yahoo.In a letter sent earlier this week he said Sotheby's boss William Ruprecht enjoyed the perks of a "long-gone era of imperial CEOs", that included club memberships.He has accused Sotheby's management of wasting shareholders' money, singling out what he says was an "extravagant" lunch and dinner at a famous restaurant in New York, where they "feasted on organic delicacies and imbibed vintage wines at a cost to shareholders of multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars."We acknowledge that Sotheby's is a luxury brand, but there appears to be some confusion - this does not entitle senior management to live a life of luxury at the expense of shareholders."Third Point has been a strong buyer of Sotheby's shares, building up its stake from 5.7% in August to its current holding of more than 9%.</body>

      <body>The alleged mastermind behind the online illegal drugs marketplace Silk Road is too dangerous to be bailed, US prosecutors have said.Ross Ulbricht, 29, was arrested this week and is charged with being the administrator of the site which has now been shut down.He is also accused of trying to arrange the killing of one of the site's users."We deny all charges and that is the end of the discussion at this point," Mr Ulbricht's lawyer said.Mr Ulbricht appeared in a San Francisco court on Friday wearing a green T-shirt under red jail clothes and had his ankles shackled.A request from his legal team for his bail hearing to be pushed back was granted - it will now take place on 9 October.Federal magistrate Joseph Spero asked Mr Ulbricht's lawyer Brandon LeBlanc whether seeing the criminal indictment that included a murder-for-hire charge had "changed his calculus" on whether he thought Mr Ulbricht would be granted bail.As part of its criminal complaint, the FBI alleged that Mr Ulbricht had sought to pay a Silk Road user to kill another user who had threatened to expose details of the site's users.Prosecutors opposed the delay, arguing that Mr Ulbricht represented a danger to the community, and that there was a high likelihood that he may attempt to flee.The Silk Road was a well-known destination on Tor, a so-called "dark web" service that anonymises users, making it much more difficult for authorities to track locations.The site sold a range of items, but was most famous for offering a host of illegal drugs, paid for using virtual currency Bitcoin.</body>

      <title>Child benefit deadline day looms</title>
      <description>A tax boss says nearly 200,000 parents must "get off their backsides" and register with the UK tax authority amid changes to child benefit.</description>

      <body>A tax boss has said nearly 200,000 parents must "get off their backsides" and register with the UK tax authority amid changes to child benefit.Saturday marks the first deadline for better-off families to sign up with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).They will need to register for self-assessment so the HMRC can claw some or all of the benefit back.Families where one parent has a taxable income of more than £50,000 are affected.They will lose some of the benefit, following the introduction of the new rules in January 2013, while child benefit has been withdrawn entirely if one parent earns more than £60,000.Eligible families receive £20.30 per week in child benefit for their first child and £13.40 a week for any further children.The new rules meant that this payment is reduced gradually for families where one parent is earning between £50,000 and £60,000.HMRC has written to people who it believes have a taxable income of more than £50,000 and so need to take some action. Taxable income is earnings from employment, as well as other income such as from savings and shares, but may not include some pension contributions.Lin Homer, HMRC chief executive, told BBC Radio 5 Live: "We think there is about 200,000 people who need to get off their backsides and do something."Some 350,000 people have opted out of receiving child benefit altogether, generally because they earn and will continue to earn a taxable income of more than £60,000 and therefore would not be entitled to the payment.HMRC says another 425,000 people were already in self-assessment, some 140,000 people have registered for self-assessment, and another 185,000 people have still to register.In theory, the deadline to register and avoid a possible penalty is 5 October. The penalty would be between 10% and 100% of the child benefit paid.However, HMRC says it is unlikely that anyone who registers and pays the tax by 31 January would be penalised."HMRC is committed to helping people pay the right amount of tax and urges parents who have been affected by the changes to child benefit to register for self-assessment," said Ms Homer."We know that lots of people leave it until the last minute."Anita Monteith, of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, said: "This adds considerable complication to the tax system for ordinary people, particularly for those brought into the self-assessment system for the first time."I would urge those affected to register for self-assessment as soon as they can."</body>

      <title>New UK car sales best in five years</title>
      <description>New car sales hit the highest level in more than five years in September helped by the latest registration plate, according to the Society of Manufacturers and Traders.</description>

      <date>1380888667</date>
      <body>New UK car sales in September hit their highest monthly total for five and a half years as the latest 63-plate attracted buyers.The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said 403,136 new cars were registered in the UK, a rise of 12.1% on the same month in 2012.September is typically strong as it is one of the two months each year when new registration plates are issued.Cars made in the UK account for one in seven of the domestic sales.Ford's Fiesta remains the UK's top selling car, with 20,600 sold in September. Vauxhall's Corsa was in second place with 14,500 vehicles sold.Car sales have now risen for 19 months in a row.The SMMT's chief executive, Mike Hawes, said: "The UK market is reflecting growing economic confidence.""Robust private demand has played a major role in this growth, with customers attracted by exciting, increasingly fuel-efficient new models which offer savings in the cost of ownership."The SMMT said the growth also reflected the fact buyers were returning to the market after a period of holding off.Buyers typically tend to replace new cars after three years, but because of economic conditions in recent years may have left that longer.It is three years since the ending of the vehicle scrappage scheme, which gave people incentives to trade in their old cars. Cars bought under that scheme would now be around three years old.Another factor boosting sales was the type of financing deals available, which can lump together payments with servicing and even vehicle excise duty.Richard Lowe, an analyst at Barclays, said: "Attractive finance packages are offering consumers more clarity on running costs, which even with a more promising economic outlook is an important factor for those on a budget."But he added that the UK car market was likely to remain strong. "As we head into the quieter months, I suspect we'll see sales hold firm, keeping the UK market zooming ahead of our European counterparts," he said.The UK car market is the second biggest in Europe after Germany .So far this year, UK buyers have bought 1.79 million new cars, compared with Germany's 2.22 million.The gap between the two has shrunk 6% since this time last year.The figures came as Daimler announced record monthly sales at its Mercedes-Benz arm.In September sales volumes grew by 15.9% to 142,994 cars.The company said sales were driven by China, where volumes rose 21% last month."Looking at the previous nine months, we can safely say that Mercedes-Benz will post another sales record for 2013," said Joachim Schmidt, head of sales at Mercedes-Benz Cars.</body>

      <title>Twitter plans to raise $1bn in IPO</title>
      <description>In documents made public for the first time, social networking company Twitter has said it plans to raise $1bn as part of its stock market debut.</description>

      <date>1380856665</date>
      <body>Social networking company Twitter has said it plans to raise $1bn (£619m) in its stock market debut in documents filed with US regulators.In the filing, revealed on Thursday, the seven-year-old company said that it now has 218 million monthly users and that 500 million tweets are sent a day.It made a loss of $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m.It will be the largest Silicon Valley stock offering since Facebook's listing in 2012.Analysts said that the offering was likely to get a good response."Social media is red hot," said Internet analyst Lou Kerner. "Twitter is front and centre benefiting from market enthusiasm for all things social, and remarkably strong metrics."The filing also revealed Twitter's finances for the first time.While the company has never made a profit, its revenue has grown from just $28m in 2010 to $317m by the end of 2012.Around 85% of Twitter's revenue last year came from ad sales; the rest was from licensing its data.The company takes in a significant portion of its ad revenue from mobile devices, an important metric often tracked by analysts.As of 2013, over 65% of the company's advertising revenue was generated from mobile devices. More than 75% of Twitter users accessed the site from their mobile phone during that same time period.Some analysts said that the decision by the firm to raise capital indicated that it was keen on improving the way people enjoy content on its platform and how advertisers connect with its users."Users should be happy about this," said Zachary Reiss-Davis, an analyst with Forrester."It looks like Twitter is looking at how to enrich the experience and it understands that to build a successful service, they have to create something people like and want to come back to and spend time on."Peter Esho from Sydney-based Invast Financial Services, added that Twitter's ease to use had seen it increase its user base, making it an attractive option for advertisers."I think what Twitter has working in its favour is that it's very easy to use: it doesn't eat up too much bandwidth for the average user in places where broadband penetration is low," he said.The filing also revealed that two of the company's co-founders, Evan Williams and Jack Dorsey, own significant stakes in Twitter, and could stand to take in significant sums from the company's stock market listing.Mr Williams owns 12% of shares in the company, while Mr Dorsey owns 4.9%.Benchmark Capital's Peter Fenton, an early investor in the company, is the second-biggest shareholder, with 6.7% of shares.Twitter indicated three weeks earlier that it had filed for a public stock market offering.However, under a new law passed by Congress in 2012, it did not have to reveal its financial documents because it had revenue of less than $1bn.But by releasing the documents publicly, it gave an indication that it hopes to complete its stock sale soon.The company plans to list under the stock symbol TWTR, but it did not reveal which stock exchange, the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange, it had chosen.However, Mr Esho said that the listing was likely to be on the Nasdaq."I was to speculate, I think it would have to be Nasdaq," he said. "That really is the exchange that has seen so many tech names come to the market."Goldman Sachs is the lead bank taking the company public, a coveted position that is often fought for amongst the nation's biggest banks.The other banks helping with the offering are Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, BofA Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank Securities and CODE Advisors.</body>

      <body>Switzerland's financial regulator is investigating possible manipulation of foreign exchange rates at several Swiss financial institutions.The regulator, FINMA, said several banks, including some from outside Switzerland, could be implicated.It is coordinating the investigation closely with authorities in other countries.It would give no further details on the investigations or the banks potentially involved.Swiss Banking, the group that represents the nation's banks, said it had no further information.The Swiss announcement follows reports in June that the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), was looking into whether traders manipulated benchmark foreign-exchange rates to increase profits.This followed an investigation by Bloomberg News that found that dealers shared information and used client orders to move the rates.The FCA, which does not announce its investigations, only its enforcement actions, said: "We are aware of the allegations and we have been speaking to relevant parties."London is by far the world's biggest market for foreign currency trading, with 41% of global turnover, according to the Bank for International Settlements.New York has a 19% share, followed by Singapore, Tokyo and Hong Kong.Switzerland accounts for 3.2% of foreign exchange trading.</body>

      <title>Fine over unemployment phone scam</title>
      <description>Unemployed people were tricked into calling expensive premium rate numbers while applying for non-existent jobs.</description>

      <date>1380894936</date>
      <body>The man behind a phone scam targeting the unemployed has been fined £75,000 by the regulator PhonepayPlus.Jobseekers were tricked into calling expensive premium rate numbers while applying for non-existent jobs.In the ruling, the regulator said the numbers were run by sole trader John Francis, from Epsom, and cost callers a least 50p a minute. Some spent more than £80 enquiring about jobs.The regulator said the trick gave false hope to vulnerable people.Jobseeker Karl Lever told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours he was charged £40 after he responded to an advert for bar staff in Brighton.In his hour-long phone call he was asked about his suitability for the role, previous experience and even his medical history."In hindsight it did feel like they were trying to keep me on the phone for as long as possible," he said.In a statement, PhonepayPlus said: "When it received these complaints PhonepayPlus launched an investigation and found that they were linked. It then identified John Francis, registered as a sole trader, as the person responsible for the service."As well as the £75,000 fine, he has been ordered to refund all those affected.Paul Whiteing, PhonepayPlus chief executive, told You and Yours: "He has seven days to pay and if he doesn't we will pursue him through the courts."They look like conventional mobile phone numbers, therefore many people don't realise what they are - so something should be done about that."It's unacceptable."None of the callers were told about the cost of the calls and most believed they were calling a mobile number. But the 070 numbers cost at least 50p a minute and those running the lines take a cut.PhonepayPlus acknowledge that it can be confusing and said they were working with Ofcom, which allocates phone numbers, and are reviewing the use of these numbers.The regulator also found the same numbers used for bogus jobs on adverts for cheap housing and in spam emails sent out offering work.One complainant told the regulator about spending an hour on the phone trying to arrange an interview. After complaining about the delay, the complainant was told: "You'll be even less happy when you get the bill."John Francis has seven days to pay the fine, otherwise further action will be taken. He did not respond to the regulator.</body>

      <title>Amplats production hit by strikes</title>
      <description>Amplats, the world's biggest platinum producer, says it has lost an average of 3,100 ounces of production a day since workers went strike a week ago.</description>

      <body>Anglo American Platinum (Amplats), the world's biggest platinum producer, said it had lost an average of 3,100 ounces of production a day since workers went on strike a week ago.Staff at two mines in South Africa are striking over plans to cut 3,300 jobs.Amplats said the cuts are necessary for its long-term competitiveness.It had originally planned to lose up to 14,000 jobs, but had to pare that back after pressure from the government and trade unions.Last year, the company, which is 80% owned by Anglo American, reported a 6.33bn-rand ($710m; £452m) operating loss, partly due to output at its Rustenburg mine, in north-west of Johannesburg, being disrupted by violent strikes.The firm would not confirm what proportion of total production is being lost at the two mines.But based on current platinum trading prices of $1,380 an ounce, the lost output is equivalent to $4.3m a day.The company said less than 20% of workers had turned up for work at its Rustenburg and North of the Pilanesburg mining operations.The company, which mines about 40% of the world's platinum, said it would continue to engage with the union "to try and return the business safely to optimal operation levels".When the strike started Chris Griffith, Amplats' chief executive, said the company was under tremendous economic pressure."Strikes and work stoppages will result in further losses that will hamper plans for future sustainability and further threaten the future of our 45,000 employees," he said.Last August, Rustenburg was the scene of violent wildcat strikes, during which police shot dead 34 miners.The bloodshed at the Marikana mine was the most deadly police action since South Africa became a democracy in 1994 and sparked national outrage.</body>

      <title>Energy price freeze 'will happen'</title>
      <description>Labour leader Ed Miliband says he is "absolutely clear" that energy bills will be frozen if his party wins the next general election.</description>

      <date>1380878080</date>
      <body>Labour leader Ed Miliband has said he is "absolutely clear" that energy bills will be frozen if his party wins the next general election."We are absolutely confident because we've done all the figures, we've looked at all of the issues," he told the BBC's Breakfast programme.He repeated his accusation that energy companies have been over-charging businesses and consumers.Critics have warned that the plan could put future energy supplies at risk.But Mr Miliband claimed that energy companies were "unreliable witnesses" in the debate: "They're the people who would say that anyway.""There's a cost-of-living crisis in this country. Energy bills are a big part of it," he said."For too long the companies have been able to over-charge people. Somebody's got to stand up and be counted."That's why we'll freeze energy bills until the beginning of 2017 if we win the election. That will benefit 1.5 million businesses across our country, make a big difference to them."The policy was unveiled at the party's annual conference last week, and has faced strong criticism about its feasibility and the effect it would have on investment in energy infrastructure.But Mr Miliband continued: "Even if wholesale prices rise, this freeze is going to happen. I want to be absolutely clear about this."We're absolutely confident the companies can stomach this, can make this happen, and we're going to make this happen."He again dismissed predictions that energy companies might try to "collude" and hike prices before the election."If they try and do that, that is illegal," he said, "they can't do that."Labour has also released figures suggesting that British business could save £1.5bn if the price freeze came into force.The party said the estimate was based on research by the House of Commons Library.Meanwhile, two energy companies, EDF and First Utility, have unveiled plans to freeze current prices voluntarily.EDF Energy unveiled a new tariff that fixes bills until 2017, and First Utility said its current variable tariff would be frozen until March 2014.The former head of the UK's competition watchdog, John Fingleton, has suggested Labour's price-freeze policy was unlikely to work."In the long term [it] will harm consumers, and taking political responsibility for prices you cannot ultimately control is quite risky," he said earlier this month.The Conservatives have accused Labour of "bashing business" and insisted action was already being taken to ensure customers are on the cheapest tariff.Energy UK, the trade body representing the six largest energy firms, said the move could push up prices across the board and threaten the 600,000 people employed in the industry.</body>

      <body>Suspected members of a drug trafficking gang in Bolivia have thrown a bag containing more than $1m (£615,000) from a low-flying plane.The cash was supposed to be collected by other gang members on the ground in eastern Santa Cruz province, said Interior Minister Carlos Romero.But they missed the target and the bag was seized by Bolivian anti-drugs police, who later made several arrests.Bolivia is one of the world's top three cocaine producers.The authorities say the money - in US dollar bills of various denominations - was wrapped with a seal from a bank in neighbouring Paraguay.They believe it was going to be used either to build a cocaine production centre or to set up a fake commercial enterprise in Bolivia."Three Bolivian citizens have been detained in the operation," said Mr Romero.Guns and vehicles were also seized near the town of Rincon del Tigre.Bolivian police had been monitoring the gang, which is believed to be well organised and with links to several countries.Peru, Bolivia and Colombia are the world's biggest coca leaf and cocaine producers, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.Coca leaf production is legal in small amounts in Bolivia, where it is used to alleviate the effects of the high altitude. But the production of cocaine is banned.</body>

      <title>Payday lenders face tougher rules</title>
      <description>The UK's payday lenders have been warned that tougher regulation is on its way, to protect consumers.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24372134</url>
      <date>1380799198</date>
      <body>The UK's payday lenders have been warned that tougher regulation is on its way, to protect consumers.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed that all borrowers should have an "affordability" check before being given a loan.Among other new rules, the FCA wants to put risk warnings on adverts and marketing material.The payday industry gave the plans a guarded welcome, saying irresponsible lenders would struggle to comply.Martin Wheatley, the FCA's chief executive, said: "Today I'm putting payday lenders on notice: tougher regulation is coming and I expect them all to make changes so that consumers get a fair outcome. The clock is ticking."The proposals mean that anyone taking out a loan would need to prove that they could afford to repay it.In a separate government survey, one in five customers said they were not even asked about their finances when they applied for a payday loan.Among other proposals, the FCA suggested that:The FCA said it did not want to stop people using payday lenders, as they might turn to illegal loan sharks instead."We believe that payday lending has a place; many people make use of these loans and pay off their debt without a hitch, so we don't want to stop that happening," said Mr Wheatley.Business Minister Jo Swinson said the new rules would "call time on unscrupulous payday lenders". She said the industry had "failed to self-regulate effectively"."We warned the industry months ago that if it didn't get its house in order we would step in."The FCA said the risk warnings to be attached to adverts would be similar to those used by mortgage lenders, which remind borrowers that their home may be repossessed if they fall behind with payments.After the FCA takes over as the new regulator for consumer credit, in April 2014, it will also consider whether to put a cap, or limit, on the interest rates that lenders can charge.The government has decided against such a cap for the moment, but does not want to rule it out in the future.Previously the FCA has also said it will consider making rogue payday lenders reimburse customers where necessary.It has also said it might close firms down overnight if it needs to.The current regulator, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), wrote to 50 payday lenders earlier this year to see if they were suitable to continue in business.Nineteen lenders withdrew from the market as a result.A further six companies have stopped offering payday loans since, or have had their licences suspended by the OFT.But the FCA said that, despite the OFT campaign, the industry was still failing to respond.Despite 25 companies leaving the payday loans market, it is thought there are still more than 200 firms offering short-term loans within a matter of minutes.Many belong to the Consumer Finance Association (CFA).Under the CFA's code of conduct, roll-overs are permitted three times only.If borrowers default on their repayments for longer than 60 days, the amount they owe is frozen."As major lenders in the mainstream market, CFA members have always supported well-designed, well-implemented regulation in order to protect consumers and drive up standards," said Russell Hamblin-Boone, the CFA's chief executive.He added that the FCA's proposals were "an opportunity to set a bar over which irresponsible lenders will struggle to jump".The public consultation on the FCA's proposals will be open until 3 December.</body>

      <title>Benefit cap hits 8,400 households</title>

      <date>1380794361</date>
      <body>The government's cap on the total amount of benefits a non-working household can receive has affected 8,400 households between April and August, according to its own figures.The cap was introduced in April this year and means no household can receive more than £500 a week in benefits.The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) says 77% of those affected lost up to £100 a week.Just over half of these were households with between one and four children.The figures only cover those first affected by the cap and do not cover the whole country.The 10-week roll-out was only completed last week.The DWP said full figures for all those affected would not be ready for "probably another couple of months".It has previously said that 40,000 households will eventually be hit.The cap takes money from housing benefit, although the limit is based on adding up all welfare payments, including Jobseeker's Allowance and child benefit.For single adults, the cap is £350 a week.The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Iain Duncan Smith, said: "Benefits should be a safety net - but not something that gives claimants an income out of reach of many hard-working families."We have now successfully delivered a cap on benefits so that out-of-work households know they can no longer claim more than the average family earns and we have returned fairness to the benefits system."He said that those facing a cap were getting extra support at job centres, while those eligible for working tax credits were exempt from the cap altogether.On Wednesday, three families challenged the government in court in an attempt to find the benefits cap unlawful.Two High Court judges are being asked to rule that the payment limit breaches the human rights of unemployed parents.</body>

      <body>House prices are rising at their highest annual pace for more than three years, the Halifax says, as demand for properties continues to rise.Prices in the three months to September were 6.2% higher than a year earlier, the highest rate since June 2010.Prices rose by 0.3% in September compared with the month before, taking the average house price to £170,733.However, the average price of a home still remains 14% below the peak reached in August 2007.Last week, the Nationwide said that house prices rose at an annual pace of 5% in September.The Halifax said demand for property was rising thanks to low interest rates and improving consumer confidence.It added that government schemes - such as Funding for Lending and Help to Buy - also appeared to have increased demand for housing.The recovery in property prices over the past few months has led to concerns that the market could be in danger of overheating.However, others note that prices and activity still remain well below levels seen before the financial crisis, and that the rise in prices has been centred around London and the South East.The Halifax added there were signs that more properties were starting to come on to the market, which could begin to slow price increases."The recent strengthening in house prices is increasing the amount of equity that many homeowners have in their home, enabling more to put their property on the market for sale," said Martin Ellis, housing economist at the Halifax.The Halifax also noted that levels of housebuilding were starting to increase.On Wednesday, a survey of the UK's construction sector suggested that housebuilding activity grew last month at its fastest pace for almost a decade,</body>

      <body>Activity in the UK services sector grew at its fastest pace since 1997 in the third quarter of the year, a closely-watched survey has indicated.The Markit/CIPS PMI services index said the rise was due to growth in financial services, bolstered by the housing market, and the business sector.The survey raises hopes that the economy as a whole saw strong growth in the July-to-September period.The PMI survey showed services continued to grow strongly last month.The activity index for the sector recorded 60.3 in September, which was marginally down from August's near seven-year high of 60.5. Any score above 50 indicates growth.The strong reading for the UK services sector follows similarly strong surveys of the manufacturing and construction sectors published earlier this week.David Noble, chief executive officer at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, said: "After nearly six lost years of economic output, the UK economy looks to have really found its feet."He said the survey reflected the stability in the global economy, which the services sector was taking "full advantage of"."The industry sustained August's impressive business growth, dipping only fractionally from a near seven-year high, and new orders have now been growing for nine months consecutively," Mr Noble added.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said there were "encouraging signs" that growth would continue in the coming months."September saw one of the largest inflows of new business ever seen by the services survey," he said.</body>

      <title>Blankfein warns on US debt impasse</title>
      <description>After a meeting between US President Barack Obama and 15 heads of big firms, Goldman Sachs' boss Lloyd Blankfein warns that a failure to raise the nation's borrowing limit would be "extremely adverse".</description>

      <body>Goldman Sachs' boss Lloyd Blankfein has warned that a failure to raise the nation's borrowing limit would be "extremely adverse".The warning came after a meeting between US President Barack Obama and 15 heads of large companies on Wednesday.Business leaders want Washington to understand "the long-term consequences of a shutdown," said Mr Blankfein.The US government has been shut down since Tuesday, 1 October.Other well-known business leaders who attended the meeting included Michael Corbat of Citigroup, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, and Brian Moynihan of Bank of America.By some estimates, the government shutdown is costing the US economy $300m (£185m) per day. If it continues, it could shave as much as 0.9% off third-quarter GDP growth.Mr Blankfein and his banking counterparts have expressed concern that there is a possibility the impasse over the US budget could bleed into efforts to raise the so-called debt ceiling, which allows the US government to borrow money to pay back its debts.The current debt ceiling of $16.7 trillion has already been breached in 2013, and the US Treasury has been engaging in a series of "extraordinary measures" since the summer to continue paying the nation's bills.US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has warned that those measures will be exhausted by 17 October, and then the nation would be forced to default on its debts.Mr Obama is scheduled to meet Congressional leaders later on Wednesday.</body>

      <body>UK housebuilding activity grew last month at its fastest pace for almost a decade, a survey has suggested.The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' housing index for September was 64.8, just below 64.9 in November 2003.The index for construction overall was 58.9 last month, a slight dip from 59.1 reached in August, but still well above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction.Markit also found more optimism about the sector's future growth.The 64.8 mark for residential housebuilding in September was also a big rise on the 61.1 seen the month before."Construction is no longer the weakest link in the UK economy," said Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit. "The third quarter of 2013 ended with output growth riding high amid greater spending on infrastructure projects and resurgent house building activity."Among managers surveyed, 51% expected output would rise over the next 12 months, with 9% predicting a fall, the highest level of confidence since August 2010.Managers reported that job creation also rose for the fourth straight month."Having been in the doldrums for so long, builders are using this renewal as a platform to invest, with employment seeing the most dramatic upturn in close to six years," said David Noble, chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply.PMI data published on Tuesday indicated that UK manufacturing activity grew at a slower rate than expected in September, but also showed employment picking up.</body>

      <title>Pioneer woman in Sri Lankan business</title>
      <description>Nimali Gunawardana is a 25-year-old Sri Lankan proving that young women can succeed in the country's male-dominated business world.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24206038</url>
      <date>1380496667</date>
      <body>Nimali Gunawardana, a petite, soft-spoken 25-year-old, is a lot tougher than she looks.From an impoverished upbringing as one of seven children in a poor family in rural Sri Lanka, she has turned herself through sheer drive and determination into one of the country's most up-and-coming young businesswomen.Able to recover from one serious business setback along the way, the self-made boss and her company - Nimali Chips and Fibre Mill - are now continuing to prosper in Sri Lanka's male-dominated business community.And Ms Gunawardana now has her sights set on exporting."I am happy that I have broken down the barriers a woman has to face in Sri Lankan society," she says."I've always had ambition, and I want to get to the top."Ms Gunawardana's company turns discarded coconut husks into three useful materials - coir, coir pith and husk chips.Coir is the fibrous outer cover of the coconut. It can be made into everything from string and rope to fishing nets, brushes and mattresses.Coir pith, one layer down, has a cork-like texture, and is used as a compost. Husk chips, made by crushing up the hard part of coconut shells, are also used as a growing material for plants, and even to filter water.Ms Gunawardana set up the company just over a year ago, and it now processes 15,000 coconuts a day.The business, based in the southern rural district of Ambalantota, employs 13 people - 11 women and two men.For Ms Gunawardana it is a far cry from her first job working as a sewing machine operator in a clothing factory.She says: "My parents are poor, and when I was at school I always wanted more money for the family."So I had to earn money, and I got a job at a garment factory. I didn't like it, I didn't like the supervisors always blaming you, I didn't like working for someone else, but I was able to save up money."I knew I wanted to save up the money to establish my own business."And so, using cash she had saved and money invested by some of her friends, she bought the lease for a coir-producing factory in 2010.Unfortunately she soon realised she did not have the experience to run a company. More pressingly, she was unaware that the business had a number of outstanding loans.As a result, she had to close down the company, losing 300,000 Sri Lankan rupees ($2,300; £1,400).Many people would have given up the dream of owning their own business, but Ms Gunawardana was determined to bounce back.After the company failure, no bank would lend to her, so she went to Youth Business Sri Lanka, a business support organisation that is part of Youth Business International, the global charity run by the Prince of Wales.Youth Business gave her a week's training in running a company, her own mentor, and a modest loan of 100,000 Sri Lankan rupees.And so her new company, Nimali Chips and Fibre Mill, was born in August last year, and is proving a success.Ms Gunawardana says she is on target for turnover this year of 5.1m Sri Lankan rupees ($39,000), and she is able to pay back the money lent by her friends.She says: "When I first started out in business, my parents did not agree with my choice, mainly because I am a girl. In rural parts of Sri Lanka, women like me are very rare."But now my parents are proud, and they give me their support, as does my husband."Ms Gunawardana has now been married for nine months, and her husband quit his job to work for her.Such has been the success of her new company that Youth Business International recently awarded her the global title of Start-up Entrepreneur of the Year 2013.Ms Gunawardana travelled to London this month to receive the award from the Prince of Wales.She now has her eyes on expanding the business.Ms Gunawardana currently sells her products to other companies who then export them. She wants to start doing the exporting herself. She also plans to start making products from what she produces, with her company starting to turn its coir into rope."I have faced a lot of challenges, but I have also had help from Youth Business. I hope that more young women in Sri Lanka think of starting their own companies."</body>

      <title>Putting the best foot forward</title>
      <description>The BBC's Jennifer Pak speaks to Lew Fong Voon about his passion for shoe design and how he came to create his own brand in Malaysia.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24330094</url>
      <date>1380668759</date>
      <body>What makes an entrepreneur? The BBC's Jennifer Pak spoke to Lew Fong Voon (now known as Lewre Lew) about discovering his passion for shoe design while working in a manufacturers and how, despite initial obstacles, he came to create his own brand.In 1991, Lew Fong Voon thought he had a big break when his shoe trading company was chosen as one of nine businesses to represent Malaysia at an international exhibition.He gathered all of the best designs sourced from Malaysian factories because he said that the GDS fair in Germany was "like the Olympics" of the shoe industry.But nobody looked at his collection.People had no idea where Malaysia was or how to even pronounce the name of the country, said Mr Lew."It was very discouraging and at the same time humiliating," he said.Mr Lew did not get any business that year or the next two years after that but he continued to show up at the annual international shoe fair even when the other Malaysian companies had given up.He believed Malaysia had very good shoe craftsmen but didn't have updated designs. Bringing back ideas from the fair, he aimed to change this.In the fourth year, two customers finally ordered a thousand pairs of shoes from Mr Lew. The small shipment helped launch his overseas business.Over the next decade he produced shoes for international labels, but there was a slow push in the country to not only rely on natural resources and cheap manufacturing.Mr Lew was inspired to work on his own brand after he met fellow Malaysian designer Jimmy Choo.He produced his mid-priced collection under the name Lewre, a loose combination of his surname and the name of his first company, Roondy, in 1997 at the start of the Asian financial crisis.The venture was risky but it also meant that production costs became cheaper, he says.Mr Lew's company weathered the financial crisis. He attributes this to the fact that his childhood prepared him for the tough battle. He was one of ten children in his family. Food was a struggle. At eight years old, he started working at a plantation in northern Perak state, tapping rubber trees before dawn to help make ends meet for his family.Mr Lew 's commute to work required him to walk across terrain filled with snakes and the sounds of tigers growling nearby."It was full of challenges [and] I think full of fun," he said.Today, Mr Lew has exchanged the jungle for a spacious office on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur and has expanded his brand to more than 20 countries.He turned an initial capital investment of RM50,000 ($15,000; £10,000) in shoe manufacturing in the late 1980s into a company whose revenue is expected to reach $25m (£15.5m) in three years' time.At the Lewre headquarters in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia, middle-aged women sit in the back of the workshop sewing each bead onto a satin heel.Mint-green shoe moulds belonging to affluent women, including actress Michelle Yeoh and the Duchess of Cambridge, hang in the backroom.The recent global downturn has not slowed down Mr Lew's expansion plans. He is set to open a couture shop in London and the company has invested millions to develop several new sub-brands.Mr Lew describes his designs as "fashion forward". He wants to prove that Asian brands can produce quality products that appeal to a global audience.His future projects could make even more customers take notice - Mr Lew has considered designing high-heel shoes for men.It was normal for women to wear 4-5in (10-13cm) heels now, so as our women got taller so the men needed to "catch up," said Mr Lew.</body>

      <title>How companies can survive in a crisis zone</title>
      <description>What can businesses do to protect themselves against unexpected events such as the recent coup in Egypt?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23944571</url>
      <date>1380236748</date>
      <body>Running a business can be unpredictable at the best of times. But sometimes freak events occur that could not possibly be forecast.The political uncertainty and violence on the streets of Cairo that followed Islamist President Mohammed Morsi's removal from office in Egypt, for instance, forced businesses in the area to react rapidly.US car giant General Motors, which employs more than 14,000 Egyptians, temporarily closed its Cairo office and stopped production in its plant there, while home appliance maker Electrolux temporarily pulled out its expatriate staff and halted production in the region for about a week.For large, global firms such as these the impact is temporary and usually minimal - slower or no production in Egypt made up for by higher production elsewhere in their global network.But for smaller firms, the disruption can be harder to manage.Christine Sfeir, chief executive of restaurant group Treats Holding, operates a restaurant chain called Semsom in Lebanon. The country was devastated by a 15-year civil war, which ended in 1990, while the effects of its 2006 war with Israel and the problems in neighbouring Syria mean it remains politically unstable.Ms Sfeir says the turmoil has affected the way she runs her business.When she recently opened a new branch of the restaurant in Lebanon's capital, Beirut, she planned a red-carpet launch with local celebrities, high-flying business people and media all in attendance.But two days before the grand opening, trouble broke out an hour away from Beirut. Soldiers driving tanks continuously past the restaurant meant they had to shift the opening to a low-key, small scale dinner instead."I didn't feel it was right to do a big event while we have funerals going on," says Ms Sfeir, who was worried continuing with the original plan would have appeared insensitive and damaged the Semsom brand.On a day-to-day basis these types of troubles hurt revenue, typically meaning no customers for three days. "We know when there is tension, the restaurant is going to be empty," Ms Sfeir says.Emile Khoury, chairman of the Virgin Megastore franchise in Lebanon, says this ongoing instability is particularly difficult for retail businesses such as his that rely on shoppers passing by and tourists visiting.One of his 10 Lebanon stores is in Martyrs' Square in the centre of Beirut. After the war with Israel, protesters set up camp in the square for six months, meaning any shoppers had to pass through this to enter the store. Unsurprisingly barely anyone did.Mr Khoury estimates he has had to close down the shop for at least 100 days over the past eight years."It's very difficult. We're constantly in crisis mode. Our revenues go down tremendously so we have to adapt. We delay payments to suppliers, reduce operating expenses and negotiate rents down with our landlords."Right now we don't see an end to the open war in Syria. We've reduced to a skeleton staff, reduced working hours and reduced inventory."Is there anything small firms can do to protect themselves against this kind of disruption?Patrick Lord, managing director for global risk consultancy Control Risks in the Middle East, says planning is key."There are three key points - understand the context of your business on a national, regional and local level, do scenario planning and work out the likelihood of them happening and remain updated as things can change extremely quickly."Unless you have that planning formula right from the start, then you are leaving yourself open to last-minute panic," he says.For Ms Sfeir, the impact of such continual short-term disruption has made her look beyond the borders of her own country to secure stable revenues. Semsom now has restaurants in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Next she has set her sights on North America."I don't think Lebanon will be stable in my lifetime. To be able to sustain from a business perspective, you need some stability, you need to be able to make long-term plans. [At present] we only make plans for next month, cannot make plans for next year or for five years."Opening in other countries in the region and hopefully outside the region as well gives us this stability and this gives us a way to keep growing and to know that in 10 years we can still be here," she says.Similarly, Mr Khoury has stores in Saudi Arabia that provide stable revenues and where he admits business is much easier because "most of the parameters are within our control".But when asked why he doesn't shut down the Lebanon stores and instead focus his business elsewhere, he is aghast."We are Lebanese and we want to support our country. We have to believe better days will come. But we cannot predict when and if they will."Escape from the Boardroom is a five-part series, starting on 21 September, broadcast on BBC World News on Saturdays at 02:10 and 15:10, and Sundays at 09:10 and 21:10 (all times GMT).</body>

      <title>Fifa sets up 2022 World Cup taskforce</title>
      <description>Fifa agrees to set up a taskforce to look into alternative dates for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</description>

      <body>Fifa has agreed to set up a taskforce to look into alternative dates for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.But a final decision on when the tournament could be played will not take place before the 2014 World Cup.Fears that Qatar's hot summer temperatures could pose a heath risk to players and fans forced football's world governing body to act.The taskforce will consult with medical experts, broadcasters, sponsors and influential European leagues."We need to carry out very deep consultations and investigations and show some diplomacy and wisdom," said Fifa president Sepp Blatter.At the climax of a two-day meeting in Zurich, Blatter also confirmed Asian Football Confederation president Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim al-Khalifa would head the taskforce.The BBC understands that Fifa is considering inviting English Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore to be a member of the working group.He has been an outspoken opponent of plans to stage a World Cup in the northern hemisphere winter, claiming it would lead to disruption in many domestic leagues.The name of FA general secretary Alex Horne has also been mooted but sources say the final composition will be subject to agreement by Fifa's executive committee.The Premier League said in a statement: "We welcome the news that Fifa intends to conduct a thorough consultation process involving all of the appropriate stakeholders, including confederations, associations, leagues and clubs."Qatar was awarded the World Cup in December 2010, beating Australia, Japan, South Korea and the United States in a vote.The Gulf state planned to combat the fierce heat, with temperatures rising to in excess of 40C, by building air-conditioned stadiums.But concerns remained, prompting Blatter to announce in July this year that the World Cup should be switched to a cooler time of the year, away from Qatar's summer months of June and July.There have also been calls to strip the desert nation of the right to stage the World Cup completely and run the vote again.But Blatter insisted: "The Fifa World Cup 2022 will be played in Qatar. There you have it."Qatar has also come under scrutiny after a British newspaper published a report that accused the country of abusing the rights of migrant workers.Blatter said Fifa could not get involved in labour issues in any country but added that his organisation "cannot ignore" the allegations."I express all my sympathy and regret for anything that happens in any country where there are deaths on construction sites, especially when they are related to a World Cup," he told a news conference.Hassan Al Thawadi, head of Qatar's organising committee, has already said the Gulf state was addressing concerns."It's not a World Cup being built on the blood of innocents," he said. "That is unacceptable to anybody. We will be eradicating these issues."Prior to Friday's announcement, Harold Mayne-Nicholls, the head of the Fifa inspection team that assessed Qatar's 2022 World Cup bid, thought the tournament should be moved to January and February, when temperatures in the Gulf state average about 22C.However, that could lead to a potential clash with other big sporting events, notably the Winter Olympics and American football's Super Bowl, as well as domestic football leagues and the Champions League.New International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach has said he is confident there will be no clash with the Winter Olympics.American TV network Fox, World Cup rights-holder for North America, is understood to be concerned over the commercial implications of any move that would see the World Cup clash with the NFL season.</body>

      <body>Work on a Brazilian football stadium which is being refurbished for the 2014 World Cup has been suspended after a judge ruled there were safety concerns.The Arena da Baixada stadium in the city of Curitiba is due to stage four matches during the World Cup. Refurbishment work on the stadium is already lagging behind schedule.Judge Lorena Colnago said workers were at serious risk of accidents.She ordered a new inspection be carried out before work could resume."Countless infractions have been committed, in various stages of the building process," the judge from Brazil's labour tribunal said.She said workers were in danger of "being buried, run over and of collision, falling from heights and being hit by construction material, among other serious risks".The news comes a week after an investigation revealed that construction workers employed on another World Cup-related project faced what were termed "slave-like" conditions.Investigators said that more than 100 workers employed to expand Sao Paulo's international airport were living in unsuitable accommodation near the building site.In August, Sports Minister Aldo Rebelo said he was worried about delays at five stadiums still being built for next year's football World Cup.Arena de Baixada, which is owned by football club Atletico Paranaense, was among the five.Plans for its refurbishment have already been scaled back. After a visit from Fifa Secretary-General Jerome Valcke, the club said it would now not fit a retractable roof in order to speed the work up.Mr Valcke said all the stadiums would have to be ready in December and warned he would not tolerate any more delays as there was "no plan B".The World Cup will be played in 12 stadiums across the country.The opening match is due to take place at a brand-new venue being built in the outskirts of Sao Paulo on 12 June 2014.The final is scheduled for 13 July in the country's most famous football stadium, the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro.</body>

      <body>The Scottish Professional Football League has signed a new sponsorship deal with Irn Bru believed to be worth a "substantial six-figure sum".The figure for Scottish-based beverage company AG Barr for their beverage to become the league's official soft drink was confirmed by a SPFL source.But the league is continuing its search for a main sponsor.Irn Bru was the sponsor of the Scottish Football League for six seasons before this summer's league merger.SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster said: "It is a very positive sign to the market that such a strong brand has invested in the new SPFL set-up."AG Barr head of marketing Adrian Troy also welcomed the three-year agreement."We're proud that our deal with the SPFL lets us extend our support to the clubs across all four divisions," he said.Doncaster revealed the search for a title sponsor of the Scottish Professional Football League and League Cup continues but refused to put a time scale on any announcement."We remain in discussions with a number of different bodies around League title sponsorship and also League Cup sponsorship," said Doncaster. "Those conversations will continue."It is important that we take the time to partner with the right organisation. It is important not to put time scales on this. It is important to work with the various brands that we are talking to and in time, be able to announce the right brand and the right fit for the SPFL."We have all sorts of licensing deals and we have a very good broadcast deal."I think today's deal demonstrates the confidence that exists within the SPFL and within Scottish football in general."</body>

      <title>Recovering from the Westgate attack</title>
      <description>Nairobi's firms 'resilient' in wake of Westgate attack</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24403698</url>
      <date>1381022446</date>
      <body>The Westgate shopping centre today stands defiantly in the middle of the rich leafy suburb of Westlands.The world's focus was fixed on it for days after gunmen struck at midday on a Saturday, shooting at people - young and old - killing more than 60.Driving down Peponi Road just beside the centre, all seems well from the outside except for some broken glass windows and bullet holes on the wall.But inside, the scenes of chaos, death and looting are all too evident.Shop owners are among the very few people who have been allowed into the shopping centre since the attack.Martin Omondi owns a camera shop on the ground floor."Almost 100% of our cameras - all gone - worth more than a million shillings (US$11,000; £6,863)," he says after collecting what remained in his shop.He cannot say who stole his merchandise, and is waiting for a government investigation.But Serah Wambui, the owner of a salon located on the first floor, blames it all on the security forces."Our small cabinet that we used to display ornaments was looted," she says."They also opened our lockers to see whether we had money. They stole our cash box but our products are still there."Kenya's defence ministry has asked people with evidence of looting to give them that information.Business owners like Omondi and Serah are now pondering their next move.'Mall culture'Other shopping centres in Nairobi have also felt the impact of the attack on Westgate.Hamed Ehsani manages the upmarket Village Market, which is next to the US embassy and the UN headquarters."The first couple of days we were down to 20% of the number of customers," he says."But in the last few days we're up to 60%, and we expect that to increase."Ally Khan Satchu, a business analyst and Nairobi resident, says that people have been going to smaller shops, and shopping centres have been quieter."The whole mall culture is what has excited middle-class shoppers because it has consolidated middle-class demand and allowed retailers to come in, in a big way and service this demand," he says."The question is, is this going to change shopping habits of middle class Kenyans? I don't think it's going to be that long-lasting."Other indicators also point to a resilience within Kenya's economy.The stock market dropped on the two days after the attack, but it has subsequently rallied more than 2% and is not far off its 2013 high."What supported the stock market was international investors," says Mr Satchu."These guys thought this was an opportunity to get supply, so they used that as a liquidity opportunity to buy up a lot of stock."But he says that Kenya's tourism sector, which accounts for 10% of the country's annual economy, is a soft target.Yet so far, says Mike Macharia, the chairman of the Association of Hotel Keepers and Caterers - there have not been significant cancellations in hotel bookings."We were pleasantly surprised to find the level of cancellations was very low - we had two conferences the Monday after the attack and of those two we had only 4% cancellations," he says.At the Karen Blixen museum in Nairobi, tourists who spoke to the BBC were continuing with their holiday plans.Frenchman Andre Mairie says he will not be changing his travel arrangements following the attack."We are used to this kind of things. We had the one at Saint Michel station, we had the one at rue de Rennes, and so what?" he states, referring to previous explosions in his home country, France."People were telling me: 'Why are you going to Kenya? It must be dangerous.'"I said: 'Look, I'm still taking my subway at Saint Michel, I'm still walking at rue de Rennes.'"Kay Headfield and her husband were already en route to Nairobi from New Zealand when the attack at Westgate took place."It's been arranged through Child Fund and the staff there have been very good in advising us and keeping us informed so we carried on," says Mrs Headfield.Mike Macharia attributes the positive reaction from tourists to the messages of support from countries like the United Kingdom - which accounts for some 16% of all visitors to Kenya."The messages that came out of the key source markets were very positive, particularly from the UK."The International Monetary Fund said in the aftermath of the attack that Kenya could withstand a "one-off" attack by Islamist militants.With the second half of the year normally the peak season for tourism, analysts are predicting that the economy is on track for growth of between 4.5% to as much as 6% this year.But analysts warn that if there were to be another Westgate-style attack, then those growth prospects could change.Africa Business Report is broadcast on BBC World News on Fridays at 18:40, Saturdays at 10:10 and 20:10, and Sundays at 00:10 (all times GMT).</body>

      <title>How does Twitter make money?</title>
      <description>How does Twitter make money?</description>

      <date>1380892903</date>
      <body>On Thursday, Twitter announced that it wanted to raise $1bn (£619m) by listing on the US stock markets, making it the biggest initial public offering (IPO) from a technology company since Facebook went public in May 2012.The giant micro-blogging site, founded just seven years ago, has been valued at about $10bn.So, how does Twitter make its money and how can we explain its high valuation?Twitter may have more than 218 million monthly users, but the company does not make money - yet.In papers filed with US regulators, it was revealed for the first time that Twitter made a loss of $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m.But analysts say the company is showing strong signs of growth, with revenue rising from just $28m in 2010 to $317m by the end of 2012.One research firm, eMarketer, estimates that Twitter's revenues from advertising sales will increase by more than 100% by the end of this year.Almost all of Twitter's revenue - about 85% of it - comes from advertising on its site.There are three main ways for a company or an individual to advertise on Twitter: by promoting a tweet that will appear in people's timelines, promoting a whole account, or promoting a trend.Twitter tends to charge its advertisers according to the amount of interaction their content generates.A budget is usually set at the start of the campaign and then the advertiser pays per click or per retweet.It also has a "bidding" system in which advertisers compete with each other to have their content appear in a particular space."One of the advantages of Twitter for marketers over traditional display advertising is they have worked really hard to make sure that advertising on Twitter is not interruptive," says Lara O'Reilly, senior reporter at Marketing Week.Anything that disrupts the user experience might reduce engagement from users, which in turn can put off advertisers, Ms O'Reilly says."It's not a flashy banner that gets in the way of something. It looks very native," she explains.Also, the company takes in a significant portion of its advertising revenue from mobile devices - in contrast with Facebook, which had not fully developed its mobile strategy at the time of its listing.As of 2013, more than 65% of Twitter's advertising revenue was generated from mobile devices.More than 75% of Twitter users accessed the site from their mobile phone during that same time period."Because Twitter was born as a mobile platform they already have this part sorted," Ms O'Reilly adds. "In investors' eyes, they have a mobile strategy."Data licensing is Twitter's second major revenue stream.The micro-blogger sells something known as the "firehose", its public data, which often adds up to about 500 million tweets each day.Companies can dive deep into the data to analyse consumer trends and sell their insight on to other brands and companies.Because the tweets are public, consumers also have access to this data.But Nick Halstead, founder of DataSift, one of the only two companies with access to the firehose, says that with sophisticated analysis companies can learn detailed and specific information about their users that, because of the volume of data, an ordinary user or company would not be able to get.Firms could use the data to do simple things, he says, like monitoring sentiment towards their brand or product.But the data can also be used in a much more complex way."One of my favourites is around stock levels," Mr Halstead says."For example, in the US football teams will analyse the popularity of players by region to work out how much they should buy of a particular football top to stock them in shops."He adds: "In the UK we all rush out and buy barbecue equipment on particular weekends, and supermarkets want to stock up when that happens, but they need three or four days to do that."You can use Twitter for modelling when people are planning to hold those kind of events."While Twitter may have proved it has the potential to make money, analysts say there are still hurdles to profitability.The company is spending a lot of money investing in advertising technology and expanding its team, says Clark Fredericksen, vice president at eMarketer.And it plans to keep spending after going public."We can expect that they will continue to make those investments because they're looking long-term," he says.But Mr Fredericksen adds Twitter needs to show it can monetise its international users and work with small businesses."When Twitter goes to advertisers a big part of their pitch is using Twitter to work with other media," he says, adding that the site gets huge traction with users around events like the Oscars or episodes of popular television shows such as Breaking Bad."Whether that formula will translate in smaller TV markets needs to be seen."</body>

      <body>If you are already missing the sunshine then here is something to consider.The pound is having a revival on the currency markets, thanks to the strengthening British economy.It is a welcome change for British tourists who saw the pound slump after the 2008 financial crisis.But the economy has perked up and sterling has seen a spectacular rise against some currencies this year.And there are other trends in the currency market which are making a difference.Now obviously changes in the value of the pound are not the top priority when it comes to choosing a holiday destination, not least because some cheap countries are not particularly safe.And it is impossible to predict exactly what's going to happen on the markets.(You can check travel advice from the Foreign Office here.)But after years of suffering the effects of a weak pound, travellers may be tempted by countries that are once again looking like good value.Currency experts in the City of London have given their views on where that value can be found over the next 12 months.South Africa is one of a group of nations which, in economic circles, are called the Brics.Along with Brazil, Russia, India and China, it was favoured by investors for its fast-growing economy.But it has run into trouble recently.Prices for its main exports such as gold, platinum and diamonds have fallen and the mining industry has also been hit by labour trouble.As a result the South African rand has plunged 25% this year."There are question marks over the economy," says Jeremy Stretch, market strategist at CIBC."Even if sterling does badly I expect the rand to underperform."Another nation that has fallen out of favour with international investors is India.Economic growth has been weak and the government has struggled to push through reform that economists say would lift growth.This year the rupee has fallen 12% against the pound.Analysts say the situation is unlikely to change in the near future."India will always be vulnerable," says Jane Foley, senior forex strategist at Rabobank in London."India has disappointing growth and a lack of reform and other emerging markets will be seen as better bets."The Australian economy has become tied to the fortunes of China.Much of its iron ore and other commodities are exported there.But prices and volumes have fallen and so has the Australian dollar.It is down more than 10% against the pound this year, currently trading at around 1.73 Australian dollars to the pound."The Oz dollar has been overvalued since mid-2010," says Jeremy Stretch."It (the pound) will probably get to 1.85, maybe 1.90, but not as high as 2. That overvaluation is dissipating."Turkey's economy has been a success story in recent years.But protests against the government in June have unsettled investors. Confidence in Turkey is also vulnerable to unrest in Syria and to a lesser extent Egypt.The Turkish lira is down 12% against the pound so far this year. But since the worst of the financial crisis in 2008, the lira has fallen 50% against the pound."It's been a very, very big move," says Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon in London."But it's very hard to know with emerging markets because they are illiquid. If political tensions ease there would be a rapid move back."If I was going to to Turkey I would buy my lira now."Anyone considering a visit to Turkey should check on the latest advice from the Foreign Office.</body>

      <title>Hydrogen: The car fuel of the future?</title>
      <description>Could hydrogen power the cars of tomorrow?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24381812</url>
      <date>1380843391</date>
      <body>A small British firm is looking forward to a day in which we will take our cars to the garage and fill them with hydrogen.Acal Energy, based in Runcorn in Cheshire, says it has developed a chemistry that could make hydrogen fuel cells much cheaper and longer-lasting than current technologies.It wants to license its chemistry to the world's car-makers, opening the way for hydrogen vehicles to sell in large volumes in 10 or 20 years' time."We believe this is one of the breakthrough technologies," says Brendan Bilton, the company's chief commercial officer."We're pretty confident and excited... that this will start unlocking the barriers," he continues, "Allowing fuel cells to be in products for mass market applications."It is a bold dream but not a crazy one.The automotive industry is already far advanced with plans for a first generation of hydrogen cars.Hyundai, the South Korean manufacturer, has said it will soon start selling a hydrogen-powered version of its ix35 model.Meanwhile, the Japanese giant Toyota is expected to unveil its first nearly-production-ready foray into the territory at next month's Tokyo motor show.Other big names - including Daimler and Volkswagen - are thought to be on track to get hydrogen vehicles into showrooms by 2017.But few expect these first-generation hydrogen cars to sell in very large numbers.Acal Energy is pitching its technology as the enabler for a second generation of less costly, more durable vehicles which could - if all goes to plan - pose a serious challenge to the long domination of the internal combustion engine from about 2020 onwards.To begin with, consumers may take a bit of persuading.Hydrogen is widely seen as a dangerous fuel - an image underpinned by that grainy newsreel footage of the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg airship bursting into flames in the 1930s.But actually, experts do not seem daunted by this particular technical challenge.They point out that hydrogen is already used and managed on a routine basis in industrial processes.The main reason anyone bothers with it as a fuel for the future is because it is emission-free at the point of use.The hydrogen is combined with oxygen in a bit of kit called a fuel cell. This process generates electricity to power the engine in the vehicle.The waste products are heat and harmless water.Water is benign, unlike the global warming-inducing, carbon dioxide emissions that spew from even the most efficient petrol and diesel vehicles.The car industry has been developing fuel cells that use costly platinum as the catalyst for generating power from hydrogen for many years.Acal Energy claims the problem with this current technology is that it results in fuel cells that are either prohibitively expensive because of the high platinum content, or prone to degrade quickly.To get round these issues, the company has developed what Mr Bilton describes as a "liquid catalyst" composed of "a dissolved solution of metal salts".As well as being a lot cheaper than a platinum catalyst, the liquid doubles up as a coolant and a cleaning agent that extends the life of the fuel cell by taking away damaging by-products as it circulates through a "regenerator"."We have a solution that both increases durability and reduces cost," says Mr Bilton.The company has its offices in a science park that until a few years ago was the research and development centre for the British chemicals giant ICI, now shrunken in size and foreign-owned.Intriguingly, the ideas behind Acal Energy's patented "FlowCath" technology derive from techniques developed to clean clothes more efficiently.The founder of the company, Dr Andrew Creeth, now its chief technology officer, spent much of his career working as a scientist for the washing powder giant Unilever.Development of the product is taking place in an environment not unlike a gigantic school chemistry lab - full of bubbling chemicals, complicated equipment and clever looking people in white coats.The company has already raised £15m ($24m) to finance its work from a mixture of private investors and government sources.It is currently hoping to raise another £15m or so from a new funding round, with the outcome due to be announced soon.Eventually, Acal Energy aims to earn profits from the business model pioneered by the successful British micro-chip designer Arm Holdings.Arm's technology is embedded in most of the chips used in the world's smartphones and tablet computers.It receives a small royalty payment every time anyone upgrades their mobile device.Acal Energy dreams of equal success from licensing its technology to car manufacturers in decades to come.The big questions, though, are does the technology work and will it be the breakthrough that the company claims?Prof Nigel Brandon of Imperial College in London, a leading academic in hydrogen energy, is well qualified to comment."The core technology looks very exciting," he says."There are some components in their system they need to improve. I don't see any reason why they can't do that but they've still got to do it," Prof Brandon adds.It is guarded optimism that could equally be applied to the whole field of hydrogen fuel cell energy.The big advantages over battery-powered electric vehicles are hydrogen cars can be refuelled in a just a few minutes, they can run for 300 or 400 miles between refuelling and they have the environmental benefits of battery driven cars with the same range and convenience as those with petrol or diesel engines.But there are also significant snags.Among them is the need to create a hugely expensive new infrastructure of hydrogen filling stations to replace garages.Hydrogen enthusiasts often quote the example of the internet.Once the demand was proven, a global network of optical fibre cables to carry data traffic was rapidly built despite the cost.Major players in the car industry are betting - but not yet on a truly large scale - that hydrogen energy will follow the same pattern.</body>

      <title>Why image is crucial for charities</title>
      <description>Why image is crucial for a charity to secure donations</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23948572</url>
      <date>1380841678</date>
      <body>When Mark Goldring joined Oxfam as chief executive in April this year, the charity's income had fallen. It fell by nearly £18m last year, with revenue from its two main sources, shops and fundraising, both down on the previous year.To better understand the business from both a staff and customer point of view, he decided to spend some time working as a shop volunteer and in the field in Africa.After volunteering on the shop floor in Oxfam's Bury branch in Greater Manchester, he found a lack of understanding from both volunteers and customers about what the charity actually did and how it spent its money.For instance, he calculated that one week's profit from the Bury shop would enable Oxfam to buy two cows in a village in Zambia to initially help two families to make a living, but subsequently would enable many other families to make a living as the calves were passed on.But no-one in the shop was aware of that."We need to show both the volunteer and the customer a bit more about the difference [their contributions] make day to day," he says.This kind of disconnect between what charities do and people's perception of what they do is common.In the 1950s, the charity St Dunstan's was a household name famed for its work with blind former military personnel. Yet in 2010 its research showed few people under the age of 75 were aware of the charity or what it did.It hired consultancy Spencer du Bois to help it rebrand. After a two-year process surveying the general public, staff, volunteers and supporters, it renamed itself Blind Veterans UK with a new logo based on the union flag. The rebranding process cost the charity £90,000 but it expects it to help raise an extra £7m over five years.And according to market research firm nfpSynergy, 22% of the British public said they would consider supporting the rebranded charity, compared with 16% before it was rebranded.While many people may believe that charities do not need to focus on branding as much as profitable organisations, Max du Bois, executive director at Spencer du Bois, disagrees."It's as important in the charity sector as it is in the commercial sector. It's a way of getting people engaged with what you do," he says.Joe Saxton, director of nfpSynergy, says: "When you give £50 to a charity, the only thing you have to judge whether your gift is well spent is the reputation and the image of the organisation."In the absence of the concrete and the tangible, the intangibles of image, personality and reputation have a much greater importance."However, Vicky Browning, director of CharityComms, an industry body that aims to improve how charities communicate, admits it can be hard for charities to justify spending on measures such as brand that do not show instant, tangible results.To help the cause, it recently produced a guide to branding best practice, which cites the case of Macmillan Cancer Support.Since its 2006 rebrand, it has seen both its brand recognition and market share increase rapidly. Awareness among its core audiences of people diagnosed with cancer and their families and friends rose from 41% and 38% respectively to 65% and 66% between 2006 and 2011. In the same period, fundraising income increased from £97m to £141m."We live in tough economic times. Supporters have tightened their belts and organisations are zeroing in on efficiency and value for money," says Ms Browning."More than ever, charities must demonstrate how their cause is unique, effective, relevant and worthy of support. A charity's brand is key to achieving this."Oxfam's Mr Goldring realises that how the charity communicates with the public is key."We can't just say, 'The world is poor, you're guilty'. So we've got to find new ways of telling those stories."We need to remind the public that they can actually convert their surplus clothes into cows for people in Zambia, into crops for people in Zimbabwe, into healthcare for people in Cambodia very easily. 'This is the difference you can be making, do it.'"The charity is now planning to launch a major campaign on 26 December to reinforce this message about what donations can achieve."It won't be, 'You'll be saving lives tomorrow,' but, 'You'll be strengthening lives forever,'" he says.Escape from the Boardroom is a five-part series, starting on 21 September, broadcast on BBC World News on Saturdays at 02:10 and 15:10, and Sundays at 09:10 and 21:10 (all times GMT).</body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: What is the debt ceiling?</title>
      <description>What is the US debt ceiling and why does it matter?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24365018</url>
      <date>1380796790</date>
      <body>The debt ceiling is a cap on the total amount the US government can borrow, set by US lawmakers.The current debt limit of $16.699 trillion was reached in May. Since then the US Treasury has been using what are called extraordinary measures to keep paying the bills.Why does the US government need to borrow so much?If you compare borrowing to the size of the US economy, it has been increasing since the 1980s.But the 2007 financial crisis created huge gaps between government income and expenditure.The economy was plunged into a deep recession and federal finances deteriorated dramatically as the government attempted to boost the economy and stabilise the financial sector.As a result the debt ceiling was raised twice in the second half of 2008 and twice in 2009.According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), US debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) is now 73%, twice as much as it was at the end of 2007.Why can't the president raise the limit?He doesn't have that power.The limits are set by lawmakers in Congress, which is made up of two houses, the Senate and the House of Representatives.They set in law how much the Treasury department can borrow.How often has the limit been raised?Since March 1962, Congress has enacted 77 separate measures that have altered the limit on federal debt.Until recently those changes have been achieved without a lot of fuss.Why has it become such a big issue?Since the Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives to the Republicans in 2010, budget fighting between the two parties has become commonplace.Republicans took their victory in the mid-term elections as a sign that Americans had rejected the president's Democratic agenda, and more specifically, that Americans were unhappy with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or "Obamacare" as Republicans label it.Although past budget fights have included larger questions about the size and scope of the US government, this one is very specifically about Mr Obama's healthcare law, substantial parts of which took effect on 1 October.Republicans have been doing everything in their power to force Mr Obama to delay implementation of a law they strongly believe was rejected by the American public.Democrats argue the law was validated by the Supreme Court in June 2012 and was a central issue in the 2012 presidential election, which Mr Obama won decisively.It seems a messy way to run the nation's finances.Part of the problem is that Congress approves spending separately from the debt ceiling.So politicians can agree to all sorts of expenditure without necessarily having the financing in place to pay for it.In good years that does not matter too much as government income is greater that expenditure.But historically those have been rare.Usually the Treasury has to cover the gap between income and expenditure, by borrowing on the international money markets.When does the money run out?The government has been juggling its debts to keep paying the bills, but those measures will run out between 22 October and the end of the month, according to the Congressional Budget Office.What happens then?The government could make drastic cuts in federal spending or try to raise taxes, or possibly even both.That would be difficult and, perhaps, not enough.During the previous row over the debt ceiling in 2011, then Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner warned that the US government's obligations are so great "immediate cuts in spending or tax increases cannot make the necessary cash available".So what does that mean?The big worry is that the US government may have to stop paying back its debts, which is known as a default.Traditionally the US has been able to borrow at low interest rates on the international markets, which has helped keep interest rates low for consumers.But a default could damage confidence and drive up the cost of borrowing for Americans.A default could also create a chaotic situation on the international market for debt.Investors would not want to accept bonds that were no longer being honoured.But the market is not set up to deal with rejected bonds, so there could be a period of confusion for traders.What would it mean for the rest of the world?A default would send a shock through the financial markets.US bonds, known as treasuries, have always been seen as a safe investment and trillions of dollars are invested in them.Analysts say it is hard to know what would happen and a lot would depend on how long the default lasts.Investors may be prepared to wait out a short disruption.But a lengthy default might see money switch into other perceived havens, such as German and Swiss debt.There might also be a rush into gold, which is traditionally seen as a safe investment.Are there any other options?The president could ignore the debt ceiling.He would be breaking the law and could be impeached.But if the alternative is to cut funding for doctors, schools and agencies such as the FBI, he might decide it is the least bad option.</body>

      <title>PM proposes under-25s' benefits cut</title>
      <description>'I'm worse off than before I got a job'</description>

      <body>David Cameron has suggested benefits paid to people under the age of 25 could be cut in an effort to reduce long-term worklessness.In his speech to the Conservative conference, the prime minister promised to "nag and push and guide" young people away from a life on the dole.It was later confirmed that the government is reviewing policies for 16 to 25-year-olds.The latest figures from the Department of Work and Pensions showed 1.09 million people between the ages of 16 and 24 were not in work, education or training.Mr Cameron argued that action was needed in the UK, saying: "There are still over a million young people not in education, employment, or training."Today it is still possible to leave school, sign on, find a flat, start claiming housing benefit and opt for a life on benefits. It's time for bold action here."BBC News website users have been sending their views on this story, here is a selection of their comments.I graduated from university in July 2012 and have been on Jobseeker's Allowance since then. I have been registered to the Work Programme as well. I have applied for at least three jobs a week and have only had one interview in that time, you rarely hear anything at all and it is very disheartening.I have dyspraxia that inhibits my ability to process information that isn't written down. I am not stupid, but I am trained in a particular field of expertise and constantly looking to break into the industry.I completed a course in teaching assistance since graduating and volunteer as an assistant in a local school and as an English teacher to military families. I have also learned British Sign Language.I am qualified and experienced in two different disciplines. Why should I have my sole source of income reduced? I give back to the community. I would have nothing against having job seekers do mandatory work for their benefits, but they need to be paid the national minimum wage.For the people that are searching for work, and are actually being let down by job centres and the Work Programme, a reduction of benefits is a punishment they do not deserve.I graduated from university with a 2:1 in architecture in 2012. I immediately started applying for jobs both in my chosen profession and posts such as shop assistants and receptionists, as well as unpaid internships. I applied to about 200 jobs. I went on a few interviews and assessment centres but no job. I was living with my parents in London and using savings, birthday and Christmas money to live.After six months of looking for work independently, my parents suggested I contact the job centre for support. They did not help me in any way, no improving my CV or training, just £50 a week. The staff just wanted me to apply for any old job and it had to be through their website, an inflexible system since you couldn't send through personalised cover letters or in my case attach a PDF portfolio. After a month, I found an unpaid internship at a graphic design studio myself.I found a job 11 months after graduating, although it is not in architecture. I still live at home because my salary can't support London rent. Three of my friends found their first jobs a whole year after graduating, and a large percentage are working in shops as they can't afford to intern to get a job in design. This is the reality.I have five children, the youngest of whom is 25. She graduated from university three years ago and looked very hard for a job in the media industry, but it is a very competitive area. She has applied for more than 100 jobs. While she was looking she got a job as an assistant manager at a restaurant and held that job for two years until the company went bust.Since then she has been looking for a job working with children. She would like to go back to college to study, but she is in a catch 22-style situation as she needs to be in a paid job working with children before she can be accepted on an NVQ Level 3 course, but she cannot get a job unless she has the relevant training.Because I do not like my children just sitting around I have encouraged her to volunteer at a local children's day care centre. Last week she was offered a part-time job there and she accepted. When she visited the job centre on Friday she told them and they stopped her Jobseeker's Allowance.The very little she does earn goes on her transport costs, so she is actually worse off than before she took the job. I am very fortunate I can support her, but what would happen to her if I couldn't?My son left school at 16 to go to college to train as a carpenter. He studied for three years and gained all his NVQs and yet despite applying to all the major employers in the area he has been unable to find work in his chosen profession.He was unemployed and receiving benefits for around a year and eventually got so disheartened he took a part-time job working nights stacking shelves at a supermarket.It is a job, but no life for a young man of 23. He would still love to get a job in carpentry, but it doesn't look likely.Interviews by Sian Richards</body>

      <title>The drink of kings makes a comeback</title>
      <description>Why mead is making a comeback in the US</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24184527</url>
      <date>1380755618</date>
      <body>Long relegated to the dusty corners of history, mead - the drink of kings and Vikings - is making a comeback in the US.But what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe."Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour.When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel."If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works," he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge."We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day," explains Mr Alexander.It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead."It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages," he gushes.After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business.His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US.It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China.Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead.Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade."We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years," she says."I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once."Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree.Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead "is becoming more and more available - similar to cider".Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry.But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments."I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is," says Mr Alexander."You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience."The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers who were just looking for something good to pair with food. But mead has since changed."People don't realise that just because it has honey in it, [mead] doesn't need to be sweet," says Ms Rowe, citing the proliferation of not only dry meads but also meads flavoured with fruits, herbs, and spicy peppers.Yet hampering efforts towards building mead awareness is also the name mead itself.Technically, mead is classified as wine by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which regulates alcohol sales and labelling in the US.This means that mead has to be labelled as "honey wine", which doesn't help combat people's perception of the drink as being as cloyingly sweet."How do people recognise it as mead if you can't say the word?" says Ms Rowe.Ironically, the alcoholic beverage that most credit with the resurgence of the mead business is beer.The craft brewing movement, which was recently singled out in a report by the Atlanta Federal Reserve as a source of job growth, inspired many home brewers to expand their repertoire."I was a home brewer, and at first I liked mead because I had never had it," says Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit, Michigan."Every home brewer has the same dream of, 'Hey what if I could sell this? Wouldn't that be great?'" he says.After he spent months making batch after batch of mead, perfecting his recipe, he realised that mead was "kind of an untouched category", and that no-one, at least back in 2008, was really doing it commercially.So when he and his wife, Kerri, were both laid off of their jobs in Detroit's car industry during the recession, they decided to take the plunge.Now, B Nektar is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, US meadery, shipping 1,100 cases a week across the country.But for Mr Dahlhofer and his fellow mead enthusiasts, that's just the beginning."If you look at craft beer 25 years ago, they had 1% of the total beer market, and now they have 8%," says Maine Mead's Mr Alexander."So we've got a long way to go, but I feel like it's got the opportunity because of the diversity of the beverage."You've got a canvas with very few limits."</body>

      <title>Economic impact of a US shutdown</title>
      <description>What will be the economic cost of a shutdown?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24341406</url>
      <date>1380646665</date>
      <body>The US government has shut down, laying off hundreds of thousands of workers, closing national parks, and delaying vital services like passport renewal.On Monday, US President Barack Obama said the "shutdown will have a very real economic impact on real people, right away".But what exactly will that economic impact be?Research firm IHS estimates that it's costing the US government about $300m a day, for each day of the shut down.Overall, the last time the US government shut down in 1995 for 21 days, it cost the federal government $1.5bn (£927m) - that's $2.1bn (£1.3bn) in today's dollars.Goldman Sachs estimates a three-week shutdown could shave as much as 0.9% from US GDP this quarter.However, markets have largely shrugged off the shut down, with all three indexes rising after markets re-opened on Tuesday.Overall, US stocks are up 18% for the year.For now, it seems, the business community is focused on other concerns, like when the Federal Reserve will begin to ease off its extraordinary efforts to prop up the US economy - something the central bank says will not happen any time soon, partially due to Washington dysfunction.Not an economic barometer"They're going to eventually get to a compromise and then we'll move on," O'Neil Securities trader Kenny Polcari told the BBC from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.A veteran trader, Mr Polcari was also at the NYSE during the last government shutdown, from 1995-1996.Back then, he remembers, markets sold off but then actually rebounded."A government shutdown is not necessarily a comment on the state of the US economy," says Mr Polcari."All indications are that they US economy is starting to turn a corner."In fact, for traders like him, he says now might actually be a good time to get into the market, before third quarter earnings next week."This is in hindsight will probably be viewed as a good buying opportunity, as long as you don't get real panicked," says Mr Polcari."I don't expect to get panicked."And, for many businesses, another debt squabble in Washington is just background noise during a time of good, if not great, economic growth."The difference between now and a couple years ago was that a couple years ago we were coming out the depths of a recession," says David Zarin, who owns a fabric store on Manhattan's Lower East Side.During the debt ceiling negotiations of 2011, he says he saw his business decline in the wake of so much uncertainty at a fragile time of the US economic recovery.Now, while business isn't as a robust as it was prior to the crisis, he's no longer as sensitive to what he calls "Washington posturing.""Frankly, I'm a little numb," he says.Brian Hamilton, boss of Sageworks, a market research company, says Mr Zarin's views are common throughout the private business community."There's sort of an assumption that what happens in Washington looms large on the minds of people who run private companies," says Mr Hamilton."Not to be flip about it, but I don't believe that the people who run private companies wake up every morning and worry very much about what's happening in Washington unless it affects their bottom lines."But for one place, the economic impact of the shutdown will be felt immediately.According to George Mason University professor George Fuller, the Washington DC area will lose an estimated $220m a day while federal workers and contractors are furloughed, perhaps not spending money at local restaurants and businesses.The federal government accounts for one-third of the region's economy."If it's a one day event, it's like a snow day, if its three days it's a blizzard - but if it's more than that, it's a big deal," says Prof Fuller.Furthermore, uncertainty is never good for hiring.One-half of bosses surveyed by the Business Roundtable "indicated that the ongoing disagreement in Washington over the 2014 budget and debt ceiling is having a negative impact on their plans for hiring additional employees over the next six months".And global markets, always keen to see how the world's largest economy is faring, will certainly have cause to pause.If the shutdown continues until Friday, the release of crucial US jobs figures could be delayed."All survey and other programme operations will cease and the public website will not be updated," said Erica Groshen, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said in a memo published on the department's website.However, some reports suggest that the jobs figures would be deemed "essential" and would end up being released on time.A prolonged closure could also have an impact on the biggest stock market news of the year: Twitter, the social networking company, has indicated that it would like to make its stock market debut soon, filing the proper paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission.The SEC says it has funds to stay open for a few weeks, but a prolonged shutdown could force the agency to delay reviewing public offering applications.But for now, at least, traders and economists have painted the shutdown as a wait-and-see moment - but something with a bit of popcorn value, like must-see TV."Investors have been riveted on still another gripping episode of fiscal policy dysfunction in a divided US government," wrote UBS's chief US economist Maury Harris in a note to clients.Mr Harris notes that indications that Washington dysfunction could spill over into wider economic impacts have been muted, with consumer confidence surveys still pointing towards a positive US public.And the main worry continues to be what happens, if, in a few weeks time, politicians cannot agree on raising the limit the US can borrow so that the country can pay its creditors."Any delay in raising the debt ceiling would have dire economic consequences," said Moody's chief US economist Mark Zandi in recent testimony in front of Congress."There will be a violent reaction in financial markets if policymakers fail to act in time," he warned.</body>

      <title>'No NHS pay freeze' in Scotland</title>
      <description>Scottish Health Secretary Alex Neil pledges not to impose a pay freeze on NHS workers in Scotland.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-24419314</url>
      <date>1381054422</date>
      <body>The Scottish government has pledged not to impose a pay freeze on NHS workers in Scotland.It came after the Department of Health (DoH) at Westminster urged UK-wide pay review bodies to cancel a planned 1% pay rise next year.It said the rise was unaffordable and the money should instead be used to help maintain safe staffing levels.But Scottish Health Minister Alex Neil said he had "no intention" of withholding the rise in Scotland.He said the Scottish government had made its own proposals to the pay review bodies, proposing that the 1% rise is implemented in 2014/15 as well as giving further help to those on low wages by ensuring no one employed by the health service earns less than the Scottish Living Wage.Mr Neil accused Westminster counterpart Jeremy Hunt of "bad faith" and said withholding the pay rise would be a "betrayal of the NHS".He added: "To steal the pay rise back from workers' hands will destabilise the NHS across the UK and damage morale."The Scottish government has no intention of following Jeremy Hunt and we will use our independence over the health service to block this move."But with UK wide agreement to Agenda for Change - which established pay policy in the health service - this damaging right wing approach could hit Scottish services, and under the current funding settlement could drive down Scotland's budget in the future."My message to Hunt is unequivocal - Scotland rejects your politics, your attack on staff, and your desire to destroy the real NHS."The health secretary said he would be meeting with unions "to ensure this ludicrous proposal finds no foundation in Scotland."On Saturday it emerged the DoH had made a written submission to the NHS Pay Review Body in which it said the proposed 1% rise was unaffordable alongside the current system, which sees many staff automatically receive incremental annual rises.The move has been criticised by Labour and the unions.The DoH has stressed no decisions on changes to pay have been taken, and said independent bodies will make their recommendations in February or March next year.However, in its submission, the DoH pointed to a staff survey suggesting high levels of motivation and morale, and said there should only be basic pay increases if there is "strong evidence" recruitment, retention, morale or motivation issues require this.The submission said: "Employers cannot pay staff more, improve quality and productivity and protect jobs."Careful and prudent management of the NHS pay bill is critical if we are to maintain the right number of frontline staff with the right skills. We believe more affordable employment contracts can help deliver better care and improve job security."The NHS Pay Review Body makes recommendations on the remuneration of all staff paid under Agenda for Change and employed in the NHS.Its recommendations apply to about 1.5 million staff in NHS Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with the exception of doctors, dentists and very senior managers.It reports separately to the health ministers in each country of the UK, who can accept, reject or modify its recommendation.</body>

      <body>Some of the world's top athletes joined thousands of people taking part in the Great Scottish Run.About 23,000 club, fun and charity runners took part in the half-marathon and 10k events in Glasgow.Ethiopian former Olympic and World champion Haile Gebrselassie won the half marathon event with a new course record of 61 minutes and nine seconds.A number of roads were closed for the races, which started at George Square and finished at Glasgow Green.Three Scots finished in the first four of the women's half marathon, with Leeds-based Susan Partridge beating Freya Ross to the line. Kenya's Pauline Wanjiku third and Steph Twell fourth.Following his victory, Gebrselassie said: "After losing out in the last mile at the Bupa Great North Run I had to get clear today and decided to make my move when I did and it worked so well, I'm happy with this win."Scottish Finance Minister John Swinney was among those due to run the half marathon course.World champion swimmer Keri-Anne Payne, Celtic manager Neil Lennon and Emmerdale stars Chris Chittell and Eden Taylor Draper were due to run in the 10k.Olympian Katherine Grainger started runners off from George Square while paralympian Richard Whitehead was at the finish line.Both courses took runners past city landmarks including the Riverside Museum, Finnieston Crane, Clyde Arc and the new Hydro venue.The half-marathon route also included a loop through Bellahouston Park.Late running engineering work delayed some runners travelling to the event by train, but Scotrail later said the service was back to normal.Network Rail said signalling works on the main Edinburgh to Glasgow line had been going on overnight and had been due to finish at 07:45 but had overrun to 09:30.A spokeswoman apologised for any inconvenience.Separately, a number of ScotRail services were affected by industrial action by some train drivers.The Aslef members voted to take action after rejecting a pay offer of 6.4%.ScotRail said routes likely to be affected were Glasgow Central to East Kilbride, Larkhall, Gourock, Neilson, Newton, and Wemyss Bay, and also Helensburgh to Edinburgh via Bathgate.On Saturday about 3,000 children took part in Super Saturday events for families and juniors.The Great Scottish Run was first held in 1982 and has grown each year, with 24,089 people taking part in the 2012 events.</body>

      <body>Gambian officials have confirmed that the country will not be competing in the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.Last week, the west African nation branded the 54-member grouping, which includes the UK and most of its former colonies, a "neo-colonial institution".At the time it was unclear whether it would still be competing in the Games.However, Games organisers have confirmed The Gambia's withdrawal and said alternative plans would be made for the baton relay.A spokesman for Glasgow 2014 said: "All Commonwealth nations and territories are entitled to compete in the Commonwealth Games."Glasgow 2014 has received confirmation from the Commonwealth Games Federation of the formal withdrawal of The Gambia from the Commonwealth."It is our understanding, therefore, that The Gambia does not intend to enter a team and compete in next year's Games."The spokesman said the Queen's Baton Relay, which visits all nations and territories of the Commonwealth, would no longer go to The Gambia."This planning is now under development in collaboration with the Commonwealth Games Federation and we will provide further information in the near future," he said.</body>

      <body>Two members of staff suffered minor injuries in a disturbance lasting around seven hours at Scotland's newest jail.The nature of the incident at Low Moss Prison, East Dunbartonshire, is not known but it is believed a number of inmates barricaded themselves in cells.The injured staff were taken to hospital as a precaution and later returned to the prison in Bishopbriggs.The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) said it was "now a police matter".The incident started at around 12:30 BST.The number of inmates involved has not been revealed but an SPS spokeswoman said the officers "suffered only minor injuries".The incident comes less than 10 days after a report on Low Moss revealed a total of 165 assaults took place at the prison last year.Ten involved assaults on staff; there were 140 assaults by prisoners on fellow inmates while a further 15 were recorded as serious assaults involving prisoner-on-prisoner violence.But the report, by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons David Strang, said Low Moss had "appropriate staffing levels" to "ensure good order is maintained".The report though highlighted at least two areas of concern within the prison: an on-going dirty protest and the short amount of time allocated to prisoners receiving methadone.The prison received its first inmates in March of last year and at the time the SPS described the complex as "state-of-the-art".</body>

      <body>The new governor of the Punjab, Mohammad Sarwar, has told the family of an Inverclyde woman that he will do everything possible to have her killers brought to justice.Mumtaz Sattar, 38, from Port Glasgow, was murdered just hours after arriving in Pakistan last month.Her relatives have petitioned the High Court in Lahore, naming a suspect.Her brother Sarfraz Ali and family solicitor Aamer Anwar met Mr Sarwar in Glasgow on Saturday.Mr Sarwar, who became Britain's first Muslim MP in 1997 when he won the Glasgow Govan seat, renounced his British citizenship in August ahead of his inauguration as governor of Pakistan's most populous province.Speaking after the meeting, he told BBC Scotland he had been in contact with the Punjab police almost every day since Mrs Sattar's murder, and had told them he wanted the case investigated by senior officers.He added: "I want to assure the family and the people of Scotland that justice will be done."Senior police officials are doing the investigations on the case and I have confidence in our police force in Punjab and the legal system that they will do their best to make sure that the person who has committed this heinous crime is brought to justice."Mr Anwar said the meeting with Mr Sarwar had been "extremely valuable".He added: "Mr Sarwar arranged a conference call with senior police officers and formal requests have now been made for the police to co-operate with Police Scotland and with ourselves in order that this murder inquiry can be solved."He has been able to cut through the bureaucracy. He has also put the spotlight on this case and said that every pressure must be brought to bear in order to bring the killers of Mumtaz Sattar to justice."Mrs Sattar's husband Abdul, 40, is in police custody.He told officers he and his wife were drugged and attacked by two men during a taxi ride on the way from the airport to see his parents in Punjab on Saturday 21 September.He said they were thrown out of a moving car and that his wife died from the head injuries she suffered.Scottish Police are helping Pakistani authorities with their investigation.On Friday, Mr Anwar told BBC Scotland Mrs Sattar's relatives had serious concerns about the Pakistani police investigation into Mrs Sattar's death.He said: "A serious allegation has been made of bribery of police officers that are involved in the case."At each and every turn the family appears to have been obstructed, as a result of which advocates lodged a petition at the High Court in Lahore yesterday in which they name one murder suspect and ask for the authorities to bring the police officers concerned to the High Court to answer questions."</body>

      <body>An Inverness-shire man has been named the world's best porridge maker for the second time in three years.John Boa took the prize at the 20th Annual Golden Spurtle World Porridge Making Championships in Carrbridge, Inverness-shire.The trophy goes to the maker of the best traditional porridge using only oatmeal, salt and water.Mr Boa told BBC Scotland his win was "a little overwhelming".He said this was only the third time he had entered the competition. He also won in 2011."I'm very proud and privileged. And it does make it a little bit special that it's a landmark year for the competition," he added.Mr Boa, who formerly lived in Edinburgh but now lives on Skye, said the trick to producing a world-class porridge was to "keep stirring", using a spurtle - a rod-shaped tool, traditionally used to stir porridge.He also said adding the salt was "always a key moment"."You have to make sure you don't oversalt or undersalt," he said. "It has to be just right."This year the speciality award was won by London-based Nick Barnard for his recipe for fruity date porridge, which used dried apricots, dates, apples and cinnamon.Past recipes in the speciality section have included the use of curry powder, sausages and seafood.</body>

      <body>An Andy Warhol exhibition has opened at Holyrood - the first exhibition of the artist's work to take place in a parliamentary building.Andy Warhol: Pop, Power and Politics includes a number of iconic works that have never been shown in Scotland.The exhibition is a result of a collaboration between the Scottish Parliament, the Carnegie UK Trust and the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.It coincides with a week of events celebrating Andrew Carnegie's legacy.The Andrew Carnegie's International Legacy: Shaping the Future festival celebrates the Scottish philanthropist and the centenary of the formation of the Carnegie UK Trust.The Warhol exhibition features portraits of Carnegie, as well as Lenin, Chairman Mao and The Queen.Presiding Officer Tricia Marwick said: "It gives me real pleasure to open this exhibition of iconic images, depicting politicians and political events from across the globe."It is important to me that the Scottish Parliament hosts exhibitions that encourage people to discuss and explore political issues, and few artists can get people talking like Warhol does."In association with the exhibition, two portraits of Andy Warhol taken by Scottish photographer Harry Benson, will be on loan to the Parliament Art Collection and displayed in the UK for the first time.A number of works made by Warhol for political and environmental campaigns are also being loaned from Artist Rooms, jointly owned and managed by Tate and National Galleries of Scotland.Angus Hogg, chairman of the Carnegie UK Trust, said: "Andy Warhol holds a special place in our hearts at Carnegie, not only because the trust has a long history of promoting access to arts and culture, but also because Warhol received his first formal training in art through free classes offered by the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh."As many will already know, Andrew Carnegie envisioned a world of peace, well-being and opportunity, and this sentiment still rings true over 100 years on."This collaborative exhibition, which kicks off a celebration of Andrew Carnegie's legacy, provides a once-in-a-lifetime chance for the public to get an up-close look to some of society's most impactful pieces of art."Matt Wrbican, chief archivist at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, said: "The Warhol is thrilled to share many truly exceptional works from our collection with the Scottish Parliament and the Carnegie UK Trust."The items represent the full scope of Andy Warhol's life and art. This exhibition features Warhol paintings, sculptures, and prints from our permanent collection and allows visitors to the stunning parliament building to have the opportunity to see many top-rate original Warhols."In addition, we're pleased to once again unite Pittsburgh and Scotland through the very rare display of Warhol's Andrew Carnegie portrait."The Andy Warhol exhibition will run from 5 October to 3 November.</body>

      <description>Police are investigating the theft of a 12ft fibreglass crocodile from St Andrew Square in Edinburgh.</description>

      <body>Police are investigating the theft of a 12ft fibreglass crocodile from an Edinburgh square.The sculpture is believed to have been stolen from the gardens in the centre of St Andrew Square between 14:00 on Thursday and 08:00 on Friday.It is owned by the National Library of Scotland.It is believed to have been removed via the west gate of the gardens and onto George Street. Police are appealing for witnesses.The crocodile was St Andrew Square to promote the National Library of Scotland's current exhibition celebrating the African adventures of the explorer David Livingstone.The life-size replica has been named Davy by staff. They are now very keen to get him back.Darryl Mead, National Library of Scotland's deputy national librarian, said: "Davy has proved a popular attraction in the gardens since he moved in three weeks ago."We suspect he may have been taken as a prank late at night and we appeal for his safe return."The crocodile was filled with sand and weighed around 180 kilos to make it difficult to move him.The sand was removed before he was taken which would have taken some time and it would still have needed at least two people to carry him off, said police.He went missing when the garden's gate were closed to the public.PC Caireen Stewart, of Police Scotland, said: "This crocodile is the property of the National Library of Scotland and is very unique."Due to its size, it is believed that someone may have seen something regarding its disappearance."</body>

      <description>Police launch an investigation into the vandalism of Edinburgh statue Greyfriars Bobby after repair work to its nose was removed.</description>

      <body>Police have launched an investigation into the vandalism of Edinburgh statue Greyfriars Bobby after repair work to its nose was removed.The statue of the world famous dog underwent restoration work on Tuesday to turn his shiny nose back to its original black.However, less than 48 hours later, his nose was shiny again.Police said an abrasive material had been "intentionally used" on the nose, stripping the repaired area.The statue, located close to George IV bridge in the city's Old Town, is popular with tourists, many of whom have taken to rubbing the Skye Terrier's nose for luck.Edinburgh City Council confirmed it called the police after experts said the repair paint used should have lasted several years.Police Scotland said the statue was damaged sometime between 13:00 on Tuesday and 17:00 on Wednesday.The estimated cost of the damage is believed to be between £200 and £300.Officers are conducting inquiries and urged witnesses to come forward.PC Nick Davies, of Police Scotland, said: "This crime is as unusual as it is disappointing to observe."The statue is a beloved tourist attraction and is also very popular with Edinburgh's local residents."The nose has recently been touched up to restore it following years of wear and at first it was believed the repair had not adhered correctly to the monument."However, we are now treating this as an act of vandalism after discovering that an abrasive has been used to remove the material from the repaired area."As such, anyone who remembers seeing any suspicious activity around Greyfriars Bobby in the past few days is asked to contact police."Richard Lewis, Edinburgh City Council's culture and sport convener, said: "The work carried out should have lasted for a number of years and it is highly unlikely that it would have worn away naturally in such a short space of time."We will, of course, organise the repair work to be undertaken again and hope that in future people respect the statue of Greyfriars Bobby."</body>

      <description>Famous as the setting for children's TV series Balamory, Tobermory is now gaining a reputation as a cruise ship destination.</description>

      <date>1380098887</date>
      <body>It is famous as the setting for the fictional village in CBeebies series, Balamory. But, as BBC Radio Scotland's Kevin Mackenzie reports, Tobermory on Mull is now making a name for itself as a cruise destination.The picturesque town with its brightly coloured sea front buildings and substantial sheltered bay has just had its best year ever - attracting more than 30 cruise ship visits during the summer.Some of the biggest vessels to drop anchor off Tobermory has been the 644ft long liner The World - which made an unscheduled stop on its recent visit to Scottish waters.Of the scheduled liners to call, the MV Balmoral brought the largest number of visitors to the town's streets as 1,400 passengers made their way ashore.Mary MacGregor, of Tobermory Harbour Association, said Mull's popularity as a destination had grown over the last few years.She said: "Interest from shipping agents in bringing passengers to Tobermory has risen over the past three years and they've already got good bookings for 2014 and 2015."The main street is just a short walk from the landing pontoon and allows visitors to enjoy the shops, the museum and the distillery."Some of the passengers go straight onto coaches to go to other parts of the island, so it brings benefits throughout Mull and Iona."However, the cruise liner business is not always a guaranteed bonanza.Mrs MacGregor said: "It depends on the type of cruise it is."One gift shop owner saw his shop's shelves nearly emptied by the visiting passengers."On another occasion they'd stocked up specially and hardly sold anything, different demographics of passenger dictates."She added: "Quite a lot of Americans and continental Europeans were keen to sample local cuisine which they don't get on the actual ship."Tobermory is looking forward to continuing to attract liners and has a good list already established for 2014.Mrs MacGregor said: "One of the more interesting ships due to call next summer is Wind Surf, quite an exclusive ship with sails."Cruise Scotland, which promotes Scottish ports as destinations, said the value of the cruise industry to the Scottish economy was projected to rise to almost £50m this year, a near 65% increase in the past three years.</body>

      <date>1381060098</date>
      <body>Double Olympic gold medallist Haile Gebrselassie broke clear of Kenya's Emmanuel Bett in the final stages to win the Great Scottish Run in Glasgow.The 40-year-old Ethiopian, in his first appearance in Scotland, crossed the line in 61 minutes nine seconds, a record for the annual half-marathon.Three Scots finished in the first four of the women's race.Leeds-based Susan Partridge beat Freya Ross to the line, with Kenya's Pauline Wanjiku third and Steph Twell fourth.Olympian Katherine Grainger set the 23,000 runners under way from George Square in the city centre, with the start delayed by about 20 minutes.Kenya's Joseph Birech had been aiming to become the first man to win three successive Great Scottish Run titles but it was Gebrselassie, 28-year-old Bett and Moroccan-born Ayad Lamdassem, 32, who soon moved clear of the field.Having led the way for the first 5km, Gebrselassie invited the others to take their turn at the front.Bett accepted and only the legendary Ethiopian athlete could match his explosive break as the duo dropped Spain-based Lamdassem on a route taking in many of the venues to host events at next year's Commonwealth Games.At 15km, the Moroccan was trailing by 25 seconds in warm, overcast conditions.Gebrselassie, the world record holder at 20,000m and the one-hour race, surged 100m clear of long-legged Bett with a mile to go as they headed along the Broomielaw towards the city centre.And he maintained the gap over the final mile to cross the line first at Glasgow Green, 31 seconds before Bett.America-based Andrew Lemoncello, who will represent Scotland in the marathon at the Commonwealth Games, finished sixth in 1:04:55, six seconds behind's England's Chris Thompson in fifth spot."Today was really wonderful. I am so happy," said Gebrselassie. "It was a perfect set-up. I didn't expect this kind of weather."When I saw the time at 15k I knew we were heading for a fast time."After losing out in the last mile at the Bupa Great North Run I had to get clear today and decided to make my move when I did and it worked so well, I'm happy with this win."Oban's Partridge, 33, had looked a strong contender for the title, with her confidence buoyed by an excellent 10th-place finish in the marathon at the World Championships in Moscow in August.She, Ross and Wanjiku set a brisk pace that ensured the trio were clear of the field.Wanjiku was dropped as the three runners progressed along Paisley Road West in the city's south side and Ross, back from injury, was next to struggle with Partridge's speed as she moved 46 seconds ahead after 15km, with Wanjiku a further 54 seconds back.Though she slowed in the closing stages, Partridge was never in danger of being caught and came home ahead of the field in 1:10:40.Ross was next in, on 1:11:51."I'm delighted to have won the race," Partridge told BBC Sport. "Scotland should be proud of its distance runners."The 10k was won by Callum Hawkins in a time of 29:39 with the women's title being clinched by Beth Potter in 34:04.Maryport's Simon Lawson won the elite 10k men's wheelchair race in a time of 24:21, while Sammi Kinghorn from Kelso took the women's wheelchair title with a time of 30:59.On Saturday about 3,000 children took part in Super Saturday events for families and juniors.The Great Scottish Run was first held in 1982 and has grown each year, with 24,089 people taking part last year.</body>

The 18 residents will be moved to other accommodation while the work is done.Operator RDS Healthcare has not commented on the closure.The Care Inspectorate said it had "serious concerns" about the quality of care offered at Clachnaharry House.A spokesman said: "The health, safety and welfare of residents is the absolute priority because everyone is entitled to care that reflects their needs and promotes their rights."NHS Highland suspended its admissions to the home in November 2012.A spokesman said: "There are currently 18 residents in the home and it is our wish to have them moved to and settled in a new care environment as soon as possible."Five residents have been moved to hospital for a variety of clinical reasons."As a board our priority is the residents currently still in Clachnaharry and we have already started discussions with them, and their relatives, about the choices and opportunities that are available to them."In the meantime we will continue to work with the care home staff in providing advice and support to ensure this goes as smoothly as possible."</body>

      <body>Nat Fraser has lost his appeal against his conviction for murdering his wife Arlene.Fraser, 54, has twice been convicted of hiring a hitman to murder his estranged wife, who vanished from her home in Elgin, Moray, in April 1998. She has never been found.Fraser was found guilty of murder in 2003 but started a lengthy appeal process which led to a retrial.He was found guilty of murder for a second time last year.Relatives of Mrs Fraser welcomed the appeal decision, and said their message to Fraser was: "He should do his time."Fraser was jailed for a minimum of 17 years but his defence team argued at the appeal that remarks made by a trial witness may have led jurors to carry out online "research" into the background to the case.They blamed a so-called "Google-factor".The appeal judges ruled: "The trial judge provided clear and repeated directions to the jury during the trial and again at its conclusion in the charge itself, shortly before the jury retired to consider their verdict."In the absence of material which would tend to demonstrate the contrary, the court must proceed on the basis that the directions were followed."In this case the appeal court considered that the trial judge took into account all the relevant factors before deciding upon the appropriate course of action. He reached a balanced and reasonable decision based upon these factors."In such circumstances the court was unable to find fault in his decision."Mrs Fraser's mother Isabelle Thompson said afterwards of the appeal: "Hopefully we can get on with our lives, it's been never-ending."Her father, Hector McInnes, said: "Obviously we are happy it's all finished."We have had to come here too often. He should do his time."</body>

      <body>An attempt by a husband to be buried alongside the wife he was convicted of murdering has been rejected.Malcolm Webster, 54, originally from Surrey, was jailed for a minimum of 30 years for murdering Claire Morris in a car crash in Aberdeenshire in 1994.He was also convicted of staging a similar attempt to murder his second wife in New Zealand.Aberdeenshire Council said he had no right to be buried in the same plot as Ms Morris.An Aberdeenshire Council spokeswoman said: "The murder conviction against Malcolm Webster has rendered his contract with the council, as relating to the lair at Tarves, void."As such, he would have no right to be buried in the same lair as Claire Morris."We are monitoring the ongoing appeal proceedings."Webster's appeal against his conviction is currently being considered by judges.The council last year gave Ms Morris's family permission to remove the headstone at her grave, as it referred to a "dear wife" and displayed her married name.Webster was found guilty in 2011 of murdering Ms Morris, 32, who was originally from Kent, in a faked car crash.The jury at the High Court in Glasgow accepted that he set fire to the vehicle with his unconscious wife inside it, before later receiving an insurance payout.The appeal judges will issue their ruling, in writing, at a later date.</body>

      <title>Scots soldiers given bravery awards</title>
      <description>Several Scottish soldiers are honoured for acts of bravery carried out while they were serving in Afghanistan.</description>

      <body>Scottish soldiers have been honoured for acts of bravery while serving in Afghanistan.The awards included a George Medal for a bomb disposal expert who helped save the lives of Danish and Afghan troops.Also honoured was a soldier who took "decisive action" after a rogue member of the Afghan Army killed a Scottish officer during a football match.And a platoon leader was recognised for his "conspicuous bravery" under heavy fire.Warrant Officer Andy Peat, a high threat explosive ordnance disposal operator, received the George Medal for his role when he was attached to a task force of a Danish Special Forces unit with Afghan partners.The George Medal is awarded to civilians for acts of great bravery, but also to military personnel for acts of great bravery not in the presence of the enemy.WO Peat, 39, from Edinburgh, was on an operation to search a suspected homemade explosive factory when one of the Danish soldiers triggered a device on a compound roof.He was credited with saving the lives of several other Danish soldiers and members of the Afghan police.He cleared a route to the injured man while urging the other Afghan and Danish soldiers to stay still to avoid triggering other bombs.When he reached him he realised there was another wire underneath him - tracing it to another IED hidden under a nearby stone, he disarmed it and cleared a safe route.WO Peat, of 33 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiment Royal Engineers, said: "Working in the dark with night vision equipment does make it more difficult but we train for those situations."I was aware that there was a potential threat from insurgents and further devices. In those circumstances you remain focused, prioritise and work logically."It is hard to suppress your emotions, knowing someone has been gravely injured. Your first instinct is to run to them and do everything you can to help but if you do that, you could make things a lot worse."Oversergeant Rene Brink Jakobsen later died of his wounds, leaving behind a wife and three children.WO Peat's citation stated: "Although a Danish serviceman was fatally injured, the calm, determined actions and bravery demonstrated by Peat without doubt prevented further casualties and death to both Afghans and Danish alike."The Commander on the ground is adamant that Peat protected seven lives that night. At no time did Peat show regard to his own safety and his selfless actions are tribute to a truly professional soldier."In August, WO Peat became the first soldier outside Denmark to receive the Anders Lassen Award for his bravery.Pte Ryan Houston, of 1st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, was two-and-a-half months into his first tour of duty in Afghanistan when an Afghan soldier starting firing at troops as they played football in November last year.The 22-year-old, from Hamilton, was on duty as a Guardian Angel, patrolling the Forward Operating Base in Nad-e Ali to protect his fellow troops, when he heard gunfire.As Afghan and British troops scattered, he took on the rogue soldier who was firing at him, then followed him as he fled the pitch.The incident fatally wounded Capt Walter Barrie, 41, from Penicuik in Midlothian, who was playing in the match.His killer was stopped when Pte Houston, joined by another soldier, gave chase and opened fire.The 22-year-old was awarded a Mention in Despatches in the latest round of Operational Honours, announced at the Tower of London.Pte Houston's citation described how he and his colleague were exposed to more than 50 bullets which passed within centimetres of them.Once the Afghan soldier had been shot, they searched him, and Pte Houston was then said to have expressed "extraordinary humanity and control" by protecting fellow soldiers who were giving first aid to the man who had only minutes before been trying to kill them."Houston's valour, decisive action and his exhibition of the highest standards to which the British Army aspires, are out of all proportion to that expected of such a junior soldier," the citation added.Also mentioned in dispatches was Cpl Richard Cook, from Selkirk, who was recognised for his "repeated gallantry and inspirational leadership" while acting above his rank as a Platoon Sergeant in Afghanistan.Cpl Cook, also of 1st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, led his platoon on an operation to search a known insurgent command post and improvised explosive device factory in central Yakchal in February.As the Scots and members of the Afghan National Security Force Tiger Team approached the compound they came under "accurate and heavy small arms fire" with rounds striking the ground among his soldiers.He immediately took control, directing his men to what little cover there was and ordered return fire to enable an extraction of his men and the Tiger Team.The 26-year-old said: "We knew it was coming. Rounds started cracking around us. I ordered rapid fire. The machine gunner got a stoppage and just as he ducked behind a wall a bullet struck the top of it."With suppressive firing failing to quell the insurgent attack, he took a significant risk and moved out of cover to an exposed and vulnerable position to draw the insurgent fire and identify their position.Upon doing so, he fired a 66mm rocket, ending the contact successfully without sustaining any casualties.He said: "I knew I had to do something to stop them firing on us. At the time I didn't think about putting myself in the firing line. It was only afterwards I wondered what the hell I was doing".Over the course of the day, his platoon was engaged a further eight times by accurate small arms, grenades and rocket propelled grenades from multiple firing points.His citation read: "Throughout, he led from the front showing outstanding grit and determination which proved to be an inspiration to his young soldiers and the Afghan Tiger team."</body>

      <body>A senior Scottish Fire and Rescue Service officer has admitted its handling of moves to close a Dumfries control room could have been better.The centre is one of five being considered for closure.Assistant Chief Fire Officer Dave Boyle issued an apology directly to members of Dumfries and Galloway Council's police and fire committee.He said the service could have handled the issue much better and would learn from the mistake.However, he said there would be no rethink on the decision taken by the board."The SFRS, myself and the strategic leadership team and the board need to learn lessons from community engagement, from local authority engagement and all the rest of it," he said."We will be examining where we have gone through this process and what we could do better and, more importantly, how we change our actions for the future."He said there had been issues with the Dumfries control room for a number of years and it would have needed significant investment in order to continue."What the board have decided has actually just brought the final chapter down on that," he said."We will now start to invest money with the local stations to make sure that they are retained to be mobilised in the way they should be."Once the fire control centre in Dumfries is shut, all emergency call handling for the region will be transferred to Johnstone in Renfrewshire.Labour councillor Ronnie Ogilvie, who sits on the local authority's police and fire committee, said he remained deeply concerned about the impact of the closure - both operationally and in terms of employment.However, he said the fact the SFRS had recognised that it had made a major error in not consulting was at least something."To be fair to the fire board they have acknowledged that - and it is not just in Dumfries and Galloway," he said."Other people are jumping up and down as well."They have realised they have made a major mistake and they are going to address that - but it doesn't change the decision though."</body>

      <body>Chemicals firm Ineos has written down the value of its petrochemical assets at Grangemouth from £400m to zero.The company said it had "no option" but to write down the value of property, plant and equipment at the site following repeated annual losses by the petrochemical business.The move has come as members of Unite prepare to start a work-to-rule and overtime ban at Grangemouth on Monday.The dispute centres on the treatment of a union convener.In a statement, Ineos repeated that its site at Grangemouth would close by 2017 if they did not find savings and fresh investment.The company said it had invested more than £1bn since taking over at Grangemouth in 2006 but the site had lost more than £150m over the past four years.Calum MacLean, chairman of the Grangemouth petrochemicals business, said: "We had no option but to write down these assets. After four years of heavy losses, the petrochemicals business is effectively worthless."Without lower costs and an alternative source of additional raw material, it will close in 2017 at the latest."He added: "The petrochemical business at Grangemouth is at a crossroads."The current financial position is unsustainable and this write-down simply confirms the stark choices that we have ahead of us."Workers at Grangemouth recently voted in favour of industrial action over the treatment of union convener Stevie Deans, who was also involved in the row over the selection of a Labour candidate in Falkirk.Mr Deans, who is chairman of the constituency party, faces an investigation by Ineos over issues linked to the Falkirk row.</body>

      <body>The Scottish Greens could play a key role in convincing Scots to vote for independence in next year's referendum, the party's conference has been told.Co-convener Patrick Harvie said "canny" voters would not be persuaded into voting Yes next September with "flags, bribes or fearmongering".He said Scots could be won over with a "radical vision" of what the country could be like after leaving the UK.Mr Harvie was speaking as the two-day conference opened in Inverness.The people of Scotland will be asked the straight yes/no question "Should Scotland be an independent country?" when they vote in the independence referendum on 18 September 2014.At last year's conference members voted to endorse the cross-party Yes Scotland campaign for independence.At the same time the party agreed to form its own pro-independence campaign, designed to promote its distinct policies.Mr Harvie, one of the Greens' two MSPs at Holyrood, said: "Many Scots remain undecided on independence and they have every right to take their time, as creating a new country is undoubtedly a radical step."These canny voters won't be persuaded by flags, bribes or fearmongering but I believe they will respond to a radical vision for a better Scotland and the Scottish Greens are crucial to outlining that vision."Taking responsibility and bringing power closer to the people is a core Green principle, and our conference is a chance for us to galvanise our party and amplify our message."He added: "This is a big decision about Scotland's long-term future."As Greens we're used to thinking big and it's in our DNA to think ahead, so let's seize the day."Mr Harvie argued that at this time the "Green vision for Scotland has never been more important", adding that his party offered "the vision of a renewed economy that works for the many rather than the few and a sustainable society that cares about future generations".He said: "The clock is ticking on the need to tackle climate change and a Green Scotland would be better placed to develop the low-carbon society we need."</body>

      <body>Shadow chancellor Ed Balls has criticised SNP plans to keep the pound in an independent Scotland, as he hit the by-election trail in Dunfermline.But also campaigning in the Fife town, Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said Sterling belonged as much to Scotland as the rest of the UK.The Tory and Lib Dem leaders, Ruth Davidson and Willie Rennie, said Scotland was better off in the UK.The by-election is being held after the resignation of sitting MSP Bill Walker.The former independent member was jailed for a year after being convicted for assaults on three ex-wives and a step-daughter.He was elected for the SNP in 2011, but thrown out of the party when the charges came to light.Hitting the campaign trail and speaking ahead of next year's independence referendum, Mr Balls said the rest of the UK wanted Scotland to remain part of it.In the event of a "yes" vote, the Scottish government wants to keep the pound and retain the services of the Bank of England under a currency zone.'Fresh start'But the shadow chancellor said: "The idea that Scotland could simply keep the pound - that would mean restrictions on budget policy, on interest rates, on financial regulation which would be very hard for Scotland - the idea that the rest of the UK would sign up to a Euro-style gamble on a Sterling zone, I don't think that is very likely."Mr Salmond officially launched the SNP's by-election campaign by setting out the party's record in government.He highlighted the council tax freeze and the SNP's commitment to maintaining universal benefits.Responding to Mr Balls' comments about currency in an independent Scotland, the first minister said: "We think sharing the pound, which is as much our pound - Scotland's pound - as Ed Balls' pound, is in the interests of Scotland, but it's also overwhelmingly in the interests of the rest of the UK and that's what will prevail after a 'Yes' vote in the referendum."Meanwhile, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Mr Rennie, who was campaigning for local jobs in Dunfermline, added: "The best way to get the best bits of the United Kingdom is to stay entrenched in the United Kingdom - the idea that you can somehow leave, but still benefit from all the good bits is nonsense."And Scottish Conservative leader Ms Davidson, who called for a "fresh start" in the town after the Bill Walker saga, said: "Alex Salmond's pronouncement about just taking the pound after having been a flag-waver for the Euro for so many years is another example of his 'say anything, do anything, promise anything for a coupe more votes' approach."Voters go to the polls on 24 October to elect one of seven candidates as MSP for Dunfermline.</body>

      <title>Energy group 'could consider freeze'</title>
      <description>The Scottish government says its expert commission on energy could consider the feasibility of a price freeze on gas and electricity prices in an independent Scotland.</description>

      <body>The Scottish government has said its expert commission on energy could consider the feasibility of a price freeze on gas and electricity prices in an independent Scotland.But Energy Minister Fergus Ewing said he thought the move was "unfeasible".On Thursday, he attacked Labour leader Ed Miliband's promise to make energy firms freeze prices for two years if he won the next General Election.Mr Ewing warned it could lead to the lights going out.The energy minister told BBC Scotland that the SNP government in Scotland had delivered a price freeze for the council tax because it was within its control.He said: "The trouble about the energy price freeze is that the international gas price is set by global markets and therefore it is not within the control of the Labour party, and they have not published any plan showing how it would work."The Scottish government recently announced the setting up of an expert commission to look at how the gas and electricity industry might be regulated in an independent Scotland.It will be chaired by Robert Armour, an energy lawyer working in the power sector in Scotland for 30 years.Mr Ewing said: "We have asked the energy commission to look at all the options, including the options which we think are unfeasible, such as a price freeze."Labour accused the SNP of siding with big business against hard-pressed consumers.Scottish Labour's finance spokesman Iain Gray said: "The choice is very clear."If we stay part of the United Kingdom, Scotland stands to benefit from a price freeze and strong regulation of the markets and prices."If we were to leave the United Kingdom we would have no price freeze and the energy companies would be able to continue to raise their prices willy-nilly while their profits go up far more."</body>

      <title>Procurement reform bill published</title>
      <description>Public sector bodies could be allowed to consider issues such as blacklisting when awarding work to firms, under proposed reforms.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-24398997</url>
      <date>1380900795</date>
      <body>Public sector bodies could be allowed to consider issues such as blacklisting and zero-hours contracts when awarding work to firms, according to planned reforms.The move is among changes to public procurement rules being proposed by the Scottish government.The Procurement Reform Bill aims to improve the way the public sector buys goods, works and services.Ministers said it would make it easier for small firms to bid for contracts.Guidance under the bill would allow public sector bosses to consider the inappropriateness of awarding contracts to companies using controversial zero-hours contracts, which allow employers to hire staff with no guarantee of work.Public sector bosses could also consider, when deciding on a contract award, whether firms use blacklisting.The issue of blacklisting has angered unions and politicians, following disclosures about a UK-wide database of names used by major construction firms to vet workers.Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the legislation promoted an approach that was "both business friendly and socially responsible".The proposed new rules could also lead to greater use of community benefit clauses.These clauses could require companies to provide training, apprenticeships or opportunities for disabled people as part of the contract."Changes to public procurement rules will ensure Scotland retains its place as a world leader in public procurement reform, promoting an approach that is both business friendly and socially responsible," Ms Sturgeon said.Responding to the bill, Scottish Trades Union Congress general secretary Grahame Smith said: "The STUC enthusiastically welcomes parts of this important bill, especially its provisions to disqualify firms engaging in tax avoidance and blacklisting from the public procurement process and the commitment to introduce further guidance on workforce matters."But Mr Smith described parts of the legislation as "very disappointing", adding: "It is difficult to believe that community benefits will be extended and improved by simply handing contracting authorities a duty to 'consider' whether to impose as part of the contract."The STUC is also sceptical that the significant additional requirements placed on local authorities and other contracting agencies will have 'no overall net impact on costs'."Scottish Building Federation managing director Vaughan Hart welcomed the publication of the bill.He said: "With a growing pipeline of publicly funded infrastructure projects planned over the years ahead, this bill offers the potential to transform the efficiency of public procurement - and to encourage many more particularly smaller building companies to bid for public sector contracts."We will look forward to scrutinising the detail in the months ahead."CBI Scotland said the bill contained "a number of encouraging measures", but added that ministers risked missing out on an opportunity to open up the delivery of public services to independent providers.Assistant director David Lonsdale added: "The bill should enshrine in legislation a 'right to bid' for private and third sector organisations, so that any provider who can demonstrate the capacity and wherewithal to deliver a public service more effectively, innovatively, and for better value is given the opportunity to do so."</body>

      <body>Newly-released scientific evidence shows mackerel stocks in the north east Atlantic are in "good health", Scottish fishing leaders have said.The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea has recommended an increase in quotas of more than 60% for 2014.The Scottish Pelagic Fishermen's Association (SPFA) welcomed the news.Scientists said analysis had been hampered by the wrangle with Iceland and the Faroe Islands over quotas.SPFA chief executive Ian Gatt said: "The scientific advice confirms what Scottish fishermen have repeatedly been saying, that the stock remains in good health and that consumers can continue to eat Scottish mackerel safe in the knowledge that the fish are abundant in the sea and being sustainably caught by our fishermen."He said he hoped a resolution with Iceland and the Faroes could be reached over disputed quota levels.Fisheries Secretary Richard Lochhead said: "The increase in quota advised for 2014 is tremendous news for the Scottish fishing industry."Mackerel is our most valuable stock, worth £131m to the Scottish economy last year."He added: "This scientific advice also provides a fresh opportunity to try and resolve the ongoing dispute with Iceland and the Faroes."Iceland's Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, said: "With our focus on sustainable fisheries, Iceland will continue to work hard for an agreement between the coastal states in order to secure sustainable management of the mackerel stock."</body>

      <body>Scotland's Kirsty Gilmour missed out on a maiden Grand Prix title after Spanish third seed Carolina Martin fought back to beat her in London.Gilmour, 20, held a seven-point lead in the opening set of the final, but Martin responded to win 21-19 21-9.English champions Chris Langridge and Heather Olver also had to settle for silver after defeat in the mixed doubles final at the Copper Box.German duo Michael Fuchs and Birgit Michels claimed a 21-19 21-14 victory.Gilmour is ranked 34th in the world and won the lower-ranked Czech Open last week.However, Martin is the world number 20 and demonstrated in the latter stages of the final why she was able to beat top seed Busanan Ongbumrungpan of Thailand in the semi-finals."We came all the way through the junior ranks together but we've never actually played each other," said Gilmour. "There was a lot of trying to work one another out early on and I had a bit of a jump on her, but she managed to claw it back."I'm going to take a lot of positives from that and I'm enjoying having a bit more expectation on me now."I'm looking to step up the level of competitions that I do and I can't wait to compete at the Glasgow Grand Prix later in the year. That will be a great test ahead of the Commonwealths."Langridge, 28 and Olver, 27, beat favourites Danny Bawa Chrisnata and Yu Yan Vanessa Neo from Singapore in the previous round, but could not overcome the second seeds.They hope the experience will serve them well leading into a crucial qualifying period for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow."It is gutting," Langridge told BBC Sport. "You don't get many tournaments in your back yard, but that's how it goes in sport sometimes."Olver added: "We need to forget this final now, but I don't see why we can't get selected for the Commonwealths, or even win a medal there."We've had good results earlier in the year and I feel we are on track."In the men's singles, Chinese qualifier Tian Houwei won gold by beating Denmark's Hans-Kristian Vittinghus 22-20 21-16.It was the third time Houwei, 21, had beaten a seeded opponent in London, including an impressive victory over top seed - and world number five - Jan O Jorgensen earlier in the competition."I still have a lot to learn but this is one of my first big tournaments and I hope there will be many more trophies," Houwei told BBC Sport.The women's doubles final was an all-Danish affair as top seeds Christinna Pedersen and Kamilla Rytter Juhl faced compatriots Line Damkjaer Kruse and Marie Roepke.Kruse and Roepke were on course for an upset after taking the opening set 21-12, but Pedersen and Juhl found their range in the second set to take it 21-17.The world number three pair were at their dominant best in the decider, powering to a 21-15 victory."They had the right tactic against us at the beginning and we were a little bit too nervous on the court," said Pedersen, who won bronze in the mixed doubles at the 2012 Olympics.Although a number of the world's leading players - including Olympic champions Lin Dan and Li Xuerui - skipped the event because of forthcoming Superseries events in France and Denmark, many established players did attend the inaugural event in London.Pedersen added: "We are so happy to be back. We have good memories from last year and we love playing here in England where the crowd is fantastic."In the men's doubles final, Olympic silver medallists Mathias Boe and Carsten Mogensen of Denmark defeated Indonesian duo Berry Angriawan and Ricky Karanda Suwardi 21-13 21-16.</body>

      <body>Wales prop Gethin Jenkins returned for the Cardiff Blues in this comfortable home Pro12 win over Edinburgh.Jenkins, 32, had been out of action for four months with a calf injury following the British and Irish Lions' tour of Australia.Wing Alex Cuthbert scored two tries to give the hosts a second win of the season.Leigh halfpenny registered the rest of the Blues points, while captain Grieg Laidlaw scored Edinburgh's points.Jenkins played for 60 minutes and his return to action, with the autumn internationals looming in November, will have been welcomed by Wales coach Warren Gatland.This was a confidence-boosting win for a young Blues side which had won just one of their previous four Pro12 games.The return of prop Jenkins and lock Bradley Davies, who was back after serving a suspension, added some much-needed experience and power to the Blues.But this was a scrappy performance by the home side, dominated by too many unforced errors and too many loose kicks.They were in control in the opening passages of the game but had little to show for all their territory and possession against an Edinburgh side who find themselves bottom of the Pro12.Halfpenny proved a great comfort in the early part of this game and the Lions man of the series finished with a personal tally of 19 points.He and Laidlaw swapped early penalties before the Blues finally crossed for wing Cuthbert's first try.Centre Owen Williams' grubber kick was snapped up by Harry Robinson before he put Williams away with his inside pass.Williams was tackled on the visitors' 22m line but a simple passing movement saw Cuthbert finish off the move in the right hand corner with a try.Halfpenny converted Cuthbert's try before Laidlaw replied with his third and fourth penalty to claw his side back to within a point of their hosts to make it 13-12 at the break.Laidlaw missed a chance to give Edinburgh the lead straight after half-time when his fifth penalty hit the post.The Scots did think they had scored a try when flanker Tomas Leonardi claimed he had scored after Edinburgh had been held up on the Blues try line.But the video referee ruled that he had made a double movement and ruled out the score and the home side cleared their line.Halfpenny replied with three quick penalties to give his side a 10-point cushion midway through the second half with a 22-12 lead.The Blues then took full advantage of Edinburgh being a man down after they lost replacement Cornell du Preez for 10 minutes as he was show a yellow card.Cuthbert finished the Blues' second try when fly half Rhys Patchell launched an attack from deep inside his own half, with centre Cory Allen, Halfpenny and Sam Warburton all combining to put the big wing in under the posts.Cuthbert thought he had scored a hat-track for the Blues five minutes from time but the video referee ruled he had been held up over the line.Cardiff Blues: Leigh Halfpenny; Alex Cuthbert, Owen Williams, Cory Allen, Harry Robinson; Rhys Patchell, Lloyd Williams; Gethin Jenkins, Matthew Rees (capt), Taufa'ao Filise, Bradley Davies, Filo Paulo, Josh Navidi, Sam Warburton, Andries Pretorius.Replacements: Kristian Dacey, Scott Andrews, Sam Hobbs, Lou Reed, Robin Copeland, Lewis Jones, Gareth Davies, Dafydd Hewitt.Edinburgh: Jack Cuthbert, Dougie Fife, Joaquin Dominguez, Ben Atiga, Tim Visser, Harry Leonard, Greig Laidlaw (capt), Alasdair Dickinson, Ross Ford, Willem Nel, Sean Cox, Izak van der Westhuizen, Dimitri Basilaia, Tomas Leonardi, David Denton.Replacements: James Hilterbrand, Wicus Blaauw, Geoff Cross, Ollie Atkins, Cornell Du Preez, Sean Kennedy, Matt Scott, Sam Hidalgo-Clyne.Referee: George Clancy (IRFU)Assistant Referees: Neil Hennessy, Neil Perkins (both WRU)Citing Commissioner: Denis Jones (WRU)TMO: Gareth Simmonds (WRU)</body>

      <body>Glasgow City will meet Hibernian in the Scottish Cup final after two tough semi-finals at Ravenscraig.Hibs triumphed 5-4 on penalties against Rangers in the first semi-final, after Lisa Swanson had cancelled out Rachel Walkingshaw's early strike.Jo Love, Suzanne Mulvey and Suzanne Lappin all hit the net as Glasgow City saw off Celtic 3-0 later in the day.The Premier League's top two meet in the 17 November final at Broadwood, in a repeat of the 2011 final.Hibs were ahead as early as the ninth minute against a Rangers side trailing them by 11 points in the league.However, Lisa Swanson's header drew Angie Hind's side level, but Hibs almost sneaked victory right on full-time only to be denied by both the post and the crossbar in a frantic goalmouth scramble.With neither side able to find a winner in extra-time, it came down to penalty kicks. Sophie Riley was the unlucky player to be denied by keeper Shannon Lynn from the spot.It was mostly one-way traffic in the first half between Glasgow City and Celtic, but champions City only had one goal to show for their dominance at half-time, Jo Love firing a scorching 25-yard effort into the top corner.City continued to dominate in the second half, but at 1-0 the game was still alive and Celtic passed up a glorious chance on the hour mark when Fiona Brown pounced on a mistake, but she could not find a way past Danica Dalziel.City got their second goal in the 73rd minute when a great ball from Lappin sent Mulvey through on goal and the City striker shot expertly past the outrushing Gemma Fay into the bottom corner.The cup holders finished off a fine performance when Lappin netted with minutes remaining after being set up by Ruesha Littlejohn to keep alive their dreams of a second successive treble.</body>

      <title>Feeding 5,000 highlights food waste</title>
      <description>Edinburgh chefs cook up meal to highlight food waste</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-24406749</url>
      <date>1380931482</date>
      <body>Feeding up to 5,000 people in a day is no easy task but a team of chefs and volunteers are hoping to do just that in Edinburgh on Saturday to highlight the issue of food waste.They will be creating free meals using ingredients which might otherwise not have been used.Scottish households throw away 566,000 tonnes of food waste every year, according to Zero Waste Scotland.In the small kitchen of an Edinburgh restaurant preparations are under way for lunchtime service. Freshly baked sourdough bread comes out of the oven, meanwhile the chef is examining lobsters, mussels and potatoes from their allotment."I dug these up on Sunday," says Neil Forbes, chef director at Café St Honore."These are a variety called pink fir apple potatoes, which are just sensational, look how nutty and knobbly they look. Incredible."He is passionate about kitchen traditions, but on Saturday he will be swapping his own kitchen for a marquee as he oversees the cooking by a team of other chefs of up to 5,000 meals. He believes the issue of food waste is crucial."You have to put your business hat on sometimes and think well if I could sell that and there's nothing wrong with it, why would I throw that away if it's perfectly edible and good to eat."It may not be attractive to look at, it may be a wonky carrot or a misshapen courgette but there's nothing wrong with it taste-wise, so by the time you've cut it up or made it into a pot of soup or a stew, then surely it's just madness to throw it away."The most wasted foods are fresh fruit and vegetables, salads, bread and cakes, with the average Scottish household throwing out something like £430 worth of food a year"In Scotland we throw away 566,000 tonnes of food waste every year from our homes, that's the equivalent of 38,000 double-decker buses," says Ylva Haglund of Zero Waste Scotland."Three quarters of this could have been avoided if we managed our food a little bit better, for example using it up in time or not over-cooking and ending up throwing out food afterwards."But is that message getting through?"I'm pretty good at using what I buy," says one woman shopper in the centre of Edinburgh.Another woman, hurrying along with bags under her arms, admits she is rather less efficient: "Vegetables that I haven't got through, stuff that's in the fridge, after a week, you just clear it all out."I should really watch what I buy."The vegetables being used to cook up Saturday's meals are mainly ones which might not meet the specifications for retail in supermarkets and could go to other parts of the food chain or even cattle feed.The Scottish Retail Consortium says the major grocery retailers "have been at the forefront of ensuring that EU fruit and vegetable marketing regulations were relaxed so that the strict marketing conditions on 26 types of fruit and vegetables were loosened so that more 'wonky' fruit and vegetables could be sold in dedicated value ranges."They are also working with farmers to make more of the crop by, for example, using 'wonkier' fruit and vegetables in basic lines or using it in processed products."It also says it is working to reach targets "agreed with the Scottish government to reduce food waste in the supply chain and help consumers reduce household waste."Saturday's event, organised by the group, Edible Edinburgh is also trying to touch on wider issues of food sustainability in the city and the public will be asked for their views on developing a strategy to advance that."The amount of food that we waste in the north, the developed world is more than the amount of food people eat in sub-Saharan Africa," says Pete Ritchie, director of the group Nourish Scotland. He is also a member of the Edible Edinburgh project."It's pretty poor, it shows how disconnected we've become from the value of food."One of the dishes on offer on Saturday will be a vegetable curry, cooked with a glut of coriander and tomato puree nearing its use by date."I'm hoping we will have created discussion and debate," says Charlie Cornelius, the chef-proprietor at Iglu restaurant in Edinburgh. He will be in charge of that curry kitchen which could turn out about 830 meals."That people will have had fun coming out, coming together through food, creating community through food. There's nothing more important than that."</body>

      <description>New flavours catapult porridge to a healthy breakfast staple</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/0/24082660</url>
      <date>1380900821</date>
      <body>Porridge's exact origins have "been lost in the mists of time", but new flavours, different grains and its nutritional benefits have catapulted it into a modern healthy breakfast staple.The simplicity of porridge is also its beauty.There are few foods that can be made as easily as a bowl of water mixed with oats, perhaps with a sprinkle of salt (the traditionally Scottish way) or sugar.Or that can be transformed with the addition of berries or fruit, spices, nuts, honey, syrups, milk, cream or even booze.Couple this with its healthy appeal, and sales of oats and ready-made porridge in the UK are skyrocketing.However aficionado John Boa's attempts at blending flavours in the annual World Porridge Championships in Carrbridge, in the Scottish Highlands have not always been successful."Keeping it simple is my philosophy when it comes to the speciality section," he says."The first year [I added] beer and nuts and called it my all day porridge. It didn't go down at all well."With wooden stirring tools known as spurtles at the ready, enthusiastic cooks from as far afield as Sweden and America must prepare their porridge using oatmeal, water and salt, with the option to add flavours in a speciality section.John Boa, is a previous winner of the coveted golden spurtle prize, and in 2012 his honeyed hazelnut porridge swirl won the people's choice award.This year he is entering his recipe for a toffee sauce and nut version at the 20th annual competition.The interest in porridge is not confined to a few die-hard enthusiasts in the Highlands.In fact 49% of people in the UK eat porridge, according to market research firm Mintel, with 23% of people eating it daily.It says sales of hot cereals - largely made up of porridge - have almost doubled since 2008, hitting £241m in 2013, and volume sales rising by 25% to 81 million kg.Cafe chain Pret A Manger's sales of hot pots have doubled since it began selling them in 2010, and it now sells more than 60,000 each week.Why the increase in popularity? It could be put down to successive cold winters or a growing awareness of porridge's nutritional value.Heidi Lanschuetzer, food and drinks analyst at Mintel says: "While porridge has found a way to tap into the out of home breakfast occasion, the segment has also benefited from oats' inherent health benefits, notably the fact that they can lower cholesterol, as well as their widely held associations with satiety - a factor which is of particular importance when it comes to buying breakfast cereals."Oats, which form the basis of traditional porridge are often called a "superfood" because of the many nutrients they contain.Oats are a wholegrain product, rather than a refined one says Dr Frank Thies of the Rowett Institute of Nutrition and Health."If you compare that with white bread, wholemeal bread contains lots of good vital chemicals, nutrients and vitamins that are removed from the grain when you process the flour to make white bread."Like any other wholegrain product, oats are very good for you."Oats contain protein, magnesium, potassium, iron, calcium, Vitamin E, and Vitamin B, and have no sodium or cholesterol.In addition, they contain large amounts of soluble fibre including beta-glucan, which is known to lower cholesterol.Professor Derek Stewart, from the James Hutton Institute, says in Britain's Favourite Supermarket Foods porridge is "outstanding"."Beta-glucan is soluble dietary fibre - beta-glucan dissolves the water and forms a gloopy thick mass," he says.This can help the stomach feel fuller, for longer - but does it actually suppress appetite and prevent snacking?Dr Thies advises that studies are still ongoing."We don't know if it's due to the effects of food or just because you have a [full] feeling in your stomach due to the viscosity of the material."More research is needed, but it might be the case that oats affect the signal telling your body that it should stop eating," says Dr Thies.Dr Izhat Khan, a consultant with NHS Scotland is competing in the World Porridge Championships for the first time.He regularly extols its benefits to diabetic patients who must control levels of glucose in their blood (glycaemia)."Oatmeal offers very good glycaemic control," says Dr Khan. "If you have a bowl of porridge in the morning then you do not have the craving for elevenses and you avoid the snacks that can be quite unhealthy."There are no big insulin surges and you have satiety that lasts until lunchtime."For those on a gluten-free diet a daily bowl of oat porridge may not be an option, though some gluten-free brands are on sale.Pure oatmeal does not contain gluten, but can often be contaminated with wheat or barley during factory production.However "pseudo-cereals", plants that produce grains such as amaranth or buckwheat, can be substituted for oats in a dish of porridge.Oats form the basis of what we think of as traditional porridge in Britain but many other countries can also lay claim to the name, albeit with variations."[Claiming porridge as their own] is a pretty clever trick that the Scots have pulled off," says Guthrie Hutton, author of A Bowl of Porridge."They have managed to get oatmeal porridge recognised as the one true porridge and to have it identified with Scotland. [But] people make porridge using different grains in different countries around the world."Varieties of porridge made with ingredients other than oats have been eaten around the globe for thousands of years.Quinoa has been used in porridge for more than 3,000 years while in China, according to legend, rice porridge or congee has been eaten since 2500BC.According to Mr Hutton, oats have been a staple of the Scottish diet for so long their origins are "lost in the mists of time"."The oat crop was brought into Scotland possibly even [as far back as] Roman times, nobody really quite knows when."It was derived from natural grasses that probably originated somewhere like the Middle East but found in the cold, wet climate of Scotland a fairly ideal habitat."The important role of porridge in history was recently highlighted by academic Alistair Moffat, who claimed the invention of porridge changed the world.He suggested that feeding youngsters porridge allowed mothers to stop breastfeeding earlier, freeing them to bear more children, in turn increasing the world's population.Meanwhile some think that its health benefits could be exploited even more.Heidi Lanschuetzer, from Mintel says: "Given that the usage of porridge stands at half of all Brits, the hot cereals segment still offers strong potential for future growth in areas such as vitamin or mineral fortification or flavour innovation."At the World Porridge Championships, innovation is celebrated - and Dr Khan plans to introduce Eastern flavours."I'll be using cinnamon, cardamom seeds, ground, skinned almonds and pistachio for garnish," he says. "I'll be using French honey for the flavour."Author Guthrie Hutton is more of a traditionalist, preferring his to be served with water and salt.But he also recommends one other daily traditional taste of Scotland: "My recipe for long life is a bowl of porridge in the morning and a tot of whisky at night."Follow BBC Food on Pinterest and on twitter: @BBCFood</body>

      <title>Tory MP pushes for early EU vote</title>
      <description>A prominent Conservative backbench MP says he will try to force the government to hold an early referendum on whether the UK should leave the EU.</description>

      <date>1381073991</date>
      <body>Prominent Conservative backbencher Adam Afriyie has said he will try to force the government to hold an early vote on whether the UK should leave the EU.The prime minister has promised to hold an in/out referendum in 2017 if he wins the next general election, but Mr Afriyie said voters were "not convinced" that it would happen.He said he would push for a vote in October 2014 instead.But Home Secretary Theresa May warned that Mr Afriyie had "got it wrong".And a Downing Street spokesman said of Mr Afriyie's plan: "The PM will not let it stand."Mr Afriyie - who has denied newspaper claims he is being groomed to replace party leader David Cameron - said he would table an amendment to the European Union (Referendum) Bill on Monday.Mr Cameron has pledged to renegotiate the UK's relationship with the EU before an in/out referendum in 2017.But, speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics programme, Mr Afriyie said there would be "ample time" to conduct this renegotiation by as early as next year."By having a referendum in 2014, it gives us 12 months to renegotiate," he said. "But more than that, it kick-starts negotiations."EU member states would need to "accommodate" British demands for reforms "if they wish us to remain", he added.He argued: "I think it strengthens the prime minister's hand."The MP said 80% of people wanted a referendum, and more than 50% of people wanted a referendum this side of the election."British businesses need certainty," he said."Look, we can carry on kicking this can down the road forever."But I've had a struggle with my conscience over this one."I don't want to cause any trouble over it, but I think it's absolutely essential that Parliament and MPs have the opportunity to search their souls and to give people a referendum this side of the election."In an article for the Mail on Sunday, he predicted that - without a referendum before 2015 - "large numbers of people will continue to vote UKIP whatever happens - and if they do, there is a distinct danger that Labour will gain a majority and we will never see a referendum at all".UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he would be "absolutely delighted" if Britain could have an early referendum.He told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme on Sunday that a referendum before 2015 would be good for British industry and business."Adam Afriyie has put his finger on the real problem - and that's that four years ago, Mr Cameron gave us a cast-iron guarantee that there would be a referendum."This time last year, he was saying there would not be a referendum, and he is now saying there should be a referendum."People are not quite sure what to believe."But Mrs May, speaking on the same programme, said: "We need to be negotiating that settlement with the European Union and then put to the British people the Europe of the future - not the Europe of the past - and give them that opportunity to say in or out."What is crucial is that we have, at the next election, a Conservative party that will be offering people that renegotiation of a new settlement with Europe, looking to the future and then putting that to the British people in an in/out referendum."Backbench Conservative MP James Wharton is attempting to enshrine his party leadership's referendum pledge in law - without the support of coalition partners the Liberal Democrats - with his European Union (Referendum) Bill.As a private member's bill, it is vulnerable to being delayed by procedural tactics from MPs who oppose it, and will only become law if the government allocates enough parliamentary time for its proponents to overcome any such hurdles.Mrs May warned that Mr Afriyie's amendment to the bill could "jeopardise" its prospects entirely.And Mr Wharton told BBC Radio 5 live the amendment could "kill" his bill."My concern is that any amendment, no matter how well-meaning it might be, is going to make the progress of the bill more difficult and it'll make it easier for those MPs who want to use procedural techniques to slow it down and stop it... that bit more possible."I don't want to see that. I'd like to see my bill go through and I think this harms the chances of that happening."Liberal Democrat deputy leader Simon Hughes, whose party opposes a referendum on the EU unless further powers are handed from Westminster to Brussels, said a 2014 referendum would be a "barmy" distraction from the government's attempts to boost UK economic growth.Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said the Conservative leadership had scheduled a referendum in 2017 due to "internal party management as much as anything else".The PM's promise of a "grand, unilateral renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU" was "deeply flawed and bound to unravel", he added, in pre-released extracts of a speech to be delivered in London on Tuesday.The European Union (Referendum) Bill is due to return to the House of Commons for further debate on 8 November.</body>

      <title>Farage: I will stand as MP in 2015</title>
      <description>UKIP leader Nigel Farage confirms he is planning to stand as an MP at the next general election, due in 2015 - but does not say where.</description>

      <body>UKIP leader Nigel Farage has confirmed he is planning to stand as an MP at the next general election, due in 2015.Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, he insisted that the 2014 elections to the European Parliament were his main priority.But the UKIP leader revealed he had been considering a bid to become MP for Folkestone and Hythe.He also said he thought PM David Cameron and his cabinet colleagues regarded UKIP as "the lower orders".Mr Farage refused to be drawn on speculation that he would stand in another Kent constituency, South Thanet."I was thinking about Folkestone," he replied."But it doesn't really matter. I'm not going say where I'm standing. I'm not even going to think about where I'm standing."I am going to stand, but let's get the European elections out the way first."On the subject of whether there was likely to be any deal between UKIP and the Conservatives at the next general election, he said: "It's perfectly clear that Mr Cameron and the cabinet view us as being part of the lower orders, and we're really not good enough for them."He said he was "perfectly relaxed" about his party co-operating with the Conservatives at the local level, but he added: "I don't think it will happen."The current MP for Folkestone and Hythe, the Conservatives' Damian Collins won a 10,122-vote majority at the general election in 2010 on nearly 50% of the vote.The UKIP candidate won 4.6% of the vote, but in the May 2013 county council elections three UKIP members were voted in to represent Folkestone.Mr Farage explained his party's general election strategy: "We will target our resources where we won county council seats, where we won district council seats following the model that the Lib Dems used under Paddy Ashdown building on local strength."If you can win at council level, you can win at parliamentary level."Mr Collins took to Twitter to comment: "Nigel Farage says 'it doesn't really matter' whether he commits to stand to be an MP in Folkestone or Thanet."He's got no commitment."</body>

      <title>Burnham acts on 'cover-up slurs'</title>
      <description>Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham will not accept "slurs on his character" from his Conservative counterpart Jeremy Hunt, a Labour spokesman says.</description>

      <date>1381073754</date>
      <body>Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham will not accept "slurs on his character" from his Conservative counterpart Jeremy Hunt, a Labour spokesman has said.Mr Hunt had suggested on Twitter that Mr Burnham attempted to "cover up" NHS failings when he was in government.As a result, the Labour MP instructed his lawyers to write to the heath secretary, the spokesman confirmed.A Conservative spokesman described Mr Burnham's move as "astonishing".Labour believes that Mr Hunt's tweet was "a step too far" and is seeking a retraction and apology unless Mr Hunt can provide evidence to substantiate his allegation, BBC political correspondent Alan Soady said.The Labour spokesman said: "Instead of focusing on what he should be doing and tackling the AandE crisis, Jeremy Hunt has spent all year orchestrating a smear campaign against Andy Burnham. On Friday, he went a step too far."This is behaviour unbecoming of a secretary of state. Andy Burnham is not prepared to accept these unfounded slurs on his character and the last government. He has therefore instructed lawyers to act on his behalf."In response, a Conservative source told our correspondent: "It's astonishing that Labour are still trying to deny the clear link between [England's health watchdog] the CQC's decision not to expose poor hospital care under the last government and the political pressure applied to the CQC by Labour ministers."Mr Hunt's tweet is understood to relate to a CQC investigation into Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which was placed in "special measures" in July after recording above-average death rates.Conservative MP Steve Barclay has said a series of emails - which he obtained and published on Friday after making a freedom of information request to the CQC - showed that Mr Burnham had put "pressure on the regulator to water down its concerns" about the trust when he was health secretary under Labour.</body>

      <title>MP claims 3p for 100m car trip</title>
      <description>Former defence secretary Liam Fox successfully claimed 3p of taxpayers' money for a car journey of about 100 metres, expenses documents show.</description>

      <body>Former cabinet minister Liam Fox successfully claimed 3p of taxpayers' money for a car journey of about 100 metres, expenses documents show.Mr Fox's office made the claim after he travelled a distance recorded as 0.06 miles in October 2012.He had visited a concrete firm before heading within his north Somerset base to a constituency surgery in Yatton.The ex-defence secretary made another 15 claims of under £1 for car travel approved in 2012-13, the files showed.These included 24p for a 0.54-mile journey from a constituency surgery to a school competition in Clevedon, and 44p for a 0.98-mile journey from a local politics event at Winford Manor to Winford School.Under the current system, MPs can claim 45p per mile.MPs claimed a total of £23m in personal expenses in the year to April.Paperwork from the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) shows Mr Fox claimed £3,866.31 in travel expenses - including rail fares - in the last financial year.The claim for the car journey to Yatton was paid last December, according to the notes.Mr Fox told the Sunday People: "I don't do my expenses. My office does them. But they are all done according to the rules for travel distances."Last year, the Conservative MP had to repay £3,000 of expenses after it was found he had allowed his friend Adam Werritty to live at his taxpayer-funded second home for a year rent-free.He was also criticised for allowing their Atlantic Bridge think tank to be run from his parliamentary offices.Mr Fox resigned from his cabinet position in October 2011 over his relationship with Mr Werritty.</body>

      <title>Gove pressed over Muslim free school</title>
      <description>Labour asks the education secretary to explain what checks his department have carried out on the Al-Madinah Muslim free school.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24417085</url>
      <date>1381015587</date>
      <body>Michael Gove is coming under pressure to explain what checks his department carried out on a Muslim free school which has been closed since Tuesday.Al-Madinah, in Derby, cited "health and safety concerns" when it shut last week. It is due to reopen on Monday.But Labour called on the education secretary to "reassure the public" amid persistent concerns over the school.The Department for Education was already investigating allegations against the school, a spokesman said.Free schools - which can be opened by anyone - are state-funded but not overseen by the local authority.Al-Madinah says it has a "strong Muslim ethos" and when it opened last year claimed to be the first such school in the country for pupils from reception age to 16.Preliminary findings from an Ofsted inspection into the school gave it the lowest possible rating.The Department for Education had asked Ofsted to bring their inspection forward. Allegations had been made by parents and staff that pupils at Al-Madinah had been told to follow strict Islamic practices.Former staff have claimed non-Muslim female teachers came under pressure to wear the hijab head-scarf.It has also been reported that girls were made to sit at the back of class.The school denies pupils have been segregated and says its dress code was made clear to anyone wanting to work at the school.Sources have told the BBC the closure was due to incomplete records of child protection checks being done on all staff.But ahead of the school re-opening to pupils on Monday, shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said the situation must be "urgently clarified in order to reassure the public".In a letter to Mr Gove the Labour MP said: "This is, of course, not the first time that there have been questions surrounding your department's oversight of a free school."While I understand that there is an ongoing investigation, the reports concerning this school are of extreme concern to parents and the wider community."Given the confusion as to why the school has closed, and that pupils may be returning to the school on Monday, I would ask that these matters be clarified urgently in order to reassure the public."He called on the department to say what "due diligence" was carried out when the school was approved.And he asked whether there had been "appropriate vetting" of staff and what oversight ministers had had since it opened.Interim principal Stuart Wilson closed the school after Ofsted inspectors shared their preliminary findings with him."While unfortunate, my decision to close the school related to a short-term health and safety issue that has now been completely resolved and will not reoccur," a statement on the school's website read.The school "will be open as normal on Monday," Mr Wilson added.A Department for Education spokesman said: "We were already investigating this school before the allegations became public."We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection. We are waiting for Ofsted's final report and considering all legal options."Mr Twigg also questioned what would happen to children at the school if it did not reopen on Monday or had to close again.</body>

      <title>Union anger at health pay proposal</title>
      <description>Unions criticise government moves to halt a 1% pay rise for all NHS staff in England, arguing they deserve to be rewarded for holding the health service together.</description>

      <date>1380991958</date>
      <body>Unions have criticised government moves to halt a 1% pay rise for all NHS staff in England.The Department of Health said the increase was unaffordable alongside the current system which sees many staff automatically receive incremental annual rises.It has urged the NHS pay review body to withhold the rise for 1.3m staff.Rachael Maskell, of the Unite trade union, said staff deserved the pay reward for "holding the NHS together".Health trusts are currently under pressure to make savings and the NHS wage bill accounts for around 40% of its budget.All public sector pay increases are capped at 1%.The Department of Health (DoH) proposes using the funding intended for the rise to "modernise" pay structures.It says automatic increments - linked to length of service and satisfactory performance - add £900m to salary costs.The DoH has stressed no decisions on changes to pay have been taken, insisting independent bodies will make their recommendations in February or March next year.But the plans, outlined in the DoH's submission to two independent pay review bodies, have been criticised by Unite and Labour.Ms Maskell, of Unite, said: "The Department of Health have got other choices. They're entering into a reorganisation which is costing £3bn, which nobody asked for and isn't adding anything to patient care."It is about choices and the NHS staff have already had two years of a pay freeze - 1% last year - and, quite frankly, are really falling behind inflation now with their wages."Staff moraleShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme motivation and morale was down among frontline health workers "at this very difficult time".However, in its submission the DoH points to a staff survey suggesting high levels of motivation and morale and says there should only be basic pay increases if there is "strong evidence" recruitment, retention, morale or motivation issues require this.Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the NHS reorganisation had taken money out of front-line services."There has to be pay restraint in the NHS as well as other public services... but the NHS has been through some very difficult years - so have NHS staff - and this was a modest increase to recognise the pressure that all families are under."To take it away, to break that promise, is just another kick in the teeth."Staff representatives have also reacted angrily to the plans."What they have done is inflammatory," said Christina McAnea, head of health at Unison and joint chairwoman of the NHS Staff Council."We are not going to negotiate while a gun is held to our head for a paltry 1% pay rise - our members will not react well to that."Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association council said this would not result in staff leaving in their "droves".However he added: "We're going to find it increasingly hard to recruit, partly for the specialist skills and partly for the numbers of staff that we'd need to bring into the health service to implement the safe minimum staffing levels."Health minister Anna Soubry defended the government 's stance telling the BBC: "This is about making sure we pay our NHS staff well and we reward their improvement in skills."This system works in other public sectors and the private sector. People want to make sure that they are getting good quality, first class services especially at a time when the NHS faces challenges."Earlier a DoH spokeswoman said: "Many NHS staff have continued to receive pay rises of up to 3.5% and we want to keep working with the trade unions and employers on affordable pay."The measures we are proposing will help increase quality for patients and help us realise our vision of an affordable seven-day service."In June Chancellor George Osborne said ministers were working to "remove automatic pay rises" for teachers, health professionals, prison and police staff.The DoH drew attention to Mr Osborne's comments and confirmed it wanted NHS pay to have "stronger links to performance, quality and productivity".</body>

      <title>Rail minister Burns stands down</title>
      <description>Transport Minister Simon Burns resigns from the government to run for the position of deputy Commons Speaker.</description>

      <date>1380897834</date>
      <body>Transport Minister Simon Burns has resigned from the government to run for the position of deputy Commons Speaker.The MP for Chelmsford has been responsible for the controversial HS2 rail link during the past year, having previously been a health minister.One of the three deputy Speaker positions is vacant after previous incumbent Nigel Evans stood down to fight sexual assault charges.Mr Burns has clashed with Speaker John Bercow several times in the past.On one occasion, Mr Burns described the man under whom he now seeks to serve as a "stupid sanctimonious dwarf".BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said the Conservative MP had apologised afterwards - but only to groups of people who felt insulted, not necessarily to the Speaker himself.Were he to be elected, relations between the pair would not be altogether comfortable, our correspondent added.There are plenty of Conservatives who do not support Mr Bercow and might vote for Mr Burns just to irritate him, he continued.MPs are elected to the role of deputy Speaker, under reforms proposed by Mr Bercow shortly after he took on his role in 2009.To stand for election, MPs need to be sponsored by at least six other MPs.One of the other candidates for the role is Nadine Dorries, who in 2009 described the Speaker as "oily" and suggested he was "mistrusted by up to half of the House".Conservative backbenchers Eleanor Laing and Brian Binley have also been named as potential candidates.The successful applicant will join existing deputies, former Labour MPs Dawn Primarolo and Lindsay Hoyle, in helping to chair Commons business.Mr Burns' decision comes ahead of an expected reshuffle of middle-ranking Conservative ministerial ranks in coming weeks.In his resignation letter to Prime Minister David Cameron, he wrote: "It has been a privilege to serve in your administration for the past three and a quarter years and I will be forever grateful to you for giving me that opportunity in both the Departments of Health and Transport."You can rest assured that I will continue to support your leadership of both the Conservative Party and the government."The PM's response described the MP as a "loyal, dedicated and committed colleague".Mr Cameron said: "I know that this will not have been an easy decision for you to make, and one you will have given a huge amount of thought to."After serving the government so ably for over three years, you will certainly be missed, but I completely understand and respect your decision."</body>

      <title>Child benefit deadline day looms</title>
      <description>A tax boss says nearly 200,000 parents must "get off their backsides" and register with the UK tax authority amid changes to child benefit.</description>

      <body>A tax boss has said nearly 200,000 parents must "get off their backsides" and register with the UK tax authority amid changes to child benefit.Saturday marks the first deadline for better-off families to sign up with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).They will need to register for self-assessment so the HMRC can claw some or all of the benefit back.Families where one parent has a taxable income of more than £50,000 are affected.They will lose some of the benefit, following the introduction of the new rules in January 2013, while child benefit has been withdrawn entirely if one parent earns more than £60,000.Eligible families receive £20.30 per week in child benefit for their first child and £13.40 a week for any further children.The new rules meant that this payment is reduced gradually for families where one parent is earning between £50,000 and £60,000.HMRC has written to people who it believes have a taxable income of more than £50,000 and so need to take some action. Taxable income is earnings from employment, as well as other income such as from savings and shares, but may not include some pension contributions.Lin Homer, HMRC chief executive, told BBC Radio 5 Live: "We think there is about 200,000 people who need to get off their backsides and do something."Some 350,000 people have opted out of receiving child benefit altogether, generally because they earn and will continue to earn a taxable income of more than £60,000 and therefore would not be entitled to the payment.HMRC says another 425,000 people were already in self-assessment, some 140,000 people have registered for self-assessment, and another 185,000 people have still to register.In theory, the deadline to register and avoid a possible penalty is 5 October. The penalty would be between 10% and 100% of the child benefit paid.However, HMRC says it is unlikely that anyone who registers and pays the tax by 31 January would be penalised."HMRC is committed to helping people pay the right amount of tax and urges parents who have been affected by the changes to child benefit to register for self-assessment," said Ms Homer."We know that lots of people leave it until the last minute."Anita Monteith, of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, said: "This adds considerable complication to the tax system for ordinary people, particularly for those brought into the self-assessment system for the first time."I would urge those affected to register for self-assessment as soon as they can."</body>

      <title>Mail's position unravelling - Labour</title>
      <description>Labour says the Daily Mail's stance is unravelling after a senior journalist said an article about Ed Miliband's father was "wrongly labelled".</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24395790</url>
      <date>1380915514</date>
      <body>Labour has said the Daily Mail's stance is unravelling after a top journalist said an article about Ed Miliband's father was "wrongly labelled".Alex Brummer, the Mail's City editor, told Channel 4 News it should have been made clearer it was a comment article.The paper has refused to apologise for a piece calling Marxist academic Ralph Miliband "The man who hated Britain" - and said its position had not changed.A Labour spokesman said the Daily Mail's defence was "crumbling".Mr Brummer's comments are the first time anyone from the Mail has suggested there might be a problem with the article.He said: "Sometimes articles which are comment should be labelled and made clear that they are comment."So perhaps it should have said 'comment' on it to make clear absolutely it was comment instead of a special report."But I think people understood that it wasn't just reporting; there was an element of commentary to it. Just maybe the labelling wasn't quite what it should have been."Labour said it showed that the Mail's strategy was unravelling piece by piece."Six days on from their original article, the Daily Mail's defence is crumbling," said the spokesman."For the first time, they have been forced to admit significant problems in the way they dealt with the article 'The man who hated Britain'."They should now finally have the good grace and decency to acknowledge their grotesque error of judgment and apologise."Earlier Mr Brummer told the BBC the Daily Mail would not say sorry to the Labour leader - and said the paper was owed an apology over claims that its Ralph Miliband articles were motivated by anti-Semitism.Mr Miliband sought to distance himself from the anti-Semitism claims.But he renewed his demand for the paper's owner Lord Rothermere to investigate its culture and practices.Lord Rothermere has apologised to Mr Miliband for a Mail on Sunday reporter intruding on a family memorial service.But he stopped short of saying sorry for the Ralph Miliband article or agreeing to a wider inquiry into the way his newspapers operate.Appearing on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Brummer strongly defended the Daily Mail's original article which questioned how far Ralph Miliband's left-wing views had influenced his son.He said: "I don't think we need to apologise for anything. This was a piece which examined somebody's views very carefully."He hit out at suggestions from the Jewish Chronicle, some Labour figures and others that there may have been "a whiff of anti-Semitism" about the coverage."I think there are people out there who need to apologise to us because there have been vicious accusations in the last couple of days, from (former Labour leader) Neil Kinnock among others, that somehow this was an anti-Semitic attack," he said.Mr Miliband told BBC Radio 5Live he was not suggesting the paper was anti-Semitic."I'm always incredibly careful about throwing around the idea that the paper or somebody is anti-Semitic or racist unless there is real evidence for that," he said."I don't believe that of the Mail; that's not been my issue."He said that while the newspaper was entitled to hold him to account for his views, the way it had attacked his father was unacceptable."They'll criticise me, they'll say my policies are wrong, that's absolutely fine. But when it comes to my dad, and saying my dad hated Britain, I'm afraid they're crossing a line," he said."In all of this, they've never apologised for the fact they said my dad hated Britain - an idea without any foundation."While acknowledging the Daily Mail - which has a circulation of more than 1.8 million - was a "popular" newspaper, he suggested many of its readers agreed with him that it had "overstepped the mark".Mail on Sunday editor Geordie Greig said a reporter had been sent to a memorial service for Mr Miliband's uncle without his knowledge and an investigation was being held into "a decision which was wrong".Mr Miliband told 5Live he had met the Daily Mail's editor Paul Dacre "two or three times" since becoming Labour leader.Mr Brummer defended the Mail's journalistic methods, saying it was "extraordinarily careful" about how it pursued a story.He said: "I hear the editor, I hear the deputy editor almost every day saying to reporters, saying to editors of their sections 'be careful how you go about getting a particular story'."That's a practice which goes to the core of the paper, and I do think there are some good ethical roots in the paper and this is the exception rather than the rule."The row comes ahead of a crucial meeting of MPs next Wednesday on press regulation.They will consider rival proposals for a new regulator to replace the Press Complaints Commission.Mr Miliband, along with the three main political parties and press intrusion victims campaign group Hacked Off, supports a form of press regulation backed by royal charter.The newspaper industry, among them the country's largest newspaper groups, including Mail publisher DMG Media, News UK, owner of the Sun and the Times, Telegraph Media Group and Trinity Mirror, have put forward a rival plan rejecting "state-sponsored regulation".A member of Lord Justice Leveson's inquiry team into press practices expressed concern that Mr Miliband's row with the Mail could be used as "a cudgel to try to beat the press" and push through tighter regulation.Former Daily Telegraph political editor George Jones said: "We were quite clear in those discussions that we did not want to get into the question of taste, we didn't want to be arbiters of what was in good taste and what was in bad taste."In my view, once you go down that road you do seriously compromise freedom of speech."</body>

      <body>The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) says it has received all the evidence about the "plebgate" row and will decide if charges should be brought.Eight people have been bailed in the inquiry following a row involving ex-government chief whip Andrew Mitchell.Mr Mitchell apologised for not treating police officers with respect during the incident at Downing Street's main gate in September 2012.But he denies newspaper claims that he called police "plebs".Five police officers are among those arrested as part of Operation Alice, which is the investigation into alleged misconduct as well as the unauthorised leaking of information to newspapers about the incident, after which the Conservative MP quit the cabinet.Mr Mitchell was accused of launching a foul-mouthed tirade at officers guarding Downing Street when he was asked not to take his bike through the street's main gates.MPs from across the political spectrum - including former Home Secretary Jack Straw - have criticised how long the investigation has taken.On Friday the Metropolitan Police said that it handed its first file of evidence to the CPS on 28 March, but three pieces of information were subsequently added.The Met said the "final lines of inquiry have now been completed" and that a copy of the file of evidence had been passed to the Independent Police Complaints Commissions.A CPS spokesman said: "We have now received all of the outstanding evidence in this case and are now considering the file to determine whether charges should be brought.""We aim to make a decision as soon as is reasonably possible."In an interview on Friday with the BBC's Sunday Politics West Midlands, Mr Mitchell said it had been "an extraordinarily difficult year" that had "taken a very considerable toll on my family and on me"."But I've been getting on with looking after my constituents in Sutton Coldfield and I'd like to express my deep gratitude to them and my many friends who've given me such trenchant support throughout this difficult time," he added in the interview, which was recorded prior to the CPS' announcement.</body>

      <title>Ken Clarke aims to continue as MP</title>
      <description>Conservative MP and cabinet minister Ken Clarke announces that he plans to stand again at the next general election, due in 2015.</description>

      <body>Conservative MP and cabinet minister Ken Clarke has announced that he plans to stand again at the next general election, which is due in 2015.In an interview with BBC political editor, East Midlands, John Hess, Mr Clarke also said he "hopes" to retain a place in Prime Minister David Cameron's top ministerial team."But sooner or later, I'm sure he'll ask me to retire," he added.The minister without portfolio and MP for Rushcliffe will be 74 in May 2015."I get on very well with David," he added."He's had me in the government for three and a half years, which is much longer than I expected."Mr Clarke continued: "He may have me there for the rest of this Parliament. But prime ministers need to accommodate young thrusting, ambitious men, as I used to be many decades ago."Sometimes, as prime minister, you have to cough gently and ask your colleagues to retire. I hope he'll keep me for as long as I can contribute."Ken Clarke returned to government when David Cameron entered Downing Street after the 2010 general election.The then justice secretary and lord chancellor said the coalition had brought out his "inner liberal".The justice portfolio and lord chancellorship have since been handed to Chris Grayling, but Mr Clarke retains his membership of the cabinet.Our correspondent John Hess predicted that if the Conservatives win the 2015 election, Mr Clarke would want to play a key pro-Europe role in any ensuing EU referendum campaign on UK membership.Mr Clarke was first elected Rushcliffe MP in 1970, a keen supporter of the pro-European, "one-nation" Prime Minister Edward Heath.Within two years of his election he was an assistant whip, rising to whip and then becoming a junior spokesman on the opposition benches.In 1988 he entered the cabinet as health secretary, with the job of driving through controversial and far-reaching reforms of the NHS, including the internal market.When John Major became leader in 1990 he moved Mr Clarke to education and later the Home Office.After the disastrous events of Black Wednesday, the decision to leave the European exchange rate mechanism and eight months later the resignation of Norman Lamont, Mr Clarke was made chancellor.He has run for the leadership of the Conservative party three times: in 1997, 2001 and 2005.</body>

      <title>Plans to curtail early jail release</title>
      <description>People jailed for a range of serious offences in England and Wales will lose their automatic right to early release, under government proposals.</description>

      <body>People jailed for child rape or some terror offences will no longer be automatically released from jail halfway through their sentences, under government plans for England and Wales.Justice Secretary Chris Grayling says he also wants to curtail the early release of prisoners serving extended sentences for the most serious crimes.About 600 prisoners a year are expected to be affected by the proposals.Campaigners warned of the likely impact on an "over-burdened" Parole Board.Under rules created in 2003, most prisoners serving fixed-term sentences are eligible for release on a conditional licence into the community at the halfway point of their sentence, unless they have been guilty of poor behaviour in jail.Others jailed for the most serious crimes are subjected to an extended determinate sentence (EDS), which means they are released on licence only after serving two-thirds of it.Under the new proposals, neither people serving an EDS - a system devised just over a year ago - or those convicted of child rape nor a range of terrorism offences would be automatically released on licence.Instead they would have to prove to the Parole Board that they were no longer dangerous and a risk to society before they could be freed.The Ministry of Justice said the proposals would require primary legislation that would go before Parliament in the new year.Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: "It's outrageous that offenders who commit some truly horrific crimes in this country are automatically released from prison halfway through their custodial sentence, regardless of their behaviour, attitude and engagement in their own rehabilitation."We need to teach criminals a lesson; you will be punished for your crime and you must earn your release, it is not an automatic right."In a statement, the Parole Board said that it supported "a more consistent approach to release arrangements" for the offenders who would be covered by the changes.It added: "Protecting the public is the primary concern of the Parole Board and any measures that ensure offenders are only released from custody following a rigorous assessment of risk are welcomed."But Andrew Neilson, of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: "Today's announcement may grab headlines but it will not make the public safer."When prisoners are released early, they do at least receive supervision from the probation service for the remainder of their sentence, with the threat of recall to prison always present."We fear this move will only serve to further clog up the Parole Board, which is already under-resourced and over-burdened."The terrorist offences covered by the changes include directing a terrorist organisation, inciting terrorism overseas and use of a nuclear weapon.</body>

      <body>A trial date has been set for ex-Commons deputy speaker Nigel Evans MP to face sex offence charges.Mr Evans has been accused of two counts of indecent assault, five of sexual assault, and one of rape against seven male alleged victims.A provisional trial date of 10 March next year was set for the 55-year-old MP by Preston Crown Court.Mr Evans was bailed and is due to appear next at Preston Crown Court on 24 January.The indecent assaults are alleged to have been committed between 1 January 2002 and 1 January 2004, the sexual assaults allegedly between 1 January 2009 and 1 April 2013, and the alleged rape between 29 March and 1 April 2013.The MP for Ribble Valley in Lancashire resigned as deputy speaker of the House of Commons after being charged in September.Mr Evans was a Conservative MP before becoming deputy speaker, a politically neutral role, but he has not sought to return to the Conservative fold in the Commons and will continue to represent his constituents as an independent.He has been MP for the Ribble Valley constituency since 1992.</body>

      <title>Energy price freeze 'will happen'</title>
      <description>Labour leader Ed Miliband says he is "absolutely clear" that energy bills will be frozen if his party wins the next general election.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24396400</url>
      <date>1380878080</date>
      <body>Labour leader Ed Miliband has said he is "absolutely clear" that energy bills will be frozen if his party wins the next general election."We are absolutely confident because we've done all the figures, we've looked at all of the issues," he told the BBC's Breakfast programme.He repeated his accusation that energy companies have been over-charging businesses and consumers.Critics have warned that the plan could put future energy supplies at risk.But Mr Miliband claimed that energy companies were "unreliable witnesses" in the debate: "They're the people who would say that anyway.""There's a cost-of-living crisis in this country. Energy bills are a big part of it," he said."For too long the companies have been able to over-charge people. Somebody's got to stand up and be counted."That's why we'll freeze energy bills until the beginning of 2017 if we win the election. That will benefit 1.5 million businesses across our country, make a big difference to them."The policy was unveiled at the party's annual conference last week, and has faced strong criticism about its feasibility and the effect it would have on investment in energy infrastructure.But Mr Miliband continued: "Even if wholesale prices rise, this freeze is going to happen. I want to be absolutely clear about this."We're absolutely confident the companies can stomach this, can make this happen, and we're going to make this happen."He again dismissed predictions that energy companies might try to "collude" and hike prices before the election."If they try and do that, that is illegal," he said, "they can't do that."Labour has also released figures suggesting that British business could save £1.5bn if the price freeze came into force.The party said the estimate was based on research by the House of Commons Library.Meanwhile, two energy companies, EDF and First Utility, have unveiled plans to freeze current prices voluntarily.EDF Energy unveiled a new tariff that fixes bills until 2017, and First Utility said its current variable tariff would be frozen until March 2014.The former head of the UK's competition watchdog, John Fingleton, has suggested Labour's price-freeze policy was unlikely to work."In the long term [it] will harm consumers, and taking political responsibility for prices you cannot ultimately control is quite risky," he said earlier this month.The Conservatives have accused Labour of "bashing business" and insisted action was already being taken to ensure customers are on the cheapest tariff.Energy UK, the trade body representing the six largest energy firms, said the move could push up prices across the board and threaten the 600,000 people employed in the industry.</body>

      <body>A Labour parliamentary candidate has stood down after it emerged she owed more than £2,000 in parking fines and late payment fees.Josie Channer accrued the penalties in the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham, where she is a councillor on a committee overseeing parking issues.She was campaigning to win the Kingswood seat near Bristol.In a statement she expressed "regret" that she could not "devote the time and resources necessary" to the campaign."It has been fantastic getting to know the residents of Kingswood and the local party members."I wish them well as they continue to fight for the Labour victory Kingswood deserves and needs in 2015," she said.Conservative-held Kingswood is a key marginal seat and one of Labour's top targets for the next General Election.The area's current MP, Chris Skidmore, said the issue was no reason for Ms Channer to "desert Kingswood"."While this is embarrassing for Labour, I think Josie Channer should reconsider her resignation," he said."It looks bad for Labour members locally who chose Josie as their preferred candidate if she is just going to walk away from Kingswood like this."Local people will be disappointed that their Labour candidate is prepared to give up on Kingswood so easily."Ms Channer, who serves on Barking and Dagenham Council's living and working select committee, was fined 10 times over three years.She said she believed the charges had been dealt with previously."Last year I learned that the charges were still live and had incurred late payment fees so I have contacted the council and agreed a repayment plan to pay off the fine," she said.Barking and Dagenham Council confirmed that Ms Channer did have outstanding parking fines and fees.Kevin Beazer, the regional secretary of the Communication Workers Union, campaigned for Labour's second-placed candidate in Kingswood, Rowena Hayward.He said: "I think questions have got to be asked about when a candidate's selected, if there is anything untoward that is going to come forward."It's unfortunate... but it has happened and people will need to move on, hopefully very swiftly, so we can get a candidate in place that tackles the Tory (Chris Skidmore MP) in Kingswood."</body>

      <title>Examine Mail culture, Miliband urges</title>
      <description>Labour leader Ed Miliband urges Lord Rothermere, owner of the Mail newspaper titles, to take a "long, hard look" at the way they are run.</description>

      <date>1380878608</date>
      <body>Newspaper owner Lord Rothermere must take a "long, hard look" at the "culture and practices" of his Mail titles, Ed Miliband has said.The proprietor has apologised to Mr Miliband for a Mail on Sunday reporter intruding on a family memorial service.The Labour leader told BBC Radio 5Live the apology was an "important step" but that he did not think his treatment was an isolated incident.Mr Miliband said he wanted to know "how these practices are allowed to happen".Last weekend, a Daily Mail article labelled Ralph Miliband, a Marxist academic who died in 1994, "the man who hated Britain".That prompted Mr Miliband to complain about his father being "smeared", but although the newspaper offered him a right of reply, it has continued to defend its coverage.In a separate incident on Thursday, the Mail on Sunday suspended two of its journalists after it emerged the paper had gate-crashed a service for the Labour leader's uncle, at which they pressed the family for reaction to the original Daily Mail article.Mr Miliband told 5Live Breakfast that Lord Rothermere "has a responsibility to take a long hard look" at the way his papers are run after the intrusion.He said: "I hope what Lord Rothermere will do is look at the wider culture and practices at the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday because I don't think it's an isolated incident."I'm interested in other families, not in public life, who've had similar experiences."Mr Miliband said he expected the papers to criticise him and his policies but that they had "crossed a line" by accusing his father of hating Britain.While acknowledging the Daily Mail - which has a circulation of more than 1.8 million - was a "popular" newspaper, he suggested many of its readers agreed with him that it had "overstepped the mark".But he said he did not agree with the Jewish Chronicle's suggestion that there was "a whiff of anti-semitism" about the Daily Mail's Ralph Miliband articles.Mail on Sunday editor Geordie Greig said the reporter had been sent without his knowledge and an investigation was being held into "a decision which was wrong".Both he and Lord Rothermere apologised "unreservedly", with the peer also writing to Mr Miliband.Neither Labour nor the Daily Mail and General Trust - the papers' parent company - have released the text of Lord Rothermere's response to Mr Miliband.Mr Miliband told 5Live he has met the Daily Mail's editor Paul Dacre "two or three times" since becoming Labour leader.He said: "My personal dealings with him have been absolutely professional. Sometimes we've disagreed about issues. We've disagreed about press standards but sometimes we've agreed on some issues."The row comes days before a crucial meeting of MPs next Wednesday on press regulation.They will consider proposals for a press royal charter with a new regulator to replace the Press Complaints Commission.The plan is backed by the country's largest newspaper groups, including Mail publisher DMG Media, News UK, who own the Sun and the Times, Telegraph Media Group and Trinity Mirror.Mr Miliband supports an alternative plan, backed by the three main political parties and press intrusion victims campaign group Hacked Off, for a form of press regulation backed by royal charter.A senior Mail executive has defended the paper's journalistic methods, saying it was "extraordinarily careful" about how it pursued a story."I hear the the editor, I hear the deputy editor almost every day saying to reporters, saying to editors of their sections 'be careful how you go about getting a particular story'," City Editor Alex Brummer told Radio 4's Today."That's a practice which goes to the core of the paper, and I do think there are some good ethical roots in the paper and this is the exception rather than the rule," he added.On Thursday's Question Time on BBC One, the Daily Mail's political sketch writer Quentin Letts defended its original reporting of the views of Ralph Miliband, a Jewish refugee who fled Belgium aged 16 to escape the Nazis and who served in the Royal Navy during WWII.Mr Letts described the socialist academic as a "useful idiot" for "people that were promoting Marxism" during the Cold War.Mr Letts added that Ralph Miliband had been "furious that we won the Falklands War. He wanted us to lose the Falklands War."Is that the behaviour of a man who loves his country? I'm not sure it is."However, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, praising Ralph Miliband's military record, told the programme: "People who haven't served their country and fought for their country should really think before deciding that they have a monopoly on determining British values."Meanwhile Ralph Miliband's biographer, Michael Newman, said the late academic "wanted a different kind of Britain" but "wasn't against Britain".</body>

      <title>Rogue investigators' clients probed</title>
      <description>Nineteen clients of rogue private eyes are to be investigated for illegal activity, the Information Commissioner's Office confirms</description>

      <date>1380836614</date>
      <body>Nineteen clients of rogue private eyes are to be investigated for illegal activity, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has said.Five retailers and four law firms are among those suspected of commissioning the illegal gathering of information.Information Commissioner Christopher Graham said in a letter to Keith Vaz MP that there were 125 alleged victims of illegal activity.Mr Graham had previously asked MPs not to publish a list of the clients.In his letter to Mr Vaz, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs select committee, he says there is a "continued need for the committee not to take any further steps to publish the details of clients" in order to "avoid compromising" any strands of his investigation.Mr Graham's office was initially handed a list of 98 clients of allegedly corrupt private detectives by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca).He told Mr Vaz in the letter that, as well as the retailers and legal firms, three insurance companies, two financial businesses, a construction firm and a security company were being investigated, as were three further private investigators.He said the allegations related to the period 2001-2009Soca passed the names of 102 firms and individuals who had allegedly used corrupt private investigators to the select committee earlier this year.But Soca's stipulation that the names must remain confidential sparked a row over transparency.The so-called "blue-chip hacking" list was drawn up at the request of the committee and related to Soca's Operation Millipede, which led to the conviction of four private detectives for fraud last year.Following a heated evidence session last month, Mr Vaz told Soca chiefs that the committee would publish the list if Soca did not do so first.He said it was in the public interest to publish the names, which include law firms and celebrities, but Soca has consistently refused to release the document.The ICO analysed the information between 3 September and 23 September.On Thursday, Mr Vaz said: "The commissioner has kept his promise to Parliament and provided the information requested promptly and efficiently."I am, however, baffled that for over four years Soca failed to conduct a scoping exercise which has taken the ICO only two weeks to complete."He added that "the most concerning outcome is that 12 of the remaining clients are now inactive which calls into question whether the delay has allowed illegal activity to go unpunished".Eight more clients could also be added to the inquiry, says BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds.They were part of a trial which resulted in the convictions of the four private investigators at Kingston Crown Court last year.The ICO said the evidence in those cases had already been assessed by the Crown Prosecution Service, and they may also face further investigation.Mr Graham is due to appear before the committee on 8 October to provide it with more information.</body>

      <title>GCHQ attack claim 'must be examined'</title>
      <description>The European Parliament is right to investigate claims that Britain's spy agency GCHQ launched a cyber attack on a Belgian telecommunications company, a Labour MEP says.</description>

      <body>The European Parliament is right to probe claims that UK spy agency GCHQ launched a cyber attack on a Belgian telecom firm, a British MEP says.Allegations GCHQ attempted to hack into Belgacom - whose customers include the EU offices in Brussels - were revealed in documents leaked by Edward Snowden.Labour's Claude Moraes said it was "only natural" there was an inquiry.Britain said the EU did not have the power to investigate. GCHQ says it works within a strict legal framework.The head of GCHQ, Sir Iain Lobban, did not turn up to give evidence at Thursday's European Parliamentary Inquiry, which is tasked with investigating the extent of the alleged electronic mass surveillance of EU citizens.Representatives from Belgacom, which provides internet services and telecommunications across Belgium including to the EU and its institutions, did attend Thursday's inquiry.Geert Stadaert, vice president of the firm, told the inquiry its experts "sounded the alarm about anomalies in Belgacom's networks" in June.The company said it had discovered malicious software in its systems.Mr Stadaert said Belgacom had no information about the perpetrator or the motive.But German magazine Der Spiegel reported that documents provided by former US defence contractor Edward Snowden contained details of "Operation Socialist" - GCHQ's alleged code name for an attack on Belgacom's systems.Der Spiegel said the aim of the alleged operation was to enable Cheltenham-based GCHQ to launch "Man in the Middle" attacks.These could have enabled it to intercept communications between two parties, read and potentially change them without either side realising.A spokesperson for the intelligence agency said it would not comment on media stories about leaks or on intelligence matters.Mr Moraes, MEP for London, said: "In every member state, including the United Kingdom, MPs and representatives are being asked to investigate these allegations and it's only natural that in the European Parliament that happens as well."You have allegations of the UK spying on Belgian telephone systems which were part of infrastructure for the European Union."I think that's quite an unusual allegation and of course it can't just stand, it has to be investigated."Belgacom has passed its information onto the Belgian prosecutor who is investigating.Mr Snowden sought asylum in Russia after disclosing classified documents to the Guardian newspaper revealing details of US surveillance activities.</body>

      <body>Blind and partially sighted people are often reluctant to leave home because of the "dreadful" state of Britain's pavements, a survey suggests.Guide Dogs UK asked more than 750 blind or visually impaired people and found almost two-thirds had tripped or stumbled while walking.The charity said two out of five feared going out because of damaged surfaces, leaving them "trapped" at home.Councils said they were "committed" to ensuring pavements were "safe to use".Guide Dogs said UK councils had spent more than £46m in compensation since 2009 for injuries to pedestrians relating to poorly-maintained pavements.It called for dangerous pavements to be prioritised.Chief executive Richard Leaman said: "Guide Dogs is determined to help people with sight loss get out independently and with confidence, but this is being undermined by the dreadful state of our pavements."Councils must prioritise dangerous pavements if blind and partially sighted people, as well as people with other disabilities, are to have the same freedom as everyone else."He went on: "For many, it can be the difference between being able to set out with confidence or being trapped at home."The research also highlighted problems with advertising boards, wheelie bins and badly parked cars.Guide Dogs is calling for new laws to prohibit parking on pavements other than in specific areas permitted by local authorities.A spokesperson for the Local Government Association said: "Councils know that the condition of pavements is a key priority for residents and are committed to making sure they are safe to use by all pedestrians."The fact that pavement maintenance spending has remained at more or less the same level in the face of cuts in local government funding that will reach 43% by 2015 is proof of that commitment."The deterioration of our roads and pavements is down to decades of underfunding from successive governments, recent severe winters and widespread flooding."Councils want to bring them fully up to scratch but need a fairer funding deal and greater government investment to allow this to happen."</body>

      <title>Tories may cut under-25s' benefits</title>
      <description>David Cameron suggests that out-of-work benefits paid to people under the age of 25 could be cut so all of them are either "earning or learning".</description>

      <date>1380745590</date>
      <body>David Cameron has suggested benefits paid to people under the age of 25 could be cut in an effort to reduce long-term worklessness.In his speech to the Conservative conference, the prime minister promised to "nag and push and guide" young people away from a life on the dole.It was later confirmed that the government is reviewing policies for 16 to 25-year-olds.But Labour accused the Conservatives of a "desperate" lack of ideas.In his speech, Mr Cameron promised to create a "land of opportunity" by boosting business and reducing reliance on benefits.He also vowed to improve the education system and told party activists that there was still much work to do to fix the economic "mess" left by Labour.The latest figures from the Department of Work and Pensions showed 1.09 million people between the ages of 16 and 24 were not in work, education or training.The problem has proved stubbornly hard to tackle across Europe, with rates of youth unemployment soaring above 50% in Spain.Mr Cameron argued that action was needed in the UK, saying: "There are still over a million young people not in education, employment, or training."Today it is still possible to leave school, sign on, find a flat, start claiming housing benefit and opt for a life on benefits. It's time for bold action here."He promised the Conservatives would consider, as they write their manifesto for the 2015 general election, whether "that option should really exist at all".A Conservative source has told the BBC the manifesto will definitely contain a commitment to end the automatic entitlement to housing benefit for the under-25s, as suggested previously by Mr Cameron.In his speech, the prime minister criticised reliance on benefits, saying: "Instead we should give young people a clear, positive choice: Go to school. Go to college. Do an apprenticeship. Get a job."But just choose the dole? We've got to offer them something better than that."He added: "And let no one paint ideas like this as callous. Think about it: with your children, would you dream of just leaving them to their own devices, not getting a job, not training, nothing?"No - you'd nag and push and guide and do anything to get them on their way… and so must we. So this is what we want to see: everyone under 25 - earning or learning."During the week-long conference in Manchester, the Conservatives have announced plans to make the long-term unemployed undertake work placements if they want to continue receiving benefits.Mr Cameron did not set out any specific changes regarding under-25s during his 50-minute speech, but Education Secretary Michael Gove offered more detail when questioned on BBC Radio 4's The World at One.He announced that Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood was already reviewing the policies in place. He is expected to report his findings by the end of the year.Mr Gove said: "It is always going to be the case that there are some people for whom you need not so much a nudge as a dunt (a firm blow or stroke) towards the workplace."It's important also that we all recognise that welfare is there explicitly to help those people through hard times that it shouldn't become habituated."He said he would not pre-empt the policy review, adding: "I don't think any of us would want to take away any form of necessary support to young or old vulnerable people."However, unions warned that any cut in benefits would hurt the worst-off.TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: "Given the government's awful track record of helping young people find jobs, the prime minister's threat to ban the dole for under-25s will simply push hundreds of thousands of young people, including those with young families, even deeper into poverty."Young people suffered most in the recession. Today the prime minister has pledged that they will suffer most during the recovery too."The general secretary of the University and College Union, Sally Hunt, said: "What we need is a real plan at local and national level which provides sustainable and secure employment opportunities for young people and access to education which is useful and mind-broadening."Cheap headlines about lazy youngsters or cutting their benefits are no substitute for a strategy which is on the side of young people and allows them to realise their potential."A Labour spokesperson said: "This is an empty and a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that there was absolutely nothing in David Cameron's speech to deal with the cost-of-living crisis facing families."If the Conservatives really wanted to get young people off benefits, they'd be backing Labour's youth jobs guarantee, giving young people who've been out of work for over a year a job they must take or lose benefits."</body>

      <title>The land of hope is Tory - Cameron</title>
      <description>David Cameron says the Tories are the party of "the many, not the few" in a conference speech also trailing possible benefit cuts for young people.</description>

      <body>David Cameron vowed to get behind business to create a "land of opportunity for all", in his big speech to close the Conservative conference.His 50-minute address sought to set out dividing lines with "the 1970s-style socialism" he said Labour now offered.He claimed the economy was "turning the corner" and the "land of hope is Tory", while "the land of despair was Labour".Mr Cameron also hinted that benefits for under-25s could be cut in an effort to get more young people into work.But Labour said the prime minister had failed to address the "cost-of-living crisis" and offered a land of opportunity "for just a privileged few".During the 50-minute speech, Mr Cameron contrasted his own party's philosophy with that of the opposition, saying: "If Labour's plan for jobs is to attack business, ours is to back business."He criticised Labour leader Ed Miliband, who promised in his end-of-conference address last week to freeze energy prices and increase corporate tax on big firms, telling Tory activists that "profits, tax cuts and enterprise... are not dirty, elitist words".Mr Cameron argued that adding more state borrowing and spending to ease the "cost-of-living crisis" would risk putting the UK on the economic trajectory of Greece."It's all sticking plasters and quick fixes cobbled together for the TV cameras - Red Ed and his Blue Peter economy, " said the prime minister.Earlier in the week, Chancellor George Osborne announced plans to make the long-term unemployed undertake work placements if they want to continue receiving benefits.In his speech, Mr Cameron did not make any specific policy announcements, but suggested his party was looking at further changes to the welfare system to include in its manifesto for the 2015 general election.It was wrong that young people could "choose the dole" and right to "offer them something better".Mr Cameron added: "And let no one paint ideas like this as callous."Think about it: with your children, would you dream of just leaving them to their own devices, not getting a job, not training, nothing?"No - you'd nag and push and guide and do anything to get them on their way… and so must we. So this is what we want to see: everyone under 25 - earning or learning."Mr Cameron, who did not repeat previous no-notes speeches, often looked straight into the lens of the TV camera to address directly the audience outside the Manchester conference centre.The BBC's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said it was a surprisingly sober speech in parts, with Mr Cameron stressing there was still much work to do to fix Britain's economy.It was not enough just to clean up Labour's "mess" and pay off the deficit, he wanted to "build something better in its place".He added: "In place of the casino economy, one where people who work hard can actually get on; in place of the welfare society, one where no individual is written off; in place of the broken education system, one that gives every child the chance to rise up and succeed."Mr Cameron invoked the spirit of his predecessor Margaret Thatcher, the winner of three general elections, who died earlier this year, saying she had "made our country stand tall again, at home and abroad".He also made efforts to distance his party, and himself, from the Liberal Democrats, with whom the Tories have ruled in coalition for more than three years.He promised: "When the election comes, we won't be campaigning for a coalition, we will be fighting heart and soul for a majority Conservative government - because that is what our country needs..."This party at its heart is about big people, strong communities, responsible businesses, a bigger society - not a bigger state."To cheers, Mr Cameron attacked the Lib Dems for "trying to take all the credit" for lowering the minimum earnings threshold at which people start paying income tax.He joked: "Well, memo to the Lib Dems: you lecturing us on low taxes is like us lecturing you on pointless constitutional tinkering."We are Tories, we believe in low taxes and, believe me, we will keep on cutting the taxes of hard-working people in our country."Mr Cameron received a standing ovation after the speech, his ninth to conference since becoming leader in 2005.But, afterwards, Labour leader Ed Miliband said the prime minister had offered nothing to address "the cost-of-living crisis facing Britain's hard-working families".The Lib Dems said they, not the Conservatives, had made a manifesto commitment in 2010 to raise the level at which people start paying tax to £10,000.And UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the pro-business message conflicted with the reality that membership of the EU was costing the UK "billions in red tape and direct payments from high taxes".But there was a more favourable response from business groups, with CBI director-general John Cridland saying the prime minister had "sent out a strong message about how vital British business is to the future prosperity of people across the UK".Simon Walker, director-general of the Institute of Directors also welcomed the speech, but warned that firms would "be looking for him to match the sentiment with action - if tax cuts aren't dirty, let's have a few more of them".</body>

      <title>Miliband: We'll freeze energy prices</title>
      <description>Ed Miliband tells his party conference Labour will freeze energy prices if they get into power - but energy firms criticise the plan.</description>

      <body>Labour would freeze gas and electricity bills for every home and business in the UK for 20 months if it wins the 2015 election, Ed Miliband has said.The big energy firms would be split up and governed by a new tougher regulator to give people "a fairer deal".Labour says the move will save average households £120 and businesses £1,800 - but cost the energy giants £4.5bn.But energy companies said the policy could lead to power shortages, and jeopardise investment and jobs.The Labour leader said firms had been overcharging "for too long" and it was time to "reset" the energy market.The Tories accused him of a "sleight of hand", saying people would have to "pay more for their electricity" under the plans.Speaking for more than hour without notes at his party's annual conference in Brighton, Mr Miliband set out his vision of how "Britain can do better" under Labour, with an economy that works for "ordinary people once again".In other developments at Labour's conference:Mr Miliband used his speech to pledge action on what he has called Britain's "cost of living crisis", setting out an alternative vision of Britain's economy to that pursued by the Conservatives, with higher skills and wages."David Cameron talks about Britain being in a global race. But what he doesn't tell you is that he thinks the only way Britain can win is for you to lose."Mr Miliband said that means "the lowest wages, the worst terms and conditions, and the fewest rights at work - a race to the bottom", adding: "The only way we can win is in a race to the top."In an upbeat speech peppered with swipes at David Cameron and George Osborne for being out touch and lacking aspiration for the country, Mr Miliband repeatedly used the phrase "We're Britain, we're better than this" to cheers and applause from Labour activists.He received standing ovations for defending the NHS and promising to axe "the bedroom tax" - and tackled Tory criticism that he lacks leadership skills head-on, saying: "If they want to have a debate about leadership and character - be my guest."Unlike David Cameron, he told the party faithful, he had stood up to vested interests on media regulation and the tobacco lobby and made the right call on Syria. There was no mention in the speech of Mr Cameron's coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats.Explaining what he believes has gone wrong with the economy under the coalition, he said: "Too many of the jobs we're creating in this country are just too low paid, too many of the gains in our economy are just scooped up by the privileged few, including those big bonuses, and too often you are left being charged over the odds."They used to say 'a rising tide lifts all boats'. Now the rising tide just seems to lift yachts."The Labour leader has used his week in Brighton to set out some of the policies on which he will fight the next election but saved what is likely to be one of the centrepieces of the manifesto for his big speech.He vowed to abolish energy watchdog Ofgem and replace it with a new regulatory regime that ensures customers get a "fair deal"."We will legislate for this in our first Queen's Speech and it will come into effect in 2017," the Labour leader told activists."But in the meantime I am not willing to just stand by. So the next Labour government will freeze gas and electricity prices until the start of 2017."Your bills will be frozen, benefitting millions of families and millions of businesses. That's what I mean by a government that fights for you, that's what I mean when I say: Britain can do better than this."The companies won't like it because it will cost them money. But they have been overcharging people for too long because of a market that doesn't work. It is time to reset the market."Labour says the energy giants have been overcharging customers to the tune of £3.9bn since 2010 by not passing on reductions in wholesale prices to consumers.The party denies that the policy is a return to discredited "price controls" of the 1970s, arguing it is a temporary measure aimed at helping consumers while the party sets up a new regulator, which would force firms to openly sell their wholesale energy in a pooled market.But RWE npower, one of the big six energy firms targeted by Labour, criticised what it said were "easy", "simple solutions"."In reality, there are three main factors that influence prices - fixing inefficient housing stock, the investment required to replace the UK's energy infrastructure, and the cost of the buying energy on the global market," said chief executive Paul Massara.Another firm, SSE, said bills were rising because of "well-intentioned" government initiatives, not fuel costs.Chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said: "Instead of price freezes which will lead to unsustainable loss-making retail businesses, the Labour Party should put policy costs into general taxation, taking them off energy bills."Angela Knight, of industry body Energy UK, said freezing prices could hit the sector, making "energy shortages a reality, pushing up the prices for everyone".In his speech Mr Miliband also pledged to help small firms by freezing business rates in England, paid for by halting a planned increase in UK-wide corporation tax for large companies.And he said that by 2020 under Labour 200,000 houses would be built a year, with a fresh generation of new towns and "garden cities".An incoming Labour government would also scrap the £1,3bn Energy Companies Obligation, launched earlier this year to make the energy giants improve efficiency, and replace it with a more "cost-effective" regime.Unite union general secretary Len McCluskey said he was "pleased" with some of the issues raised by Mr Miliband."The most important thing was he highlighted the problems with the minimum wage and low pay and that fact that wage depression is something that needs to be tackled," he added.But John Longworth, from the British Chambers of Commerce, said talking about "controlling prices and wages sends a very bad signal" to businesses.John Cridland, from the CBI, said the plan "will deter much-needed investment" and would be viewed by business as "a setback for Labour's pro-enterprise credentials".Every Labour activist in the hall was given a copy of a book called One Nation Economy after the leader's speech.</body>

      <title>We must stay in government - Clegg</title>
      <description>The Lib Dems must be part of a coalition government after the next election to stop the Tories or Labour "messing up", Nick Clegg tells his party conference.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24137394</url>
      <date>1379527774</date>
      <body>Nick Clegg has urged the British people to put the Liberal Democrats back in government in 2015 to curb the excesses of the Tories or Labour."We are the only party that can finish the job of economic recovery, but finish it fairly," he told the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow.After three years of coalition Britain was now a "step closer" to the death of single party government, he claimed.He also spoke at length about his family and personal values.The BBC News Channel's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said Mr Clegg stuck to the argument he has been making all week - namely that coalition government works and the Lib Dems want another go at it.In a 51-minute speech aimed at preventing the Conservatives from claiming all the credit for the economic upturn, Mr Clegg said Lib Dem policies such as infrastructure spending and more apprenticeships had made all the difference."The big question mark that has always hung over the Liberal Democrats - could we handle government? And handle it when the going got tough? - that question mark is now gone."This recovery wouldn't be happening without us."He said Lib Dems had proved wrong the critics who said coalition would never work - but he also looked ahead to the next election, saying that "left to their own devices" Labour or the Tories would "mess it up".Speaking openly about forming a power sharing deal with the two bigger parties - something he avoided doing before the last election - he said: "Labour would wreck the recovery. The Conservatives would give us the wrong kind of recovery."He listed a series of Conservative policies which he claimed the Lib Dems had blocked, including "inheritance tax cuts for millionaires, profit-making in schools, firing workers at will, regional pay for public sector workers, scrapping housing benefit for young people, ditching the human rights act and closing down the debate on Trident".But he stressed that the Lib Dems were "no-one's little brother", adding: "We have our own values and beliefs."The speech contained no new policies, following Tuesday's headline-grabbing announcement on free lunches for all children in their first three years at school in England.Saying Lib Dems would extend the scheme to all primary school children, he said: "Their (the Conservatives) priority is to help some families over others, with a tax break for married couples."That tells you everything you need to know about their values."By contrast, he said his party was helping "young children get the best possible start in life, and that tells you everything about ours".The Lib Dem leadership have seen off challenges from activists to its nuclear weapons and economic policies, although delegates voted for a review of housing benefit rules - what critics call the "bedroom tax".And he scoffed at suggestions that coalition was all about personal chemistry between the party leaders, saying any coalition depended on the result of the election.In what will be seen as a hint that he is thinking of stepping down after the next election, he told activists in Glasgow that he "will not be in politics forever".But he used the speech to set out how his liberal values came to be formed, his "privileged" childhood and his "internationalist" outlook.He said the Lib Dems had always backed "home rule" for Scotland but would be urging a "no" vote in next year's independence referendum to keep the UK together.But he hoped the cross-party consensus would continue after the referendum to push for "the next advance in Scottish devolution".And he said the Lib Dems would be the party of "in" when it came to an EU referendum.Summing up what his pitch would be at the next election, he said: "In the past the Liberal Democrats would eke out an existence on the margins of British politics."Now we hold the liberal centre while our opponents head left and right. I have spent my entire life watching the other two mess it up. We cannot stand idly by and let them do it all over again."Lib Dem colleagues praised Mr Clegg's "intensely personal speech" but Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman said that, far from restraining the Conservatives, the Lib Dems had backed them all the way."He didn't mention the million young people out of work on his watch, the tax cuts for millionaires his party helped to introduce, or the cost of living crisis that means that since he became deputy prime minister wages are down an average of £1,500 a year," she added."Nothing he said today made any difference to the fact that Nick Clegg is propping up a Tory-led government that's making things worse for ordinary families."</body>

      <title>We want Britain back, says Farage</title>
      <description>UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage calls for an immediate EU exit, telling his party's conference the UK could go it alone.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24163335</url>
      <date>1379689172</date>
      <body>Britain would flourish outside the EU, Nigel Farage has said, predicting UKIP will cause a "political earthquake" in European elections next year.Addressing the party's annual conference, he said leaving the union would "open a door to the world".He described his party as the "true Europeans" as he claimed credit for shifting the terms of the debate on immigration and holding a referendum.But the speech was overshadowed by a row over remarks by MEP Godfrey Bloom.Mr Bloom has had the whip removed after he referred to a group of female activists as "sluts" - although he maintained that it was meant and taken as a joke.UKIP has reached unprecedented heights in the opinion polls under Mr Farage, coming second in the European elections in 2009 and winning hundreds of seats in the May local elections.Mr Farage has refused to predict how the party's Westminster candidates would fare in an election in 2015 but said he wants to turn the next European elections "into a referendum on EU membership"."My ambition and my conviction is that we can come first across the United Kingdom," he told activists."Let us send an earthquake through Westminster politics and let's say we want our country back."The party has sought to broaden its appeal beyond its core message of EU withdrawal, announcing policies in recent days on energy and welfare.But, in a speech dominated by Europe, Mr Farage said the European Commission had "hijacked" the EU's original ideals and the UK would begin a process of "national renewal" by going its own way.Those who warn that British trade would be harmed by a UK exit were the "true voices of Little England", he told party members."Those 10,000 trucks a day coming in from the Continent bringing goods into this country. They won't stop coming," he said."The idea that the EU will start a trade war with Britain is simply not credible. The real reason the EU won't be able or willing to stop trading with us is that the German car industry won't allow it."UKIP was growing in strength and, by the time of the next election, Mr Farage said it would be the third largest party in the country in terms of membership, overtaking the Liberal Democrats.The party is meeting just days after one of its former deputy leaders quit the organisation, frustrated by what he had described as its "totalitarian" leadership.Mike Nattrass, West Midlands MEP and a member for 15 years, accused Mr Farage of silencing dissent and surrounding himself with "cronies".But Mr Farage, by far the party's best-known figure, outlined his popularity with voters, saying in his speech: "They are fed up to the back teeth with the cardboard cut-out careerists in Westminster, the spot-the-difference politicians... the politicians who daren't say what they really mean."While there was no mention of the members who quit in protest at his leadership, he acknowledged internal clashes.Mr Farage told party members he had a "blistering row" with Godfrey Bloom, the UKIP MEP who courted controversy recently by claiming British foreign aid goes to "bongo-bongo land".Alluding to the comments, he referred to "public pronouncements that I would not always choose myself" and urged those with passionate views to focus on the "big messages".Immigration was the "biggest single issue facing" the UK, he said, as he warned of an "even darker side to the opening of the door".He claimed London had been gripped by a "Romanian crime wave"."This gets to the heart of immigration," he said. "We should not be opening our doors on 1 January to Romanian criminal gangs."The "Establishment" had dismissed anyone wanting to debate immigration as "bad and racist", he claimed.UKIP gained 16.5% of the popular vote, second only to the Conservatives, in the 2009 European elections and returned 13 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs).But, at the 2010 general election, support dwindled to 3.1% and UKIP did not win a Westminster seat.Earlier on Friday, the party's energy spokesman Roger Helmer announced it would invest profits from shale gas extraction in a sovereign wealth fund.The two-day conference is also set to discuss plans to ensure migrants have private health insurance and for social housing to be prioritised for people whose parents or grandparents were born locally.</body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: 2013 Party conferences</title>
      <description>A guide to what goes on at the political parties' autumn conferences.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24052129</url>
      <date>1379521029</date>
      <body>The autumn political party conference season is upon us. Here is our guide to them.What are party conferences?They are annual events where MPs, local councillors and ordinary party members gather to hear speeches, debate policy and socialise with like-minded souls.Why do they have them?Party conferences used to be all about policy debates and votes on the conference floor. These days the emphasis is more on big set piece speeches and policy announcements. It is a chance for the party leadership to dominate news coverage for a few days and boost the morale of their supporters. Or, if it doesn't go to plan, fend off leadership challenges and plots. There have been proposals over the years to reduce them in size, or only hold them in the year before an election, but they are popular with the membership and a useful source of income for cash-strapped parties.So what actually happens?They are four or five day festivals of democracy. Like Glastonbury for political obsessives. At any one time there will be dozens of speeches and debates taking place - some in the main hall in the full glare of the TV cameras, but many more in stuffy hotel conference rooms and lecture theatres on the conference "fringe". The whole thing takes place within a security cordon, giving it a slightly unreal atmosphere. There is also a thriving social scene based around the bars and restaurants of the main conference hotels. Drinks receptions and dinners go on late into the night. It is the only chance grassroots members get to rub shoulders with the big names at the top of their party.Where are this year's big three conferences?The Liberal Democrats were first up, gathering in Glasgow for five days from Saturday, 14 September. Labour start their four day event on Sunday, 22 September, in Brighton. The Conservatives meet for four days from Sunday, 29 September in Manchester.Who goes to them?It is more than just politicians and party members. At each conference there is a large exhibition hall where businesses, charities, local authorities and other groups hire stalls in the hope of catching the attention of a passing decision maker. There are also mini-shopping malls, with book, food and even clothes shops. Hundreds of journalists also attend, from the Westminster press pack to local paper and trade journalists and bloggers. The big party conferences also attract visiting dignitaries from abroad and the occasional TV celebrity.Can anyone attend?No. Security is very tight and you must apply weeks in advance for a pass.How big are the events?Huge. Conservative and Labour conferences regularly attract upwards of 10,000 attendees while the Lib Dems have seen a big jump in attendance since they entered government in 2010.Aren't they normally at the seaside?They used to be. But the trend now is to hold them in one of Britain's major metropolitan cities. However, Brighton came back on to the roster in 2012 after a couple of years' absence.What difference can the conferences make?The days when conferences decided what went in the next general election manifesto are, for the most part, gone, although the amount of say ordinary members get varies between parties. Labour and the Lib Dems still hold votes on policy motions. For the big parties it is largely all about media coverage but a conference speech can still make or break a party leader or act as a springboard to a fledgling career. With so many journalists and politicians in close proximity they are also a great chance to plot and often set the tone for the next few months at Westminster.What's particularly on the agenda this year?With a general election less than two years away, the talk will be all about winning votes in 2015. Labour leader Ed Miliband is under pressure to unveil the results of a long-awaited policy review and will also be keen to prepare the ground for a special conference next year to debate his trade union reforms. The Lib Dems and Tories were expected to announce new government policies to prove the coalition has not run out of steam - but,as seen with the Lib Dems, they have also begun the process of uncoupling themselves in the minds of voters by setting out a few of their own distinctive policies.What about other parties' conferences?The UK Independence Party meets at the Westminster Central Hall, in London, for two days starting on Friday, 20 September. Plaid Cymru meets in Aberystwyth for two days, from Friday, 11 October. The Scottish National Party's annual conference is from 17 to 20 October in Perth. The Green Party of England and Wales conference was the first, being held for two days from Friday 13 September.</body>

      <title>EU body withdraws peace centre money</title>
      <description>A European Union funding programme withdraws its offer of £18m in financial support for the peace centre at the former Maze Prison in Northern Ireland.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-24399418</url>
      <date>1380902849</date>
      <body>An EU funding programme has withdrawn its offer of £18m in financial support for the peace centre at the former Maze prison in Northern Ireland.The Special European Programmes Body said it had done so after consulting with the lead partner - the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister.They said they decided, after the talks, that the centre was no longer viable.The Maze housed paramilitary prisoners during the Troubles from 1971 - 2000.Ten republican prisoners died on hunger strike there.Over the years, the scheme to redevelop the former prison site, near Lisburn in County Antrim, has been controversial.First Minister Peter Robinson said: "What the SEUPB is doing is the sensible and practical step of ensuring the money doesn't find itself going down some black hole."It allows them time to look at other projects and spend the money elsewhere."He added: "When we looked at the issue of the peace centre we made it very clear that what was required was to get support across the community, that there had to be a broad level of support, and of course if at any time that is achieved then there are other opportunities for funding."But at this stage it's very clear that the SEUPB doesn't believe that it's possible to get it within the period of time necessary."I don't think there's any difficulty whether it's Europe or whether it's elsewhere that we go for the funding - if there was the level of support that's necessary, I'm pretty sure the funding would fit into place very quickly."Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said on BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme that he was disappointed at the withdrawal of funding and added that he had not given up on the project."I still hold out hope that at some stage we'll see it constructed at Long Kesh. I will authorise no other projects (apart from Royal Ulster Agricultural Society's move to the site) on that site until people come to their senses," he said."What is at the heart of this is power-sharing. From my perspective I want to share power but I can't do it on my own."The peace centre is a government commitment which has to be honoured. If it isn't, then it damages the power-sharing project."The peace money will now be re-allocated to other projects.These will be based in either Northern Ireland or the border counties of the Republic of Ireland.BBC Northern Ireland political editor Mark Devenport said: "They may have some difficulties finding other projects because it was by far and away one of the biggest projects to be funded by that programme but they are now looking around to see how they can spend that money."During the summer, First Minister Peter Robinson stalled the plans to build the peace centre as part of the development of the site of the former Maze prison, a decision that caused tension between his party, the DUP, and Sinn Féin.Mr Robinson said there needed to be a broad consensus on how it would operate and what it would contain - and that is currently absent, in his view.On Monday, Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said there could be no development of the wider Maze site unless it was on the basis of previous agreements about the building of a peace centre.In its statement on Friday, the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) said: "The SEUPB has been in discussions with the lead partner in relation to the viability of the Peace Building and Conflict Resolution Centre."It has been agreed that the project is no longer viable at this time and the SEUPB has therefore rescinded the letter of offer. The SEUPB will now consider the re-allocation of funding to suitable projects."The European Commissioner for Regional Policy, Johannes Hahn, said: "This is a project which we supported as a contribution to the reconciliation of the communities in Northern Ireland."Sadly, due to the political conditions on the ground it cannot go ahead in this period."To be meaningful all communities have to be involved - that unfortunately is not the case. I very much hope we can try again with this project and that for the time being the money from it can be used to fund other projects."Last week, Daniel Libeskind, the architect who designed the proposed peace building and reconciliation centre, said he was convinced the scheme would go ahead.Ulster Unionist Tom Elliott, who attended a meeting on Friday morning at which the SEUPB made the announcement, said the one thing he took "significant comfort" from was that the £18m would not be lost to Northern Ireland.He said the SEUPB assured those at the meeting that there were a number of other projects that would be eligible for the funding.John Armstrong of the Construction Employers Federation (CEF) said it was another blow to the industry."Every project that is stalled or scrapped is costing jobs and hindering economic recovery," he said.</body>

      <body>The Scottish government has pledged not to impose a pay freeze on NHS workers in Scotland.It came after the Department of Health (DoH) at Westminster urged UK-wide pay review bodies to cancel a planned 1% pay rise next year.It said the rise was unaffordable and the money should instead be used to help maintain safe staffing levels.But Scottish Health Minister Alex Neil said he had "no intention" of withholding the rise in Scotland.He said the Scottish government had made its own proposals to the pay review bodies, proposing that the 1% rise is implemented in 2014/15 as well as giving further help to those on low wages by ensuring no one employed by the health service earns less than the Scottish Living Wage.Mr Neil accused Westminster counterpart Jeremy Hunt of "bad faith" and said withholding the pay rise would be a "betrayal of the NHS".He added: "To steal the pay rise back from workers' hands will destabilise the NHS across the UK and damage morale."The Scottish government has no intention of following Jeremy Hunt and we will use our independence over the health service to block this move."But with UK wide agreement to Agenda for Change - which established pay policy in the health service - this damaging right wing approach could hit Scottish services, and under the current funding settlement could drive down Scotland's budget in the future."My message to Hunt is unequivocal - Scotland rejects your politics, your attack on staff, and your desire to destroy the real NHS."The health secretary said he would be meeting with unions "to ensure this ludicrous proposal finds no foundation in Scotland."On Saturday it emerged the DoH had made a written submission to the NHS Pay Review Body in which it said the proposed 1% rise was unaffordable alongside the current system, which sees many staff automatically receive incremental annual rises.The move has been criticised by Labour and the unions.The DoH has stressed no decisions on changes to pay have been taken, and said independent bodies will make their recommendations in February or March next year.However, in its submission, the DoH pointed to a staff survey suggesting high levels of motivation and morale, and said there should only be basic pay increases if there is "strong evidence" recruitment, retention, morale or motivation issues require this.The submission said: "Employers cannot pay staff more, improve quality and productivity and protect jobs."Careful and prudent management of the NHS pay bill is critical if we are to maintain the right number of frontline staff with the right skills. We believe more affordable employment contracts can help deliver better care and improve job security."The NHS Pay Review Body makes recommendations on the remuneration of all staff paid under Agenda for Change and employed in the NHS.Its recommendations apply to about 1.5 million staff in NHS Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with the exception of doctors, dentists and very senior managers.It reports separately to the health ministers in each country of the UK, who can accept, reject or modify its recommendation.</body>

      <body>Companies in Wales could do more to export goods to new markets, according to the South Wales Chamber of Commerce.Director Graham Morgan said businesses should create more opportunities to tap into emerging markets.Wales exported £633m worth of goods to the Middle East in 2012, making it the fourth most popular destination.The Welsh government said international trade remains a priority. A Royal Bank of Scotland report said firms could use markets like Mexico and Brazil more.Mr Morgan told BBC Wales Today: "There are certainly a range of mechanisms in place to move into new markets."I think there's probably a shortfall in the number of businesses that have fantastic products and fantastic services but don't appreciate that they can now be sold in overseas markets."And the more we can get business proprietors to think in terms of where they can be making headway in what has been a difficult economic market, the better for Wales."Chris Howarth, managing director of confectionery company Bon Bon Buddies in Blackwood, Caerphilly county, said it was challenging trading across different parts of world.He said: "You have to get it right in a completely different cultural environment so you have to be committed to learning a different set of rules of the game... every single market is different."The Welsh government said they have a programme of trade missions and exhibitions in place which will take in markets including China, India, Brazil and Russia.</body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Beginner's guide to PM's speech</title>
      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21013771</url>
      <date>1358939858</date>
      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant?What has happened?Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning.Why the big deal about the speech?Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech.So what did Cameron say?Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech.What sorts of powers does the UK want back?The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK."Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders?The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK.So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU?David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market."What has been the reaction in the UK?Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement.Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party.The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts.What about the reaction around Europe?The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction.What about the reaction from business?A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".Where can I get more detail on the speech?If you click on the link below you can read the whole text, with key bits picked out and analysed by BBC expertsAnnotated transcipt: Key excerpts</body>

      <description>The details of Labour leader Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet following the recent reshuffle.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11494915</url>
      <date>1337253895</date>
      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his wide-ranging reshuffle.The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction.Launched a two year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. Faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to phone hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire.The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton.As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later became schools secretary and narrowly held onto his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper.Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children.The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign.Best known for his stunning victory over Michael Portillo - then Defence Secretary and potential future Tory leader - in the 1997 general election. Mr Twigg himself was ousted from Enfield Southgate by a Conservative in 2005, but returned to Parliament in 2010, parachuted into the very safe Labour seat of Liverpool West Derby. Served as minister for school standards under Tony Blair and shadow Foreign Office minister in Ed Miliband's first opposition front bench, he was the first openly gay MP in the Commons. In a previous life, he was head of the National Union of Students. The then 44-year-old was promoted to the shadow cabinet in October 2011.Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. Rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. Keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet, he returned to his previous love, health in 2011.Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development.Probably best known for leaving a note to his successor as chief secretary to the Treasury before the 2010 election saying "I'm afraid there is no money left". The then 39-year-old was forced to apologise, saying he did not want to appear "flippant" about the deficit. This was an uncharacteristic slip from someone who rose smoothly through the ministerial ranks after being elected in 2004, taking on the high-profile immigration brief after the foreign prisoners scandal in 2006. One of few senior Labour figures with a business background, he was a merchant banker before launching his own technology firm. Interests include half marathons, church architecture and astronomy.A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader.As the son of former Labour cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest.One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending, but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress.A Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign, he has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football.The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing". Like many leading female MPs, the former union worker entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide. Responsible for the controversial eco-town project as housing minister before becoming Europe minister in 2008. Supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011.One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. A keen chess player, she supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leaders of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.At a youthful 31, the MP for Leeds West was elected to Parliament in 2010 and appointed shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament.Sister of Angela but chose to support Ed Miliband in the leadership contest. Ms Eagle was a solicitor in Liverpool before entering Parliament in 1997. Held a series of ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including children's minister and equalities minister. Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player.When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before. The Wakefield MP worked for the European Parliament and in academia before entering Parliament in 2005. A keen Europhile, she is fluent in French and Italian. Worked as parliamentary private secretary to Andy Burnham but voted for David Miliband in the leadership contest.Former charity worker and chief executive of the Manchester Jewish Federation, Mr Lewis held a string of junior ministerial posts in the Labour government after becoming an MP in 1997 at the age of 31. He started out as a parliamentary private secretary to then trade secretary Stephen Byers, before going on to be an education minister, Treasury minister, health minister and international development minister. Most recently, he was minister of state at the Foreign Office. His previous shadow cabinet role was as culture spokesman in which he was a vocal campaigner on phone hacking.Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. But when that constituency was torn up in boundary changes she made the move to Westminster in 2010. Under her, Labour took back Glasgow East having lost it in a stunning by-election defeat by the SNP in 2008. In Holyrood, she held various posts, including Minister for Communities, overseeing the executive's flagship anti-social behaviour laws. Before entering politics she was a lecturer in community education. The then 52-year-old took up her first full shadow cabinet role in October 2011.The West Bromwich MP rose to prominence with his dogged pursuit of the phone-hacking issue, becoming the number one thorn in News International's side. He has used his position on the influential culture select committee - something he has maintained despite his party post - to grill newspaper representatives. He has also raised the matter time and again in the House of Commons, demanding more action from police and Parliament. Mr Watson was a defence minister under Tony Blair but resigned in 2006, calling for Mr Blair to step down. That personal stand saw him accused of conspiring with Gordon Brown. An avid Tweeter and blogger, the then 41-year-old returned to government when Mr Brown became PM as digital enhancement minister.Gordon Brown's former parliamentary aide, who previously attended shadow cabinet as a junior minister, became a full member as shadow Cabinet Office minister in Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle. The then 61-year-old MP for Hemsworth took on the role from Tessa Jowell.One of Labour's true stalwarts, Ms Jowell, born in 1947, held ministerial office throughout the Blair and Brown years, holding briefs in the health and education departments.

He supported Ed Miliband for the leadership and was given a role in his shadow team five months after entering the House, first as shadow Wales minister and then in the shadow Treasury team. This is his first shadow cabinet role.The MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted smoking cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip.The then 52-year-old was elected unopposed in a ballot for chief whip in 2010.

      <title>Are lobbyists taking over party conferences?</title>
      <description>How lobbyists are taking over conferences</description>

      <date>1380696115</date>
      <body>The party faithful are an increasingly rare breed at party conferences, amid an ever-growing army of lobbyists and PR people. What are they all doing there?It is probably the nearest public relations gets to rock and roll.Packing your suitcase, kissing your tearful children goodbye and heading off for a month on the road.It is the same blur of cavernous city centre venues, late nights, too much booze and dodgy hotel rooms, although rock bands probably consume fewer canapes."It is a bit of a wrench because the littlest is very little," said mother-of-four Claire Burton, speaking at the Lib Dem conference."I suppose if you are going to be doing a job, working with some of the most vulnerable people in society, then a little bit of sacrifice is OK."Claire is head of business development at Langley House Trust, which helps to resettle ex-offenders.Like thousands of other lobbyists she is going to the three main conferences this year.What does her organisation get out of it?"I think it has various uses. If you have something specific to say. If you've got a particular cause that you need to promote. But you have to be quite focused."You have to know who you want to talk to. You have to know exactly what you want to say to them and at the end of the day it might not be of any interest to them at all."Many organisations - from small charities to corporate giants - will splash out on a stand in the exhibition hall, or sponsor a fringe meeting, which can cost thousands of pounds.Many more will simply get a conference pass to hang about in the bars and restaurants, or set up private meetings with MPs."Some people say you can achieve just as much by setting up meetings with MPs or ministers at Westminster, for less expense," said Simon Butler, parliamentary liaison officer for The Sport and Recreation Alliance, at the Labour conference."But I think there is something about being at conference that makes politicians more receptive to new ideas and debate."But is all this lobbying and schmoozing strictly ethical?There are plenty who will argue it is sucking the life out of party conferences, which are, after all, meant to be festivals of democracy and political debate.Ben Harris Quinney, chairman of Tory think tank the Bow Group, is among those who believe it has gone too far."Conference is now populated by lobbyists, not members. It offers no freedom and no democratic rights to a membership who barely recognise or connect with what the Party has now become," he says.Much of the lobbying activity is, at least, out in the open. It is always fun to spot some of the less fashionable causes that have hired stands in the hope of burnishing their image in the eyes of a passing decision-maker.Tobacco giant Philip Morris had a stand at the Labour Party conference in Brighton, to make the case against smuggling, but they were not welcome at the Conservative gathering a week later in Manchester.The British Fur Trade Association, on the other hand, is at the Tory conference this week but was not welcome at Labour, apparently.It is unlikely any minister will have risked being pictured at these stands due to the controversial nature of their products but, for others, particularly those who do a lot of business with the government, the ministerial visit is a highlight of the week.In fact it is almost part of the package. The Conservative conference organisers send a photographer along to record the handshakes and grins for a souvenir CD.But just like at Westminster, the real power-broking, and influence-peddling, goes on behind closed doors in private dinners and closed fringe meetings.This happens at all party conferences, although it was still a slight surprise to see the Conservatives promoting a private lounge area, the Blue Room, where corporate guests can rub shoulders with cabinet ministers and senior party officials for a minimum fee of £20,000 plus VAT.The Conservatives have certainly got the commercial side of conference down to a fine art.They are the only one of the big three to have a mini shopping mall in the exhibition hall, with upmarket brands such as Harvey Nichols and Crombie competing for a slice of the blue pound.But it would be unfair to single the Conservatives out for using conference as a cash cow.A quick glance at the commercial opportunities available at Labour's annual conference, from £10,000 to advertise on "eco-friendly" conference bags to £450 for a quarter page ad in the conference brochure, reveals a party every bit as alive to marketing opportunities.In fact, Labour charges more for a "hotel room key drop" than the Conservatives."Have our key Conference guests wake up to your message by getting your flyer delivered overnight direct to their bedrooms," explains the Labour brochure. A snip, surely, at £2,000 (The Tories charge £1,750).The fact is, conferences are a huge money spinner for all the parties.In 2012, The Conservative Party made £4.3m from them - getting on for a third of its total income. The Lib Dems made a more modest £1.5m. Labour does not list its income from conferences in its accounts, but it made £3.4m from "commercial activity".And it is not just the "big three" London-based parties.As the Westminster press pack gets ready to head home from Manchester on Wednesday, after David Cameron's big speech, the commercial caravan moves on to Perth, in central Scotland, where the SNP are holding their annual shindig.That's rock and roll...</body>

      <date>1380702201</date>
      <body>Labour Party leader Ed Miliband is locked in a row with the Daily Mail over his father's views. But to what extent do our mothers and fathers shape our political opinions?Many people's first exposure to political debate wasn't watching Question Time or reading newspaper reports about the House of Commons or the US Congress.It was at the dinner table or in the family front room, with a parent cursing conservatives or muttering darkly about socialists.Labour leader Ed Miliband's upbringing fitted this pattern better than most. His father Ralph was a left-wing academic, his mother Marion a campaigner for progressive causes.Now this family history has become the focus of a bitter media spat. On Saturday, the Daily Mail ran a profile of Ralph Miliband under the headline: "The man who hated Britain". After offering his son the right of reply, the paper repeated the original article and ran a leader describing the deceased lecturer's legacy as "evil".For its part, the paper justified the attack by arguing that Ralph Miliband's political views had been passed down the generations."We do not maintain, like the jealous God of Deuteronomy, that the iniquity of the fathers should be visited on the sons," its leader says. "But when a son with prime ministerial ambitions swallows his father's teachings, as the younger Miliband appears to have done, the case is different."The Labour leader has reacted furiously.He insisted his politics were markedly different from those of his Marxist father: "I have pursued a different path and I have a different vision." He also said he was "appalled" by the Mail's "character assassination" of a man who had served in the Royal Navy during World War II after escaping Nazi persecution.The dispute raises the question of the extent to which people's politics are shaped by the influence of their families.Many of those who have backed Miliband in the row have followed the Mail's logic by pointing out that the first Viscount Rothermere, great-grandfather of its present owner, met Hitler and wrote an article titled Hurrah For The Blackshirts in 1934 which praised Oswald Mosley's fascists.There are plenty of political dynasties, even in countries that have long shaken off the shackles of aristocracy - the Bush family, for instance, who have accounted for two of the last four US presidents, or the Gandhis in India.In the UK, the Cecil family have been involved in Conservative parliamentary politics for more than two centuries, while four generations of Benns have sat for Labour or the Liberals in the House of Commons.But there is no shortage of examples of politicians who have rejected the views of their forefathers.Famously, the father of former Conservative cabinet minister Michael Portillo was a left-wing Spanish Republican who escaped his homeland during the civil war. Labour Prime Ministers Clement Attlee and Tony Blair both grew up in Tory households (Attlee's grandson, Earl Attlee, now takes the Conservative whip in the House of Lords).If nothing else, the process of youthful rebellion requires adopting contrary views - teenagers in the Tory shires long having irritated their mums and dads by joining the Socialist Workers Party or announcing their sympathy for the anarchist cause.It's a process the comedian Alexei Sayle understands well. He grew up in a Communist Party household in Liverpool where the only way to appear more radical than his parents was to declare himself a Maoist.Over time, however, Sayle, while retaining left-wing principles, lost his illusions about the brutality of the regimes his family supported. As a result, he feels ambivalent about the environment in which he acquired his values and moral code."My parents had a genuine hatred of injustice - they were really decent people. On the other hand, that wish for a better world led them to turn a blind eye to the two greatest mass murderers of the 20th Century, namely Stalin and Mao," he says."But I'll always value the fact that they taught me to look sceptically at the news, to question society and people's motives."It's not just among the left that parents can be crucial in shaping opinions. Margaret Thatcher often spoke of the formative influence of her father, a grocer and Methodist lay preacher, who instilled her faith in the virtues of hard work and thrift.Of course, plenty of children of politicians and the politically engaged grow up to have no interest whatsoever in parties and ideologies.Others say they became active despite, not because, of their parents' interests.Rachel Johnson belongs to one of the most notable political families in the UK - her father Stanley was a Conservative MEP while her brothers Boris and Jo serve as Mayor of London and head of the Number 10 Policy Unit respectively.But she insists that politics was rarely discussed while she grew up, not least because her parents' affiliations were split - her mother Charlotte was a Labour voter."We didn't have a politicised household," Johnson, herself a Conservative party member until recently, says. "The only thing I remember was canvassing for my father for the European Parliament. But we did that not because he was a Tory but because he was my father."Arguably the political success of the Miliband family is proof that politics aren't simply handed down from father to son.It's difficult to reconcile the Marxist dialectics of Ralph with the views of his Blairite son David, who served as foreign secretary from 2007 to 2010 and was defeated by his brother for Labour's leadership.Though Ed has often spoken warmly of "the values I grew up with", he rose to the top of the party in defiance of his father's long-standing belief that Labour could never achieve socialist transformation.Unite general secretary Len McCluskey once joked that Ralph Miliband "spent his life trying to convince our movement that there was no possibility of a parliamentary road to socialism, while his sons have been loyally putting theory into practice, and proving Ralph right".Still, when children depart from their parents' political paths delicate situations can arise.In 1994, Sir Nicholas Scott, the Conservative disability minister, left office after coming under severe criticism after the government scuppered a bill that would have banned discrimination against disabled people.One of his sternest critics was his daughter Victoria, a Labour party member who at the time worked for a disability pressure group. Memorably, on one occasion she took to the Today programme to sternly criticise him.Now Victoria says the affair did create tensions, even in a family where she had been encouraged to think independently (Sir Nicholas later told interviewers he was proud she had stood up for herself)."My dad loved arguments and had a good sense of humour - he'd rather I was left-wing and had different political opinions than that I was totally uninterested," she says."But we weren't prepared for the emotional and personal fallout, which was quite phenomenal. People in my family really felt I had betrayed my father, even if he didn't feel that himself."Her experience may be far from uncommon, according to Elias Dinas, lecturer in politics at the University of Nottingham, who has researched the impact of parental influence on opinion-forming."There's a volume of literature that says the more politicised your parents are, the more likely you are to become a politically engaged adult - but you're also more likely to abandon your parents' views," he adds.If true, this implies the best way to pass on your political opinions to your offspring is to keep quiet about them. In the Miliband household, this evidently wasn't an option.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Viewpoints: How should long-term unemployment be tackled?</title>
      <description>How should long-term unemployment be tackled?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24330111</url>
      <date>1380552793</date>
      <body>The long-term unemployed may have to undertake work placements in return for their benefits, under changes being unveiled by Chancellor George Osborne.From April 2014, people who are jobless after being on the work programme for two years will face three options - a community work placement; taking part in training; or visiting a job centre every day - or face losing benefits.Although the UK unemployment rate has fallen in recent months, the number of long-term unemployed has not fallen.How should long-term unemployment be tackled?Most would agree that people with the misfortune to be long-term unemployed need intensive, personalised help to get back into a job.International evidence shows that a full package of support and the right kind of work experience - ideally with pay and the prospect of a proper job at the end of it - is crucial.Forcing people into jobs at threat of financial sanction risks pushing them out of the system entirely and doesn't help them get a real job, which is not cost-effective.Neither can we ignore the extent of poor-quality jobs in the UK labour market. Getting on the ladder is vital but we need better and wider routes upwards out of poverty.There is nothing wrong with expecting the long-term unemployed to undertake work experience or an intensive job search, in fact it can really help.When done right, they give people the work habits and employability skills that employers are looking for.What's crucial is that schemes are designed to make people more likely to get a job, not less.Today's announcement builds on an earlier "mandatory work activity" pilot, which was found to have had no impact on future job prospects, only short-term breaks in JSA claims, and increased the numbers on disability benefit.Instead, drawing on the successful Future Jobs Fund, the government should guarantee a real job, created by the charitable sector and paid at the minimum wage, to anyone who has been out of work for a year.And insist that they take the job or lose their benefits - limiting the time someone can be unemployed.The social and economic consequences of long-term unemployment are well known.For individuals, it can mean detachment from the norms of work, skills losing currency and loss of confidence due to multiple knock-backs.Mechanisms that re-build labour market attachment are valuable but there is a need to recognise the multiple barriers faced, including the uneven geographic dispersion of work, which poses the challenge of economic regeneration.Long-term unemployment among young people is particularly problematic, and it is crucial that they receive interventions that help them to achieve traction in the labour market, which may include skills development as well as workplace experience.The longer someone is out of work the more challenging it becomes to find a job.Their skills and experience become out of date and their confidence is dented.Specialist help should kick in quickly, but currently the Work Programme is targeted at people who have been unemployed for a full 12 months.The benefits trap is also a real problem.People can be reluctant to take a temporary or part-time job even though it would be a great first step back into the workforce because they are worried that when it ends they might lose their benefits.Welfare reforms must tackle this perceived barrier.The government should tap into the expertise of professional recruiters.It's their job to have good relationships with employers and to understand their local labour markets.This can make them better placed than Jobcentre staff to provide advice about local opportunities.They can also give free, personal advice to jobseekers about how to perform well in interviews and how to make the most of themselves on their CVs.Very long-term unemployment (2+ years) is strongly cyclical, almost disappearing from 1998 to 2009, but has returned with the protracted period of poor economic performance.It is thus not a new phenomenon and a large range of policies have been tried before. We have a very good idea of what does and does not work.The effect of requiring people to go into work placements depends a lot on the quality of the work experience offered.They have three elements: first, some people leave benefits ahead of the required employment.This is called the deterrent effect and is stronger the more unpleasant and low paid (eg work for the dole) the placement is.Then, whilst on the placement, job search and job entry tend to fall off as the person's time is absorbed by working.Finally, the gaining of work experience raises job search success.This is stronger for high-quality job placement in terms of the experience gained and being with a regular employer who can give a good reference if the person has worked well.The net effect of many such programmes, including work for the dole, has often been little or even negative.But the best effects come where job search is actively required and supported when on a work placement, where the placement is with a regular employer rather than a "make work" scheme and where the placement provider is incentivised to care about the employment outcomes of the unemployed person after the work placement ends.Long-term unemployment is a major problem for many jobseekers, as those who have been out of work for a long time can lose confidence and feel that they have become unattractive to employers.George Osborne does sound as though he is unfairly trying to shift the onus onto the unemployed, when the government aren't really doing enough to generate new jobs.Despite this, the work placements outlined should help the long-term unemployed in theory, by giving them the chance to develop work-related skills and so on.The most important thing for those out of work is the development of new skills and experience, whether this is through work placements, free courses or taking on new responsibilities, along with maintaining their confidence and believing in their ability to get a job.</body>

      <title>EU law and budget: a video guide</title>
      <description>Matthew Price explains EU laws and budget</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23782683</url>
      <date>1377100903</date>
      <body>The EU has a reputation for being slow and cumbersome - largely because of the difficulty of getting agreement among 28 member states with different languages and traditions.Here BBC Europe correspondent Matthew Price gives a video guide to the complex bargaining that results in new EU laws and the EU budget.The right to initiate legislation in the EU belongs to the European Commission - the union's civil service and rule-enforcer.Usually Commission proposals go through many amendments before becoming law - a process that takes years.In most policy areas the Council of Ministers - representing EU governments - and the European Parliament reach joint decisions through negotiation. Their role is called "the ordinary legislative procedure". During their negotiations they come under pressure from lobby groups, for example industrial firms or environmentalists.Often EU laws arise because national governments and MEPs tell the Commission that there is a need for them. Public consultations, scientific research and impact assessments also feed into the legislation.Once a measure becomes EU law the member states have two years to adopt it nationally - "transpose" it, in the jargon. The Commission can fine them for failure to do so.The budget is one of the most contentious policy areas among the member states, whose priorities differ greatly. The 2013 EU budget is 132.8bn euros (£113bn; $178bn).The size of the budget has to be decided annually, but there is also a seven-year budget framework, agreed in advance so that money can be set aside for long-term projects.This year for the first time EU leaders agreed to cut the multi-year budget (for 2014-2020), under pressure from the UK and some other countries, including the Netherlands and Sweden.The eurozone crisis has exacerbated tensions in the budget negotiations. Net contributors to the budget - the richer countries including the UK - argue that it should reflect the tough austerity policies adopted nationally. But net beneficiaries, such as the new member states in Central and Eastern Europe, oppose EU cuts to key areas like agriculture and infrastructure projects.EU spending is a small fraction of what the national governments spend in total, but those governments have to pay for big public sector areas like education and health, which are largely outside the EU's remit.</body>

      <body>A new course record has been set at Cardiff's annual half marathon, with Kenyan Lentaknai Lengurisi completing the 13.1 mile (21km) race in sub 62 minutes.His official time was 61 minutes and 51 seconds, running 4 minute and 44 second miles.The women's race was won by Kenyan Purity Kimetto in 1 hour 14 minutes and 22 seconds.First Welshman Dewi Griffiths finished in 65 minutes and two seconds.The race, in its 11th year, attracted 19,000 runners on Sunday.Most runners are continuing to cross the finish line in the city centre.The course's personal best comes as Cardiff Council bids to hold the IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in 2016.The Welsh government, UK Athletics and the council have agreed a funding package of £910,000 to host the biennial event.Proposals will go before the council, which said the event could boost the city's economy by £1m, next week.Another £2m would be raised for charities and good causes through race sponsorship, the council said.UK Athletics and the Welsh government will jointly provide up to £360,000, with the Welsh government giving a further £400,000 contingency for the successful delivery of the race.The council will contribute £150,000 from its corporate initiatives fund if the bid is successful.Councillor Ramesh Patel, cabinet member for sport, said: "The Lloyds Bank Cardiff Half Marathon is now a major event for Wales and shows the city has the capacity, infrastructure and draw to be able to host the World Half Marathon Championships."It would be hugely exciting for Cardiff to host this event which further compliments the city's vast sporting event portfolio, promoting it to an international audience."Before the start of the marathon, there was a minute's applause in tribute to Paralympian wheelchair athlete Chris Hallam, who died in August.Hallam, from Pontypool, won medals at three Paralympic Games as well as twice winning the London Marathon.A number of roads are closed until 14:00 BST.King Edward VII Avenue, from Boulevard de Nantes to its junction with City Hall Road will be shut until 18:00 BST on Monday.Rolling road closures will be applied along the half marathon's route. Roads around the route are also affected, including North Road, which leads to the start line on Castle Street. Diversions are in place.</body>

      <body>Companies in Wales could do more to export goods to new markets, according to the South Wales Chamber of Commerce.Director Graham Morgan said businesses should create more opportunities to tap into emerging markets.Wales exported £633m worth of goods to the Middle East in 2012, making it the fourth most popular destination.The Welsh government said international trade remains a priority. A Royal Bank of Scotland report said firms could use markets like Mexico and Brazil more.Mr Morgan told BBC Wales Today: "There are certainly a range of mechanisms in place to move into new markets."I think there's probably a shortfall in the number of businesses that have fantastic products and fantastic services but don't appreciate that they can now be sold in overseas markets."And the more we can get business proprietors to think in terms of where they can be making headway in what has been a difficult economic market, the better for Wales."Chris Howarth, managing director of confectionery company Bon Bon Buddies in Blackwood, Caerphilly county, said it was challenging trading across different parts of world.He said: "You have to get it right in a completely different cultural environment so you have to be committed to learning a different set of rules of the game... every single market is different."The Welsh government said they have a programme of trade missions and exhibitions in place which will take in markets including China, India, Brazil and Russia.</body>

      <body>Swansea City defender Ben Davies is likely to miss Wales' World Cup qualifiers against Macedonia and Belgium.Davies, 20, appears to have suffered a hamstring injury in the 2-0 defeat at Southampton.Swansea manager Michael Laudrup says Davies will have a scan on Monday on an injury he picked up towards the end of the game at St Mary's Stadium."It seems like Ben Davies got injured in the last ten minutes," said Laudrup."It's his hamstring and we are hoping it's just a strain, so he will be out for two or three weeks."I hope not, but we will see tomorrow. He will miss them (Wales qualifiers) and maybe one or two games for us."He will have a scan and then we will know."Wales manager Chris Coleman is already without Real Madrid striker Gareth Bale, Liverpool's Joe Allen, Brighton's Andrew Crofts and Celtic Joe Ledley.Wales host Macedonia on 11 October and then play in Belgium four days later.Laudrup saw his Swansea side go 1-0 down to an early goal to Southampton on the 18th minute strike by Adam LallanaThe Swans manager saw his side dominate proceedings with Saints keeper Artur Boruc saving brilliantly from Michu while Nathan Dyer struck the post.Jay Rodriguez's late volley sealed the win for the home side and Swansea have now won only one in four and slip to 14th in the Premier LeagueLaudrup admitted he was at a loss at how his Swans side had lost top Southampton but did admit they are being punished for any mistake they make."We dominated part of the game and the negative part is the loss," said Laudrup"We have been severely punished lately. Against Arsenal they had four chances and scored two goals. We saw three chance and two goals today."At the other end we created but in some games we are not convincing with the last shot or pass. We had the chances we just had to take them."We had chances in the first half but dominated the second half. It seemed like they were looking at the watch the whole time and we kept coming at them."They were under pressure and every time we lost the ball we got it back."We didn't create as much in the second half as we did in the first, but I still expected an equalising goal. It didn't arrive and then they counter-attack and it was 2-0 and game over."</body>

      <body>Early morning and evening train services between Harlech and Porthmadog in Gwynedd are being suspended from Monday for repairs on an unsafe pylon.Arriva Trains Wales said engineers need to stabilise the pylon in the estuary of the River Dwyryd near Porthmadog.The Cambrian Coast Line railway is at risk from the overhead cables falling and a precautionary 100 metre exclusion zone has been set up .Daytime services should not be affected, the train company said.Engineers will monitor the situation between 07.20 to 18.45 to ensure it is safe to operate a train service under the cables, it said in a statement.Day time services, including school train services, are not expected to be affected by the repair work however they may be subject to last minute delays or cancelations.One of the foundations which supports the pylon at Llandecwyn has eroded, causing it to list slightly and National Grid engineers are due to work on it.Trains will run at booked times between Machynlleth and Harlech, and Porthmadog and Pwllheli with replacement road transport operating between Harlech and Porthmadog.The unsafe pylon has also led to road closures and local diversions which means the replacement road transport is unable to call at Llandecwyn station.A spokesman said customers were advised to check their website for service updates before travelling.</body>

      <title>Military honours for female winchman</title>
      <description>Two servicemen from Port Talbot and Swansea, including one who helped in a a daring sea rescue off Milford Haven, recognised.</description>

      <body>The only female winchman in the RAF has been named in a list of military honours for her part in a daring sea rescue.Sgt Rachael Robinson, 37, from Devon, is among 117 servicemen and women recognised in the latest Operational Honours and Awards List.She saved a fisherman's life in a Force 8 gale in March, 50 nautical miles west of Milford Haven.Her Queen's Gallantry Medal is awarded "for exemplary acts of bravery."The Queen will present the medals at an Investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace later this year.Sgt Robinson was repeatedly smashed against the deck of a French fishing vessel as she dangled from an RAF Sea King helicopter on March 21.She and her pilot and handler Flt Lt Christian Wilkins, 28, from Port Talbot - who received the Air Force Cross for his part in the rescue - tried six times to reach a Portuguese crew member, who had cut his head open on a door and needed urgent help.A lifeboat was unable to reach the 25 metre fishing vessel because of the terrible weather conditions, but after three further attempts Sgt Robinson was able to get onboard."It was like running into a wall," she said.Her citation said that despite being "repeatedly battered against the boat", causing her "great pain", Sgt Robinson - who said she sometimes attracts quizzical looks doing such a tough "man's job" - "never once gave up".Also among those honoured is Sgt Michael Catarall, who dodged Taliban bullets to run across 100 metres of open ground to save an injured Afghan.Sgt Catarall, 32, of The Mercian Regiment, was a Fire Support Group commander in Kopak, central Helmand province, on November 5 last year when he risked his life to save a seriously wounded Afghan National Army (ANA) soldier.The ANA soldier had been shot in the leg, clipping his artery, and was trapped with gunfire all around him.Sgt Catarall, from Stockport, commanded his driver to drive through a suspected mine field to reach him before running the last 100 metres "with rounds landing at their feet and flashing past their heads"."The first 10 metres we were just laughing our heads off at each other saying 'this is horrendous'," he said."We got to him and didn't have a translator and he just looked at us to say 'what happens now?' We put an arm under his legs but the small arms contact [gun attacks]continued. The casualty suddenly got the urge to hop."Sgt Catarall, who was commended for showing "complete disregard for his own safety", was mentioned in despatches.Twenty-five-year-old Capt Owen Davis, from Swansea, a marine who spent a year learning Pashto so he could accompany the Afghan Local Police (ALP) as they took over from international troops in Afghanistan Helmand province, was also honoured for his service.Capt Davis, who speaks six languages, was awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross - one of the highest military honours.He worked as a cultural advisor in a fragile stretch of Nahri Saraj and the upper Gereshk Valley, which was being targeted by Taliban fighters.He was recognised for feats of leadership in battle and overcoming cultural boundaries which saw him live and work with his Afghan officers for several months - even sharing a bed with them for weeks at a time."I went a bit Lawrence of Arabia," Capt Davis said, as he described how the men listened to Pashto poetry and music together.Capt Davis was blown off his feet by a grenade in a raid on a Taliban stronghold on June 13 last year, just seconds after an Afghan colleague was shot next to him.He managed to jump backwards over the compound wall and continue the assault, in which all insurgents were killed."During the incident you don't really think," he said. "You want to get the job done and prevent anyone else from getting hurt and all get out in one piece. Because any time you lose a friend or colleague it is the worst feeling on earth."The names of military personnel from all three services are included in the latest operational honours list, published in the London Gazette.Men and women are nominated by their commanding officers every six months in recognition of their bravery.Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: "As we enter the final phases of combat operations in Afghanistan, British forces deserve our recognition and gratitude for their role in helping to keep us safe in the UK."</body>

      <body>Wales prop Gethin Jenkins returned for the Cardiff Blues in this comfortable home Pro12 win over Edinburgh.Jenkins, 32, had been out of action for four months with a calf injury following the British and Irish Lions' tour of Australia.Wing Alex Cuthbert scored two tries to give the hosts a second win of the season.Leigh halfpenny registered the rest of the Blues points, while captain Grieg Laidlaw scored Edinburgh's points.Jenkins played for 60 minutes and his return to action, with the autumn internationals looming in November, will have been welcomed by Wales coach Warren Gatland.This was a confidence-boosting win for a young Blues side which had won just one of their previous four Pro12 games.The return of prop Jenkins and lock Bradley Davies, who was back after serving a suspension, added some much-needed experience and power to the Blues.But this was a scrappy performance by the home side, dominated by too many unforced errors and too many loose kicks.They were in control in the opening passages of the game but had little to show for all their territory and possession against an Edinburgh side who find themselves bottom of the Pro12.Halfpenny proved a great comfort in the early part of this game and the Lions man of the series finished with a personal tally of 19 points.He and Laidlaw swapped early penalties before the Blues finally crossed for wing Cuthbert's first try.Centre Owen Williams' grubber kick was snapped up by Harry Robinson before he put Williams away with his inside pass.Williams was tackled on the visitors' 22m line but a simple passing movement saw Cuthbert finish off the move in the right hand corner with a try.Halfpenny converted Cuthbert's try before Laidlaw replied with his third and fourth penalty to claw his side back to within a point of their hosts to make it 13-12 at the break.Laidlaw missed a chance to give Edinburgh the lead straight after half-time when his fifth penalty hit the post.The Scots did think they had scored a try when flanker Tomas Leonardi claimed he had scored after Edinburgh had been held up on the Blues try line.But the video referee ruled that he had made a double movement and ruled out the score and the home side cleared their line.Halfpenny replied with three quick penalties to give his side a 10-point cushion midway through the second half with a 22-12 lead.The Blues then took full advantage of Edinburgh being a man down after they lost replacement Cornell du Preez for 10 minutes as he was show a yellow card.Cuthbert finished the Blues' second try when fly half Rhys Patchell launched an attack from deep inside his own half, with centre Cory Allen, Halfpenny and Sam Warburton all combining to put the big wing in under the posts.Cuthbert thought he had scored a hat-track for the Blues five minutes from time but the video referee ruled he had been held up over the line.Cardiff Blues: Leigh Halfpenny; Alex Cuthbert, Owen Williams, Cory Allen, Harry Robinson; Rhys Patchell, Lloyd Williams; Gethin Jenkins, Matthew Rees (capt), Taufa'ao Filise, Bradley Davies, Filo Paulo, Josh Navidi, Sam Warburton, Andries Pretorius.Replacements: Kristian Dacey, Scott Andrews, Sam Hobbs, Lou Reed, Robin Copeland, Lewis Jones, Gareth Davies, Dafydd Hewitt.Edinburgh: Jack Cuthbert, Dougie Fife, Joaquin Dominguez, Ben Atiga, Tim Visser, Harry Leonard, Greig Laidlaw (capt), Alasdair Dickinson, Ross Ford, Willem Nel, Sean Cox, Izak van der Westhuizen, Dimitri Basilaia, Tomas Leonardi, David Denton.Replacements: James Hilterbrand, Wicus Blaauw, Geoff Cross, Ollie Atkins, Cornell Du Preez, Sean Kennedy, Matt Scott, Sam Hidalgo-Clyne.Referee: George Clancy (IRFU)Assistant Referees: Neil Hennessy, Neil Perkins (both WRU)Citing Commissioner: Denis Jones (WRU)TMO: Gareth Simmonds (WRU)</body>

      <title>Resort revamp sees homes demolished</title>

      <body>Demolition work has started on the next phase of a project to regenerate a Denbighshire seaside town.The county council secured over £8m to buy and flatten run some down properties in Rhyl and create a new green space as part of its plans.The work at Gronant Street comes amid news the council failed to secure £12m to revamp another part of the resort.The council said it was "bitterly disappointed" but regeneration of the town centre was still its priority.The demolition work began in 2011 with the clearing of some properties just away from the town centre at Aquarium Street.Last year emergency action was taken to start the process to demolish the former Honey Club nightclub over concerns about safety of the building.Work has since started on developing that site into a hotel.Last month, the council was informed it had lost a bid to be shortlisted for a share of the Welsh government's £90m Vibrant and Viable Places fund which it hoped to use to "change the face of Rhyl town centre".The council wanted £12m over three years for its regeneration as work continues on other projects around the resort, including a multi-million pound overhaul of Rhyl Harbour.In a statement, Denbighshire leader Councillor Hugh Evans said the council was making "urgent enquiries" to seek money from other sources, including a £5m Welsh government fund for smaller projects.He added: "We believe that our proposals for investment in the town centre would have been the final piece in the jigsaw that Rhyl needed to return to its rightful place as a prosperous, successful and attractive seaside town."</body>

      <title>Church seeks visibility with revamp</title>
      <description>A south Wales valleys' church with a landmark spire needs to become "more visible" in the community after a proposed £1.2m revamp, says its warden.</description>

      <body>A south Wales valleys' church with a landmark spire needs to become "more visible" in the community after a proposed £1.2m revamp, says its warden.The plans for St Elvan's Church in Aberdare, Rhondda Cynon Taf, include a cafe, a mezzanine floor and a gallery in the bell tower.The altar would be moved to the church's centre to allow "interactive" services with the congregation.Warden David Lewis said the church must be more welcoming.The Grade II*-listed church was built in 1852. Its 180ft (55m) spire is a dominant local landmark.It is part of the Diocese of Llandaff and the proposals before the diocesan advisory committee include an arts and craft centre inside and an exhibition area.A mezzanine level above the proposed cafe would be for community use while more room would be created on a galley level in the bell tower.The church also aims to cater for theatre groups, concerts and town celebrations by removing pews on those occasions.Its north door would have a glass fronted foyer entrance, possibly housing a tourist information centre.Church leaders have bid for £500,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund for the improvements which they say aims to make it "fit for the 21st Century".Mr Lewis said: "Despite our central position on the mound and the huge tower, we have become invisible to the town and that is what we want to overcome by making this building more welcoming."We need to be more visible."This church, with its 180ft spire, towers above Aberdare and was central to its development. We want to ensure that it is central to the continuing life of this town."Christina Davies, the wife of Aberdare's vicar, the Reverend Robert Davies, said parishioners backed the plans as a way of rejuvenating worship."There is an opportunity to have an altar in the centre of the church and interactive services which will particularly make a difference for the young people," she said.A report into the future of the Church in Wales last July looked into how the church could adapt to cope with the decline in clergy, falling congregations, a surplus number of churches and a large repair bill for its buildings.A Church in Wales spokeswoman said: "Local parishes are responsible for running their churches - paying bills, maintaining buildings and raising money for initiatives to enhance their use."As many of our churches are listed buildings, grants from Cadw or the Heritage Lottery Fund are sometimes available for improvement schemes that can assure their future."</body>

      <title>Mackay unhappy with first half display</title>
      <description>Manager Malky Mackay says Cardiff City's poor first-half performance proved costly in the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle.</description>

      <date>1381004630</date>
      <body>Manager Malky Mackay says Cardiff's lacklustre performance in the first half was the reason for the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle.The Bluebirds found themselves 2-0 at half-time to Newcastle thanks to two goals by striker Loic Remy,But Cardiff mounted a spirited comeback with striker Peter Odemwingie scoring his first goal."We started really slowly and you cannot give good teams and players time and space on the ball," said Mackay."You end up being punished, and we were in the first half. We made a couple of changes at half-time and had a few words."In the second half, we saw the team that I know and that is the way we have been playing during the last few weeks."We know the players are good enough and I know the players have got it in them to play the way they did in the second half to pen Newcastle in."We have to make sure we play, because in this league, you are punished if you don't."Without the heroics of goalkeeper David Marshall, the home side would have been dead and buried at half-time. He produced a string of outstanding saves to keep his side in the game.The Bluebird may have left themselves too much to do after a poor first 45 minutes, but dominated the second half as Newcastle tried to defend their lead.The introduction of Jordan Mutch changed the game for Cardiff as he created Odemwingie's first goal for the club and missed a chance to level the scores in the dying moments.Mackay, who saw his Cardiff side slump to their second successive home defeat in the Premier League, says he believed his side were capable of salvaging a point against Newcastle."We had great momentum and had balls flashing across their box," said Mackay."We had three or four (chances) which did not break properly for us."I thought at one point the second goal was definitely coming, because we played really well in the second half."</body>

      <body>Language campaigners say they will start a campaign of non-violent direct action unless government policies to protect Welsh are put in place.The motion with a deadline of February 2014 was passed at the Welsh Language Society's (Cymdeithas Yr Iaith's) annual meeting in Carno, Powys.The 2011 census figures showed a drop in the number of Welsh speakers.The Welsh government said it was committed to seeing the language prosper.A Welsh government spokesperson said: "Cymdeithas must understand that those in government are as committed to growing the Welsh language and increasing the number of Welsh speakers as they are."This is not the 1960s or 70s."Welsh Language Society chairman Robin Farrar said: "Nearly a year has passed since we saw the results of the census, and since then there has been a lot of talk and discussion about the situation regarding the language."There is by now a consensus that the Welsh language is facing an emergency and that we need big policy changes."We have said since the publication of the census results that we can't sit back and accept the consequences, with positive campaigning and political will we can change our destiny and the destinies of our Welsh language communities."If the government refuses to act on the six points we have outlined we will take direct but non-violent action."We have drawn up a list of people who are willing to act - campaigns like this have worked in the past and we're ready to do it again."The Welsh government spokesperson added: "We are committed to promoting the Welsh language and since the census results we have been taking action. "He said measures included a national conversation on the language, which gave everyone a chance to have their say on how best to secure its future."We have commissioned a number of reviews and studies, and will be receiving their reports soon. This autumn we will also be launching an information campaign for Welsh medium education."Meanwhile, we will be working with all those with an interest in the language to ensure it continues to thrive throughout Wales."</body>

      <title>200 at demolished mural protest</title>
      <description>About 200 campaigners protest at the site of a demolished mural of the 1839 Chartist uprising after failing to have it preserved.</description>

      <body>About 200 campaigners have protested at the site of a demolished mural after failing to have it preserved.The artwork depicted the 1839 Chartist uprising in a subway off John Frost Square in Newport was created in the 1978.But Newport council removed the 35m (115ft) mosaic as part of a £100m shopping centre development.It said it would cost £600,000 to save and move the mural.The diggers moved in on Thursday, a fortnight after heritage body Cadw declined to list the 1970s mosaic which was in a city centre subway off John Frost Square.Pippa Bartolotti from the Wales Green Party said the council demolishing the mural has "woken a sleeping giant"."It's just a pile of rubbish on the floor," she said."I managed to retrieve some. There's likely to be a couple of hundred (at the protest). I think people have had enough, this has upset a lot of people."Peter Rawcliffe, chair of Save Our Mural, told BBC Radio Wales people are "incandescent" at the council's actions."It's in bits, and we're hoping to be able to make a memorial out of the bits for the people of Newport," he said."We're asking the city council to make a decision to let us have the rest of the mural."On Thursday protesters shouted at workers as the demolition started, before barriers were pulled down and some people rushed through.The mural was created in 1978 by artist Kenneth Budd who used 200,000 pieces of tile and glass.It celebrated the bloody rebellion led by the Chartist leader John Frost, a magistrate and mayor of Newport who was forced out of office for his radical views.A champion of universal suffrage, he led a march of around 3,000 people in to the town and a confrontation with troops positioned at the Westgate Hotel which left many protesters dead.Frost was convicted of treason and sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered but this was commuted to transportation.He survived and later returned to Britain, where he continued to campaign for political reform until his death aged 93.Around 4,000 people signed a petition calling for the artwork to be saved.Wales' heritage body Cadw said the artwork did not meet its "special architectural interest" criteria for listing.Previously, the artwork faced demolition in 2009 under a development proposal that was later scrapped.The council called in consultants who advised that moving the art work would cost at least £600,000.A report to the council said there were "real risks that the mural would not survive such a move".A spokeswoman for Newport Council said it would consult with the public on a replacement to mark the Chartists.</body>

      <body>Land used by fly-tippers has been turned into a community fishery and recreation area in Denbighshire.The £170,000 project saw 40,000 tonnes of material excavated at Rhyl Cut to create a pool and the earth used to build a mountain bike trail and traffic-free route for walkers.The land had become an official dumping ground for years before the clean-up began in March.Now the plan is to extend it as a "green corridor" through Rhyl.Denbighshire council countryside officer Garry Davies said the transformed site has been well received by residents, leading to a community fishing club being set up.There is now a five-year plan being drawn up to try to secure funds to cut a green route through the town to provide a traffic-free route."Because of the work started here we think we can do it," he said.In order to create the fishing area thousands of tonnes of material was removed from the Cut's flood alleviation channel to improve drainage.It has since been used to create a near two-mile (3km) mountain bike course at the former tip at Glan Morfa at nearby Marsh Road.ScottishPower relocated a high power electricity cable which was in the excavation area.And the adjacent landowner at Marine Holiday Park allowed a path to be laid across the site.The land falls within a Communities First area regarded as deprived.Natural Resources Wales (NRW) is stocking the pool with roach, bream and rudd.Local school children are due to help with their release next week.Tim Jones from NRW said: "This project will enable the community and especially young people to enjoy the natural environment."It has transformed what was once an eyesore and a hazard to the public into an asset the people of Rhyl South West can be proud of."The Federation of Welsh Anglers has agreed to show local people how to fish when the Cut is officially opened on 11 October.</body>

      <body>Plans to turn an empty warehouse in a "fantastic" location on the banks of the Menai Strait into a heritage centre have received a funding boost.The Prince's Pier building in Menai Bridge will also host office space as part of the £195,000 scheme.It is one of four projects in Gwynedd and Anglesey to receive grants from the Welsh government.An environmental scheme in Caernarfon, a heritage centre in Amlwch and several town centres will also benefit."The building at Menai Bridge is basically an empty 19th Century warehouse which Menter Mon bought from Anglesey Council years ago, but there's been no budget to do it up until now," said Neil Johnstone, the heritage manager with regeneration body Menter Mon."It'll be a joint enterprise between us and the Menai Bridge Heritage Trust which will use part of the space to display the history of the two bridges."The location really is fantastic as you can see the Telford bridge from the building."To enable the centre to generate an income two office units will also be developed.In Amlwch, a £160,000 grant will be used to refurbish the Sail Loft heritage centre in the town's port, improving access and moving the cafe and exhibition space around.It is a joint venture with the Amlwch Industrial Heritage Trust.Cartrefi Cymunedol Gwynedd plan to use £120,000 to improve the area around the Bro Seiont housing estate in Caernarfon, including upgrading street lighting.Across Gwynedd and Anglesey £500,000 will go towards the continuation of town centre improvements.Councillor John Wynn Jones, Gwynedd Council cabinet member for the economy, said: "We are delighted to be able to secure additional funding to support Gwynedd's town improvement grant."The scheme that has been in place for a number of years is open to town centre shops and businesses to improve the front exterior of their properties."Grants of 50% up to £70,000 are available for eligible businesses."The housing and regeneration minister Carl Sargeant said the grants demonstrated the "commitment" of the Welsh government to local projects and local communities.</body>

      <body>Two goals in three minutes by Dan Fitchett and Angus MacDonald earned a good home win for Salisbury.Wrexham had led at half time after Joe Anyinsah lifted the ball into the top of the net from Brett Ormerod's quick throw-in.But Fitchett's 79th-minute header was followed by a cheeky back-heeled finish by MacDonald three minutes later.And MacDonald denied Wrexham an equaliser when he cleared Robert Ogleby's shot off the line.Salisbury City manager Mikey Harris told BBC Wiltshire:"I'm absolutely delighted with our resolve from being 1-0 down against the run of play. I felt like we could come back and I made a couple of changes at half-time."In the second half we showed that bit of quality and we got our rewards."Angus's goal was something pretty special that would grace any league."Really delighted with the way the lads have worked for each other and put their bodies on the line."Wrexham manager Andy Morrell told BBC Radio Wales: "There's so many positives to take from the game today, but we just keep conceding goals. One today was a back-heel which was an unbelievable goal really when you watch it back again."We were comfortable for 70 minutes, no problems, no issues, then one sloppy back pass and they're in behind us and they've headed in our net and then we're under pressure. Everything that can go wrong is going wrong."</body>

      <body>A murder trial jury has heard how a burglar told police he grabbed a 65-year-old Wrexham woman "until she became limp".The body of Glynis Solmaz was found at her Caia Park home in February.At the Mold Crown Court trial, Alexandros Wetherill, 24, of Wrexham, and Christopher Curran, 34, of Brymbo, Wrexham deny murdering the pensioner.They and two men have pleaded guilty to conspiring to burgle the property at Bryn Hafod.During proceedings on Friday, the court heard details of statements made to police by Wetherill, who has admitted the manslaughter of Mrs Solmaz.He told officers: "When I grabbed hold of her she sort of screamed and I said for her to calm down and don't struggle."She grabbed a lamp from a small cabinet and swung it back at me."At the same time she pushed backwards and I put my head down to avoid being hit and we ended up on the bed with her on top of me."I tightened my grip and she went limp and I lowered her off the bed onto the floor. I thought I'd choked her but I didn't do it deliberately."It is alleged that Wetherill restrained his victim during the burglary after failing to remove a safe from a wall in the spare bedroom.The prosecution say that Curran was there to remove the safe. He is charged with murder on a joint enterprise basis, that he did nothing to help Mrs Solmaz, or alert the authorities, after it is claimed he saw her being restrained on the floor.In evidence from Home Office pathologist, Dr Jonathan Medcalf, the cause of death was given as "mechanical asphyxiation".The jury was told that Mrs Solmaz had suffered "forceful neck compression", with fractures to parts of the neck structures.Mrs Solmaz' former son-in-law Christopher Natt, 52, of Ponciau, and 29-year-old David Lovell of Brymbo, have pleaded guilty alongside the other two defendants to conspiring to burgle.The defence case is expected to begin next week and the trial continues.</body>

      <title>Town cemetery extension opening</title>

      <body>The Bishop of St Asaph led a ceremony to mark the opening of an extension at a Flintshire town cemetery that was years in the planning.With just six plots remaining, work began in May to level land on a sloping section adjoining Mold Cemetery.The town council had spent years trying to find an alternative site for a new cemetery before deciding to extend the site off Alexandra Road.The space is expected to add an extra 15 years to the life of the cemetery.It will be able to accommodate 360 new burial plots.Bishop of St Asaph the Right Reverend Gregory Cameron consecrated the site at a special ceremony on Thursday.He said: "When you think about consecrating a bit of land, it seems like a very straightforward, ordinary thing to do."But when you think of all the people that go to be buried there, of all the love and life and experience as well as those who remember and mourn, it actually becomes a very significant thing to be doing."A report by consultants said it was one of the few places left in the area for burials, with churchyards mostly full.The cemetery, which opened in 1877, has more than 4,000 plots which house two or even three burials. There are also more than 200 sites for cremated remains.A cemetery costing almost £1m opened in neighbouring Connah's Quay in 2010 to address an "urgent need" for local burial space.Woodland burials promising a "return to nature" have just been approved to take place at the cemetery on Kelsterton Lane.</body>

      <body>Students are staging a protest over the future of Aberystwyth University's Welsh-medium hall of residence, Pantycelyn.The university is currently developing new halls at Penglais Farm, which means Pantycelyn may be redeveloped.The hall has been traditionally where Welsh-speaking students stay, and where Prince Charles spent a term in 1969.The Welsh-language students' union claimed the new halls would harm the Welsh-speaking student community."The new student village is completely unsuitable," said the president of Undeb Myfyrwyr Cymraeg Aberystwyth (UMCA), Mared Ifan.She said the new £45m Penglais Farm development would not have an office for the union or a canteen.She said it would also lack sufficient space for the Pantycelyn eisteddfod group to meet and practice."These are elements that are absolutely essential in maintaining our community of Welsh students," she said."After the lack of consultation on these plans, students have completely lost faith in the university."University officials have insisted that the college is investing in "high standard" accommodation at Penglais Farm, with en suite self-catering flats featuring between six and eight bedrooms each."As part of the development there will be a dedicated area for Welsh language students with a particular social area for Welsh speakers," said a spokesperson."The university will continue its discussions with Welsh-medium students, the Pantycelyn Hall committee and UMCA about the Penglais Farm facilities and how to build and develop the Welsh language ethos there."The college said Pantycelyn would remain in use as Welsh-medium hall until at least the end of the 2014-2015 academic year.Officials said a business exercise was now under way to explore options for the site beyond those dates.</body>

      <body>Police officers who investigated the disappearance and murder of schoolgirl April Jones have been honoured for their "truly outstanding work".Dyfed-Powys Police won the policing excellence award at the Police Federation National Detectives Forum (PDNDF).The force was praised for its work that led to the arrest and conviction of killer Mark Bridger.Five-year-old April, from Machynlleth, Powys, was snatched in October 2012.Paul Ford, secretary of the PDNDF forum, which was set up to represent detectives in Wales and England, said: "This investigation brought out the very best in true team working to deliver justice for April, her family and the local community."PDNDF wish to recognise the truly outstanding policing excellence displayed by Dyfed-Powys Police, the wider police family and those who supported this investigation and helped in the delivery of justice."Det Supt Andy John, who led the investigation, said: "We are delighted as a team to have been presented with this award."Our focus was always to secure justice for April and her family, and we could not have achieved this without the support and assistance of so many officers and staff in Dyfed-Powys but also all the other forces and agencies throughout the UK, it was a huge team effort."April went missing while playing outside her home on the Bryn y Gog estate but was never found despite the largest search in UK police history.The hunt took in 2,000 hours of CCTV evidence and nearly 5,000 calls and messages from the public.The investigation was unprecedented in the UK, in terms of its scale and the terrain covered.Neighbouring forces and specialist teams helped focus on more than 20 locations around Machynlleth.Around 200 local volunteers gathered at a leisure centre to join the search after news of April's disappearance spread on social media.The operation led to 600 messages from the public to police, and the search involved 100 mountain rescue volunteers, 100 police specialist searchers, 20 dog handlers, as well as coastguards and two RNLI craft.Bridger, 47, from Ceinws, near Machynlleth, was convicted of April's abduction and murder at the end of a four-week trial at Mold Crown Court in May.He will never be released from prison.Last week hundreds of people attended April's funeral in her home town, almost a year after she was abducted and murdered.About 200 people walked behind the funeral cortege as it travelled from her home to a nearby church.</body>

      <body>Funding for a £75m campus replacing a high school, a further education college and a leisure centre is being sought from the Welsh government.Powys council and Neath Port Talbot College (NPTC) have been invited to submit "an outline case for funding" for their scheme in Brecon.The council agreed in April to spend £400,000 to develop the plans and work on initial designs for the campus.The project is part of a schools modernisation project in Powys.Mark Dacey, chief executive of NPTC Group which recently merged with Coleg Powys, said: "We are paving the way for an opportunity to build a centre of learning that will surpass anything that is currently available in Wales or the UK."The proposal brings together a partnership including the school, the Brecon Beacons campus of the NPTC Group, leisure facilities and the wider community."The campus would replace the existing secondary school, the college building and the town's leisure centre.Powys council said in April that building work, on land near the current school, could start as early as April 2015.Cabinet member for learning Myfanwy Alexander said: "The £75m development will enable the learners, people and businesses in the region to make a positive contribution to the economy while promoting personal and community well being."While we have developed initial proposals that could see the campus run as an 11-16 secondary school; a sixth form and vocational college; [and] a leisure centre with a range of other council and third sector services, we will be consulting with the community about how this exciting project can be delivered."The council said consultation with "key stakeholders" was planned for later this month, while the public would have their chance to respond at an event on 6 November.</body>

But with brand names leaving, there are a number of empty units."The closure of the magistrates' court, we're also losing our post office and the citizens advice bureau has gone - it's one thing after another.""The town will be massively enhanced by these new facilities."</body>

      <title>Scarlets lacked composure - Easterby</title>
      <description>Coach Simon Easterby says Scarlets lacked composure in the later stages of their 17-12 home defeat against Glasgow.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/24417218</url>
      <date>1381050920</date>
      <body>Scarlets coach Simon Easterby felt his side lacked composure at crucial times during their 17-12 defeat by Glasgow.The Scottish visitors maintained their 100% record in the Pro12 in spite of twice being reduced to 14 men in the second half at Parc y Scarlets."We lost our composure a little bit in the latter stages of the game," said Easterby."We had opportunities to score more than just three points and we just didn't take those."Scarlets were outscored two tries to nil, but kept in touch thanks to the boot of fly-half Rhys Priestland.He kicked three penalties to get them back to 14-9 early in the second half, and after he suffered a slight injury Jordan Williams also kicked a penalty to get the Scarlets back to within two points.Williams was also involved in two other crucial moments.He had the try line at his mercy when he chose to pass to full-back Liam Williams, who was held up short.And he narrowly missed a late penalty after man-of-the-match Niko Matawalu was yellow-carded with six minutes remaining.However, Easterby blamed a collective lack of coolness under pressure for the defeat."I suppose you have to credit Glasgow for the way they played, but also we'll be disappointed a little bit in some of our composure and accuracy in particular in that first half," said the former Ireland international."It was disappointing really because we played some good stuff at times, but we just didn't get that final pass or missed a couple of tackles which allowed them to get a bit of momentum."</body>

      <title>New measles case prompts concerns</title>
      <description>Pupils are being offered MMR jabs at a Neath Port Talbo school after a case of measles was confirmed three months after outbreak in area ended.</description>

      <body>More than 200 children are being offered MMR vaccinations at a Neath Port Talbot high school after a fresh case of measles there.Public Health Wales (PHW) said it has received two notifications of measles in pupils at Cwmtawe School with one case laboratory confirmed.It comes three months after Wales' biggest measles outbreak ended.The first cases in Swansea were reported last November before spreading to mid Wales.More than 75,000 were vaccinated during the outbreak throughout Wales.But experts say more than 30,000 children in the 10 to 18 age group still remain unvaccinated.Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board is arranging for MMR vaccinations to be offered next week to all pupils at the school who are not fully vaccinated.Of 1,260 pupils, 62 are recorded as having received no doses of the MMR vaccine and 142 have received only one dose.Two doses are needed to provide the maximum 99% protection against measles, say experts.PHW communicable disease control consultant Dr Jorg Hoffmann said: "This case of measles comes only three months after the end of Wales' biggest ever measles outbreak... so we are obviously concerned and want to act quickly."Although we vaccinated more than 75,000 people during the outbreak, we are aware of more than 30,000 children in the 10 to 18 age group who remain unvaccinated in Wales and have always warned that this could lead to another outbreak."We have written today to all parents of unvaccinated children in Cwmtawe School to urge them to arrange for their children to be vaccinated."In the meantime, to prevent the spread of infection, we would urge parents of any children who become unwell with measles-like symptoms over the weekend to keep them at home and seek medical advice, and not to allow them to attend events where other children will be present."The symptoms of measles include a fever, fatigue, runny nose, conjunctivitis and a distinctive red rash.By the time the outbreak was declared over after six months, it had resulted in 1,219 notifications of measles cases in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, Hywel Dda and Powys health board areas.Some 88 people visited a hospital due to measles during the outbreak.Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, from Swansea, died from pneumonia after contracting measles at the height of the epidemic.</body>

      <title>Trees in ancient forest are felled</title>
      <description>The felling of diseased trees across an area the size of around 300 football pitches is taking place at Wales' largest ancient woodland.</description>

      <date>1380916448</date>
      <body>The felling of diseased trees across an area the size of around 300 football pitches is taking place at Wales' largest ancient woodland.Larch trees at Wentwood Forest, near Newport, have become infected with the fungal disease Phytophthora ramorum.The infection can kill trees and has spread across the UK after being found in south west England four years ago.The Woodland Trust, which owns most of the forest, said the felling of the trees was essential."This is the most serious and devastating action we've had to take on our estate," said the trust's head of woodland management, Andrew Sharkey."It again highlights both the need to tackle tree disease and the importance of restoring as much of our damaged ancient woodland to make it more resilient in decades to come."Felling the infected conifers across an area of 200 hectares (500 acres) will leave the Woodland Trust with a £35,000 bill for replanting in the forest.It also hits restoration work that has been taking place since the trust bought 352 hectares (869 acres) of Wentwood in 2006."Our aim was to prevent clear felling at Wentwood from happening. However, there is no alternative," explained Rory Francis, also from the trust."We are hoping that the action will slow down the spread of the infection or perhaps halt it."Wentwood Forest is the remains of the ancient tree cover that stretched from the River Wye to the River Usk.Conifers were first introduced to the wood in 1880, and much of the forest cleared to provide timber for trenches in World War I.When it was replanted in the 1950s and 1960s, the once abundant broadleaf trees were replaced with imported conifers, ultimately damaging the forest floor and its natural formation.The forest is spread out over 400 hectares (1,000 acres) and is home to 75 species of birds, including turtle doves, nightjars and spotted flycatchers, and is a habitat for dormice, otters, and pipistrelle bats.It is also a home to wild bluebells, wood sorrel and wild daffodils."Every time you have to clear-fell, the risk is that the shock of the sudden change in conditions stresses some of the native species and they could be lost," said Mr Francis."So in the short term, it will have a negative impact. We don't want to do it but it is a legal requirement."Natural Resources Wales (NRW), which manages most of the remaining forest, said it had already invested £500,000 across Wales to halt the spread of the infection, and was setting aside another £2m to tackle the problem.The disease has recently been discovered at Bwlch Nant-yr-Arian near Aberystwyth and at Cwmcarn Forest Drive in Caerphilly county borough.The infection has also spread to parts of north Wales, at Coed Maentwrog near Porthmadog, and at Coed Cymerau near Blaenau Ffestiniog.It has also affected larches across south west England, Northern Ireland and the west of Scotland."The felling in Wentwood Forest is very sad but this prompt action by the Woodland Trust is essential to try to slow the spread of this devastating disease," said John Browne, from NRW."Our ultimate aim is to make our forests more resilient to pests and diseases and we are heartened that the Woodland Trust is to seize this opportunity to undertake change of structure and species within Wentwood Forest by planting native broadleaves."The felled larch trees will be replaced with a mix of oak and cherry trees, and other broadleaf native trees."In some ways it will actually accelerate the work to plant native trees, but it is not in the circumstances we would have preferred," added the trust's Mr Francis.</body>

      <body>Companies in Wales could do more to export goods to new markets, according to the South Wales Chamber of Commerce.Director Graham Morgan said businesses should create more opportunities to tap into emerging markets.Wales exported £633m worth of goods to the Middle East in 2012, making it the fourth most popular destination.The Welsh government said international trade remains a priority. A Royal Bank of Scotland report said firms could use markets like Mexico and Brazil more.Mr Morgan told BBC Wales Today: "There are certainly a range of mechanisms in place to move into new markets."I think there's probably a shortfall in the number of businesses that have fantastic products and fantastic services but don't appreciate that they can now be sold in overseas markets."And the more we can get business proprietors to think in terms of where they can be making headway in what has been a difficult economic market, the better for Wales."Chris Howarth, managing director of confectionery company Bon Bon Buddies in Blackwood, Caerphilly county, said it was challenging trading across different parts of world.He said: "You have to get it right in a completely different cultural environment so you have to be committed to learning a different set of rules of the game... every single market is different."The Welsh government said they have a programme of trade missions and exhibitions in place which will take in markets including China, India, Brazil and Russia.</body>

      <title>Pleas to schools over early GCSEs</title>
      <description>Schools will not be blocked from entering pupils early for their GCSE exams, Wales' education minister says.</description>

      <body>Schools will not be blocked from entering pupils early for their GCSE exams, Wales' education minister has said.But Huw Lewis warned he would intervene to prevent schools "gaming the system" in the future if they did not stop voluntarily.In the meantime, Mr Lewis appealed to head teachers to "do the right thing".The UK government has said it will stop schools in England from entering teenagers for their GCSEs early.Schools have been accused of entering pupils early so they can bank good grades and sit re-takes if they fail.Under the changes in England, only pupils' first attempts will count towards league tables which rank schools according to how many pupils get good GCSE grades.There are no league tables in Wales. Instead, secondary schools are placed into performance bands which are based on a number of factors, including GCSE grades.Mr Lewis said a review of the way schools are banded will look at the impact of early entry for GCSEs. The review will begin after the next set of banding data are published in December.In a speech to the NAHT teaching union, Mr Lewis said: "I am not proposing to take immediate action, of the type proposed in England, I want schools to do the right thing by their pupils without direction from me."But, if we have to act to stop inappropriate gaming of the system in the future, then we will do so."Any school that puts forward a pupil for early entry, for any other reason than their academic best interests, is gaming. Where it is improperly used, early entry can cheat pupils of the opportunity to fulfil their potential."He said a Welsh government-commissioned review of qualifications had found that sitting GCSEs early allowed high-achievers to start their A-levels sooner.However, in general, early entry "was likely to disadvantage most learners".Robin Hughes, secretary of the ASCL Cymru union, encouraged Mr Lewis to take a "more measured approach" than Mr Gove.He said: "When pupils and teachers are given hoops to jump through, they can be forgiven for using ladders to help get them there."And these ladders, early and multiple entry, give some of our most disadvantaged pupils a leg up."</body>

      <title>Call to revamp IT studies in schools</title>
      <description>A subject called "computing" should be created to replace information and communications technology (ICT) in school, a report suggests.</description>

      <body>A subject called "computing" should be created to replace information and communications technology (ICT) in school, a report suggests.ICT is no longer regarded as relevant for the future, the report by a steering group says.It said its replacement should encourage creativity, develop real-life problem solving and be flexible enough to evolve to stay current.Education Minister Huw Lewis called the report detailed and thorough.The report also suggested grouping computing with the three main science subjects."A career in IT typically involves some degree of logic, creativity, com­munication and collaboration, managing uncertainty, and problem solving," the report said."This is at odds with the current ICT curriculum that is prescriptive, outdated and documentation heavy, focusing on the consumption rather than cre­ation of software and digital content."It added: "We feel strongly that ICT has lost its meaning and become synonymous with word processing and spreadsheets."By renaming and rebranding it as computing as part of a new curriculum we will have an opportunity to improve these perceptions."The new subject would be broken down into two areas - computer science and information technology.Computer science would include the academic side and encompass programming, while information technology would focus on the use of computers in industry, commerce, arts and elsewhere.The report, prepared by an independent steering group chaired by Stuart Arthur from software experts Box UK, recommended computing should be designed with input from the industry and have an online assessment tool.It also added that digital literacy - the general ability to use computers - should start in primary school when pupils are five years old."We should equip children with the skills and empower them with the knowl­edge and confidence to become innovative digital creators, effective digital citizens and successful entrepreneurs so they can take advantage of the global growth opportunities that exist in the digital economy and beyond," the authors said."We have a unique opportunity to learn from the challenges identified in this report and aspire to become truly world class, not just by delivering a digital Wales but by becoming a world leader in computing and digital skills."It is essential to empower our children by giving them the skills required to con­tribute to the rapidly growing digital economy."Education Minister Huw Lewis said: "ICT in Wales is global and dynamic and I want Welsh learners to be given opportunities to develop the skills required to work in and contribute to the sector."We have concerns that fewer Welsh learners are seeing the value in pursuing a career in ICT and that many learners, as well as the wider public, perceive learning about computing in a negative way."It's therefore of great importance what is currently being taught is relevant to the global economy of the future."We will now take time to consider the report's findings in the context of our wider review of assessment and the national curriculum."</body>

      <description>Goals from Adam Lallana and Jay Rodriguez help Southampton to victory over Swansea and into the Premier League's top four.</description>

      <body>Goals from Adam Lallana and Jay Rodriguez helped Southampton to victory over Swansea and into the Premier League's top four.Lallana fired high past Michel Vorm early on, before Saints keeper Artur Boruc saved brilliantly from Michu while Nathan Dyer struck the post.Swansea rallied after the break, but Rodriguez's late volley sealed the win.It was a third consecutive win for the Saints, while Swansea have won only one in four and fall to 15th.More broadly, Mauricio Pochettino's Saints have lost only three of their last 19, and have the tightest defence in the top flight, conceding only two goals this term.Meanwhile, Swansea, playing their seventh game in 20 days, have lost on all four occasions that they have conceded the opening goal this season, though they may curse their luck after Dyer's first-half strike rolled across the goalline after hitting the post.Dyer's effort was the closest Swansea came to scoring, but it was his old club who started the game sharply, with the trio of Rickie Lambert, Pablo Osvaldo and Lallana linking neatly.Osvaldo went close from a tight angle, before Lallana went one better in the 20th minute.The 25-year-old followed his own cross into the box and, after a botched clearance, was fed by Steven Davies to power the ball high into Vorm's net from 10 yards.It was the first time the Saints had scored a first-half goal in the Premier League this season and it helped make for a more open game.Michu, who wore a headguard after being kicked in the Europa League win over St Gallen , led the Swansea response and headed at the back post to draw a fine save from Boruc, while Jonjo Shelvey had an effort from distance saved.Michael Laudrup's Swans, chasing three consecutive top-flight away wins for the first time in 31 years, grew into the game and Dyer rattled the woodwork to start a 15-minute spell of pressure at the end of the first half.He collected Wilfried Bony's back-heel to fire left-footed against the woodwork, only for the ball to roll across the line.Bony himself was then denied as a header was brilliantly parried by Boruc before Michu headed straight at the Polish keeper.Swansea's momentum was not hampered by the interval and Dyer - so often their first-half supply line - dragged a shot wide, but Saints did not concede a goal in September and absorbed the visiting pressure.And, with a little over 10 minutes remaining, the hosts thought the points were sealed when Victor Wanyama bundled home from a corner, but referee Mike Dean had spotted shirt-pulling in the build-up.The decision kept the Swansea hopes alive temporarily and Michu missed a headed chance from 10 yards before Rodriguez wrapped it up for the hosts.A long clearance from Boruc created chaos at the heart of the City defence and, when Chico and Jordi Amat failed to deal with the bouncing ball, Rodriguez volleyed home.Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino:"There were different phases of the game where we commanded and then they did, but overall I'm delighted for the three points and it sets us up for the international weeks and the game against Manchester United."I don't know where we will finish, I don't have a crystal ball. The most important thing is to look to the next game and focus."Osvaldo is fine, he took a heavy challenge but taking him off was mainly a tactical challenge."Swansea City manager Michael Laudrup:"We performed very well. Apart from the first 15 minutes we dominated the game and had lots of chances."They got a good goal but the whole of the second half was all about us. We still need too many chances to score. After the St Gallen game, I said they deserved a little more. Today, I think we deserved a little more."</body>

      <title>Impressive Treve wins Arc in Paris</title>
      <description>Treve put in an outstanding performance to claim the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe with favourite Orfevre second in Paris.</description>

      <body>Treve put in an outstanding performance to win the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in Paris.Jockey Thierry Jarnet, who replaced the injured Frankie Dettori, pushed Criquette Head-Maarek's unbeaten filly to a dominant five-length victory.It was Jarnet's first win in the race since 1994 as Treve emulated Zarkava in 2008 by winning the French Oaks, Prix Vermeille and Arc in the same season.Favourite Orfevre was second ahead of Intello in Europe's richest horse race.Joshua Tree was the early front runner in the mile-and-a-half race and set a steady pace as Jarnet struggled to get early cover on the three-year-old French filly.But unbeaten Treve made stealthy progress down the outside and appeared to be in control as she loomed up on the turn for home.When the pace picked up, the Sheikh Joann Al Thani-owned filly took the lead as Joshua Tree dropped away.Another burst of speed then sent the winner clear and Jarnet was able to ease up before the line with Orfevre, who also finished second last year, well behind.Fellow Japanese runner Kizuna was fourth while Penglai Pavilion claimed fifth for Godolphin and Andre Fabre.Aidan O'Brien fielded two Classic winners in Derby winner Ruler Of The World and St Leger hero Leading Light but neither challenged Treve for the £2.2m winner's prize."My English is not good but this is fantastic, magic," said winning rider Jarnet.Trainer Head-Maarek, who won with Three Troikas in 1979, had sympathy for Dettori after the Italian broke his ankle at Nottingham on Wednesday and was ruled out for the season."I send my love to Frankie, he looked after her in the Vermeille because he knew the Arc was the target and I send him a big kiss," she said."At one point her head went up in the air and looked bored but she has so much class and is simply a wonder filly that she focussed and was never going to be beaten."</body>

      <body>When Thea Davies finishes the Chester marathon on Sunday it will not be the end of a race so much as a labour of love.It is her 10th marathon to raise funds in memory of her partner Stephen Healey from Cardiff.Capt Healey was the 415th UK serviceman to die in Afghanistan, killed by a roadside bomb in Helmand in 2012.Ms Davies, from Pembrokeshire, vowed to run 415 miles, a goal she will achieve.Capt Healey, a former Swansea City apprentice, was commanding his platoon in the 1st Battalion, The Royal Welsh (Royal Welch Fusiliers). from a lead vehicle when it ran over and detonated an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) in May 2012."For the first couple of months after Steve died I didn't know what to do. I just moped around," said Ms Davies."Eventually the padre who repatriated Steve - who co-incidentally is also Steve - took me to watch the Olympics, completely reluctantly at the time."I already knew I wanted to do some sort of fundraising for Steve's favourite charity,"And I knew it had to have a symbolic significance. But it wasn't until I watched the Brownlees winning gold and bronze in the triathlon that the idea of running 415 miles came to me."Capt Healey fundraised for Blind Veterans UK because it supported soldiers who had lost their sight through IED explosions in Afghanistan.Before his last tour he organised a blindfolded sponsored walk to its rehabilitation and training centre in Llandudno, Conwy.Ms Davies' year of running has seen her raise about £14,000 for the charity.Chief executive Robert Leader said her support has been inspirational."At a time of enormous personal tragedy for her she chose to take up Stephen's mantle and continue the amazing work that he had done to support ex-servicemen and women, blinded both in action and later life."We owe both her and Stephen a huge debt of gratitude and what they have done for our people will never be forgotten".Her feat has seen her compete in 20 races - 10Ks, half and full-length marathons, triathlons, and even a half-iron man event.Completing the challenge in Chester will also be highly significant."I hadn't planned it all the way along that the challenge would finish in Chester, but I'm extremely glad that it's worked out that way."As well as Steve's regiment being based here in the Dale Barracks, two years ago Chester was the first marathon Steve dragged me around, just over six months before he died."With the end of this challenge, she is already planning her next project."It suddenly struck me a few weeks ago that it's nearly all over. That panicked me a bit - it certainly made me very emotional because the running has been my way of coping with it all I suppose.""I'm so grateful to everyone who's supported me throughout. Not just my family, but also Blind Veterans UK, and particularly the thousands of ordinary people who've donated and given me such a sense of purpose.""This was for Steve, but the next challenge is for myself. I'm off to New Zealand next year to take part in an ultra iron man event," she said.</body>

      <title>Wales doubles as England in war film</title>
      <description>Rural Wales stands in for England in war film</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-24405390</url>
      <date>1380981009</date>
      <body>Rural Wales is doubling up as England in a new film about the break out of World War III.The movie How I Live Now was shot at a number of locations purporting to be an English country house and farmland.Other locations used to camouflage the war-torn love story include the Army training range at Sennybridge, Powys.Oscar-nominated actress Saoirse Ronan stars as American Daisy in the big screen adaptation of the 2004 debut novel by Meg Rosoff.How I Live Now, which opened at cinemas on Friday, tells the story of a 16-year-old girl sent to England from New York for one "perfect summer".Daisy stays with cousins on a remote farm and as she immerses herself in this pastoral idyll she falls madly in love with Edmond (played by George MacKay).But when war breaks out, she is forced to embark on a terrifying journey to be reunited with the boy she loves.What big screen audiences will not know is that many scenes are filmed in Wales rather then England.When the location manager was searching for suitable film locations, Wales Screen Commission, part of the Welsh government's creative sector team, suggested more than 50 sites.Eventually, producers settled on Mandinam in Llangadog, Carmarthenshire, as the main farmhouse setting.The location is an estate with 450 acres (180 hectares) of parkland and woodland with views of the Towy Valley.Filming ran from June to August 2012 and took place in some very wet Welsh weather.But it did not seem to dampen the spirits of director Kevin Macdonald, who previous credits include The Last King Of Scotland and State of Play.Macdonald has been quoted as saying how making the movie was "the most fun I've ever had making a film".Daisy's journey also takes her across a number of other Welsh locations.These include: Llandovery and Llandeilo in west Wales, Cardiff International Airport, the Ministry of Defence's training village at Sennybridge, Powys, and the backlot of Dragon International Studios in Rhondda Cynon Taf.Berwyn Rowlands, a film producer who was chief executive of the former Welsh media agency Sgrin, said Wales has a long history of attracting film companies."Wales' landscape offers rugged mountains, rolling hills, beaches and urban settings," he explained.Last month there was criticism when it emerged that a University of South Wales promotional film starring Hollywood's Ioan Gruffudd was shot in Somerset, and not the Brecon Beacons in mid Wales, to avoid the Welsh rain.</body>

      <body>Three RNLI crew members who saved a woman trapped in flood waters in Devon will be honoured for heroism at a national awards ceremony.Paul Eastment and Chris Missen, from Porthcawl in Bridgend county, along with Poole-based crewman Martin Blaker-Rowe, rescued Vanessa Glover when water swept her from her car.The crew will be presented with the Pride of Britain Emergency Services Award in London on Monday.They were nominated by Mrs Glover.She told the ITV programme Daybreak: "They know how proud of them I am and how very grateful I am to be alive."I'm so grateful for this showcasing and nomination. They are volunteers and... risked their own lives."The rescue took place in the early hours of 23 December last year when the River Taw had reached 3.5 metres (11ft) above its normal range.Mrs Glover, a mother of one, had been swept from her car in Umberleigh after it was forced off a road by flood water, leaving her husband and seven-year-old son holding onto the car roof.She was left clinging to a branch.At 01:51 GMT the RNLI's flood rescue team launched its boat with Mr Missen at the helm.Boat team leader Mr Eastment and crew member Mr Blaker-Rowe guided Mr Missen along the safest route to reach Mrs Glover with only head torches for light.They reached her and at 01:57 GMT she was in the rescue boat, very cold and receiving treatment.The men previously won the RNLI bronze medal for gallantry - one of the institution's highest accolades - for the rescue.</body>
