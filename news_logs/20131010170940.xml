      <body>Consumer groups are predicting that the UK's other major energy suppliers will raise prices after SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills.SSE said its average annual dual fuel energy bill would rise by £106 to £1,380 on 15 November.One industry expert described the move as "the final nail in the coffin for affordable energy", but SSE said that many costs were beyond its control.The decision prompted fevered political debate over who to blame for the rise.Citizens Advice is expecting an "avalanche" of increases but has called on the other energy firms to freeze prices."This price rise will be a blow for stretched budgets," said the charity's chief executive Gillian Guy."I hope other energy firms show an understanding of their customers' financial situation by not raising their prices this winter."Many households are facing a daily battle try to make their frozen incomes cover mounting energy, food and travel costs. Further increases will push people into poverty."SSE said that 8.2% was an average rise. Customers in the North of England and central Scotland would see the smallest increase, of 7%, in their dual fuel price. Customers in the South East of England would see the biggest, up 9.7%.It added that the rise reflected higher costs of buying wholesale energy and paying to deliver it to customers' homes, plus government levies.The move has amplified political debate about the issue of energy bills.Labour leader Ed Miliband, who pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election, described SSE's price rise as a "scandal". He accused the government of "letting energy companies get away with this".But Prime Minister David Cameron branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas.SSE's price rises will affect about 4.4 million domestic electricity customers and 2.9 million domestic gas customers.One of those customers is Gary Waywell, from Somerset, who has been a SSE customer for eight years.He said he was surprised by the size of the price rise and angry at the timing just before winter."I can hardly go to my boss and say, 'would you mind giving me an extra £16 a week for the winter. I don't think he is going to smile at that," he said.SSE's Will Morris said he understood customers' frustration."We're sorry we have to do this," he said."We've done as much as we could to keep prices down, but the reality is that buying wholesale energy in global markets, delivering it to customers' homes, and government-imposed levies collected through bills - endorsed by all the major parties - all cost more than they did last year."SSE, made up of Southern Electric, Swalec and Scottish Hydro, said that for a typical dual-fuel customer, wholesale energy prices had gone up 4%, paying to use delivery networks was 10% more expensive, and government levies were 13% higher.Up to 11% of a customer's bill goes on government programmes to save energy, reduce emissions and tackle climate change, according to regulator Ofgem. SSE said it wanted this to be included in general taxation, rather than added to bills.However, Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: "Half of an average energy bill is made up of the wholesale cost of energy. This far outweighs the proportion of a bill that goes to help vulnerable households with their bills and to cut energy waste."SSE's announcement comes about a year after the last set of gas and electricity price rises.Between August and December 2012, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%.Ann Robinson, from price comparison website Uswitch, which could benefit from consumers swapping suppliers, said: "This is a crippling blow for consumers, who are still reeling from last winter's price hike. Adding to an already sky-high energy bill will leave consumers buckling under the pressure. It's the final nail in the coffin for affordable energy."Of course the danger now is that the other big six suppliers will follow suit. This raises the spectre of yet more households forced to cut back on their heating."The latest calculations from the regulator found that the average profit margin made by an energy supplier on an average £1,315 bill is £65.SSE, formerly Scottish and Southern Energy, said it expected its annual profit margin to average about 5% over a three-to-five-year period, which it believed was "a fair amount".It said its profit margin was 4.2% in the 2012-13 financial year and was expected to fall short of the 5% target again this year."We know we will come in for a great deal of criticism for this decision and politicians will no doubt be lining up to condemn us," said SSE's Mr Morris."But over many years, policymakers themselves have failed to highlight adequately the cost to consumers of the policies they have pursued in government."They can't expect to have power stations replaced with new technologies, the network to be upgraded and nationwide energy efficiency schemes all to be funded for free."And as an energy provider, we are in the unenviable position of having to pass this cost on to consumers through energy bills."The BBC understands that the government is prepared to look at easing green taxes on smaller energy companies. These costs include paying for measures to save energy, reduce emissions and tackle climate change, and also include the cost of social programmes to help vulnerable customers.At present, companies with 250,000 customers are liable to pay the green levy.This threshold could be changed in order to encourage smaller energy companies to enter the market and challenge the big six. Only three smaller energy firms are operating in the UK at the moment.</body>

      <title>Freed Libyan PM calls for calm</title>
      <description>Libyan PM Ali Zeidan calls for "caution and wisdom" after being freed from the custody of militiamen who held him for several hours in Tripoli.</description>

      <date>1381419570</date>
      <body>Libyan PM Ali Zeidan has called for "rationality and wisdom" after being freed from the custody of militiamen.He was abducted from a Tripoli hotel and held for several hours by armed men whose identity has yet to be confirmed.In a cabinet meeting, the PM thanked "real revolutionaries" who took part in a security operation to free him.The motive of the abduction is unclear but some militias had been angered by a US commando raid to capture senior al-Qaeda suspect Anas al-Liby.Many militia groups saw the raid in Tripoli on Saturday as a breach of Libyan sovereignty and there is growing pressure on the government to explain if it was involved.One group, the Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room (LROR), said it had captured Mr Zeidan, claiming it was acting on orders from the prosecutor general. But the justice ministry denied this.The LROR said its actions had not been related to Mr Liby's detention.The official Lana news agency also named another formal rebel group, the Brigade for the Fight against Crime, as being involved.Two years after the overthrow of Col Muammar Gaddafi, Libya still has no constitution and divisions between secular and Islamist forces have paralysed parliament.The government has been struggling to contain the numerous militias who control many parts of the country.Mr Zeidan's cabinet meeting following his release was shown live on Libya's al-Ahrar television.He thanked those who had helped free him but gave no details about them or the abductors.He said: "I salute the revolutionaries who had an important role. The real revolutionaries, those who rose above greedy demands, I salute them for what they did in this affair."Mr Zeidan urged them to "assimilate into the state, and play an active role in it through its civilian and military institutions".He added: "Only with an army and the police can a state exist."The prime minister said of his capture: "These are accidental things from the revolution's overflow and they will disappear."He also said Libya would "regain its health" and be "an active, positive nation".Mr Zeidan ended by calling for "caution and rationality in handling this matter".A spokesperson for David Cameron said the UK Prime Minister had spoken to Mr Zeidan since his release and had promised to help build a "stable, free, peaceful and prosperous" Libya.The spokesperson said: "Both leaders agreed that Libya's democratically elected representatives and leaders must be able to carry out their duties and deliver Libya's political transition free from the threat of kidnap, violence and armed intimidation. A minority of individuals must not be allowed to undermine that."Mr Zeidan had been taken in a pre-dawn raid on the Corinthia Hotel by more than 100 armed men.Photographs circulating online showed Mr Zeidan being surrounded and led away. There were no reports of violence during his capture.In claiming it carried out the attack, the LROR said it was acting on the orders of the prosecutor general and in accordance with a section of Libya's criminal code relating to "crimes and misdemeanours harmful to state security".But Justice Minister Salah al-Marghani said the prosecutor general had issued no arrest warrant, according to state-run National Libyan TV.The prime minister was reportedly held at the interior ministry anti-crime department in Tripoli, where an official said he was treated well.In a news conference shortly before the release was announced, the government condemned the "criminal act" of his detention and said it would not give in to "blackmail".The LROR is one of a number of militias operating in Libya which are nominally attached to government ministries but often act independently and, correspondents say, often have the upper hand over police and army forces.Earlier this week, the prime minister appealed for Western help in tackling rising militancy in Libya.In an interview with the BBC on Monday, he said Libya was being used as a base to export weapons throughout the region.Mr Liby, 49, is believed to have been one of the masterminds behind the 1998 US embassy attacks, which killed more than 220 people in Kenya and Tanzania.He was living openly in Tripoli before his capture by US commandos early on Saturday morning.In remains unclear whether the Libyan government had prior knowledge of the operation to capture him.Libya asked the US for clarification of the incident and has questioned the US ambassador, but the PM also said it would not harm ties with Washington.</body>

      <title>Alice Munro wins Nobel Literature Prize</title>
      <description>Canadian author Alice Munro wins the 2013 Nobel Prize for Literature, making her only the 13th woman to receive the award since its inception in 1901.</description>

      <date>1381409500</date>
      <body>Canadian author Alice Munro has won the 2013 Nobel Prize for Literature.Making the announcement, Peter Englund, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, called her a "master of the contemporary short story".The 82-year-old, whose books include Dear Life and Dance of the Happy Shades, is only the 13th woman to win the prize since its inception in 1901."I knew I was in the running, yes, but I never thought I would win," Munro told Canadian media.Presented by the Nobel Foundation, the award - which is presented to a living writer - is worth eight million kronor (£770,000).Previous winners include literary giants such as Rudyard Kipling, Toni Morrison and Ernest Hemingway.Mr Englund told The Associated Press that he had not been able to contact Munro ahead of the announcement so left a message on her answering machine, informing her of her win."She has taken an art form, the short story, which has tended to come a little bit in the shadow behind the novel, and she has cultivated it almost to perfection,'' he added.Munro, who began writing in her teenage years, published her first story, The Dimensions of a Shadow, in 1950.She had been studying English at the University of Western Ontario at the time.Dance of the Happy Shades, published in 1968, was Munro's first collection, and it went on to win Canada's highest literary prize, the Governor General's Award.In 2009, she won the Man Booker International Prize for her entire body of work - but she downplayed her achievements."I think maybe I was successful in doing this because I didn't have any other talents," she once said in an interview with Book Lounge.BBC Arts Editor Will Gompertz said Munro had been "at the very top of her game since she started"."Very few writers are her equal," he said, adding "she gets to the heart of what it is to be human"."I thought she might not win because she's not overtly political; and of late the Nobel has tended to go to political writers."The award "probably won't make a commercial difference" to the author, he added, but it "makes a huge difference to how her work will be viewed in historical terms"."If she hadn't won it before she died, I think it would have been a terrible, terrible omission."Often compared to Anton Chekhov, she is known for writing about the human spirit and a regular theme of her work is the dilemma faced by young girls growing up and coming to terms with living in a small town.The Nobel academy praised her "finely tuned storytelling, which is characterised by clarity and psychological realism".Munro, whose daughter woke her to tell her she had won the Nobel, said she was "terribly surprised" and "delighted".Speaking to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), she said she always viewed her chances of winning as "one of those pipe dreams" that "might happen, but it probably wouldn't"."It's the middle of the night here and I had forgotten about it all, of course," she added.Since the 1960s, Munro has published more than a dozen collections of short stories, many of which take place in her native southwest Ontario.Her writing has brought her several awards. She won The Commonwealth Writers' Prize, the National Book Critics Circle prize for Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage, and is a three-time winner of the Governor General's prize.Other notable books include Lives of Girls and Women, Who Do You Think You Are, The Progress of Love and Runaway.In 1980, The Beggar Maid was shortlisted for the annual Booker Prize for Fiction and her stories frequently appear in publications such as the New Yorker and the Paris Review.Several of her stories have also been adapted for the screen, including The Bear Came Over the Mountain, which became Away from Her, starring Julie Christie and Gordon Pinsent.Munro revealed earlier this year that her latest book, Dear Life, published in 2012, would be her last."Perhaps, when you're my age, you don't wish to be alone as much as a writer has to be," she told Canada's National Post.In 2009, Munro revealed she had been receiving treatment for cancer. She also had bypass surgery for a heart condition.Notriously publicity-shy, Munro shies away from public events.According to American literary critic David Homel: "She is not a socialite. She is actually rarely seen in public, and does not go on book tours.Munro will be presented with her latest award at a formal ceremony in Stockholm on 10 December, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, who established the prize.Last year's recipient was Chinese novelist Mo Yan.</body>

      <title>Royal Mail sale: Small bids favoured</title>
      <description>Investors who applied for £750 worth of Royal Mail shares will receive their full allocation, the BBC has learned.</description>

      <body>Small investors will be favoured in the privatisation of the Royal Mail, at the expense of those seeking a large allocation, the BBC has learned.Anyone who subscribed for the minimum entitlement of £750 will receive 100% of their application, according to BBC business editor Robert Peston.But those who have applied for £10,000 worth of shares or more, will not receive any, he said.Demand for Royal Mail shares far outstripped the supply.Robert Peston said: "A government source said to me that ministers wanted to reward the Mrs Migginses, but not the big professional investors."Royal Mail's shares will be priced at 330p, which is at the top end of what the government was hoping for and values the entire Royal Mail at £3.3bn.Shares were initially priced between 260p and 330p, but strong demand led the government to revise the figures upwards on Friday last week.There were more than 700,000 individual applications for shares, which far outstripped the value of shares available.Retail investors could apply for up to £10,000 worth of Royal Mail shares online, but could bid for a much bigger allocation if they applied through a stock broker.But the government has decided to favour more modest investors and any applications seeking more than £10,000 worth of shares will receive none.The applications indicate that individual investors had about £4bn to spend on Royal Mail shares, which is much more than the £517m worth of shares on offer.Applications for shares from professional investors also far outstripped the amount allocated to them.Our business editor says that combined, individual and professional investors may have had £15bn available to invest.He also said that individual investors could be allotted as much as 33% of the total shares on offer, up from the original amount of 30%, while professional investors could expect their share to be reduced slightly to 67%.The government will sell 52.2% of the company, the maximum it was prepared to sell at this stage, he adds.That puts the value for the Treasury of the privatisation at £1.7bn.Full trading in Royal Mail shares begins next Tuesday on the London Stock Exchange.However, investors have been able to speculate on the value of Royal Mail ahead of the official start of trading on what is known as the grey market.Financial bookmaker IG Index says that, as of Thursday morning, orders placed by its clients indicate Royal Mail shares could be worth between 405p and 425p each.However, that is just an indication and the market may react differently next week.Under the terms of the share sale, a 10% stake in the business has been reserved for Royal Mail employees.Members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) are voting on whether to strike over the government's privatisation plan.The ballot closes on 16 October and strike action could begin as early as 23 October.Royal Mail says the fundraising will provide it with the money needed to modernise and compete in a competitive parcels market.Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna criticised the government on Monday for "short-changing" taxpayers.In particular, Labour says the privatisation may be undervaluing Royal Mail's property, some of which is in prime locations.However, on Wednesday, Business Secretary Vince Cable told a parliamentary committee: "We're confident that it's priced in the right place".</body>

      <title>Debt limit brinkmanship 'dangerous'</title>
      <description>US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew says leaving a deal over the debt ceiling to the last minute could be "very dangerous".</description>

      <date>1381418314</date>
      <body>US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has warned that pushing talks over the debt ceiling to the last minute could be "very dangerous".He said that the US government could suddenly run out of money some time after 17 October, which would have "serious" repercussions.He also warned that the Treasury's payment systems were not designed to work without funds for payment.According to Mr Lew that would make it difficult to prioritise payments.The current debt limit of $16.699 trillion was reached in May.Since then the US Treasury has been using what are called extraordinary measures to keep paying the bills, but those measures run out on 17 October.In his testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, Mr Lew said that the Treasury had big bills to pay soon after that date, including to hospitals and doctors under the Medicare scheme, to Social Security recipients, veterans and members of the armed forces.Mr Lew underlined that, every week, the Treasury also has to refinance $100bn worth of debt in the form of US government bonds known as treasuries.The US also has to pay interest on its huge debt burden.An inability to pay that interest, or pay back debt if required, would put the US into default.That would potentially have a "catastrophic" impact, according to Mr Lew, who cited a recent Treasury report.Effects of a default would include a sharp fall in the dollar, a significant jump in US interest rates and negative effects on the global economy.As well as disagreeing over the debt ceiling, US politicians have also been unable to approve funding for current federal spending.As a result there has been a partial shutdown of government activities over the past 10 days.Thousands of government workers have been told to stay at home.On Thursday, URS Corp, which builds and operates industrial projects, said it had temporarily laid off about 3,000 employees due to the government shutdown.Mr Lew said that a two-week shutdown could cut growth in the fourth quarter of the year by a quarter of a percentage point.A report from the US Labor Department released on Thursday said that the number of Americans applying for benefits jumped by 66,000 last week, taking the seasonally adjusted total to 374,000.But that total does not reflect federal workers laid off due to the shutdown.They can apply for benefits but their number is added up separately and reported a week later.Half of last week's rise was accounted for by California which processed a big backlog of claims.A quarter of the applicants were from workers affected by the shutdown, such as private contractors working for the government.It is thought Republicans are considering agreeing to an increase in the debt ceiling, but only enough to provide a temporary reprieve, while politicians negotiate a broader deal.Meanwhile, President Barack Obama was preparing to meet senior Republicans at the White House on Thursday in the hope of finding a way out of the budget deadlock.Mr Obama invited all of the Republicans in the House of Representatives, but their leader, John Boehner, decided instead to send about 20 members.White House press secretary Jay Carney, however, complained that hardline Tea Party Republicans were not attending the discussion.On Wednesday, Mr Obama met House Democrats at the White House and told them he would prefer a long-term increase to the nation's debt ceiling.But the president said he was willing to accept a short-term rise in the borrowing cap to "give Boehner some time to deal with the Tea Party wing of his party", Representative Peter Welch told the Associated Press news agency after the meeting.News that senior Republicans will visit the White House helped to lift US stocks on Thursday. But analysts remain cautious."It would be a minor sign of hope there may be some more positive news coming in the next couple of days, hard to make much more out of that," said Fred Dickson, chief market strategist at D.A. Davidson and Co."The markets right now are betting somebody will blink between now and October 17," he said.</body>

      <title>Alzheimer's find is 'turning point'</title>
      <description>A chemical which can stop brain cell death in a neurodegenerative disease could hold the key for treating Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntingdon's diseases, scientists say.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24462699</url>
      <date>1381395409</date>
      <body>The discovery of the first chemical to prevent the death of brain tissue in a neurodegenerative disease has been hailed as the "turning point" in the fight against Alzheimer's disease.More work is needed to develop a drug that could be taken by patients.But scientists say a resulting medicine could treat Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's and other diseases.In tests on mice, the Medical Research Council showed all brain cell death from prion disease could be prevented.Prof Roger Morris, from King's College London, said: "This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer's disease."He told the BBC a cure for Alzheimer's was not imminent but: "I'm very excited, it's the first proof in any living animal that you can delay neurodegeneration."The world won't change tomorrow, but this is a landmark study."The research team at the Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit, based at the University of Leicester, focused on the natural defence mechanisms built into brain cells.When a virus hijacks a brain cell it leads to a build-up of viral proteins. Cells respond by shutting down nearly all protein production in order to halt the virus's spread.However, many neurodegenerative diseases involve the production of faulty or "misfolded" proteins. These activate the same defences, but with more severe consequences.The misfolded proteins linger and the brain cells shut down protein production for so long that they eventually starve themselves to death.This process, repeated in neurons throughout the brain, can destroy movement or memory or even kill, depending on the disease.This process is thought to take place in many forms of neurodegeneration, so safely disrupting it could treat a wide range of diseases.The researchers used a compound which prevented those defence mechanisms kicking in and in turn halted neurodegeneration.The study, published in Science Translational Medicine, showed mice with prion disease developed severe memory and movement problems. They died within 12 weeks.However, those given the compound showed no sign of brain tissue wasting away.Lead researcher Prof Giovanna Mallucci told the BBC news website: "They were absolutely fine, it was extraordinary."What's really exciting is a compound has completely prevented neurodegeneration and that's a first."This isn't the compound you would use in people, but it means we can do it and it's a start."She said the compound offered a "new pathway that may well give protective drugs" and the next step was for drug companies to develop a medicine for use in humans.Prof Mallucci's lab is also testing the compound on other forms of neurodegeneration in mice but the results have not yet been published.Side effects are an issue. The compound also acted on the pancreas, meaning the mice developed a mild form of diabetes and lost weight.Any human drug would need to act only on the brain. However, this gives scientists and drug companies a starting point.David Allsop, professor of neuroscience at Lancaster University described the results as "very dramatic and highly encouraging" but cautioned that more research was needed to see how the findings would apply to diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.Dr Eric Karran, the director of research at the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said: "Targeting a mechanism relevant to a number of neurodegenerative diseases could yield a single drug with wide-reaching benefits, but this compound is still at an early stage."It will be important for these findings to be repeated and tested in models of other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease."</body>

      <body>Prison guards faked logs about their monitoring of Ohio kidnapper Ariel Castro in the hours before he killed himself last month, officials say.An inquiry has found video footage that indicated two guards failed to make checks at least eight times on the day Castro was found hanged in his cell.In August, Castro was sentenced to life imprisonment for abducting three women over a decade.He raped them repeatedly while holding them in his Cleveland home.The Ohio Department for Rehabilitation and Correction published its findings on Thursday.The report said that prison guards had failed to check Castro at least eight times between 15:03 and 20:15 local time on 3 September. He was found hanged at 21:18.The document said that "post log books were falsified" and that "there was no satisfactory verification process in place".It was also revealed that Castro "was found in his cell with a Bible open to John Chapters 2 and 3"."Additionally, he had pictures of his family out and arranged in a poster-board fashion. His pants and underwear were pulled down to his ankles."The convict left no suicide note.The report said Castro's intentions were unclear, however the facts had been "relayed to the Ohio State Highway Patrol for consideration of the possibility of auto-erotic asphyxiation".</body>

      <description>Illegal immigrants will find it harder to set up home in the UK under planned new laws, says Home Secretary Theresa May.</description>

      <body>Illegal immigrants will find it harder to set up home in the UK under planned laws, says Home Secretary Theresa May.The Immigration Bill would force private landlords to quiz tenants about their immigration status and restrict access to bank accounts for people in the country without permission.It also aims to streamline the appeals process in immigration cases.Labour said the bill did nothing about bigger problems like the "shambolic" state of UK border controls.The bill, which is expected to become law in spring 2014, subject to approval by MPs, will include measures to allow the UK to "deport foreign criminals first and hear their appeal later" when there is "no risk of serious irreversible harm".BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani says this could lead to an increase in air fare costs for the Home Office, if it has to fly back migrants who are successful in their appeal.A requirement is also included for temporary migrants, such as overseas students, to make a contribution to the National Health Service to prevent so-called "health tourism".Other new measures in the bill include:Immigration minister Mark Harper said: "The Immigration Bill will stop migrants using public services to which they are not entitled, reduce the pull factors which encourage people to come to the UK and make it easier to remove people who should not be here."We will continue to welcome the brightest and best migrants who want to contribute to our economy and society and play by the rules. But the law must be on the side of people who respect it, not those who break it."Mrs May said the measures were about "making it harder for people who are here illegally to stay here".She said it was a "point of principle" that people who used public services should be expected to contribute to them, but she would not comment on the cost to the country of "health tourism".She denied claims that forcing private landlords to check the immigration status of prospective tenants would be unworkable, saying they would just be "required to ask some simple questions" in the same way that employers have to do when interviewing workers.But an organisation representing private and public sector landlords said the measures would "make it much harder for non-British people to access housing even when they have a legal right to live in the UK".Gavin Smart, director of policy and practice at the Chartered Institute of Housing, said: "Checking immigration status is complicated so landlords may shy away from letting to anyone who appears not to be British."Don Flynn, director of Migrants' Rights Network, criticised moves to restrict access to the NHS, saying: "There are very small numbers of migrants who come here with pre-existing health conditions and find themselves registering with the health service."I simply do not believe there is any significant evidence that something like the NHS is a pull factor."The British Medical Association (BMA) is also critical of the plans.Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chairman of the BMA's GPs committee, told BBC Radio 5live there is already a system in place for hospitals to recover the cost of treating patients who are ineligible for NHS care."Clearly that could be improved, but introducing a system for general practice could be a bureaucratic nightmare," he said."The reality is people don't come to the UK to use the NHS, they're more likely to come to work in the NHS."Labour said there was nothing in the bill to tackle problems at the UK's "increasingly shambolic" border controls or to deal with "long delays in getting electronic checks in place, or the UKBA (UK Border Agency) bureaucratic failings that have prevented foreign criminals being deported".Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: "It doesn't seem to address some of the serious issues around border control and some of the problems about exploitation of immigration in the labour market, particularly low-skill immigration, which has caused concerns about jobs and wages."Campaign group the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants welcomed what it claimed was a "climb down" by the Home Office, which had not included in the bill proposals to introduce immigration checks by GPs.It said the new proposals would deter students from wanting to study in the UK but would have "no impact whatsoever on 'illegal' immigration - the declared intention of this bill".UKIP said "pressganging landlords, doctors and private citizens under the threat of sanctions to carry out the work of border agencies is simply wrong" and the government needed to treat the cause of immigration problems rather than the symptoms.And Bill Walker, of the Institute of Directors, warned that some of the government's rhetoric was starting to make the UK "look unwelcoming and hostile to the people on whom our export markets depend".The Conservatives say they want to reduce net migration from non-EU countries - the difference between the number of people emigrating and arriving in the UK - to less than 100,000 a year.But the latest Office for National Statistics figures show net migration rose to 176,000 in the year ending December 2012 - up from 153,000 people in the year to September 2012 - appearing to buck the recent downward trend.There are no official estimates of the number of illegal immigrants in the UK. A 2009 study by the London School of Economics produced an estimate of 618,000 but the Migration Watch pressure group said this under-estimated the number of people who had overstayed their visas and the true figure was more like 1.1 million.</body>

      <title>Taylor to serve jail term in UK</title>
      <description>Liberian ex-President Charles Taylor is to serve his 50-year war crimes sentence in the UK, Justice Minister Jeremy Wright confirms.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24474588</url>
      <date>1381404403</date>
      <body>Ex-Liberian President Charles Taylor is to serve his 50-year war crimes sentence in the UK, Justice Minister Jeremy Wright has confirmed.Finland, Rwanda and Sweden were other possibilities following the rejection of his appeal last month by a UN-backed special court in The Hague.It ruled that his convictions had been proved beyond doubt.He was sentenced in May 2012 for aiding rebels who committed atrocities in Sierra Leone during its civil war.Because of fears his trial could spark renewed conflict in West Africa, it was moved from Sierra Leone to The Hague, and the UK at the time offered to jail him if convicted.Mr Wright made the announcement in a written statement to Parliament, saying it followed a request from the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL)."Taylor will now be transferred to a prison in the UK to serve that sentence," he said, adding that international justice was central to British foreign policy."The United Kingdom's offer to enforce any sentence imposed on former President Taylor by the SCSL was crucial to ensuring that he could be transferred to The Hague to stand trial for his crimes," Mr Wright said.The SCSL found Taylor, 65, guilty of 11 crimes including terrorism, rape, murder and the use of child soldiers by rebel groups in neighbouring Sierra Leone during the 1991-2002 conflict in which some 50,000 people died.He was found to have supplied weapons to the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels in exchange for a constant flow of so-called blood diamonds.The rebels were notorious for hacking off the limbs of civilians to terrorise the population.Taylor has always insisted he is innocent and his only contact with the rebels was to urge them to stop fighting.He is the first former head of state convicted by an international war crimes court since World War II.UK forces intervened in Sierra Leone in 2000, sending 800 paratroopers to protect Freetown as rebel forces were closing in on the capital. They evacuated British citizens and helped secure the airport for beleaguered UN peacekeepers.The British forces pushed back the rebels, allowing the UN peacekeeping force to operate effectively. British forces then stayed on for another two years to re-train the Sierra Leone army.An act of parliament was passed in 2007 to allow for Taylor to serve his sentence in the UK at the cost of the government."The conviction of Charles Taylor is a landmark moment for international justice," Mr Wright said."It clearly demonstrates that those who commit atrocities will be held to account and that no matter their position they will not enjoy impunity."It is not the first time the UK has imprisoned foreign nationals convicted of war crimes.Four men convicted of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia served time in British high-security prisons. One former Bosnian-Serb general was stabbed at Wakefield prison in apparent retaliation for the massacre of Muslims in the UN safe haven of Srebrenica in 1995.The UK also offered to jail the former President of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic, had he been convicted at his trial in The Hague on charges of war crimes and genocide. But he died in 2006 while on trial.</body>

      <title>UK interest rates held at 0.5%</title>
      <description>The Bank of England decides to keep interest rates at a record 0.5% low and makes no change to its monetary stimulus.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24471495</url>
      <date>1381404300</date>
      <body>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has again voted to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5%.It has kept the key borrowing rate at that level since March 2009.The MPC also said it would make no change to the £375bn of monetary stimulus it is providing through its quantitative easing (QE) programme.Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said that before interest rates can rise, the unemployment rate needs to fall below 7%.That stipulation is part of Mr Carney's policy of giving forward guidance.The idea is to create more certainty for businesses and individuals about the course of interest rates, which may encourage borrowing and investment.He has forecast that it will take about three years for unemployment to reach his target.However, there has been speculation that rates may start to go up sooner, given recent indications of healthier prospects for the UK economy.On Wednesday, the International Monetary Fund lifted its UK growth projection for this year from 0.9% to 1.4%."The bar for any more QE now looks to be very high," said Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight."It will likely only occur if the economy loses substantial momentum over the coming months, or if there is major financial turmoil and a sharp upward move in market interest rates when the US Federal Reserve finally starts to taper."Our central scenario is that neither of these events will happen, but neither can be ruled out."David Tinsley of BNP Paribas said the decision came as no surprise."Overall, UK monetary policy settings for now are on auto-pilot, barring the US debt ceiling debate getting very messy," he said."Even on an optimistic basis, the UK labour market is not going to deliver an unemployment rate at 7% for six to 12 months at the very earliest, while inflationary pressures are under control."And the Bank has made fairly clear that while it is monitoring house price developments, it is not about to adjust monetary policy in response to those."So for now, forward guidance is delivering the sort of boring certainty the new governor was after."</body>

      <title>Pregnant woman in abortion appeal</title>
      <description>A woman pregnant with twins who can not survive outside the womb calls for the health minister to allow her to have an abortion in Northern Ireland.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-24474353</url>
      <date>1381404905</date>
      <body>A woman pregnant with twins who can not survive outside the womb has called for the health minister to allow her to have an abortion in Northern Ireland.The woman, who wants to be named only as Laura, said she has been told her twin girls have anencephaly - a severe brain abnormality.She is 22 weeks pregnant and any termination has to be before 24 weeks.Foetal abnormality is not a ground for abortion under Northern Ireland law.Laura said she felt "let down by her country" at having to leave to have the abortion."I'm not going to be near my family, I'm not going to have any of my family's support," she told BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan Show."I have a hard enough thing to go through at the minute, finding out I have twin girls with the same condition who are going to have absolutely no outcome of life whatsoever."To make that decision in the first place (to have an abortion) was one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make in my life."I think it's horrendous the fact that I have to go to a different country where I don't know anybody and have to go through something like that."Laura said she only found out she was expecting twins after her five-month scan; the next day she found out they had anencephaly and would have "absolutely no form of life whatsoever"."I don't think I could ever go full term and have them in your arms for a couple of hours and have to watch them pass away is just something I don't think I could cope with," she said."They only have a heartbeat, that's all they have, the only thing that's keeping them alive is me."She said there was also a strong chance the babies would die in the womb.The twins' father, Chris, added: "We would like to be given the option, like any family in our position, to get the treatment that we require in our own country and have our families around us."On Wednesday, another woman, Sarah Ewart, contacted the Nolan Show to highlight her experience.She had to travel to England for an abortion because her baby was also diagnosed with anencephaly.On Thursday, Justice Minister David Ford said he was committed to bringing a paper to the Northern Ireland Executive looking at issues around the termination of pregnancy."That arose out of the previous issue on the discussion of the Marie Stopes clinic," he said."I have written to the minister of health suggesting it should be a joint paper, because there are issues of both criminal law and health and social care issues."It seems to me that what we've had highlighted yesterday and today is the need that we perhaps need to widen out that consultation to look at difficult issues like foetal abnormality to see if where the law is currently drawn is in the right place."The BBC has contacted the Department of Health and the couple's local health trust and is awaiting responses.</body>

      <title>Ofcom price hike alarms mobile firms</title>
      <description>Mobile networks left "disappointed" as Ofcom proposes quadrupled licence fees, leading to concerns the cost may be passed on to consumers.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24475802</url>
      <date>1381406086</date>
      <body>Mobile network operators may have to pay more than four times the current amount to use the radio spectrum, under new proposals from Ofcom.The regulator said the new licensing fees reflected market value based on other European countries.Operators told the BBC the increase was "excessive". Vodafone said it was "disappointed".Some analysts have raised concerns the increased costs might be passed on to the public."The size of these figures may come as bad news to the mobile networks, but more worryingly could sound alarm bells for consumers," said Adam Kirby, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com."The proposed new costs reflect a huge leap in the amount networks will have to pay the regulator for using the spectrum - our concern is that it will be consumers who are left to foot the bill."However, the good news for concerned consumers is that no increases have been confirmed as yet - Ofcom are now consulting on the fees. It remains to be seen how much these costs will actually rise, and if the networks can fight back and keep a lid on these increases."An Ofcom spokesman told the BBC that while it had no control over how much operators charged customers, it did not expect the rise to have an impact on bills.In an advisory note, financial services firm JP Morgan said it expected the competitiveness of the mobile market would stop costs being passed down.However, operators contacted by the BBC expressed concern that the rise had been higher than they had budgeted for.The affected companies - Vodafone, O2, EE and Three - each told the BBC that they would respond to Ofcom's announcement in due course.EE said it would aim to stress that "there must be a balance between licence fees and the critical 4G network investment consumers and businesses are demanding to drive growth and jobs for the UK economy".Vodafone criticised Ofcom, saying: "We are disappointed that Ofcom is proposing a 430% increase in the fees we pay for our existing spectrum at a time when we are investing more than ever in vital national digital infrastructure."The regulator should be encouraging such private sector investment in infrastructure and new services like 4G, which will benefit consumers, businesses and the wider British economy for many years to come."Prices for the 900Mhz and 1800Mhz spectrum bands were set when it was used for 2G services several years ago. Ofcom has since "liberated" the spectrum - the term given when a certain band is freed up for different purposes.In this case, it meant that operators could use the bands for higher-speed services such as 4G.In 2010, the government instructed Ofcom to revisit the cost of the licences for 900Mhz and 1800Mhz which - in comparison with other equivalent services across the EU - were considered to be very cheap.The new prices will see Vodafone and O2's individual fees rise from £15.6m to £83.1m. EE will pay £107.1m, up from £24.9m, and Three will go from £8.3m to £35.7m.The increase comes at a time when operators are facing a drop in income via calls made while customers are overseas. The European Union is pressing hard for far lower roaming costs in a bid to reduce so-called "bill shock".A source at one of the affected operators said he expected operators would now engage in a tug of war with Ofcom to see the proposed amounts lowered.In response, the regulator said: "It's a consultation - we welcome the views of our stakeholders. Nothing's final at this stage."They've been expecting this for some time and we've based our proposed annual license fees on market value."Ofcom also dismissed the suggestion that the price hike is in response to a lower-than-expected return from the recent auction of 4G spectrum, which took place earlier in the year.That sale raised £2.3bn - less than the £3.5bn expected by the Office for Budget Responsibility.The shortfall is being investigated by the National Audit Office, which expects to publish its findings early next year.Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC.</body>

      <title>UK troops praised for Afghan role</title>
      <description>An Army commander has paid tribute to British troops as the deployment of the last major British force sent to Helmand in southern Afghanistan begins.</description>

      <date>1381421046</date>
      <body>An army commander has paid tribute to British troops, as the deployment of the last major British force to Helmand in southern Afghanistan begins.Speaking at a handover ceremony at Camp Bastion, commander Brig James Woodham praised soldiers from 1st Mechanized Brigade for "a job well done".The 7th Armoured Brigade, the Desert Rats have now begun their mission.They will be responsible for packing away forces' equipment ahead of the final British pullout next year.Troops are not expected to be involved in regular fighting as Afghan forces will now take the lead.But some will remain in the country for nine months, rather than the usual six.Around 100 soldiers from both incoming and outgoing brigades gathered to take part in the handover to the Germany-based Desert Rats.After the blue flag of the Desert Rats was raised to the sound of bagpipes, incoming commander Brig Woodham said he was determined to build on 1st Mechanized Brigade's investment and bring the campaign to a successful conclusion."I congratulate the 1st Mechanized Brigade on a job well done and I wish them a safe and swift trip back to their families."For the Desert Rats - we've got a job to do," he said.Outgoing commander Brig Rupert Jones also praised his troops and said Afghan forces had "exceeded all expectations" while leading for the first time in a summer fighting season.He said he was confident Afghan forces were capable of taking control as UK troops stepped back.He also defended the role that Nato-led International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) has played in Afghanistan.It follows comments made by President Hamid Karzai in a BBC interview which criticised the Nato exercise in Afghanistan for causing "a lot of suffering" and making "no gains".Brig Jones said: "What I hear from local Afghan commanders and governance leaders is that they recognise the job that Isaf have done here for them - that the situation has been transformed - but importantly that they are now ready to take forward the mantle."Operation Herrick 19, the latest deployment, runs until June 2014.A large part of the force is made up of engineers as attention turns to bringing back equipment and disposing of what cannot be returned.Afghan forces will take the lead on all operations, but British troops have enough army and infantry for combat.All combat operations in the country are expected to be over by the end of next year, leaving Afghan forces fully in control.The UK presence in Afghanistan will be almost halved by the end of this year to 5,200.British troops are now placed at five bases - down from a peak of more than 130 - and rarely go on patrol.Six thousand soldiers and 300 armoured vehicles took part in a final training exercise, named Pashtun Dawn, ahead of the deployment.The exercise was the largest on Salisbury Plain for 10 years.Major Chris Hunter, a former bomb disposal officer for the British Army, told the BBC that Afghan forces should now be prepared to lead operations."It's down to leadership. They're certainly trained, they're certainly equipped to carry out the role," he added.</body>

      <title>Premier League one third English</title>
      <description>English footballers account for less than a third of minutes played in the Premier League, BBC Sport's State of the Game study shows.</description>

      <body>English footballers account for less than a third of all the minutes played in the Premier League, a State of the Game study for BBC Sport has found.The figure for home country players - 32.26% - is down from 35.43% in 2007-08 and is significantly lower than all other major European leagues according to football statisticians Opta.In La Liga, home of World Cup holders and European champions Spain, Spaniards account for 59% of all minutes played. In Germany's Bundesliga, Germans make up 50%.The minutes played by Scottish players in the Scottish Premiership has remained static - 57.36% in 2007-08 and 57.19% so far this season.But Scottish (3.27%), Welsh (3.17%) and Northern Irish (0.93%) players have got fewer minutes on the pitch in the Premier League than French (8.1%), Dutch (4%) and Spanish (6.27%) players so far this season.However, footballers from England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are playing more minutes in the Championship and the Scottish Premiership than they did five years ago.In total, 60.36% of minutes in the Premier League have been completed by foreign players so far this season, up from 56.7% in 2007-08.Former England captain Alan Shearer said: "These are tough times for English football at the moment. Everyone is aware that English football is not as healthy as it should be and I'm afraid it is all going to take time."Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said the figures were a "concern", but added: "There are only two ways you can see it - you have the opportunity to have the best players in the world in England, so let's see what they have and let's produce players who have the same qualities."Or you say, let's protect our players, keep the good players out and let's just play the English players. I believe that we live in a global world. The real question for English football is whether it can produce the players with the needed quality."In a statement, the Premier League said that it was working to encourage the development of home-grown talent, and highlighted the efforts being made as part of the Elite Player Performance Plan, a scheme designed to increase levels of investment and raise the standards of youth set-ups at English professional clubs."The Premier League is one season into the implementation of its £340m Elite Player Performance Plan, the number one stated aim of which is to develop more and better home-grown players," a spokesman said."Significant progress has already been made with club academies independently audited, coaching hours and provision increased, and new competitions established."Young home-grown players, including Daniel Sturridge [at Liverpool], Danny Welbeck [at Manchester United], Ross Barkley [at Everton], Ravel Morrison [at West Ham] and several others, have already made a significant impact this season. The clubs are working harder than ever to develop more home-grown players of sufficient quality to play in the Premier League."The BBC's study examined the minutes played by every nationality represented in the Premier League, the Championship and the Scottish Premiership so far this season, compared with the 2007-08 campaign, the last time all the home nations failed to qualify for a major tournament.The findings come ahead of a crucial few days in England's campaign to reach for next summer's World Cup in Brazil, a tournament that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have failed to qualify for.State of the Game found:Only last month, Football Association chairman Greg Dyke addressed what he called a "frightening trend" of the reduction in the number of English players playing regularly in the Premier League.Against the backdrop of a growing foreign influence in the Premier League, Dyke warned England might not be able to compete seriously on the world stage without changes in the domestic game.Shearer, who won 63 caps between 1992 and 2000 said: "It makes it harder for England, there's no doubt about it."But England didn't qualify for the US in 1994 when the percentage of British players was quite high, so I do believe that it's not only the number of foreign players in the Premier League that is making things difficult for England."I believe there are a number of other things. Foreign players are a lot cheaper than British players and as we all know, managers have no time whatsoever."There is also the hunger of young players and the coaching that players have. If you put all that together, then that's where England are at this moment in time."Chris Waddle, who won 62 caps for England between 1985 and 1991, said: "The Premier League is a great product to sell around the world but for the national team it does a lot of damage."All this money flying around in the Premier League, and grassroots [football] is going backwards."Former Football Association chairman Lord Triesman said it was an "acute problem and getting worse"."Unless there is some sort of ratio idea that Uefa president Michel Platini has been advocating over the years, I expect that we are not going to resolve that problem," he added.Former Northern Ireland international Billy Hamilton, who starred at the 1982 World Cup, said the figures painted a "bleak future" for his country."Unless the Premier League or indeed Championship put some kind of cap on the amount of foreign players then the statistics are only going to get worse for Northern Ireland," he said."Well, if the Premier League don't introduce a cap on foreign players to four or five in a team, I can tell you that England will never win another tournament."David Wetherall, head of player development at the Football League, said he was not surprised the numbers of UK numbers were on the up in the Championship."There's some fantastic youth development work being done in the Football League. About £60m per year is invested in youth development in the Football League, and two thirds of that comes from the clubs themselves."Figures amended at 13:12 BST on 10 Oct because of Serbia being counted twice</body>

      <body>A printing mix up led to early copies of the latest Bridget Jones book having a chunk of Sir David Jason's memoirs in the middle.About 40 pages of Sir David's My Life were printed in Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, both of which came out on the same day."The printers have had a Bridget moment," said publishers Vintage.It said it was recalling the misprinted copies and replacing them with correct versions."A printing error has been detected in some of the very early copies of Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy," said a Vintage spokesman."Copies printed on one day have given readers an accidental preview of David Jason's autobiography."Both Fielding and Sir David's book were published on what the publishing world has dubbed "Super Thursday", when publishing houses put out some of their highest-priority titles for the Christmas market.Among other books released are Jennifer Saunders' autobiography Bonkers, My Life in Laughs; Mo Farah's Twin Ambitions and John Bishop's How Did All This Happen?Mad About the Boy signals the final chapter of hapless "singleton" Bridget Jones's diaries.Fans may already know one of the significant plotlines after extracts were earlier published in the Sunday Times Magazine.Although Fielding herself approved the reveal, some fans were shocked to be told of such a major twist before the book had even been published.</body>

      <body>Glenn Hoddle says England should forget about winning the 2014 World Cup but thinks success is not very far away.The ex-England boss is on a Football Association commission looking at ways of improving the nation's fortunes."It is unrealistic for England to think they can go and win the World Cup in Brazil," Hoddle told BBC Sport."Let's first qualify, then get the youngsters experiencing a tournament in Brazil so that in two years' time we can have a real go at the Euros."FA chairman Greg Dyke has also written off England's chances of winning in Brazil next year and has targeted success in the 2022 World Cup.But Hoddle told BBC Sport's Ben Smith: "I know Greg has said he wants England to win in 2022, but I think we can bring that forward."I would hope to say we could expect to get some success a little bit earlier than that."The former England and Tottenham midfielder thinks youngsters Ross Barkley, 19, and Jack Wilshere, 21, can help propel England to future success.But Hoddle says they need to be given the opportunity to play regular international football first, starting with next year's World Cup.England will book their place in Brazil if they win their final two qualifying games against Montenegro on Friday and then Poland next Tuesday.Roy Hodgson's side currently sit top of Group H, after picking 16 points from eight matches, one point ahead of Ukraine and Montenegro."I do believe we will be there, but it is about the experience that the likes of the Barkleys, the Wilsheres can get under their belt so that we can have a real onslaught at the Euros," said Hoddle, who was England boss from 1996 to 1999.The 55-year-old thinks the chances of England or any European side winning in Brazil next year are slim."No European team has ever won a World Cup in South America," he said."Spain have Europe's best chance, but even then they probably only have a 35% chance. England have got a lesser chance than that. I don't want to put a percentage on that."Hoddle has been joined on the FA commission by Danny Mills, Howard Wilkinson and Dario Gradi,The former England and Tottenham midfielder believes he can make a positive contribution."I really have got some exciting ideas that I want to run across this commission and I hope people will get on board with it," he said."It is something close to my heart, close to my heart for many years."Hoddle admits the number of foreigners in the Premier League is a hindrance and thinks England has a lot of work to do to catch up with other nations.Responding to BBC Sport's State of the Game survey, which has revealed that playing time for English players in the Premier League has dropped to just 31.8%, he feared the situation could get "worse and worse" if no action was taken."We have got to produce better players so they become as good as the Spanish kids, they become as good as the French and the South Americans," he said."We will always create exciting players, like your Ferdinands, your Owens and your Beckhams, but we need 15 of these players every two years coming through."That's what the Spanish have done, that's where the French have done, so we've got a lot of things to change if we are going to catch up. We've been stuck for a very long time."Hoddle also praised Dyke's leadership after meeting the FA chairman and giving him "a vision of how we could improve things".Hoddle, who spoke with Dyke "a couple of months back", added: "I am particularly impressed that Greg wants to change things."He's very successful in what he's done as a businessman and has a different outlook to some of his predecessors."</body>

      <title>Tendulkar to retire from all cricket</title>
      <description>Legendary India batsman Sachin Tendulkar announces his retirement from all forms of cricket at the age of 40.</description>

      <date>1381409632</date>
      <body>Legendary batsman Sachin Tendulkar will retire from all forms of cricket after playing his 200th Test next month.The 40-year-old former India captain, who retired from one-day internationals in December 2012, will end his career with two matches against West Indies."It's hard to imagine a life without playing cricket because it's all I've ever done since I was 11," he said.Tendulkar is the highest scorer in both Tests and ODIs, with 15,837 runs in 198 Tests and 18,426 runs in 463 ODIs.He made his international debut aged 16 in November 1989 and last year became the only batsman in the history of the game to reach 100 international centuries."All my life, I have had a dream of playing cricket for India. I have been living this dream every day for the last 24 years," Tendulkar said.He played his final Twenty20 match last weekend in the Champions League T20 final between his Mumbai Indians team and a Rajasthan Royals side led by another former India skipper, his long-standing team-mate Rahul Dravid.Tendulkar's final appearances will also take place in India and he said: "It's been a huge honour to have represented my country and played all over the world. I look forward to playing my 200th Test match on home soil, as I call it a day."He also holds the record for the most number of Test appearances, with Australians Ricky Ponting and Steve Waugh joint second on 168, followed by Rahul Dravid (164) and South African Jacques Kallis, who is still playing, on 162.The president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, N Srinivasan, said: "He is without doubt the greatest cricketer India has produced."In fact, one should really say he ranks among the top of all-time great sportspersons in the world. No one has served Indian cricket as Sachin has."He has truly been an ambassador for India and Indian cricket. He has been an inspiration for generations of sportsmen, not just cricketers."We respect his decision to retire, although many of us can't imagine an Indian team without Sachin."Tendulkar was tipped for greatness from an early age, and whilst still at school in 1988 he made an unbeaten 326 in a stand of 664 with Vinod Kambli in the semi-finals of the Harris Shield.His first Test century came in his 14th innings and was against England at Old Trafford in 1990.There were six double centuries, the first of which came against New Zealand in 1999 and the most recent a 214 against Australia in Bangalore in October 2010, with his highest score an unbeaten 248 against Bangladesh in 2004.Tendulkar racked up 16 Test hundreds before he turned 25 and in 2000 became the first man to score 50 international tons, while in 2010 he became the first double centurion in a one-day international.It was hoped his 100th international hundred would be in the 2,000th Test match, which was against England at the home of cricket, Lord's, in 2011 but he was dismissed for 34 and 12 and the feat was achieved in an ODI the following year.One of his most memorable Test centuries was an unbeaten 103 that inspired India to victory against England in December 2008 and came shortly after terror attacks hit his home city of Mumbai.Tendulkar was popular across the world, and in 1992 became the first overseas player to sign for Yorkshire, scoring more than 1,000 runs in the summer.BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew said on Twitter:  "Perfect symmetry to Sachin's retirement: 200th Test, not confirmed, surely to be played in Mumbai. Also a charming man to deal with, which I have been fortunate to do many times."Former England captain Michael Vaughan tweeted:  "One of the greatest ever Sachin Tendulkar is retiring. One of my heroes and an absolute joy to play against."And England batsman Kevin Pietersen also took to Twitter  to dub Tendulkar: "Undisputed Champion of Cricket!"In a special BBC Radio 5 live programme on Monday 14 October at 21:00 BST, Mark Chapman is joined by BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew and Indian commentator Prakash Wakankar as they look back at the career of Sachin Tendulkar.</body>

      <title>Women's Tour gets equal billing</title>

      <body>The women's Tour of Britain is set to attract top riders after being given the same status as the men's race.World cycling's governing body, the UCI, has given the event 2.1 status for its launch in 2014.The race, to be staged over five days in May, will be separate to the men's event held in September."We are absolutely delighted that the UCI have awarded us 2.1 status for this exciting new event," said Guy Elliott, director of event organisers SweetSpot.The UCI grades all men's and women's stage races - any event that takes place over several days - in four categories: WT, 2.HC, 2.1 and 2.2.WT, which stands for World Tour, includes the sport's most prestigious races, such as the Tour de France.The 2.1 category is the third tier overall, below 2.HC. But giving the Tour of Britain 2.1 status ranks it among the highest-rated women's races, meaning it will be able to attract top riders.Plans for a women's race were confirmed in July. The event will take place between Wednesday, 7 May and Sunday, 11 May next year, with the opening stage to be held in Northamptonshire.Exact details of the route, and start and finish locations, have yet to be announced.</body>

      <title>Teenager's Russian 'transfer saga'</title>
      <description>A 14-year-old boy is struggling to gain clearance to represent a Sunday league side after playing in a junior tournament in Russia.</description>

      <body>A 14-year-old boy cannot play Sunday league football until he gets international clearance after playing in a junior tournament in Russia.Rob Johnstone needs clearance from the Football Association to play for Swavesey Spartans in the Cambridge and District Colts League.His father, Rob Sr, said the issue was "an international transfer saga".The FA said it was adhering to Fifa regulations that ensure the safety of minor players.The Johnstones moved to Russia in 2006 with Rob Sr's work but returned to Cambridgeshire in June this year.Rob Jr played for a Moscow youth team called Tip Top Tigers, a side unaffiliated with the Russian football authorities, between August and October 2011.After being asked for a series of documents and reasons for their move back home, the FA said it would need correspondence from the Russian Football Union, even though Rob Jr was never registered with them."What I thought was going to be a very simple situation where he would play for the local under-14s turned into an international transfer saga," said Rob Sr."He's not registered in Russia. There's no paperwork. He played for a kids team in a tournament with boys and girls playing together."The latest I've heard is that after 17 October, Swavesey's club secretary can apply for some sort of clearance. Whether the FA will grant it or not I don't know."Rob Jr added: "It's really annoying. It's stopping me from doing the thing I like to do."In a statement the FA said: "The FA has a commitment to football for everyone but the case regarding Rob Johnstone requires international clearance under Fifa regulations."As the player is under the age of 18, strict regulations have been enforced by Fifa (article 19) to ensure the safety of minor players and these apply to all 208 national associations across the globe."The mandatory documentation required by Fifa must prove that the parents have moved to the new country for non-football related reasons."The FA has been liaising with the Russian FA since last month in the hope that we can get Rob Johnstone's international clearance through as quickly as possible."</body>

      <description>US Republicans offer President Obama a short-term debt limit increase in exchange for negotiations about how to end a government shutdown.</description>

      <body>US Republicans have offered President Barack Obama a short-term debt limit increase to stave off default.House Speaker John Boehner said they would do so in exchange for wider negotiations with the White House to end a government shutdown that took effect on 1 October.Republicans will meet Mr Obama later on Thursday.Officials have warned the US will risk default on 17 October if the nation's borrowing limit is not increased.Mr Boehner said on Thursday: "What we want to do is to offer the president today the ability to move a temporary increase in the debt ceiling in agreement to go to conference on the budget for his willingness to sit down and discuss with us a way forward to reopen the government."A spokesman for Mr Boehner told reporters that the deal on the table ahead of Thursday afternoon's meeting was a "clean" increase of the debt limit, with no additional policies attached.But it would only last six weeks - until November 22.On Wednesday, Mr Obama met House Democrats at the White House and told them he would prefer a longer-term increase of one year to the nation's $16.69 trillion (£10.47 trillion) debt ceiling.But the president said he was willing to accept a short-term rise in the borrowing cap to "give Boehner some time to deal with the Tea Party wing of his party", Representative Peter Welch told the Associated Press news agency after the meeting.Earlier, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told a congressional panel the US could not prioritise between its payment obligations once borrowing was exhausted.Mr Lew warned lawmakers the government could miss pension and healthcare payments for the elderly as well as military salaries.And a missing payment on US debt would trigger a potentially more profound financial crisis, he warned."This system was not designed to be turned off selectively," Mr Lew told a Senate hearing. "It would be chaos."</body>

      <title>Minister considers gassing badgers</title>
      <description>The government is exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB, environment secretary Owen Paterson tells MPs.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24475034</url>
      <date>1381404261</date>
      <body>The government is exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has told MPs.A six week trial of badger culling in Somerset has now ended.But the firm behind it has asked for more time after its marksmen fell short of killing the target of 70% of the badger population.Mr Paterson said the Department for Food and Rural Affairs was looking at other methods including the use of gas.Responding to a question from Green MP Caroline Lucas in the Commons, Mr Paterson said: "Until we can establish vaccines, we have to use the tools used by other sensible countries - which is to remove wildlife - we made it quite clear in our TB strategy we would look at other methods of removing wildlife, and yes we are looking at gassing, but we will not use it unless it is proven to be safe, humane, and effective."Labour MP Barry Sheerman called the badger cull "morally reprehensible" and asked Mr Paterson "why doesn't he resign?" during heated Commons exchanges.Marksmen only managed to shoot 60% of the badgers in the trial area in Somerset, although estimates have been lowered as to how many badgers lived in the region in the first place.The company behind the cull has asked for more time and a similar time extension is being sought for a trial cull Gloucestershire.The government is due to make a decision on extending the culls later this week.Farmers have long blamed badgers for spreading bovine TB in cattle but animal rights groups say evidence does not support this.At one time gassing was the preferred method of culling but it was dropped in favour of shooting, which is seen as more humane.The RSPCA said it was "opposed to the use of gas to control badgers on welfare grounds and believes it is not humane as it may cause badgers to suffer prolonged deaths underground"."We are extremely concerned about the government's admission that they are looking into using gassing to cull badgers," the organisation said in a statement."Culling badgers will not solve the problem of bovine TB in cattle, whatever the method of culling."The possible gassing of badgers adds a further outrageous twist to this misguided policy. The RSPCA will look into reports that badgers have been gassed in and around the pilot cull areas."Martin Surl, Police and Crime Commissioner for Gloucestershire, has warned that plans to extend the cull could stretch police resources in his area.Mr Surl told the the Stroud News and Journal: "My concern is that the cull operators are feeling the pressure and may become more desperate in their attempts to shoot their quota of badgers while the people opposed to the cull are getting equally frustrated, all of which adds up to an unhelpful situation."But Laurence Robertson, Conservative MP for Tewkesbury, dismissed Mr Surl's concerns, accusing him in the Commons of being "publicity-seeking", adding that it was for the government to decide whether to extend the cull.In the trial which has just ended, the plan was to shoot and kill 70% of badgers in the areas of west Somerset and Gloucestershire by free shooting.Across both regions this meant around 5,000 badgers were to be killed in total.But Defra sources said these targets were based on population estimates from 2012 that have proved to be highly inaccurate.Explaining the failure to meet the target on Wednesday, Mr Paterson said: "The badgers moved the goalposts."We're dealing with a wild animal, subject to the vagaries of the weather and disease and breeding patterns."But rock star and campaigner Brian May, a leading opponent of the cull, branded the trial an "utter failure" and described the application for an extension as a "farce"."They were warned this would happen and they did not listen to the scientists," he added.</body>

      <title>NHS 'must seek saving ideas abroad'</title>
      <description>The NHS in England has to look to India and Mexico for saving ideas - or face a large funding shortfall, its regulator says.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24464934</url>
      <date>1381366030</date>
      <body>The NHS in England has to look abroad for new ideas - or face a large funding shortfall by the start of the next decade, a health regulator has said.Monitor said the NHS was only likely to reach two-thirds of its £30bn saving target by 2021 if it kept on as it was.Most savings so far have come from keeping wages low and improving productivity.But the regulator said the NHS should be more radical by borrowing ideas from countries such as India and Mexico.Monitor's report cites Aravind Eye Care which runs a network of cataract clinics across India.The report said: "By streamlining the workflow of care to maximise the use of staff skills, Aravind is able to perform 60% of the number of NHS cataract surgeries but at one-sixth of the cost to the NHS and achieve better clinical outcomes."Another scheme highlighted was Medicall Home in Mexico which is a nurse telephone advice service that has had great success in reducing the need for consultations with local doctors."If the NHS were to introduce a similar service and it reduced 50% of first visits to general practice, where patients would otherwise have seen a doctor, we estimate it could free up GP time worth in the region of £0.6bn to £0.8bn, taking into account the cost of nurses to run the phone service," stated the report.Other schemes highlighted include one in Ghana for capturing patient information and images on a mobile phone and sending them "for interpretation by a doctor at a different location".Monitor said using fresh ideas such as these could help the NHS meet its ambitious savings targets.Over recent years the NHS has been working towards saving £15-20bn by 2015 - the so-called "Nicholson challenge".But it is now becoming accepted that the savings drive will need to be extended beyond that and hence a £30bn figure has been put forward for 2021.Monitor chief executive David Bennett said he agreed with that but claimed the combination of wage restraint, productivity improvements and reconfiguration of hospitals services was only likely to save around two-thirds of that and so fresh ideas were needed.He said that could either be achieved by getting new providers from abroad into the NHS to compete or by getting NHS trusts to adopt their ideas.He added: "We are not going to make the numbers add up if we don't have this sort of innovation."We must not rule out letting players outside the NHS from coming in and showing us how to do things differently."British Medical Association leader Dr Mark Porter questioned how easy it would be to adopt ideas from abroad."Doctors would need to see more detail as to how the changes proposed would work in reality," he said.But he added it was clear the continuing funding crisis meant doctors had to be given the "freedom" to innovate.Monitor, set up in 2004, describes itself as "the sector regulator for health services in England". It exercises a range of regulatory powers under different acts of parliament.</body>

      <title>Inspectors attack prison education</title>
      <description>Ofsted inspectors have strongly criticised the standards of education and training in England's prisons.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24460085</url>
      <date>1381407494</date>
      <body>Ofsted inspectors have strongly criticised standards of education and training in England's prisons.The watchdog says it is unacceptable that not one prison has been rated "outstanding" for education in the past four years and only one in three is rated "good".At Wormwood Scrubs jail in London, Ofsted chiefs said if the figures related to schools there would be a "national outcry".Ministers say reforms are under way.In a speech at the prison, Matthew Coffey, national director of further education and skills at Ofsted, said the aim of training and education in jail should be to make people less likely to go back to crime when they got out."This year's annual lecture aims to focus on how we can reduce the high re-offending rates that are nearly 50% for adult prisoners and 72% for juveniles," he said."The aim is to reduce the number of re-offenders by focusing on rehabilitation in prisons through better employer engagement and better teaching and training."Levels of education among prisoners are generally much lower than in the population as a whole.Some studies suggest half of men in UK jails and nearly three-quarters of female prisoners have no qualifications at all, while about half have literacy skills below that of most eleven-year-olds. Many have been expelled from school.Mr Coffey said: "Far too many prisoners leave prison without employability skills, meaning they are less likely to find a job. Research shows that being in employment is one of the key factors that can reduce the risk of re-offending by between 30% and 50%. However, examples of good training provision in prisons were all too scarce."Clearly, reducing the number of those re-offending is in everyone's interests. Every prisoner costs the taxpayer the same as sending a child to Eton, around £34,000 per year. We must now focus on improvement of prisoners' vocational and employability skills to ensure we support them on their journey out of prison and into employment to break the cycle of re-offending."He added that there were "outstanding examples" of prisons working with employers, education providers and other bodies to help prisoners develop vocational skills, but that those examples, were "all too scarce".Education in prisons in England and Wales is provided by private bodies which bid for contracts.Prisons Minister Jeremy Wright said: "Re-offending rates have been too high for too long and we are introducing significant reforms to the way offenders are rehabilitated and managed in the community."We are committed to improving education in prison and are working with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Skills Funding Agency to develop prisoner learning."In most countries in the European Union, only about one in four adult prisoners takes part in education, according to a report for the EU published earlier this year, out of 640,000 inmates.In England and Wales, the proportion is higher, with an estimated 42% receiving some kind of prison education, which has to be provided by law.The EU report said prisons were all too often "environments for negative learning" when they could be offering people a second chance.According to the University and College Union, which represents many prison teachers and trainers, the "constant re-tendering" for education contracts brings problems, including a high turnover of staff and instability.They say because providers are paid by results, some teachers feel under pressure to limit courses to certain offenders and those in for longer terms.</body>

      <body>The US Army is working to develop "revolutionary" smart armour that would give its troops "superhuman strength".It is calling on the technology industry, government labs and academia to help build the Iron Man-style suit.Other exoskeletons that allow soldiers to carry large loads much further have already been tested by the army.The Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (Talos) would have such a frame but would also have layers of smart materials fitted with sensors.The suit would also need to have wide-area networking and a wearable computer similar to Google Glass, the US Army said.It should be made of smart material fitted with sensors to monitor body temperature, heart rate and hydration levels.The exoskeleton, which could be attached to arms and legs, would be likely to use hydraulics to greatly increase strength."The requirement is a comprehensive family of systems in a combat armour suit where we bring together an exoskeleton with innovative armour, displays for power monitoring, health monitoring, and integrating a weapon into that," said Lt Col Karl Borjes, a science adviser at the US Army's research, development and engineering command."It's advanced armour. It's communications, antennas. It's cognitive performance. It's sensors, miniature-type circuits. That's all going to fit in here, too," he added.According to US Army Sgt Maj Chris Faris, "no one industry can build it".Instead the army is calling on research and development organisations, private industry as well as government labs and academia to support the project.The US Army said it was likely that scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology would be involved in the design.An MIT team is currently developing liquid body armour - made from fluids that transform into a solid when a magnetic field or electrical current is applied.In an interview with US news site NPR, MIT professor Gareth McKinley compared the futuristic armour to that seen in Hollywood films."It sounds exactly like Iron Man," he said."The other kind of things that you see in the movies... would be the kind of external suit that Sigourney Weaver wears in Aliens, where it's a large robot that amplifies the motions and lifting capability of a human."The aim is the get the Talos armour out in the field within three years.</body>

      <body>Nations have begun signing a legally binding treaty designed to curb mercury pollution and the use of the toxic metal in products around the globe.Mercury can produce a range of adverse human health effects, including permanent damage to the nervous system.The UN treaty was formally adopted at a high level meeting in Japan.The Minamata Convention was named after the Japanese city that, in the 1950s, saw one of the world's worst cases of mercury poisoning.In January, four years of negotiations concluded with more than 140 countries agreeing on a set of legally binding measures to curb mercury pollution.UN data showed that mercury emissions were rising in a number of developing nations.The convention regulates a range of areas, including:Earlier this year, the UN Environment Programme (Unep) published a report warning that developing nations were facing growing health and environmental risks from increased exposure to mercury.It said a growth in small-scale mining and coal burning were the main reasons for the rise in emissions.As a result of rapid industrialisation, South-East Asia was the largest regional emitter and accounted for almost half of the element's annual global emissions, it said.'Highly toxic'Mercury - a heavy, silvery white metal - is a liquid at room temperature and can evaporate easily. Within the environment, it is found in cinnabar deposits. It is also found in natural forms in a range of other rocks, including limestone and coal.Mercury can be released into the environment through a number of industrial processes including mining, metal and cement production, and the burning of fossil fuels.Once emitted, it persists in the environment for a long time - circulating through air, water, soil and living organisms - and can be dispersed over vast distances.The World Health Organization (WHO) says: "Mercury is highly toxic to human health, posing a particular threat to the development of the (unborn) child and early in life."The inhalation of mercury vapour can produce harmful effects on the nervous, digestive and immune systems, lungs and kidneys, and may be fatal."The inorganic salts of mercury are corrosive to the skin, eyes and gastrointestinal tract, and may induce kidney toxicity if ingested."The Unep assessment said the concentration of mercury in the top 100m of the world's oceans had doubled over the past century, and estimated that 260 tonnes of the toxic metal had made their way from soil into rivers and lakes.Another characteristic, it added, was that mercury became more concentrated as it moved up the food chain, reaching its highest levels in predator fish that could be consumed by humans.Campaigners urged nations to sign the land-mark agreement."Millions of people around the world are exposed to the toxic effect of mercury," said Juliane Kippenberg, senior children's right researcher at Human Rights Watch."This treaty will help protect both the environment and people's right to health."</body>

      <body>A painting by Francis Bacon of his friend and fellow artist Lucian Freud is expected to sell for at least $85m (£53m) when it is auctioned for the first time in New York next month.The triptych, Three Studies of Lucian Freud (1969), is considered to be one of Bacon's greatest masterpieces.It will have its first ever UK public viewing at Christie's from 13 to 18 October during Frieze Art week.A smaller, preparatory triptych of Freud sold at auction for £23m in 2011.Three Studies for a Portrait of Lucian Freud, painted in 1965, had been expected to sell for between £7m and £9m.Francis Outred, head of Post-War and Contemporary Art at Christie's, Europe said the Three Studies of Lucian Freud, completed four years later, was "a true masterpiece and one of the greatest paintings to come up for auction in a current generation"."It is an undeniable icon of 20th Century art and a painting that Bacon preserved as one of his favourites."Outred said the first public unveiling of the complete painting in London was "quite a moment"."The work is a very important international painting but it's also a conversation between two masters who happen to be British."It marks Bacon and Freud's relationship, paying tribute to the creative and emotional kinship between the two artists," he added.Bacon and Freud met in 1945 and became close companions, painting each other on a number of occasions, before their relationship cooled during the 1970s.Bacon, known for his triptychs, painted Three Studies of Lucian Freud in 1969 at London's Royal College of Art, after his studio was destroyed in a fire.With its sunshine yellow background, it is an "extraordinary piece of paintwork" and one of only two existing, full length triptychs of Freud.The other, painted in 1966, was last seen in 1992, according to Outred, "but no one knows where it is".Exhibited in Bacon's renowned retrospective at the Grand Palais, Paris in 1971-1972, the three panels that form the painting were separated for almost fifteen years in the mid-1970s.One panel was shown at the Tate in 1985 before the three sections were reassembled in their original splendour.The complete work was displayed in New Haven, Connecticut in 1999.According to the curator Martin Harrison: "Bacon was deeply distressed when the triptych was dismantled, noting on a photograph of the left panel that it was only 'a fragment of a triptych… and I think it is meaningless unless it is united with the other two panels.'"Its reassembly into the form he intended would, if he lived to see it, have caused him profound satisfaction, given that this was among the surprisingly small number of his paintings he held in high regard."</body>

      <title>Is altruism self-interest in disguise?</title>
      <description>Is altruism simply self-interest in disguise? And can a mathematical equation hope to answer the question?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24457645</url>
      <date>1381360309</date>
      <body>Is altruism simply self-interest in disguise? And can a mathematical equation hope to answer the question?In 1968, an academic almost unknown in the UK walked into University College London and presented its staff with an equation so remarkable, that they offered him an honorary position and the keys to his own office.His name was George Price, and his equation addressed a problem that has vexed scientists since Charles Darwin published On The Origin of Species more than a century earlier. If we are selfish creatures, engaged in a battle for survival, why do we display altruism? Why do we show kindness to others even at a cost to ourselves?Price's equation explained how altruism could thrive, even amongst groups of selfish people.It built on the work of a number of other scientists, arguably beginning with JBS Haldane, a British biologist who developed a theory in the early 1950s. When asked if he would sacrifice his own life to save that of another, he said that he would, but only under certain conditions. "I would lay down my life for two brothers, or eight cousins."Haldane's reasoning was a simplistic explanation of a theory that has come to dominate evolutionary biology - that of "kin selection".Since he would share 50% of each brother's genetic makeup, and 12.5% of each cousin's, his genes would survive even if he were to die.It took until the early 1960s for another scientist, William Donald Hamilton, to popularise the theory. He wrote a simple equation to explain that an organism would demonstrate self-sacrificing behaviour if it would enhance the reproductive chances of those it was closely related to.In 1967 Price arrived in London from the United States, where he had been a scientist and journalist, but with no background in the field of evolutionary biology.He discovered Hamilton's theory in a public library and thought he could improve upon it. Working in seclusion, he rewrote the equation in a simpler but more wide-reaching way. It explained the relationship between different generations of a population, and could be used to show how the prevalence of particular traits would change over time.Although it was a fairly simple statement, it had never been expressed in clear mathematical terms, and the staff at the University College London recognised his insight as wildly original.A debate about the scientific roots of altruism still rages to this day, but kin selection remains a hugely influential theory, and Price's contribution is held in high regard by many."It underpins a lot of modern evolutionary biology research," says Andy Gardner, an evolutionary biologist at Oxford University, who uses the Price Equation in much of his work.Oren Harman, who wrote Price's biography in 2010, says the view is shared by plenty of people in the field."Although there are those who fail to see the precise use of the equation, others think of it as the most simple and brilliant description of the dynamics of natural selection."But Price began to find the implications of his work very difficult to deal with, according to Harman. If altruism was simply an attempt to ensure the survival of one's own genes, could it be considered altruism at all?Lee Dugatkin, professor of Biology at the University of Louisville, thinks it was this thought that triggered a major change in Price. "That was what got him going," he says. "He was so depressed when he found out that Hamilton was right."In the summer of 1970, Price became a devout Christian and embarked on a radical project - giving himself over to the service of others."He was going to go out to try and show that human beings are the only species that can beat out their own nature. And he was going to do that by becoming a pure selfless altruist," says Harman.Price began giving money to homeless people, and invited many of them to live with him in his flat near Oxford Circus. His increasingly erratic behaviour left him penniless. He left his flat and eventually moved into a squat in Kentish Town.It is not universally agreed that Price's equation triggered his downfall - he was undoubtedly suffering from some form of mental illness as well. And in the winter of 1975, Price took his own life.For Harman, the two are inextricably linked. "I think the fact that George killed himself due to his interpretation of the equation really focuses the problem to the utmost degree."Price's story is laced with tragedy, but need his scientific work imply a dark, depressing view of human nature?Samir Okasha, professor of the philosophy of science at Bristol University, thinks not. "The idea that what evolutionary theory shows is that altruism is self-interest in disguise is, to my mind, a questionable thing to say."Behaviour in some animal species is indeed genetically determined, he says, but with humans "that certainly isn't the case". He argues that culture sets us apart from animals in that respect, and points to the huge variance in social norms in different countries, and over short periods of time."We have seen rather dramatic change over, say, a 300-year period, which cannot be explained by genetics," he says.Harman also disagrees with Price's interpretation of his own work. "It is not a necessary logical conclusion. It was his own conclusion, the conclusion of a troubled mind, but it's what led him to a terrible realisation that there is no true kindness in the world."If we want to understand behaviour, biology is part of it - it has to be by definition. But that's never an entire and complete explanation for the complexity and grandeur of the human condition."Gardner thinks it is always possible to think of people as attempting to protect and reproduce their own genetic material. "But that's not necessarily always selfish," he says. "There's room for altruism in that logic."Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>The hunt for a long-lost John Wayne film</title>
      <description>The Oregon Trail, a 1936 film starring John Wayne, is missing. Fans and historians are trying to find it.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24407455</url>
      <date>1381368054</date>
      <body>John Wayne was the archetypal screen cowboy, embodying the rough independence of the American west for generations of film fans. Now, newly discovered still photographs offer fresh insight into a western he made that was last seen more than three-quarters of a century ago.Kent Sperring was raised in Ocala, Florida, in the 1940s by his mother, a widow who worked as a chemist's clerk."Money was kind of scarce," he said.Luckily, he could see "a double-feature western for nine cents" at the Ritz theatre on Saturdays. The movies made an impression."You came away from the movie knowing that if you did something bad or wrong, you were going to get punished for it," he said.Wayne and other good cowboys wore white hats. The bad ones wore black hats."It was almost that clear-cut," he said. "If you watched the films long enough, you'd see that those bad guys - they didn't end up too well."The films were wildly successful. Today, Wayne ranks as one of the most popular film stars of all time, admired by Sperring and countless others.Yet despite Wayne's iconic stature, one of his films is missing.The Oregon Trail, released by Republic Pictures in 1936, was shown in theatres - then disappeared. There are no known remaining prints.In the film Wayne plays John Delmont, a retired army captain who falls in love with a frontier woman played by Ann Rutherford, who later appears in Gone With the Wind. The plot hinges on the discovery of a journal bound in black that once belonged to Delmont's father.Reading the diary, Delmont learns that his father has been killed or was left to die by a renegade - and vows to hunt down the killer.Earlier this year Sperring, a retired telephone company manager in Duluth, Georgia, discovered 40 still photographs taken on the sets of The Oregon Trail.He came across the photos while ordering Wayne memorabilia from a video store, Eddie Brandt's Saturday Matinee, in North Hollywood."They sent me the negatives," said Sperring. "I think they did it by mistake."Decades ago, photographers would take pictures of actors, either during a scene or after it had been shot, with an 8in by 10in (20cm by 25cm) camera. The photographs, known as movie stills, were then displayed in glass cases outside of theatres.Sperring scanned the stills into a computer and sent them to the Lone Pine Film History Museum in Lone Pine, California, so they could be stored in the archives.These photographs and other promotional material are the film's lasting legacy. They provide insight into the film, showing the locations where it was shot and other details about the production.The promotional materials are also striking images. Aside from the stills, three posters remain. Painted in garish colours, Wayne fords a river in a stagecoach pulled by a team of wild-eyed horses.The Lone Pine museum, which celebrates the western film genre, hosts an annual film festival.This year it will take place from 11-13 October and will feature Jake Thorne in The Life and Legend of John Wayne.Lone Pine museum director Bob Sigman, former president of Republic Pictures, started his own search for the film a decade ago. He prides himself on his hard-nosed approach to the film world. He is the kind of person who says: "I've been in this business a long time.""If we could have brought out The Oregon Trail, it would have generated a million dollars in revenue," he said, standing in a room with klieg lights at the museum last summer.As he spoke, a Comstock Cowboys CD played in the background. The music has simple chords with lonely-guy lyrics: "I rode in the deadwood one dark, stormy evening."Sigman said he believed The Oregon Trail was misfiled and placed in the wrong canister.He picked up a rusted canister, a storage case for movie prints, that been lying on the floor. It was empty, except for a brochure from a 2003 film festival.He said the canister with The Oregon Trail may be sitting in a warehouse somewhere. He has travelled to Latin America in search of the film and has spoken with film distributors in Europe and the UK."I looked all over the world for it," he said. "It is one of the treasures that everybody wants."Should a print be found, it would not be the first time a lost film was rediscovered.Another film from the 1930s featuring Wayne - a pre-censorship version of Baby Face - was missing until a curator found it at the US Library of Congress in 2004.Too Much Johnson, a 1938 picture by Orson Welles, was discovered more recently in an Italian warehouse. The US premiere of the film will take place at the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York, on 16 October.By 1935, when The Oregon Trail was shot, Wayne, then 28, had already appeared in dozens of films.But his career prospects looked grim.His 1930 star turn in Raoul Walsh's The Big Trail was artistically ambitious but flopped at the box office.He spent the next several years appearing in poverty-row westerns, as the low-budget films were called. For a while he worked as a singing cowboy.Yet he was not a quitter. Courage, he once said, "is being scared to death but saddling up anyway".After The Oregon Trail, he appeared in several more films before he was propelled to stardom as the Ringo Kid in John Ford's Stagecoach in 1939.Wayne's earlier films are now prized by collectors and studied by fans and historians.Wayne himself described the work in simple terms. As he said in a BBC interview in 1964, the films tell "the story of the West - the story of a man fighting against the elements".The most compelling characters, he said, were men of action."There's no nuance," he said in a BBC interview in 1974."They drive ahead," Wayne said, "usually fighting something bigger than a petty little argument with someone."A historian at the museum, Chris Langley, is using the movie stills to track down locations where the film was shot. In this way, he hopes to deepen the public's understanding of the movie - and of Wayne.One Saturday morning last summer, Langley tossed a manila folder into the front seat of his car and drove about 10 miles (16km) to the Alabama Hills, where The Oregon Trail was shot in December 1935.Known as Hollywood's back lot, Alabama Hills was also the setting for Gunga Din, a 1939 movie based on a Rudyard Kipling poem, several Firestone tyre commercials, and Quentin Tarantino's recent Django Unchained.Mt Whitney's 14,497ft (4,418m) peak loomed in the distance. Granite rocks were scattered across a lunar landscape.Grabbing the folder, Langley climbed out of the car."I thought if I were ever in trouble, I'd like John Wayne to ride up," he said. "It's like a father figure, but it's more than that."It was a wet morning, with a sharp breeze that wrapped around your legs. Chunks of broken glass jutted from the dirt, and it was quiet. One could hear raindrops splash on dark leaves, and the place smelled like sage and Marlboro Lights."You're now leaning exactly where John Wayne is," said Langley. He held up a movie still. In the photograph Wayne leans against a rock. He wears a white jacket with fringe, cinched with a silver buckle.Sperring is now in Lone Pine for the film festival at the weekend. He too spent time in Alabama Hills, visiting places where Wayne acted out scenes in The Oregon Trail and other films."I don't want to sound goofy, but it's almost like you feel their presence," Sperring said. "It's a good feeling."For Sperring and others, Wayne was part of their childhood. As Joan Didion wrote in a 1965 essay for The Saturday Evening Post: "He determined forever the shape of certain of our dreams."The Oregon Trail is gone, but some things remain."I'll look at a rock that was there 75 years ago," Sperring said."It erodes, but it erodes very slowly because it's hard granite. You look, and you see that very little changes. The rocks will split and fall down, but they are still there."</body>

      <body>A man who assaulted, raped and held a woman prisoner after she was snatched from Slovakia and trafficked to Lancashire has been jailed.Azam Khan "bought" the woman and "married" her at a local mosque in a bid to halt his deportation from the UK to Pakistan.Five other people helped in her trafficking after she was snatched in August 2012, Preston Crown Court heard.Khan, 34, of Brougham Street, Burnley was jailed for 12 years.The victim's story was described by prosecutor Joe Boyd as like "something from a 19th Century novel by Dickens".The Crown Prosecution Service's Emma Kehoe said the woman had been "falsely imprisoned, beaten and raped"."She had no money or identity documents and she was unable to speak English or ask anyone for help," she said."She was threatened and told she was not allowed to leave."The woman was brought to England on a coach and kept prisoner by Imrich Bodor, 45, and Slovakian Petra Dzudzova, 27, both of Clipstone Street, Bradford.Bodor was sentenced to nine years in prison. Dzudzova is due to be sentenced at a later date.Before being sold to Khan, she was handed over to Afghani Abdul Sabool Shinwary, 38, of Washington Street, Bradford, who sexually assaulted her, and Slovakian Kristina Makunova, 37, of Girlington Road, Bradford.Shinwary received a prison sentence of 10 years and three months.Makunova has already served a 51-week prison sentence after previously pleading guilty to human trafficking and false imprisonment offences.Khan's relative Nusrat Khan, 40, of Colne Road, Burnley was also found guilty of false imprisonment and received a jail sentence of nine months, suspended for two years.</body>

      <body>A head teacher whose appointment to a new free school was criticised has quit her post weeks after starting.Pimlico Primary, which opened in September, said Annaliese Briggs, 27, had left the job to "pursue other opportunities in primary education".Miss Briggs was appointed in April as the head while still studying for her postgraduate certificate in education.Labour councillors in Westminster said governors may be regretting appointing someone with "no teaching experience".The primary school opened at the site of Pimlico Academy in Lupus Street, central London, with 60 pupils and aims to have 420 pupils by 2019.Pimlico Primary is sponsored by Future Academies, a charity founded by Lord Nash and his wife Caroline.A statement from Pimlico Primary said: "Having successfully set up Pimlico Primary, Annaliese Briggs has decided to leave Future Academies to pursue other opportunities in primary education."A new principal of Pimlico Primary has been appointed. Coming from within the group, our new principal is already known to the pupils and families of Pimlico Primary, and brings over 10 years' experience in both early years and leadership."We are delighted that Annaliese will continue to support Pimlico Primary as it grows by becoming a governor."Miss Briggs is completing a school-centred initial teacher training (SCITT) course in Wandsworth and will qualify with a postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE).She previously said she has classroom experience from teaching primary school children in supplementary schools and had been chosen to lead the school for her curriculum expertise.Reacting to the news that Miss Briggs has stepped down, leader of the Labour group at Westminster Council Councillor Paul Dimoldenberg said: "Being the head of an inner-London school is a tough job which can sometimes be very stressful."By appointing someone with no teaching experience or experience in running a school, the Pimlico academy governors might now consider that this is a decision they now regret."I hope that Ms Briggs' commitment to education is undiminished and wish her well in her future career."The Department for Education said it was a matter for the school.</body>

      <body>Details of the Queen's Baton Relay's route around Scotland have been unveiled as it sets off on the international leg of the journey.The baton will visit all 70 nations and territories of the Commonwealth before the Glasgow 2014 games start at Celtic Park on 23 July.Its 40-day tour of Scotland will begin in Edinburgh on 14 June, before ending with four days in Glasgow.The baton left Glasgow Airport on Thursday afternoon, bound for India.Organisers have also launched the campaign to recruit 4,000 baton-bearers.They are seeking nominations before 22 November via the Glasgow 2014 website.About 100 people each day will carry the baton on its journey around the country, an event Lord Smith of Kelvin, Glasgow 2014 chairman, hopes will help in "sharing the excitement of the countdown to the Commonwealth Games with communities across the nation".He said: "It's important as many people as possible feel part of this special moment and from today there's a chance for everyone to nominate the people in their street, village, town or city that they would like to see honoured as baton-bearers."Commonwealth Games Minister Shona Robison said the call for nominees for baton-bearers "gives everyone in Scotland a chance to recognise up to 4,000 individuals who have made an exceptional contribution to their local community, in particular through sport or their work with young people".On Wednesday, The Queen placed her message to the Commonwealth inside the baton during a special ceremony at Buckingham Palace.Cyclist Sir Chris Hoy, a six-time Olympic gold and double Commonwealth gold medallist, escorted the empty baton up The Mall to the palace in London.The Queen placed the hand-written scroll inside the specially-designed baton, which was then sealed for its 288-day journey through the Commonwealth nations and territories.The first baton bearer was Allan Wells, the Scottish sprinter who won gold at the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games as well the Commonwealth Games in 1978 and 1982.Stirling and Glasgow hosted official events on Thursday before the baton was transported to Glasgow Airport on its way to India.From there, it will travel to Commonwealth nations as diverse as Bangladesh, New Zealand, Nigeria and Barbados.However, it will not stopover in The Gambia, which last week withdrew from the Commonwealth, saying it will "never be a member of any neo-colonial institution".The baton will return to Europe on 4 May 2014 when it will visit Cyprus, Malta and Gibraltar before going on to Jersey, Guernsey and Isle of Man, who all send their own teams to the Games.The baton's visit to Northern Ireland begins on 20 May, Wales on 24 May and England, where it spends two weeks, from 31 May.Glasgow 2014 will be the 20th Commonwealth Games and will feature 17 sports in 11 days of competition, with 261 medal events.The Commonwealth of Nations has 54 members, but 70 teams participate in the Commonwealth Games because a number of British overseas territories, Crown dependencies and island states compete under their own flag.The baton's journey around the globe will be documented by adventurer and broadcaster Mark Beaumont for the BBC.</body>

He had been shot.Mr Kearney was 46 and a father of four, and lived at Dunmore Avenue close to the park, which is off the Antrim Road.The Irish News reported that it received a statement from a dissident republican group calling itself "the IRA" that claimed it killed Mr Kearney.In July 2012, a new paramilitary group styling itself "the IRA" is believed to have been formed from an amalgamation of previously disparate dissident republican organisations.BBC NI Home Affairs Correspondent Vincent Kearney said: "CCTV cameras at the home of the father of four suggest he may have felt under threat, and local sources said he may have been involved in low level drug dealing."Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Det Ch Insp Justyn Galloway said that Mr Kearney "was known to the police"."Kevin was known to us for previous offending, but what I want to make clear is regardless of Kevin's lifestyle, regardless of his previous offending, there is no justification whatsoever for someone to shoot him dead as they did."Mr Kearney left his daughter off at school on Tuesday morning, and returned home and took his dogs for a walk in Alexandra Park.He was wearing dark clothing and distinctive bright blue trainers, and police say he was shot at approximately 09.15 BST on Tuesday.He was reported missing on Tuesday evening when he had not returned home.Police have appealed for information on a silver Peugeot 406 car, registration number GNZ 8168, that was found burnt out in Dunore Court in the New Lodge area of north Belfast at about 09:30 on Tuesday morning.They also want to hear from anyone who was in the park between 08:30 and 09:30 on Tuesday.DCI Galloway added: "We are aware of the claim of responsibility and that is forming part of my investigation and it is a line of inquiry."Kevin has been going about his normal routine so there is an element of targetting. He has been shot in a callous and brutal way."It is important that we identify witnesses, recover the firearm that was used, and we can only do that with the cooperation of the people of north Belfast, which I have to say to date has been fantastic."Secretary of State Theresa Villiers condemned the murder and that of a man in Londonderry on Thursday."The murders of two men in Londonderry and north Belfast are abhorrent and brutal crimes, for which there is no excuse," she said."I am sure the police will leave no stone unturned in bringing to justice the people responsible for these disgraceful attacks."DUP North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds said: "The entire community will share in the sense of shock at this appalling news."Our thoughts are with the family of the deceased. I appeal for anyone who can assist the police investigation to pass on whatever information they have."Sinn Féin North Belfast MLA Gerry Kelly said: "The murder of Kevin Kearney is to be condemned outright. The pseudo 'republican' group that carried out the killing have no support whatsoever within the local community."In fact, it is common knowledge that they have within their ranks people who have taken backhanders from drug dealers so that they can continue peddling drugs. This makes them the same as the drug dealers who bring death and destruction to the community."Masquerading under the name republican does not stop people from seeing these groups for what they really are. I would call on anyone who has any information on this killing to bring it forward to the PSNI."The people of north Belfast have suffered enough throughout the years without the blight of these maverick, self-serving, hypocritical groups bringing death to the community."SDLP councillor Pat Convery, who chairs the north Belfast community safety partnership, said: "This is a very tragic event."My thoughts and prayers are with the man's family."The park has been closed to the public while the investigation continues.</body>

      <title>Court hears gun discharge dispute</title>
      <description>Some gun discharge residue on a coat linked to a man jailed for murdering a police officer could have come from a different incident, a court has heard.</description>

      <body>Some gun discharge residue on a coat linked to a man jailed for murdering a police officer could have come from a different incident, a court has heard.Brendan McConville and John Paul Wootton are appealing convictions for murdering Constable Stephen Carroll.Constable Carroll, 48, was shot after responding to a 999 call in Craigavon, County Armagh, in March 2009.The case against McConville and Wootton at the non-jury trial involved DNA and other evidence.On Thursday, prosecutors accepted they could not prove beyond reasonable doubt that either McConville or the murder weapon were transported in co-defendant Wootton's car.Instead they argued that the surrounding circumstances confirmed the two men's guilt.McConville, 42, and Wootton, 22, are both seeking to overturn their convictions for the murder.McConville, of Glenholme Avenue in the town, is serving at least a 25 year sentence for killing the policeman. Wootton, from Lurgan, received a minimum 14-year term.Prosecutors contended that Wootton's car was near the scene of the attack and driven off within minutes of the killing. However, his legal team insist absolutely no evidence exists to link him to any role in the shooting.Gun residue was found on a coat linked to McConville which was later recovered from the vehicle.On day three of the two men's joint appeal judges examined whether it could have come from a separate incident.Some of the residue could have come from another source, the Court of Appeal heard.Questioned on whether it could be proven that the coat was at the firing point on the night of the killing, prosecution counsel Ciaran Murphy QC said he could prove a connection with the relevant particles.Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan then asked: "Are you proving beyond reasonable doubt that the weapon was transported in Mr Wootton's car?"The barrister replied: "No."Sir Declan continued: "Are you proving beyond reasonable doubt that Mr McConville was transported in Mr Wootton's car."Again the response was: "No."Mr Murphy contended that scientific evidence connected the murder weapon - an AK47 rifle which was later recovered - to the jacket.After it was pointed out to him that some of the discharge could have come from a different incident, he stressed the rarity of the particles.During exchanges Sir Declan said: "The Crown accept there's at least a possibility there was some other source which was responsible for some of the gunshot residue."How then do you get from knowing there's another source as well as the gun that was recovered to concluding that other source was not responsible for the entirety of the gunshot residue?"According to Mr Murphy the surrounding circumstances provided the answer.Those established "a sufficient case for the trial judge to reach a conclusion that he was satisfied that at least some of these particles originated from the weapon that night", he argued.Earlier, Mr Murphy defended an account given by a key prosecution witness at the trial.Defence lawyers attacked his credibility, branding him a compulsive liar and a Walter Mitty-type character whose allegations of what he saw on the night of the shooting were "farcical".The man, known only as Witness M, has since left Northern Ireland to live under a protection programme.But Mr Murphy argued that he had reliably recalled seeing McConville near the scene, describing him as someone he knew by nickname and being able to remember exchanging words.Witness M claimed he was later approached by another man and warned to "keep your mouth shut".The defence pointed out how he only phoned police to make his claims 11 months later, making the call after drinking into the early hours of the morning.However, Mr Murphy said: "He was aware in his own mind of the consequences."The fact he was drinking at the time has little bearing other than to explain how he may personally have felt and to get up the courage to do what he did because he was nervous and said he had seen someone watching his house on different occasions."The hearing was adjourned until Friday.</body>

      <title>Mine owners file for administration</title>
      <description>The owners of Wales' largest drift are filing for administration, it is confirmed, but the owners say the 220 jobs are not under threat.</description>

      <date>1381420152</date>
      <body>The owners of Wales' largest mine are filing for administration, it has been confirmed.The future of the Unity Mine, a drift mine near Neath, has been uncertain in recent months after management said they only had work for 66 of 220 staff.Richard Nugent, director with Unity Mine Limited, said the company had been "forced into the process of filing for administration".He added the workforce would be maintained until further notice."Unfortunately the Unity Group of Companies have been forced into the process of filing for administration whilst discussions continue about the future direction of the mine," he said."Fundraising negotiations are continuing with various parties and the current workforce will be maintained until further notice."Neath MP Peter Hain said the situation was "deeply worrying, especially for the workforce and their families".He added that he understood that discussions are taking place "imminently", with management at the mine "hopeful" that funding can be found to save the site."I am disappointed that recent discussions on grant aid did not succeed and I hope that these can be resurrected," he said.Mr Hain added outstanding planning and licensing problems had to be resolved as they were putting off investors."Unity remains a vital and exciting project and everyone must do everything to ensure it can both be saved and can move forward because not only 250 existing jobs are at stake but potentially many more too," he said.In recent months, workers at Unity Mine were told there was not enough work for everyone.Staff offered to share shifts between all of the workers which meant they got on average a quarter of their previous pay.It was seen as a way that could safeguard the pit's future.At the time The National Union of Miners (NUM) said it was not an ideal solution but it would provide a "breathing space".But bosses at the mine were unable to remedy the situation and have filed for administration.Gwenda Thomas, the assembly member for Neath, described the announcement that the mine had gone into administration as "extremely regrettable"."I sincerely hope that the administrators can find new owners for the mine, and preserve the miners' jobs and the future of the apprentices," she said.Welsh government officials are continuing to hold with the mine's management.Meanwhile, Tyrone O'Sullivan, chairman of Tower Colliery in the Cynon Valley, said: "It's difficult for me to comment further because a number of ex-Tower employees are working there and we are a rival company."But it's a tragedy that in a country that burned 61 million tonnes of coal last year that we are allowing mines to close."In September 2012 the BBC reported 94% of all Welsh coal came from opencast sites, the remainder from drift mines.The vast majority work was at two pits in the Neath Valley at Unity and Aberpergwm which is currently closed.Unity Mine opened in 2007 with reserves of up to 90 million tonnes of coal.It is a drift mine, which means that miners can walk into it from the surface rather than having to be transported down to the coal seams via a lift in a shaft.</body>

      <body>Figures show another significant rise in the number of patients who have had to wait more than nine months to start hospital treatment.More than 13,000 had been waiting over 36 weeks in August, a rise of over 2,000 in one month.The Welsh government's own target is for no-one to wait that long.The Welsh Conservatives have written to the first minister calling on him to personally intervene to deal with what they called "an escalating crisis".Darren Millar, the party's shadow minister for health, told Carwyn Jones the situation needed "immediate priority".He said: "I hope you will agree that patients across Wales - particularly the elderly and vulnerable - should not be faced with such long waits."Meanwhile, Kirsty Williams, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said the figures were a "national disgrace"."Why must patients in Wales have to put up with such an inferior service when compared to the rest of the UK?" she said."Years of Welsh Labour incompetence has led to thousands of people having to wait an awful long time until the start of their treatment."No one should have to wait this long, but it's particularly dreadful to think of the large amount of elderly people that are being forced to wait months on end."On Tuesday, it was announced that the Welsh NHS would be given £570m of extra funding over three years during the Welsh government's draft budget.Finance Minister Jane Hutt said the extra money would help the NHS in Wales to avoid a scandal such as the one in Stafford Hospital, where hundreds of patients died as a result of neglect and abuse.The Welsh government is expected to comment on the figures later.</body>

      <title>Kenyan fury as police 'ignore rape'</title>
      <description>Kenyans are outraged that three men accused of gang-raping and dumping a girl in a pit latrine were ordered by police to cut grass as punishment.</description>

      <body>Kenyans are outraged that three men accused of gang-raping and dumping a girl in a pit latrine were ordered by police to cut grass as punishment.The 16-year old was attacked after returning from a grandfather's funeral in a village in western Kenya, Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper reports.Her back was broken during the attacks and she now uses a wheelchair.Rights activists and MPs denounced the police for failing to investigate the girl's complaints."Everyone is incensed, to say the least," Saida Ali, executive director of Kenya's Coalition on Violence against Women, told the BBC's Newsday programme.The police were investigating the conduct of officers who dealt with the girl's complaint, Halima Mohamed, the police commander of Busia County, where the attack took place, the Daily Nation reports.The BBC's David Okwembah in the capital, Nairobi, says the apparent failure by police to act on this incident is an example of the incompetence which many Kenyans feel afflicts the force, especially after the recent attack on the Westgate shopping centre.The girl apparently knew some of the alleged attackers, and police recorded a case of assault against three of them.Villagers took the three accused to the local police station after hearing of the attack."The three... were only ordered to cut grass around the police camp and set free shortly after," the girl's mother is quoted as saying.The girl's plight was discussed by the Kenyan parliament's national security committee on Wednesday."It is shocking and unbelievable. We want to get to the bottom of it," said committee chairman Asman Kimama."I want my attackers arrested and punished," the girl told the newspaper."My wish is to see justice done," she said.Ms Mohamed told the BBC police had ordered the girl's mother to "clean her up" after the alleged rape, destroying vital forensic evidence that could be used against the suspects."This is one of many cases of blatant impunity on the part of police," she added.The Nation Media Group has offered to pay the girl's medical expenses and has launched a campaign to bring the alleged attackers to justice."Not only did she suffer a brutal crime that changed her life forever; she was also denied justice," said Ann Gitao-Kinyua, the Nation Media Group's marketing director.Readers of the newspaper and BBC listeners reacted furiously to the attack, describing it as despicable and calling for prosecutions against the alleged rapists and the police for failing to arrest and charge them.</body>

      <body>Norway's intelligence agency says it is investigating whether a Norwegian citizen was involved in the attack on Nairobi's Westgate shopping centre.The PST said it had sent investigators to Kenya to try to verify the claim.It said it was opening an inquiry "based on information that a Norwegian citizen may have been involved".A Norwegian of Somali origin may have been involved in planning and carrying out the 21 September attack in which at least 67 people died, the PST said."The enquiry will primarily be aimed at helping prevent new terrorist acts and [determining] to what degree the Norwegian... was involved in the attack," the agency said.It added that it would also try to establish if the unnamed suspect had ties to Somalia's al-Shabab, the al-Qaeda-linked militant group which said it had carried out the attack.The PST said it was working to assess any potential threats to Norway and Norwegian interests.Reports have suggested that an al-Shabab leader targeted at the weekend in a US military operation may have spent time in Norway.The 5 October raid failed to capture Abdukadir Mohamed Abdukadir, alias Ikrima. He is thought to be a Kenyan citizen of Somali origin, one of many Kenyan Somalis and other foreign fighters who have joined the group.Norway's TV2 reported earlier this week that Ikrima had travelled to Norway and applied for asylum in 2004 but left in 2008 before there was a decision on his application.Norwegian officials have not commented on the claims.Last week Kenya's military identified four men it said were involved in the Westgate siege. It said Abu Baara al-Sudani, Omar Nabhan, Khattab al-Kene and Umayr were killed during the standoff.Sudani was said to have been an "experienced fighter" from Sudan, who led the group. Nabhan was a Kenyan of Arab origin and Kene a Somali linked to al-Shabab. Details about Umayr were not available.</body>

      <body>Pakistani schoolgirl and campaigner Malala Yousafzai, who was shot in the head by the Taliban, has won the EU's Sakharov human rights prize.The 16-year-old activist was shot a year ago for campaigning for better rights for girls.The Sakharov Prize for free speech is awarded by the European Parliament annually in memory of Soviet physicist and dissident Andrei Sakharov.US whistleblower Edward Snowden had been a contender for the prize.The 50,000 euro ($65,000) prize is considered Europe's top human rights award.Malala rose to prominence in 2009 after writing a blog anonymously for the BBC Urdu service about her life under Taliban rule and the lack of education for girls.She lived in Pakistan's mountainous Swat Valley and her name became internationally known after the Pakistan army pushed the Taliban out of the area in 2009.The Taliban's Islamist doctrine puts harsh restrictions on women's rights and one of the militants shot her as she was riding in a bus with school friends."Today, we decided to let the world know that our hope for a better future stands in young people like Malala Yousafzai," said the head of the conservative European People's Party (EPP), Joseph Daul.Malala received a standing ovation in July this year for an address to the United Nations General Assembly, in which she vowed she would never be silenced.MEPs in Strasbourg said Malala was "incredibly brave" to continue promoting the rights of children. Her new home is in Birmingham, in the UK.She joins a distinguished list of winners of the Sakharov Prize which includes South Africa's Nelson Mandela and Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma, also known as Myanmar. The award will be officially presented at a ceremony in Strasbourg in November.Three jailed Belarusian dissidents were also on the shortlist for the prize this year, along with Edward Snowden, who leaked thousands of documents detailing US National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance activities worldwide.</body>

      <body>Australian police say they have seized guns, ammunition and drugs in a series of raids on the Hells Angels motorcycle gang in the state of Victoria.Around 60 properties were raided on Thursday, in an operation involving more than 700 police.The move came days after new anti-fortification laws came into effect, making it easier for police to storm biker gang-linked properties.There have been several cases of biker gang-related violence in recent months."We've located a number of firearms, a large quantity of ammunition, we've located drugs, [and] a large quantity of cash," Acting Deputy Commissioner Steve Fontana told reporters on Thursday.Police found so much ammunition at one address that they needed to "get a trailer in to cart it away", he said.However, he added that police were still searching for "high-powered military-style weapons" believed to be in the gang's possession.On Sunday, Victoria state introduced laws allowing police to remove barriers, cameras and booby traps at biker club facilities during raids. However, police said that Thursday morning's operation was not linked to the new laws.Last week, eight members of the rival Hells Angels and Comanchero gangs were charged in Melbourne over a spate of shootings.Last year police warned that feuds between motorcycle gangs - including a series of shootings in Sydney - were a step away from becoming an all-out war.</body>

      <date>1381401587</date>
      <body>The main opposition candidate in Azerbaijan has called for the results of Wednesday's presidential election to be cancelled over alleged vote-rigging.Ilham Aliyev officially won re-election for a third term, with official results giving him more than 80% of the vote.Jamil Hasanli said the election was not free and fair because of electoral fraud and government control of all television channels.European observers found the election had been "seriously flawed".The election was "undermined by limitations on the freedoms of expression, assembly and association that did not guarantee a level playing field for candidates", the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said in a press release.OSCE observers reported "clear indications of ballot box stuffing" in 37 polling stations and took a negative view of counting at 58% of the polling stations they inspected.According to the latest results available, Mr Aliyev won 85% of the vote to 5% for Mr Hasanli.The Aliyev family has ruled the energy-rich ex-Soviet state for two decades.Human rights groups say the government cracked down on its critics in an unprecedented campaign of repression in the run-up to the vote.Mr Aliyev, who enjoys immense power after inheriting the presidency from his father in 2003, abolished a two-term presidential limit in a controversial referendum in 2009.But political opposition in the country of nine million has also been blunted by prosperity, with oil wealth more than tripling gross domestic product.The president has courted Western states attracted by its strategic location and status as a producer and transporter of oil and gas.Oil multinationals BP, ExxonMobil and other Western companies have invested billions of dollars to tap into Azerbaijan's oil riches.An oil pipeline supported by the US and the European Union to pump Azerbaijani crude oil via Georgia to Turkey - bypassing Russia - went into operation in 2005.The pipeline is seen as an important part of the West's aim of reducing Europe's dependence on Russian energy resources.</body>

      <body>Russia has replaced the head of its space programme, Vladimir Popovkin.The move follows a series of setbacks including an unmanned rocket that crashed and exploded seconds after lift-off.Oleg Ostapenko, who was previously a deputy defence minister, was appointed the new space chief by prime minister Dmitry Medvedev.Prior to his ministerial role, Ostapenko served as commander of the military's space forces.Speaking to Mr Ostapenko, Mr Medvedev said: "You've been engaged in the space industry all your life including at the military posts."Now you are set to be involved with space in a slightly different dimension. No doubt that this topic is complex and requires greater attention from the state."The outgoing Vladimir Popovkin had been in the role for two-and-a-half years. He was appointed in April 2011 during a time of difficulty with the country's space programme. Russia had lost three satellites when a rocket crashed into the Pacific Ocean.Mr Popovkin had pledged to improve manufacturing standards and quality checks, but he struggled to deliver.His time as head was marked by embarrassments including the explosion of an unmanned Russian Proton-M rocket, crashed after its launch from the Russian Baikonur facility in Kazakhstan.The accident was captured live by Russian television in July and the crash spread hundreds of tonnes of toxic rocket fuel.Other countries still depend on Russia to launch manned rockets to the International Space Station.</body>

      <body>Thirteen inmates have been killed and at least 30 injured in a fight between rival gangs in a prison in Brazil.Riot police say they have regained control of Pedrinhas prison in Sao Luis, in the state of Maranhao, and are searching the jail for illegal weapons.Prison guards said fighting had broken out after they discovered inmates digging an escape tunnel.Brazilian prisons suffer from extreme overcrowding and riots and gang warfare are not unusual.The riot started after guards received a tip-off that 60 inmates were digging a tunnel through which they were planning to escape at dawn, Maranhao state security secretary Aluisio Mendes said."When the guards tried to access the cell in which the entrance to the tunnel was located, the prisoners tried to fight them off," he added.Prisoners started a fire and members of rival gangs took advantage of the confusion to settle scores, officials said.Relatives of inmates gathered outside the prison complex demanding information and threw stones at the guards.Several buses were also set alight by the relatives, local media reported.Pedrinhas is notorious for its gang warfare. Earlier this month, three inmates were killed, one of them decapitated.Another was electrocuted when he got entangled in cables used to light an escape tunnel last month.Brazil's Minister of Justice, Jose Eduardo Cardozo, said last year that Brazil had "a medieval prison system, which not only violates human rights [but] does not allow for the most important element of a penal sanction, which is social reintegration".Officials say that despite building new prisons they have not been able to keep pace with the increasing number of detainees, making it hard for them to improve conditions within the jails.</body>

      <title>UN sued over Haiti cholera epidemic</title>
      <description>The UN faces a claim for compensation by victims of a cholera epidemic in Haiti, which victims' lawyers say was caused by peacekeepers.</description>

      <date>1381331536</date>
      <body>Lawyers representing victims of a cholera epidemic in Haiti have filed a lawsuit against the United Nations at a court in New York.They say UN peacekeepers introduced cholera to Haiti in 2010. The disease killed more than 8,000 people and made hundreds of thousands sick.The lawyers are demanding compensation of $100,000 (£62,000) for every person who died and $50,000 for each of those who became ill.The UN says it has legal immunity.Lawyers filed the suit at the US District Court in New York. They said they were left with no other option after the UN had rejected previous claims for compensation."The UN refused to even consider them. We then felt we had no choice but to file in a national court," Brian Concannon, director of the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, which is bringing the case, told the BBC.BBC international development correspondent Mark Doyle says investigations have pointed strongly to leaking sewage at a camp for UN soldiers from Nepal, where cholera is endemic, as the origin of the outbreak in Haiti.No cases of the bacterial infection, which causes diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and muscle cramps, had been recorded in Haiti for a century until the outbreak in late 2010.Then cases mounted quickly in an area near the camp.Leading cholera expert Danielle Lantagne, who once worked for the UN, said in the past that the outbreak's "most likely source" was the UN camp.In February, a spokesman for UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the petition for compensation was "not receivable" under a 1947 convention which grants the UN immunity for its actions.Our correspondent says the UN's position is unlikely to change.</body>

      <body>Egypt has criticised a decision by the US to suspend a large part of the $1.3bn (£810m) in aid it receives, following months of political turmoil.A government spokesman in Cairo said the move was wrong and Egypt would "not surrender to American pressure".The US said this week it was suspending the delivery of large-scale military systems and withholding cash support.But US Secretary of State John Kerry later stressed the decision was not "a withdrawal from our relationship"."The interim government understands very well our commitment to the success of this government," Mr Kerry said.He was speaking shortly after Egyptian foreign ministry spokesman Badr Abdelatty criticised Washington's move, saying Egypt was "continuing on its path towards democracy".Since the Egyptian army ousted Mohammed Morsi as president in July, the authorities have clashed repeatedly with his Muslim Brotherhood supporters.The US state department launched a review of its aid to Egypt in August after a crackdown that left hundreds of people dead.On Wednesday, it said it would halt the delivery of Apache helicopters, as well as Harpoon missiles and tank parts.Washington would also halt a $260m cash transfer and a $300m loan guarantee, officials said.The freeze was not intended to be permanent, the state department added."We will continue to hold the delivery of certain large-scale military systems and cash assistance to the government pending credible progress toward an inclusive, democratically elected civilian government through free and fair elections," state department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.The BBC's Kim Ghattas in Washington says the suspension of aid is more symbolic than a painful cut in essential aid.The announcement had been expected, with deliveries of military hardware already halted, a military exercise cancelled, and cash aid in effect on hold since the summer, our correspondent says.The US will continue to provide health and education assistance, and money to help Egypt to ensure security in the increasingly volatile Sinai peninsula.</body>

      <body>At least four members of Egypt's security forces have been killed in a suicide car bombing in northern Sinai, state media and officials say.The vehicle blew up at a checkpoint just south of the the town of el-Arish when personnel were about to search it, the Associated Press reports.Soldiers and at least one policeman are among the dead. Five have been wounded.Egypt's security forces have been engaged in a major offensive against Islamist militants in Sinai for weeks.Attacks on security forces have increased since Islamist President Mohammed Morsi was ousted by the military in early July, prompting a large-scale operation by the military.Earlier this week, four people were killed and 45 injured in a car bomb attack on a security building in al-Tour, in southern Sinai.Last month, at least six soldiers were killed in a double suicide bomb attack in Rafah, on the border with the Gaza Strip.The Egyptian military has recently cracked down on tunnels used by militants and smugglers under the border.Local media reports suggest the Egyptian army is considering military action in the Gaza Strip if attacks on its troops in the Sinai Peninsula are not stopped.The Sinai region has grown increasingly volatile since the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak in early 2011.During his period in office, President Morsi took measures to curb the lawlessness, but he was accused by the army of being too lenient.</body>

      <body>The father of fugitive former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden has arrived in Russia to visit his son.Lon Snowden told journalists on his arrival in Moscow that he felt "extreme gratitude that my son is safe and secure and he's free".Edward Snowden was granted asylum in Russia in August after weeks spent in a transit zone at Moscow airport when the US revoked his travel documents.The 30-year-old leaked many thousands of US intelligence documents.The information, published in The Guardian and Washington Post newspapers, revealed extensive internet and phone surveillance by both US and British intelligence.In the US, Edward Snowden faces charges of theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified intelligence.Each of the charges carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence.Lon Snowden, arriving at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, was met by his son's Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena."I'm here to learn more about my son's situation," Mr Snowden told reporters. "My hope is to learn more about his circumstances and his health and to discuss legal options.""If the opportunity presents itself, I certainly hope that I have the opportunity to see my son," he said in televised remarks."I'm not sure that my son will be returning to the US. That's his decision, he's an adult."Lon Snowden has in the past praised his son for speaking "the truth" and making great sacrifices, and has spoken of his concern that he would not face a fair trial if he returned to the US.Edward Snowden accessed many of the documents while working for the defence contractor Booz Allen Hamilton in Hawaii, where he had been living with his girlfriend.As the revelations became public, Mr Snowden fled to Hong Kong where, with his consent, The Guardian revealed his identity in June.To escape US attempts to extradite him, Mr Snowden moved on to Russia where he remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport until Russia granted him asylum.Russia's move added to already tense relations with the US. Washington cancelled a bilateral summit in September.</body>

      <title>Yellen nominated as new US Fed boss</title>
      <description>US President Barack Obama nominates Federal Reserve vice-chair Janet Yellen to be the next head of the US central bank.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24469081</url>
      <date>1381350437</date>
      <body>US President Barack Obama has officially nominated Federal Reserve vice-chair Janet Yellen to be the next head of the US central bank.He called her one of the nation's foremost economists and policy makers.Ms Yellen said if confirmed by the Senate she would do her utmost "to promote maximum employment, stable prices and a stable financial system".She said more needed to be done to strengthen the US economy although progress had been made recently.The president praised Ms Yellen's ability to build consensus and listen to competing views.He added that she was "committed to increasing employment and understands the human costs when Americans can't find a job".If the nomination is confirmed by the US Senate, Ms Yellen, 67, would replace Ben Bernanke, who has held the post for eight years.She has been his deputy for the past two years, and would become the first woman to head the Federal Reserve.She has taught at Harvard University and the London School of Economics, as well as holding a series of senior administrative positions in the US.Ms Yellen, like Mr Bernanke, is seen as a "dove", meaning she prefers to prioritise boosting employment by keeping rates low rather than worrying about inflation.Her nomination had been widely expected since former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers withdrew his candidature last month amid opposition from liberal Democrats.As Democrats control the 100-seat Senate, Ms Yellen's appointment would only need six Republican votes to overcome potential any procedural hurdles.Some conservatives are scrutinising her views on monetary policy and her support for previous federal stimulus efforts.On Wednesday, the second-most powerful Republican in the Senate questioned whether she was the right choice."Ms Yellen subscribes to the liberal school of thought that the best way to handle our nation's fiscal challenges is to throw more money at them," John Cornyn of Texas, the party's whip in the Senate, said in a statement."This stimulus obsession is the reason the nation finds itself in the fiscal calamity it does today, and the last thing we need is a leader at the helm of the Federal Reserve who is intent on more quantitative easing that harms our economy."Senator Bob Corker, a leading Republican on the banking committee, said in a statement: "I voted against Vice-Chairman Yellen's original nomination to the Fed in 2010 because of her dovish views on monetary policy.""We will closely examine her record since that time, but I am not aware of anything that demonstrates her views have changed."But Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said Ms Yellen would win Senate confirmation "by a wide margin".The chairman of the US Senate banking committee, Tim Johnson, said she had "a depth of experience that is second to none"."I have no doubt she will be an excellent Federal Reserve chairman," he added.The BBC's chief business correspondent, Linda Yueh, says the transition from Mr Bernanke to Ms Yellen is likely to be "seamless" and will not have much impact, because the two already work so closely together."I don't think there's going to be a radical change," she said on Radio 4's Today programme, adding that the changeover was unlikely to alter the timing of the Fed's withdrawal of economic stimulus.Ms Yellen's most recent academic post was at the University of California, Berkeley. A former colleague there, Laura Tyson, professor of business and economics, told the BBC Ms Yellen's nomination was "terrific news"."We have an outstanding candidate who is a wonderful match of skills and experience and temperament and reputation around the world at a time when monetary policy is extremely important," she said."Continuity is important and Janet is an outstanding candidate."A former member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve, Prof Randy Kroszner, told the BBC that Ms Yellen was "battle tested" and would be driven by the data in deciding when to reduce support to the markets.</body>

      <title>Do you really need to drink eight cups of water a day?</title>
      <description>Do you really need to drink eight cups of water a day?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24464774</url>
      <date>1381393552</date>
      <body>Drinking eight cups or two litres of water a day is longstanding advice. But is there any scientific basis for it, asks Dr Chris van Tulleken.You know those ads that remind us that even a small drop in hydration levels can massively affect performance so you need to keep hydrated with whatever brand of isotonic super drink they're selling?They seem pretty scientific don't they? Man in white coat, athlete with electrodes attached and so on. And it's not a hard sell because drinking feels right - you're hot and sweating so surely replacing that fluid must be beneficial.Well earlier this year sports scientists in Australia did an extraordinary experiment that had never been done before (British Journal of Sports Medicine, September 2013, Current hydration guidelines are erroneous: dehydration does not impair exercise performance in the heat, Wall BA).This group wanted to find out what happened to performance after dehydration. So they took a group of cyclists and exercised them until they lost 3% of their total body weight in sweat.Then their performance was assessed after rehydration with either 1) nothing, 2) enough water to bring them back to 2% dehydration or 3) after full rehydration.So far nothing unusual, but the difference between this and almost every other study that's ever been done on hydration was that the cyclists were blind to how much water they got. The fluid was given intravenously without them knowing the volume.This is vital because we all, and especially athletes, have such an intimate psychological relationship with water consumption.Remarkably, there was no performance difference between those that were fully rehydrated and those that got nothing. This study was part of a growing movement to "drink to thirst" which hopes to persuade athletes not to over hydrate with the potentially fatal consequence of diluting your sodium level, causing hyponatraemia.Perhaps the result shouldn't be so surprising. Humans evolved doing intense exercise in extreme heat and dryness. We are able to tolerate losses in water relatively well whereas even slight over hydration can be far more dangerous. In simple terms, being too watery is as bad for you as being too concentrated.But what about the rest of us who aren't cycling around the desert in Western Australia?There is a very well accepted idea that we should drink about eight cups of water per day (two to three litres) in addition to our food and other drinks.We are awash with positive messages about the healing properties of water and how it will improve everything from our brains to our bowels. And we know that without it we will die in days.It's a short leap of logic to think that if a lack of water is bad for for you then hydration must be good - purifying, cleansing water washing through your organs must be beneficial, detoxifying. It surely improves your skin, helps you think, reduces your risk of kidney stones and turns your urine a lovely light, straw/champagne colour rather than the fetid orange syrup you produce at the end of a long day where you haven't had time to drink.So I've looked through the literature and I found a review article saying all of this and more. It was written by a group of respected physicians from American and French hospitals and it clearly supported the widely held belief that you should drink two to three litres of water a day.It said that people with a high urine output have a lower rate of kidney stone disease, that the flushing action of the water may reduce the risk of a urinary tract infection (especially in women after sex). Perhaps most importantly, they referenced a surprising study which showed that paradoxically an increased intake of water increased the risk of bladder cancer. But only tap water. And there's the clue.A footnote at the end of the article explained that what you thought was a scientific article in a scientific journal is in fact a supplement, sponsored by a major mineral water manufacturer. All of the authors received honoraria from this company, which also provided medical writing assistance. So this isn't research, it's marketing.And this is one of the reasons we're even discussing this - because increasingly drinking water doesn't just come out of our taps for free. It's sold to us by the same clever people that sell us yoghurts with bacteria in them that probably don't do us much good, something I look at separately in the television series I've been making. And these companies pretty consistently recommend two to three litres of water per day.So where did that number come from and is there any reason to think it correct?Well the grain of truth is this - people in temperate climates who are not doing sustained physical exercise do need around six to eight cups per day but that can be contained in food, alcohol or caffeinated beverages.Yes, beer and coffee do not dehydrate you to any noticeable extent (there's a nice paper where some medical students got to drink quite a lot of beer and had their urine studied - British Medical Journal (Clin Res Ed), December 1982, Acute biochemical responses to moderate beer drinking, Gill GV).There is no evidence that adding the eight cups of water to everything else you drink will do you any good and it could do you harm (American Journal of Physiological - Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology, November 2002, Drink at least eight glasses of water a day. Really? Is there scientific evidence for "8x8"? Valtin H).But the great thing is that just like a top-level athlete you don't need to worry about exactly what that total daily requirement is because your body will sort it all out for you.If you drink too much you pee it out. If you drink too little you get thirsty and pee less. It's all exquisitely well-controlled in the same way that your intake of oxygen is well-controlled.Saying that you should drink more water than your body asks for is like saying that you should consciously breathe more often than you feel like because if a little oxygen is good for you then more must be better.Like most things in life there's a Goldilocks amount - not too little and not too much. With this in mind, next week I'll deal with the health benefits of porridge and how to avoid being eaten by bears.Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on FacebookTrust Me I'm a Doctor is broadcast on 10 October on BBC Two at 20:00 BST, or catch up with iPlayer</body>

      <title>Sunday v Dimanche</title>
      <description>Will a French Sunday soon be like a British one?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24458571</url>
      <date>1381401662</date>
      <body>Almost twenty years ago, a bitter war was fought over the future of Britain's Sundays - and today France is mired in a similar battle. But how has shopping on a Sunday re-shaped British society and do the French really have anything to fear?In November 1993, protesters from across much of the UK (although not Scotland) were confident they could keep big shops closed on Sundays.Outside Parliament they raised placards reading "Don't give in to supermarket greed" and "No government can change the laws of God".Things always appeared very different across the Channel. The French had always seemed to grasp the notion of work-life balance - in British imagination at least, reserving their weekends for red wine and serene lunches.Not everybody in the UK shared that desire for a day of rest, however. "About 50 years ago Sundays were completely dead," says Joe Moran, a cultural historian.Once, pubs had to close between 3-7pm on a Sunday, and theatres and cinemas were closed altogether. Those rules were steadily relaxed in the years that intervened, but by the early 90s most shops were still banned from trading on Sundays.Michael Schluter, founder of the Keep Sunday Special campaign, wanted to keep it that way, and lobbied MPs to support his movement. In December 1993, a vote in the House of Commons saw Schluter's vision defeated by just 18 votes. The following year all restrictions were removed from small shops, and those "over 280 square meters" in size were allowed to trade for six hours each Sunday.Today you only need to stand in a DIY superstore in a desolate retail park on a Sunday morning to see how things have changed. Customers gather in the store in the half-hour "browsing time" before the tills open, glancing over expectantly, ready to pounce. Their day is built around a visit to a big shop."It's fairly obvious that Sunday is a huge trading day in this country in spite of the fact that it's limited to six hours," says Richard Perks of market research firm Mintel.The British Retail Consortium says it is second only to Saturday for footfall and total sales - and is the biggest day in terms of hourly sales, as customers try to squeeze their shopping into the six hour window.While the UK has opened its shops on Sunday since 1994, the French have managed to keep most of theirs closed.It's easy to conjure up a vision of a stereotypical French Sunday and imagine families hiking through the Fontainebleau forest, cycling to the Bois de Boulogne park, or rounding off their poulet roti with a freshly baked tarte aux fraises.But now 20 years after the British battle was settled, a similar quarrel is bubbling in France, where different groups of workers take to the streets of Paris to argue both sides of the case. Its tangled web of regulations has been dubbed a "millefeuille" by the press - after the intricate, multi-layered, French pastry of the same name.Shops in designated tourist zones can open, as can garden centres and small owner-operated shops. Those selling food are permitted half a day's trading. For the most part, though, major retailers are forced to close all day, which has angered many business leaders, and some of their workers too.Castorama and Leroy Merlin - two major French DIY chains - have chosen to defy the ban, opening their doors to shoppers on the day of rest, and their employees have backed them. They have held "Yes Weekend" demonstrations to argue for their right to work.In the UK, there seems to be a particular link between Sunday leisure and home improvement.On a typical British Sunday, streams of family cars wait patiently for a space beneath IKEA's blue and yellow facade, trundling out hours later with open boots tied down by rope.It isn't just shopping that has turned Sundays upside down. The proliferation of televised sport has also contributed to a steady erosion of the distinction between the first and second days of the weekend. Schluter is convinced that the UK has lost something along the way, however.Besides small shops that have suffered from increased competition, family ties have been damaged too, he says. "There's a psychological shift which is hard to pin down or measure… towards an attitude that is less about the value of people and relationships and more about material goods."But the example of the British reforms is an inspiration to some French campaigners. Jerome Dubus of MEDEF, a consortium of French business leaders, says that reforms are overdue. "We are one of the last countries that haven't allowed Sunday work, we are behind as usual. I was a student in England 30 years ago. On Sundays everything was closed, there was nothing going on, we didn't know what to do, and the English were attached to it. But now it has changed a lot."Of course, the unions disagree. Christophe Le Comte, of Force Ouvriere, says that the move is just another example of employers trying to exploit their staff. "They are increasing the length of the working day, they are pushing back the age of retirement," he says. Le Comte bemoans the lack of employment protection in the UK and says Sunday trading had "disastrous consequences" for small businesses in the UK.Some change looks likely. The French government has now commissioned a review into the regulations, but whether it will endorse wholesale reform or add more layers to the pastry is difficult to know.Anne-Elisabeth Moutet, a French columnist for the British Daily Telegraph, thinks the unions are projecting a romantic notion of life in the country that is essentially a fiction."They describe a kind of idealised France of the 1950s in which everybody has got 2.3 children, and a dog, and a little house, and the children organise Sunday lunch for all members of the family."But half the households in large cities are single person households… so what they're describing is something that doesn't exist anymore."Trish Deseine, a food writer in Paris, has a very different outlook, and the city she describes will still sound appealing to the UK's Keep Sunday Special campaigners, who are still campaigning."If you walk by Montparnasse, you will see big family reunions in the restaurants," she says. "There is a definite distinction between Sunday and the rest of the week. There is a sense of occasion. It is quieter and more family oriented. I really hope it stays this way."She does not think the restrictions can last forever, but seems determined that change should at least be delayed."Eventually France will have to come around. The French are dragging their heels into a modern way of life, but I think it is a good thing that we are standing against it."Should France follow the UK and allow shops to open on Sundays? How has shopping on a Sunday re-shaped British society? Do the French really have anything to fear?Comment using the form below, on Facebook or on Twitter.</body>

      <description>How significant are reports of a turning point in Alzheimer's?</description>

      <date>1381417427</date>
      <body>If you regularly walk past a newspaper stand, then "Alzheimer's cure" or "Major Alzheimer's breakthrough" headlines will be a familiar sight. And here we are again.UK researchers have, for the first time, used a chemical to prevent the death of brain tissue in a neurodegenerative disease.The Times went with Cure for Alzheimer's "within reach" on its front page, the Independent had Scientists hail historic breakthrough in war against Alzheimer's, and my BBC News website article used the headline Alzheimer's find is "turning point".One major difference this time is that sensible, cautious scientists are suggesting the latest discovery could be one for the history books.Nearly every report contains this quote from Prof Roger Morris, at King's College London: "This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer's disease."So what is it about the latest study that generates a rare level of excitement? And is a cure really on the cards?The prime source of excitement is that a chemical has stopped the death of brain cells, in a living brain, that would have otherwise died due to a neurodegenerative disease.This is a first and a significant one. When I interviewed Prof Morris on Wednesday night, he used the word "landmark" repeatedly.In the Medical Research Council study, the mice had prion disease, similar to the human form of mad cow disease. Within eight weeks, their brains deteriorated so badly that memory and movement were noticeably affected. By the 12th week, the mice were dead.But when the same infected animals were given a "drug-like compound", they survived the 12 weeks with no sign of the brain dying. The chemical also caused side-effects including weight loss and diabetes.The second tier of excitement comes from the potential implications.The chemical helps the brain cope with producing broken proteins. In Parkinson's the alpha-synuclein protein goes wrong, in Alzheimer's it's amyloid and tau, in Huntington's it's the Huntingtin protein.The brain's response to all of these diseases is to shut down protein production, but this eventually kills brain cells. The chemical helps brain cells ignore the broken proteins, keep functioning and stay alive.In the past, research on neurodegenerative diseases has focused on what is unique to that condition. This approach looks at what is common to all of them and if it really does work, then it raises the prospect of a single drug to cure or prevent nearly all forms of neurodegeneration. Another reason for excitement.Lead researcher Prof Giovanna Mallucci said: "If it stops brain degeneration in its tracks, it will halt disease in people who have already got it. And if we can detect early disease, it will prevent a lot of degeneration."The hope is to arrest the process of brain cell death, and that's what's so exciting."It's worth emphasising the precise findings of the study - a toxic chemical, which the researchers will not even call a drug, halts the death of brain cells in mice with prion disease.Clearly this is not a cure, but it points the way to one. It gives drugs companies and scientists something to work with.That process will take time, probably more than a decade, with no guarantee of success at the end.And the recent history of medical research is littered with examples of drugs that looked promising in mice, but were a bitter disappointment when tested in people.This chemical works in a mouse brain of 75 million neurons. A more complex human brain built from 85 billion neurons is a far different challenge.Dr Simon Ridley, the head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, told the BBC patients would be facing a long wait."I'm afraid it's far longer than any of us would like," he said."I think there are many people who'd be desperate for any news of new treatments, which they would like to take today."I think at this stage we could be looking at a decade before we'll know whether this will be effective."This study is certainly exciting scientifically. But it might take until 2023 to see whether it truly deserves its place in the history books.</body>

      <description>How education helped one ex-inmate turn his life around</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24460089</url>
      <date>1381408161</date>
      <body>As Ofsted inspectors deliver a critical verdict of the education prisoners receive in England's jails, one ex-inmate describes how he finally learnt a vital lesson.Expelled from school at 12, Frank Harris says it was the thought of how he would be remembered by his own children that helped him see education as a way to change his life.The 53-year-old Londoner says he was in and out of prisons for more than 30 years before he found his "way out" through education and wants other people involved in crime to see it is not too late for them either."I wasn't getting any younger. I was thinking, 'What will my four kids do if I dropped down [dead]?'"If they said I was in and out of prison - that I wasted my time on earth. Now they can say I made mistakes, but I tried to do something different. That pushes me on."I'm still enjoying my education and still have something to give back."Frank is in the second year of a degree in criminology and criminal justice. He counsels and mentors others who have been involved in crime and has worked with the police on tackling gang culture.But in 2004 he was facing his longest prison stretch ever - four years for smuggling cocaine from Amsterdam - after what he says was a "lifetime of crime"."I knew I'd be coming out, that I needed to do something, to make a change instead of hanging around with people," he said."I found I enjoyed learning. I had been interested before in lots of things but never had the kind of environment for it to be cool to learn."In prison, he did basic skills lessons before getting A-grades in GCSE English and maths."People saying well done, that inspired me to say I enjoyed doing this education and it was positive. I saw I could change my life, learning and achieving things. I saw education as a way out and that it could be the key to set me free."After leaving jail, Frank says he was very tempted to go back to his old way of life but instead decided to stay in touch with a charity that had supported him inside - the Prisoners' Education Trust - and the St Giles Trust."Normally, I was getting picked up by one of my friends [when I got out of jail], and before I got back to London, I would be stoned and wouldn't get home for two days."The crucial thing this time was there was link. This group had offices you can get in touch with when you get out."Frank says he was on the verge of getting involved with crime again when, he says: "Something told me, 'Don't take the left path, take a right,' and instead, I went down to the offices."He went on take a qualification in counselling to help homeless and vulnerable people and to work for the charity Turning Point.He now counsels others, he says, "to try to stop them taking my path".Like many people in Britain's jails, Frank did badly at school. He had no academic qualifications before studying in prison in his 40s.Expelled at 12, he says he was "delinquent" for 18 months, before being sent to a reform "boarding school", where he says there was no proper teaching."The classroom was a work room and the teachers - who were really PE teachers - used to say, 'Finish that English off, then you can finish making your chair.'"Boys would be banging about while others were doing written work."Frank says things then went further downhill."I'd come home every two weeks - my family would not know me, I had no friends. I'd go around by myself and began breaking in to cars, doing rubbish stuff because I was lonely, bored."Shortly after that, Frank says, he began to get custodial sentences for theft and fraud and "that was it for 30 years".He says he was never involved with violent or sexual crimes, but witnessed violence."People were getting shot in a car next to me; people getting stabbed, but I never picked up a knife in anger. I was smoking crack but I always felt I was on the outside looking in; like I was not meant to be there."Now I know that reason was to say to young men and women, 'You don't have to go that way - it's such a waste.' I'm here to tell that story."If you find yourself on the that road, if you are in prison, there's a way out and it's education."Now I'm a proper father, a proper son, a proper grandfather. I'm stable and I have a family that's stable."</body>

      <title>Last major Helmand handover like no other</title>
      <description>David Loyn on the last phase of the UK's Afghan mission</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24467398</url>
      <date>1381380977</date>
      <body>The last sizeable British force to be sent to Helmand province in southern Afghanistan begin their mission later as 7th Armoured Brigade -­ the "Desert Rats" -­ take over from 1st Mechanized Brigade. The Afghan operation is codenamed Herrick, but Herrick 19 is unlike any that have gone before.British troops were once in more than 130 bases here, but are now down to five, and that will reduce still further.They rarely patrol. The formation of the brigade has changed too. The Desert Rats have enough armour and infantry to protect themselves and take the war to the Taliban if need be, but a large part of the force is made up of engineers and logisticians engaged in packing what they can bring back and disposing of what they cannot.Some of the troops now arriving in Helmand will stay for nine months, but most will leave earlier as the force rapidly scales back from the 5,200 it will be at the end of this year.The outgoing Brigadier, Rupert Jones, told me that as British troops stepped back security would be sustained.I asked him for his reaction to President Karzai's comments in a BBC interview that Nato had caused only suffering for Afghanistan."You'll forgive me if I don't comment on what the president of this country has said. That is clearly his business. What I would observe is local commanders, local governance leaders here who are hugely grateful."They recognise that enormous progress has been made here. They know that is in large part due to ISAF previously."One of those local governance leaders, the deputy district governor of Nad Ali, Auliya Atrafi, confirmed the brigadier's view with an anecdote."Yesterday a police officer came by at sunset. He was having tea with us. He was saying that the day when the Taliban saw the British withdraw, they were dancing in the desert, saying 'Next week we will be having our meal at the district centre.' And it's been quite a while and they haven't been to the district centre."Progress has come at a cost. I was on the first British patrol onto the streets of Lashkar Gah in January 2006 when soldiers wore soft berets, proudly pointing out how they were going to do things differently as a US patrol passed by in heavily-armoured vehicles.But the optimism of Corporal Scott Hodgkinson, who told me on the streets back in 2006 "everyone has been really friendly; they're happy to see us, the British", was clearly misplaced.This week when I went out to see an aid project, I travelled in the sort of heavily-armoured military vehicle the British used to mock.Before British soldiers were sent down to Helmand, five British soldiers had been killed in the first four years of the Afghan intervention.However, 439 more have died since the decision to send troops to Helmand was made, when Defence Secretary John Reid said: "We would be happy to leave in three years and without firing a shot."He meant, of course, that they had been sent to provide support for an aid programme, not to fight a war.Colonel Henry Worsley, the first commanding officer in those long-ago days of soft-beret patrols told me they wanted to grab development "by the scruff of the neck".Since then I have been here pretty well every year, and seen just how hard it is to make a difference.Once I went to see how a programme to encourage women to plant vegetables and keep chickens was going. The plastic sheeting on the greenhouses had gone, no vegetables grew, and the chickens had disappeared,­ presumably into the pot.And there was to be a business park, close to Bost airport in Lashkar Gah, designed to encourage food-processing plants for export, with lucrative deals for investors. The money disappeared and the business park was never built.If you mention it now, there is an embarrassed silence and shuffling of feet among aid officials.And there is the continued failure to eradicate the opium poppy.I have been briefed frequently here by earnest agricultural economists on how they were going to provide alternative livelihoods for poppy farmers.But three times as much opium was produced in Helmand last year as when British troops arrived.Most of the illegal heroin on sale in Britain comes from poppies grown in Afghanistan.And yet, despite the cost, the loss of life and the blunders, there has been some genuine progress.It is hard to knock the enthusiasm of a girl like Raihanna, in her last year at school, speaking good English and now on her way to medical college, something that would not have been possible under the Taliban.There are functioning courts, and a prison that is far superior to other Afghan facilities.When I went to see it last year, a woman who had come to visit her son told me, without being asked, that this was a really good jail. Far better, she added, than the one where her other son was being held in Kandahar.But uncertainty remains over what will happen next as British and other foreign forces disappear from the landscape.International forces are drawing down and ending the war on a timetable. But Afghanistan has a history of upsetting the best-laid plans.</body>

      <title>The UK housing market - in graphics</title>
      <description>Six charts to explain history of house prices</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24387237</url>
      <date>1381359735</date>
      <body>The UK's housing boom ended in 2008 as the banking crisis and credit crunch bit.In the subsequent years, sales and prices fell in most areas, leaving some people in negative equity. Many potential buyers found they were unable to get on to the ladder as risk-averse banks rationed their lending.But 2013 has seen hints of a revival in the housing market, driven in part by signs of the return of first-time buyers.Transactions have risen but the number of homes for sale has failed to match demand in many areas, pushing up prices.Annual increases are now at a level not seen for at least three years.This is an average across the UK, and might not reflect the fact that prices and activity are growing in some major cities - most notably London - but are still falling in some areas.Increasing prices create a fresh headache for first-time buyers trying to raise the deposit for a home, even though mortgage rates remain at record low levels.But some fundamental issues remain for the UK housing market that will affect the chances of people being able to buy or sell in the longer term.Firstly, the UK remains rather obsessed with the idea of borrowing to own a home compared with the rest of Europe.Ownership levels, for mortgaged properties, are higher than most of the EU with the exception mainly of Scandinavian countries.Yet there is widespread agreement that there are not enough homes being built to match this demand.The number of new homes being built and finished fell then stalled during the financial crisis. Only now do builders say it is starting to pick up again, helped in part by government schemes aimed at kick-starting the market.But the pace of building means the housing stock is not keeping up with population growth.Looking to the future, properties are going to have fewer people living in them, partly owing to the fact we are living for longer - creating even more of a squeeze for young people hoping to buy a home of their own.</body>

      <body>Flights in and out of Aberdeen International Airport have resumed after an air ambulance left the runway while taxiing.The Scottish Ambulance Service said its aircraft, operated by Gama Aviation, was involved in the incident just before 12:00.A patient, being routinely transferred from Shetland, was on board the plane, along with an escort, a paramedic and two crew. No-one was injured.There was no damage to the aircraft.All flights were suspended for about three hours and services were diverted to Edinburgh and Glasgow.A spokesman for the ambulance service said: "An air ambulance plane on a routine non-emergency transfer from Shetland appears to have come off the runway at Aberdeen while taxiing after landing."There were no injuries to anyone on board and the patient has been transferred to hospital."In a statement, Gama Aviation said a full investigation was underway.It said: "Today at 11:49 local time a Beechcraft King Air 200 aircraft, operated on behalf of the Scottish Air Ambulance by Gama Aviation Ltd, undertook a normal landing at Aberdeen Airport, following a routine patient transfer from Lerwick."Whilst entering the taxiway, the aircraft experienced steering difficulties and departed the runway onto the grass."</body>

      <title>Route unveiled as baton trip begins</title>
      <description>Details of the Queen's Baton Relay's route around Scotland are unveiled as it sets off on the international leg of the journey.</description>

      <body>Details of the Queen's Baton Relay's route around Scotland have been unveiled as it sets off on the international leg of the journey.The baton will visit all 70 nations and territories of the Commonwealth before the Glasgow 2014 games start at Celtic Park on 23 July.Its 40-day tour of Scotland will begin in Edinburgh on 14 June, before ending with four days in Glasgow.The baton left Glasgow Airport on Thursday afternoon, bound for India.Organisers have also launched the campaign to recruit 4,000 baton-bearers.They are seeking nominations before 22 November via the Glasgow 2014 website.About 100 people each day will carry the baton on its journey around the country, an event Lord Smith of Kelvin, Glasgow 2014 chairman, hopes will help in "sharing the excitement of the countdown to the Commonwealth Games with communities across the nation".He said: "It's important as many people as possible feel part of this special moment and from today there's a chance for everyone to nominate the people in their street, village, town or city that they would like to see honoured as baton-bearers."Commonwealth Games Minister Shona Robison said the call for nominees for baton-bearers "gives everyone in Scotland a chance to recognise up to 4,000 individuals who have made an exceptional contribution to their local community, in particular through sport or their work with young people".On Wednesday, The Queen placed her message to the Commonwealth inside the baton during a special ceremony at Buckingham Palace.Cyclist Sir Chris Hoy, a six-time Olympic gold and double Commonwealth gold medallist, escorted the empty baton up The Mall to the palace in London.The Queen placed the hand-written scroll inside the specially-designed baton, which was then sealed for its 288-day journey through the Commonwealth nations and territories.The first baton bearer was Allan Wells, the Scottish sprinter who won gold at the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games as well the Commonwealth Games in 1978 and 1982.Stirling and Glasgow hosted official events on Thursday before the baton was transported to Glasgow Airport on its way to India.From there, it will travel to Commonwealth nations as diverse as Bangladesh, New Zealand, Nigeria and Barbados.However, it will not stopover in The Gambia, which last week withdrew from the Commonwealth, saying it will "never be a member of any neo-colonial institution".The baton will return to Europe on 4 May 2014 when it will visit Cyprus, Malta and Gibraltar before going on to Jersey, Guernsey and Isle of Man, who all send their own teams to the Games.The baton's visit to Northern Ireland begins on 20 May, Wales on 24 May and England, where it spends two weeks, from 31 May.Glasgow 2014 will be the 20th Commonwealth Games and will feature 17 sports in 11 days of competition, with 261 medal events.The Commonwealth of Nations has 54 members, but 70 teams participate in the Commonwealth Games because a number of British overseas territories, Crown dependencies and island states compete under their own flag.The baton's journey around the globe will be documented by adventurer and broadcaster Mark Beaumont for the BBC.</body>

      <title>Questions raised over indy oil fund</title>
      <description>Scottish ministers were warned by their own economic advisers that plans for an oil fund under independence may require tax rises or spending cuts.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-24469684</url>
      <date>1381413910</date>
      <body>Scottish ministers were warned by their own economic advisers that plans for an oil fund under independence may require tax rises or spending cuts.The advice, written for the government last year and published under freedom of information laws, has been seen by the BBC and the Daily Mail newspaper.Pro-Union campaigners claimed the pubic was being deceived.But the Scottish government said the private advice had since been overtaken by events.It warned that, if Scotland became independent, it would have to raise taxes, cut services or borrow to create the oil fund.But it also said Scotland could have paid off its debts 30 years ago if it had been independent and had had oil revenues.The advice calculated the tax surpluses of the 1980s could have been set aside to create a Norwegian-style oil fund which would have been worth £117bn by 2011.The emergence of the paper led to stormy exchanges during first minister's questions at the Scottish Parliament, where Labour and the Conservatives accused the SNP government of trying to hide information detrimental to its case for independence, ahead of the referendum on 18 September next year.Labour leader Johann Lamont asked the first minister: "When was he going to tell us his choice to raise taxes or cut public spending? The answer is, never. Honesty is not something this government deals in."When Ms Lamont was asked to withdraw the remark by Holyrood's presiding officer, she continued: "I accept the advice of the presiding offer, but I have to say I do not know what word you use to describe a government that says one thing in private and something different in public."The fact of the matter is, Scotland is on pause and we will not be given the full facts with this government ahead of a referendum."But Mr Salmond said the contents of the private advice had come before recommendations published last week by the Scottish government's fiscal commission working group set out a scenario where, under independence, money could be put into two separate oil funds without spending and taxation changes.One fund would help stabilise finances as revenue fluctuates, while the other would be a long term investment fund, similar to the one operated by Norway.The first minister said: "We've got a fiscal commission report which sets out clear criteria, how we can marshal Scotland's resources and make sure that asset is used for the benefit of this generation and for future generations."Nobody would seriously argue that the UK has handled oil well as a resource over the last 40 years. Nobody would seriously dispute that Norway - the country across the North Sea - has handled that resource much better.""The fiscal commission have put forward a proposal which allows Scotland to get towards the fortunate position of Norway, as opposed to making the unremitting bungles of Westminster and successive United Kingdom chancellors."However, Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said she ran both the private advice and the fiscal commission report through "university cheating software".She went on: "And what did I find? Whole sections cut and pasted - entire paragraphs on Scotland's projected net fiscal debt, on the country's debt interest payments and on notional borrowing costs."All the good stuff made the grade. All the bad stuff hit the bin.Ms Davidson added: "It seems when the government reached any section in here - and there were plenty - that said that an oil fund would mean higher taxes, more borrowing or lower public spending, they simply hit delete."Earlier, on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Alistair Darling, who is former chancellor and head of pro-Union Better Together, said: "If you were to set up an oil fund you would have to borrow money to save it so that seems to be complete nonsense."The problem we have here is yet again we are being told one thing in public when the SNP knows something else is the case in private."Finance Secretary John Swinney told the same programme that if debt in an independent Scotland was reducing it would be prudent to invest in an oil fund.He added: "People will have mortgages, which is debt, it is an obligation to pay back, at the same time many people will also be saving - if they have the money to put aside for their future - and that is exactly what we are trying to do as a country."</body>

      <title>Spending watchdog in £4m tax dispute</title>
      <description>The public spending watchdog Audit Scotland is in dispute with the taxman over a £4.1m bill.</description>

      <date>1381414983</date>
      <body>Scotland's public spending watchdog is in dispute with the taxman over a £4.1m bill, it has emerged.Audit Scotland boss Caroline Gardner told MSPs that HMRC is seeking to recoup VAT rebates which it believes were wrongly paid.The organisation said it had not budgeted for the tax demand and was challenging the bill.The issue came to light at a meeting of the Scottish Commission for Public Audit (SCPA) at Holyrood.HMRC said the VAT rebates had been wrongly paid to Audit Scotland since 2006, which is understood to have recouped the tax incurred by external companies that it contracted in to do audit work.Scotland's auditor general Caroline Gardner said: "We have just been through a four-year budget strategy in which we have reduced the cost of audit by more than 20%."I struggle to see how we could reduce our costs by anything approaching that amount."We would continue to apply that pressure, but the options we would have would be to ask the SCPA for funding or look at recovering it through local government fees, neither of which is palatable."In a letter to the SPCA, the parliamentary body which polices the watchdog, Ms Gardner warned the debt could have a knock-on effect for local authorities, which could see their fees for audit work increased by around 5%.She added: "We believe HMRC have some fundamental misunderstandings about the current arrangements and have responded robustly."It also emerged that a second tax dispute, worth £160,000, has been settled.</body>

      <body>SSE customers will see an average 8.2% rise in gas and electricity prices from 15 November, the company has announced.The energy firm said the rise reflected higher costs of buying wholesale energy and paying to deliver it to customers' homes, plus government levies.The price rises will affect about 4.4 million electricity customers and 2.9 million gas customers, not including those on fixed-price tariffs.SSE's average annual dual-fuel energy bill will rise by £106 to £1,380.Business and Energy Minister Michael Fallon said he was "disappointed" by SSE's decision to increase energy prices.He told BBC Radio 5 live: "I would encourage all customers to look again at their tariffs and see whether they can switch to a cheaper tariff."He added the long-term answer to high energy bills was "more competition and encouraging consumers to shop around".Caroline Flint, shadow energy secretary, said: "When times are tough energy companies should be helping their customers not hitting them with more price rises to boost their profits."The company said that 8.2% was an average rise. Customers in the North of England and central Scotland would see the smallest increase, of 7%, in their dual fuel price. Customers in the South East of England would see the biggest, up 9.7%.SSE last increased its prices a year ago. It has now pledged not to raise them again before autumn 2014."We're sorry we have to do this," said SSE's Will Morris."We've done as much as we could to keep prices down, but the reality is that buying wholesale energy in global markets, delivering it to customers' homes, and government-imposed levies collected through bills - endorsed by all the major parties - all cost more than they did last year."SSE, made up of Southern Electric, Swalec and Scottish Hydro, said that for a typical dual-fuel customer, wholesale energy prices had gone up 4%, paying to use delivery networks was 10% more expensive, and government levies were 13% higher.About two-thirds of a household fuel bill goes on the cost of wholesale energy, the cost of running an energy sales business, and on the companies' profits.Up to 11% goes on government programmes to save energy, reduce emissions and tackle climate change, according to regulator Ofgem. SSE said it wanted this to be included in general taxation, rather than added to bills.However, Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: "Half of an average energy bill is made up of the wholesale cost of energy. This far outweighs the proportion of a bill that goes to help vulnerable households with their bills and to cut energy waste."The latest calculations from the regulator found that the average profit margin made by an energy supplier on an average £1,315 bill is £65.However, this figure can be volatile. The snapshot profit margin has risen above £100, but has also fallen to a negative figure at certain points in recent years.Profit levels prompted Labour leader Ed Miliband to declare that gas and electricity bills would not go up for 20 months if Labour won the 2015 election.Prime Minister David Cameron condemned the pledge as a "gimmick", saying the government was simplifying bills to make it easier for consumers to switch suppliers and encourage competition.SSE, formerly Scottish and Southern Energy, said it expected its annual profit margin to average about 5% over a three-to-five-year period, which it believed was "a fair amount".It said its profit margin was 4.2% in the 2012-13 financial year and was expected to fall short of the 5% target again this year."We know we will come in for a great deal of criticism for this decision and politicians will no doubt be lining up to condemn us," said SSE's Mr Morris."But over many years, policymakers themselves have failed to highlight adequately the cost to consumers of the policies they have pursued in government."They can't expect to have power stations replaced with new technologies, the network to be upgraded and nationwide energy efficiency schemes all to be funded for free."And as an energy provider, we are in the unenviable position of having to pass this cost on to consumers through energy bills."The announcement comes about a year after the last set of gas and electricity price rises.Between August and December 2012, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%.At that time, the companies blamed rising wholesale prices, the cost of transporting energy to homes, and the increasing cost of government social schemes for the increases.Advice line National Debtline said it had received a record 15,502 calls from people seeking help with energy debts in the first six months of this year. This was up 10% on last year.Adam Scorer, of watchdog Consumer Futures, said: "SSE and others who follow need to demonstrate why this rise is justified."</body>

      <title>Probe finds plane evacuation delays</title>
      <description>An investigation into an emergency plane stop at Glasgow Airport finds the evacuation was delayed by passengers trying to remove luggage.</description>

      <body>An investigation into an emergency plane stop at Glasgow Airport has found no cause for smoke being in the cabin but said the evacuation was delayed by passengers trying to remove luggage.The Jet2 Boeing 737, was taking off for Alicante in Spain, when it made an emergency stop on 19 October last year.During the evacuation 16 of the 187 passengers were hurt - one seriously.Investigators said the injuries were due to passengers bumping into each other or being knocked over.The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) report said the Boeing 737 made an emergency stop after smoke was detected in the cabin.After stopping the plane on the runway, the captain entered the cabin.With smoke or vapour visible and a strong smell of burning, he ordered an immediate emergency evacuation.The report said passengers attempting to recover property from the overhead lockers delayed movement towards the exits "and the age or infirmity of some of the passengers may have extended the evacuation time".The AAIB added that several passengers decided to re-enter the cabin through the over-wing exits, rather than slide down the extended flaps as they considered it would be safer to use an escape slide.The report went on: "The injuries suffered were as a result of the evacuation due to passengers bumping into each other on the slide or being knocked to the ground."In the case of the over-wing exits, sliding six feet to the ground off a wet flap can be a daunting experience but the aim is to escape from the aircraft and, as such, carries a degree of risk."The report said no source for the smoke was identified "but excessive moisture in the air conditioning system was identified as a possible factor".</body>

      <body>A convicted killer has been found guilty of attempted murder over a hammer attack which left a dog walker in Glasgow with serious head injuries.Francis MacKenzie, 46, attacked Gerald Kenney, 48, in Tollcross Road, in June. His son, Steven, 21, admitted kicking the victim as he lay on the ground.At the High Court in Glasgow, sentence on both men was deferred.MacKenzie Snr was jailed for 10 years for the culpable homicide of 27-year-old David Baxter in 2000.The court heard that Mr Kenney was attacked from behind by three men as he walked his dog at 20:10 on 12 June.Mr Kenney heard his attackers running towards him and turned to look.He was immediately struck on the head by Francis MacKenzie, who was wielding a hammer.Mr Kenney fell to the ground unconscious and MacKenzie hit him another six or seven blows on the skull with the weapon.He was also hit on the left arm with the hammer.An eye witness said that he saw Mr Kenney's skull give way under the blows.Steven MacKenzie kicked Mr Kenney, as did the unknown third attacker.The incident was caught on CCTV and the father and son were identified from the footage.Mr Kenney suffered life-threatening injuries including severe depressed skull fractures and broken bones in his face.Doctors considered it too risky to operate to remove bone fragments from his brain.Mr Kenney is said to be recovering and able to live independently, but he has no feeling on the right side of his head, face and mouth.He lost five teeth in the attack and has to use a straw to drink and suffers daily headaches.Francis MacKenzie claimed that he attacked Mr Kenney because he was part of a group that had assaulted him in 1999. This is denied by Mr Kenney.</body>

      <description>A former managing director of Ayr United Football Club is jailed for 20 months after being caught with herbal cannabis worth £257,889.</description>

      <body>A former managing director of Ayr United Football Club has been jailed for 20 months after being caught with herbal cannabis worth £257,889.David McKee, 55, admitted involvement in the supply of the drug on 18 April last year at his home in Ayr and at another address in the town.The High Court in Edinburgh was told McKee fell into financial difficulties after the death of his daughter.He was managing director of Ayr United between 1991 and 1995.The court heard how police began keeping watch on McKee after a tip off.They saw him drive his Rover across town to met another man in a white Mercedes van.The two returned to his home in the town's Greenfield Avenue and began loading 104 heat-sealed plastic bags from his garage into the van before returning to the first address.The bin bags were transferred to a smaller van which was stopped in the village of Carsphairn, Dumfries and Galloway.The total weight of the cannabis was more than 25 kilos and had a potential street value of £257,889.Pleading for leniency, defence advocate Euan Dow told how McKee's businesses had gone bust after his 19-year-old daughter Leann died from cystic fibrosis.McKee and his brother, Robert, each donated a lung for a pioneering transplant operation in 1999.The court heard how his daughter was able to gain a university degree and married before her death in 2007.Mr Dow also said McKee's wife, Marion, had been treated for cancer and he had struggled to work after the death of his daughter but had been unable to avoid financial failure.He had to sell his house, then rent it back from the buyer.Mr Dow said he saw the opportunity to make some money when he was asked to store the cannabis and move it to another location but had made "the wrong choice".The lawyer said that because of the loss of the drug consignment McKee had been assaulted, his car had been set on fire and his wife had been "targeted" in the family home."He is adamant that his involvement in such matters is at and end," said Mr Dow.Sentencing McKee, judge Lord Burns said: "I accept that because of the tragic death of your daughter, who you valiantly attempted to assist, your business collapsed with catastrophic consequences and I can have nothing but sympathy for these circumstances."However, you involved yourself deliberately in what must be regarded as a substantial operation."Lord Burns said that under the circumstances a custodial sentence was unavoidable.</body>

      <title>Committee to seek prisoners' views</title>
      <description>Prisoners are to be asked for their views on plans to scrap the 136-year-old system of monitoring conditions in Scotland's jails.</description>

      <body>Prisoners are to be asked for their views on plans to scrap the current system of monitoring conditions in Scottish jailsHolyrood's justice committee will take evidence as MSPs scrutinise Scottish government proposals to replace the independent prison visiting committees.These committees ensure conditions in Scottish jails are safe and decent.The government wants to replace them with monitors overseen by the Chief Inspector of Prisons.Prison visiting committees, which were established in 1877, monitor the care of prisoners and the conditions in which they are held.Members, who are unpaid volunteers, get free access to prisons to observe conditions and hear complaints from inmates as part of their work.Although they are responsible to the Scottish government, they are independent and are not part of the management structure of a prison.The Scottish government has already put forward proposals to scrap the committees and replace them with four independent prison monitors supported by lay monitors.The monitors would be paid, and would be part of the prisons inspector's staff.The change was recommended in a report by Professor Andrew Coyle in his review of independent monitoring of prisons, which was published in February.The justice committee said that as part of its evidence-gathering about the plans, it wants to hear the views of everyone who may be affected - including serving prisoners.Its convener, Christine Grahame MSP, said: "We want to hear the views of people at the sharp end of these proposals to reform the monitoring of Scottish prisons and prisoners."We hope that representatives from both inside and outside the prison walls will let us know what they think."She said once the committee had received written evidence, it would then hear from people in person on the issue next month.Neil Powrie, convener of the Association of Visiting Committees for Scottish Penal Establishments (AVC), said it was concerned about some aspects of the government proposals."We will be opposing, during the consultation, the principle of having monitors within the inspectorate," he said."We are also opposed to the principle of having paid and lay monitors."He said the AVC supported the idea of monitors being part of an independent unit within the Scottish Justice Department, as happens in England and Wales, one of a number of suggestions put forward in Prof Coyle's report.The government has rejected that idea.A Scottish government spokeswoman said: "It is our priority to ensure that the transition from prison visiting committees to the new monitoring service is achieved speedily and seamlessly."However, our decision still requires parliamentary scrutiny and agreement."The government said it hoped its proposed new system could be in place by autumn 2014.</body>

      <description>The Scottish NHS needs to focus on its long term financial plans to meet the significant challenges ahead, the public spending watchdog says</description>

      <body>The Scottish NHS needs to focus on its long term financial plans to meet the significant challenges ahead, the public spending watchdog has said.Audit Scotland said the health service had to take heed of tighter budgets and a rising demand for services.Despite the warning, Audit Scotland praised the financial performance of Scotland's health authorities in the last year.Scottish ministers said they were committed to protecting NHS spending.Opposition politicians said the health service was operating on a "hand-to-mouth basis".The health service spends more than £10bn over the year - almost a third of the total Scottish budget.It ended the 2012-13 year with a £16.9m surplus and savings worth about £270m - and boards will need to identify savings of £268m to break even this year.Publishing her findings in a new report, Auditor General Caroline Gardner said: "The health service needs to increase its focus on longer-term financial planning so that it is prepared for the challenges it faces."While budgets are getting tighter, demand for healthcare is rising due to an ageing population, more people with long-term conditions and the impact of factors such as increasing rates of obesity."This presents significant challenges for the NHS boards delivering services both now and in the longer term."Health Secretary Alex Neil said: "Despite increasing budgets it is right that the NHS is as efficient as possible with taxpayers' money which is why we have asked boards to make savings."I want to be very clear that these savings are not a reduction in budget - all money saved will be reinvested in frontline services. This improves the quality of care patients receive."But Labour health spokesman Neil Findlay said hospitals were struggling to cope with cuts to nursing staff, adding: "This report confirms everything we've been saying for the last few months about the increasing build-up of pressure across health boards because of SNP cuts."Audit Scotland have reinforced the need for an immediate review of the NHS so we can come up with a long-term plan that will support hard-pressed staff and ensure patients are properly cared for."Liberal Democrat health spokesperson Jim Hume, added: "Under the SNP our health service has been operating on a hand-to-mouth basis."This report shows that the SNP's erratic approach of decreasing and increasing nurse numbers, stumbling from one crisis to another and cutting capacity without creating effective care in the community is leaving health boards fighting increasing pressures with one arm tied behind its back."Scottish Conservative health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: "Most health boards haven't managed their target for recurring savings, and these are the ones which - over time - will make the real impact."This is despite the fact the Scottish government has slashed nursing numbers so drastically that millions has had to be spent on expensive bank and agency workers."Dr Brian Keighley, chairman of the BMA in Scotland, said: "NHS managers have the unenviable task of managing shrinking budgets whilst trying to achieve a range of annual targets, outcomes and performance standards that are set by government."This can leave boards focusing on planning services for the short term; making savings from easy targets such as the workforce."This is not sustainable and the BMA welcomes Audit Scotland's recommendation to introduce structures that encourage longer term planning for NHS boards."</body>

      <body>Two Stirling councillors have withdrawn a motion calling for the Union flag to be flown outside Stirling Council's headquarters.Tory member Callum Campbell suggested the debate which was seconded by Labour member Danny Gibson.The proposal had been condemned by some nationalists.On Thursday the councillors withdrew the motion, saying they did not want it to be a "distraction" from the "real issues of uncertainty".At present the council flies two flags at its headquarters - a conventional St Andrew's Cross and a specially-modified Saltire, which also includes the lion rampant and emblems from the city's coat of arms.The suggested motion would have seen both the Union flag and the modified Saltire flown.The Union flag would have been flown outside the council building while the Saltire would have been on the flagpole in the grounds between the building and the main road.Stirling is run by a coalition of Labour and Conservative councillors, although the SNP is the largest single party.After withdrawing the motion due to be debated on Thursday evening, Councillor Campbell said: "I don't want this motion to become a distraction from the real issues of uncertainty that the SNP are asking us to decide upon next year, so I have written to the provost withdrawing my motion."On Thursday, 18 September next year, the electorate in Scotland will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?"Policies on which flags are flown vary from council to council.Some fly the St Andrew's Cross, the union flag and the EU flag or a corporate logo. Others fly just one flag and change it depending on the occasion.Glasgow City Council normally flies the St Andrew's Cross above the city chambers but replaces it with a Union flag on royal birthdays and some other special occasions.</body>

      <body>Selkirk school pupils are taking part in a project to create a musical event commemorating the Battle of Flodden.Fletcher's Ballad involves Scottish Borders Council's Youth Music Initiative (YMI), the Scottish Chamber Orchestra (SCO) and Abbotsford House.The project is being led by award-winning British composer, John Barber, with support from SCO musicians.It will end with a "showcase event" of the songs and music produced on 1 November.The project is named after a figure who is an important part of the town's history.A statue in Selkirk commemorates Fletcher as the only man from a deputation of 80 from the town to survive the Battle of Flodden in 1513.The project will start with "inspirational visits" to Abbotsford House to learn about how Sir Walter Scott used items he collected to develop his own creative ideas.Mr Barber will then work with the pupils to develop a theme which will be used as the basis of their songs and music.It will conclude with a "Big Sing" in the Victoria Hall involving pupils from all local primary schools and Selkirk High School.It will take the form of a ballad which will tell the story of Flodden with the pupils performing a number of songs interspersed with text.Councillor Vicky Davidson said: "Fletcher and his return from Flodden are an integral part of Selkirk's history and it is exciting that pupils and young people in the area are getting the chance to participate in such an innovative musical project in this anniversary year."Not only will they be given the chance to work with professional musicians and composers, they will be doing so in a way that will develop their creativity, social skills and knowledge of local history."</body>

      <body>A new sculpture has been erected above the entrance to the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh.Made by Alexander Stoddart, it represents Clio - who is the muse of History in Greek mythology.In 2008 Mr Stoddart was made Sculptor in Ordinary to The Queen in Scotland.The sculpture replaces the original figure of History by the sculptor William Birnie Rhind, which weathered beyond repair and was later removed.Mr Stoddart's new figure is cast in aluminium, stands almost two metres tall and weighs 85kg.An exhibition, Alexander Stoddart: Making History is at the Queens Street gallery from Saturday until 28 September 2014.The exhibition shows the technical process to create History through the artist's drawings and photographs from his studio at the University of the West of Scotland and at the Black Isle Bronze foundry in Nairn where the sculpture was cast.Mr Stoddart has sculptures of David Hume and Adam Smith on The Royal Mile and the physicist James Clerk Maxwell on George Street.Christopher Baker, director of Scottish National Portrait Gallery, said: "This wonderful new sculpture is sited serenely above the facade of the gallery, both making a statement and being entirely sympathetic to its context, one of Scotland's greatest 19th Century buildings."It is the first enrichment of this sort which has been installed on the gallery since the Victorian period."The related exhibition will illustrate in a compelling manner the extraordinary commitment that Alexander Stoddart made to this high-profile commission."Mr Stoddart, said: "This tremendous commission, to complete the sculpture scheme of the Portrait Gallery, gave me the opportunity to pay homage to some of the great late 19th Century artists whom I have admired since my earliest days as a sculptor."It has been a weighty honour to have been allowed to work in collaboration with these long-dead men, and a pleasure working with the people at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery who are all alive and thriving in one of the greatest National-Romantic buildings in the British Isles."I should like to thank them all, and to thank my studio assistants in Paisley, and the foundry-workers in Nairn, who worked so diligently with me to achieve this end; a simple little figure, standing where she ought, with the clouds behind her."</body>

      <body>A disco jacuzzi bath and Hogwarts floating lights are new features at a state-of-the-art children's respite centre which has officially opened.The £2.4m Seaview Centre, run by Edinburgh City Council, can accommodate up to 60 youngsters aged between five and 17 who have disabilities.It provides regular short breaks with activities.The centre was opened by Paul Godzik, Edinburgh's convener of the education, children and families committee.There is also a wheelchair swing and tree house in the centre's garden.The centre has been built on one level and was designed by the council's architects.Mr Godzik said: "Respite care is an extremely important service and the new Seaview offers a wonderful setting to provide this. Both the young person and their families can benefit immensely from the facilities at the centre."Carol Mentiplay, Seaview and family focus manager, said: "What makes the centre so special was all the work that went into taking on board the ideas from both young people and staff."I can't praise highly enough everyone involved in the design and construction process."Their enthusiasm rubbed off on everyone else and has resulted in a fantastic building."The new complex has been built on the site of the city's old Lismore Primary School, replacing the former building in Joppa which was a girl's hostel.</body>

      <title>King Rangers return link welcomed</title>
      <description>Former Rangers chairman Alastair Johnston says the potential return of Dave King to the Ibrox board would benefit the club.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24474218</url>
      <date>1381404226</date>
      <body>Former Rangers chairman Alastair Johnston would welcome Dave King's return to Ibrox.King invested heavily during Sir David Murray's Ibrox reign and maintained interest during recent club events.But issues with South African tax authorities prevented him from playing a more significant role."I think his agenda, his experience and the care and attention he pays to financial matters could serve Rangers well," said Johnston.King recently agreed to pay almost £44m to the Revenue Service in South Africa as criminal charges against him were dropped.And the Glasgow-born businessman has been in talks with Ibrox chief executive Craig Mather and finance director Brian Stockbridge over the club's future.Johnston told BBC Sportsound that King would prove an asset at Ibrox."David joined the Rangers board at my behest when he invested money and was a friend of mine that I knew from the sports world," he said."I paved the way for his original investment in Rangers. David, in his own personal circumstances, seems to have progressed towards resolution of the issues he's had in South Africa."Dave King is a very bright guy, keeps his cards very close to his chest and I think his agenda, his experience and the care and attention he pays to financial matters could serve Rangers well."Whether or not he'd come into a circumstance where we or he has not a great deal of control, as part of an investment, is only one that he can analyse at this point in time and realistically what he could do, even if he did join."Asked whether King could be enticed to take up the vacant chairman's role at Ibrox, Johnston said: "I'm not sure how much authority the chairman has right now."Dave is not going to go in there in any circumstance where he doesn't have a control. He stayed on the board when Craig Whyte tried to get him off it, simply because of an obstinacy and certain leverage he brought to bear on Craig Whyte."But the bottom line was at the end of the day if Dave can't see the role as chairman as being anything more than a figurehead then I don't think he'll be interested."A group of shareholders are trying to force changes on the Rangers board at the upcoming AGM.Speaking earlier this week, former Rangers manager Walter Smith said the club must "get rid of the boardroom turmoil" and "settle down".</body>

      <title>Men guilty of £400,000 Rolex raid</title>
      <description>Two men are convicted of carrying out an armed robbery which saw £400,000 of Rolex watches stolen at an East Renfrewshire jewellers.</description>

      <body>Two men have been convicted of stealing Rolex watches worth £400,000 and causing £210,000 of damage during an armed robbery at a jewellers.Cousins Alan Mitchell, 34, and 20-year-old Gary Mitchell targeted Eric N Smith jewellers in Ayr Road, Newton Mearns, on 13 April, with another unknown man.They threatened the owner and his wife with a machete while display cases were smashed with hammers.At the High Court in Glasgow, sentence on both men was deferred.The court heard that the well-planned heist at the East Renfrewshire jewellers lasted about 33 seconds.The jury were played CCTV footage which showed the masked robbers walking along Ayr Road, with one of them carrying a large lump of concrete on his shoulder.This stone was used to hold open the shop door.One of the robbers threatened the owners Eric Smith and his wife Yvonne with a machete while the other two smashed display cases containing Rolex watches with hammers.A total of 38 watches, worth £400,000 were taken, with £210,000 worth of damage caused to other Rolexes.Mrs Smith, 52, told the court it had been an ordinary Saturday until the raid took place.She said: "The first thing I was aware of was a really loud bang. It was like a gun going off."I ran towards where the noise was coming from. There were three men coming into the shop with masks and carrying a machete and two hammers. They kept shouting 'Get back, get back'."She told the court the man armed with the machete stood guard over them while the other two smashed a display window of Rolex watches.In court, Mrs Smith identified both of the Mitchells as the two men she saw in the shop.She said she thought Alan Mitchell was the leader and Gary Mitchell the robber who was wielding the machete.The Mitchells and their unknown accomplice were out of the shop in seconds.However, a mother and son who saw the robbery chased them in their car - then a doctor and his wife saw them changing from their first getaway car into their second and noted down the registration number.The second getaway car, a Mazda, owned by Alan Mitchell, was later searched by police and a scarf similar to the one worn by the robbers was found to have his DNA on it.A top, which was the same as one worn by the raiders, had Gary Mitchells DNA on it.Both men denied having anything to do with the robbery.Alan Mitchell, from Cambuslang, South Lanarkshire, claimed he was getting a quote for work from a plasterer.Gary Mitchell, from Shettleston, Glasgow, said he was at a football match.Advocate depute Sheena Fraser, prosecuting, told the court that both men have previous convictions.Alan Mitchell was jailed for five years at the High Court in Paisley in 2006 for opening lockfast places and a firearms offence.Judge Lord Jones deferred sentence on both until November at the High Court in Edinburgh.</body>

      <body>Plans for a major extension to the St Giles Centre in Elgin have been recommended for approval.The development, which will retain the existing facade on the High Street, will include three new floors and and a new bus station.Developers Robertson Property/Upland Investments said it would allow Elgin to compete with Inverness and Aberdeen as well out of town shopping centres.A decision is expected to be made by Moray Council on Tuesday.The St Giles Centre was granted planning permission and listed building consent in 1987, with provision for future expansion.The development will create an additional 4,500 sq m of shopping space - more than double the current area.A report to councillors will say that without the extension it is unlikely the city centre will be able to attract significant further investment.It said the approach was in step with the Scottish government's "high street first" presumption.Planning officials conceded that the amended proposal was an acceptable departure from the development plan, which could be offset by helping to breath new life into the town centre.</body>

      <body>Police chiefs say there has been a rise in violent crime in Dumfries and Galloway in the first six months since the launch of a single national force.Exact figures for the increase have still to be disclosed.However, Divisional Commander Kate Thomson has warned they will show a rise in the most serious "group one" offences.A particular area of concern is the number of recent street robberies taking place in the region.Commander Thomson said the number of such incidents remained low but admitted it had been an unusually busy and difficult period.She said that while it had been "business as usual" it had also been a "very challenging" first six months for the division."We have had two murders which have been well reported on and we have seen some significant incidents and events that have taken place," she said."I would have to give credit to the colleagues that I work with - not only within the division but those that have also come from Police Scotland as well."She added that the community had played a vital part in helping the police to get on top of the cases which faced them.However, she urged the public to be aware that while such offences were rare, they could also take steps to avoid them."It is not only about being visible and hopefully preventing some of these offences but also to give inputs into various groups just reminding them of personal safety," she said."That is certainly what I would look to do."Make sure you are safe when you are out there - don't wander along with your iPhone in your hand because somebody will invariably decide that it is perhaps something they would like."</body>

      <body>Relatives of a Scottish woman found dead in Crete more than four years ago have joined a protest in London.It was seeking greater support for the families of people who lose their lives overseas.The family of Jean Hanlon, who was from Dumfries, is convinced she was murdered but has been frustrated by the lack of progress in investigations.Her son Michael Porter joined other families in the protest outside the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.He said they were highlighting the fact that the issue affected a large number of people."It happens to so many people all over the UK and it is happening in so many other different countries," he said."No matter where someone dies or is killed, murdered or happens to pass away in a country there should be help."He said that the people involved deserved to be assisted "legally, financially and mentally" from the UK.Erin Bain, 28, from Hamilton, was there to highlight the lack of support following the death of her brother, Ryan, in Greece in July 2009.She said: "The Greek authorities just expect us to accept that a fit, healthy young man, a strong swimmer, with no past medical history apart from losing an eye, drowned in a hotel swimming pool."We want to know what happened - was there a lifeguard there and if not, why? Were there witnesses?"It won't change what happened but we need some sort of closure."An FCO statement said it would meet with any families concerned about the death of a loved one overseas."This is an incredibly difficult time for any family and the FCO has teams of trained professionals in the UK and across the world ready to offer support," it added.It said that more than 6,000 British nationals died overseas every year and their families were offered support in conjunction with a range of agencies."We also provide direct funding for many of our partners, including Victim Support Scotland, Missing Abroad and the travel care organisations and chaplaincies at UK airports, to enable them to provide additional specialist support where we cannot," it said."We regularly review our policy and our training for staff, seeking feedback from specialist non-governmental organisations and support groups as well as from families themselves."However, investigation of the death of any British national is a matter for the judicial process of the country they died in, and we must respect their systems just as we expect them to respect the UK's laws and legal processes."</body>

      <date>1381337132</date>
      <body>A proposal by Stirling Council aimed at ending a dispute over pay and conditions has been rejected by unions.The dispute has centred on the council's plan for a 0.5% pay cut across all pay grades and an additional hour of work per week.The new offer included a guarantee to restore the pay cut, and implement a national 1% pay rise, at a future date.Unions said the plans did not address the key issues of working more hours and changes to terms and conditions.The council's revised offer included:Stewards from JTUC, Unison, Unite, GMB and UCATT unions unanimously rejected the proposals after a meeting on Monday.They said the proposals also introduced performance-related pay and terms.The council expressed disappointment and said more than 90% of the council's 3,000 employees had signed up to the new terms and conditions.However, unions have said their members were only signing up "under protest" in order to keep their jobs.Unison has described the 0.5% cut as equivalent to a 1.5% pay cut after council staff across Scotland narrowly accepted a below-inflation 1% pay rise.It has also claimed the proposed extra 7.5 days of work a year meant it actually amounted to a 4.5% pay cut for most staff.The council has said the changes are necessary as it needs to make savings of £24m due to a real terms cut in the funding it receives from the Scottish government.It said the proposals amounted to an average pay reduction of £10 a month for middle and higher paid employees.The lowest grades will have a pay increase to £7.50 an hour as part of the council's ongoing commitment to the Living Wage, it said.Bob Jack, Stirling Council chief executive, said: "We are very disappointed that union officials have rejected these very positive proposals without asking their members for their views."The votes taken on industrial action are now some months old, they attracted only a few hundred votes, and were based on a very different set of conditions."Unison said it had been unable to share the proposals with its members as it was locked into a confidentiality agreement. The council said this agreement had been requested by the union.Unison said it would step up its campaign to pursue further "fair, meaningful negotiations".</body>

      <title>Harsh weather 'hit farmers hard'</title>
      <description>Harsh weather last winter led to a fall in livestock and fewer winter crops being planted, official statistics reveal.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-24460638</url>
      <date>1381324593</date>
      <body>Harsh weather last winter hit Scotland's farmers hard, official statistics have revealed.Fewer winter crops, such as wheat, potatoes and oilseed rape, were planted and there was also a fall in livestock.About 170,000 fewer lambs were counted in the annual census, while the number of sheep, pigs and cattle also fell.The National Farmers Union said wet weather last year, cold temperatures this spring and the closure of meat processing plants were to blame.The statistics were released as the Scottish government announced it had paid out almost £3.5m in compensation to farmers hit by losses caused by the severe weather.Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead said a total of 540 Weather Aid payments, worth more than £2.7m, had now been processed.A further 300 claims are still outstanding.More than 4,000 farmers have already received help from the Scottish government's £750,000 Fallen Stock Fund.The June 2013 Scottish Agricultural Census found livestock numbers continued to decline, with the total number of cattle down by 2% to 1.8 million.There was also a further fall in the number of sheep, which declined by 2% to just over 6.5 million.The drop was mainly due to a 5% fall in the number in lambs, much of which was related to the poor weather.Pig numbers saw a large fall - down 12% to 319,000 - which was put down in part to a reduction in meat processing facilities in Scotland.Commenting on the census, Mr Lochhead said: "These latest statistics confirm what we already know - that this year's extreme weather has taken its toll on Scottish farmers."That is why the Scottish government is providing £6.5m compensation through our Weather Aid scheme and Fallen Stock Fund which, unlike in England and Wales, is extra funding in addition to Single Farm Payments."About 300 Weather Aid claims are still outstanding and my officials are actively working with these farmers to verify their applications so that payments comply with EU state aid rules."This is very complex, which is why some claims are taking longer to process, but all payments will be completed as soon as possible."He added: "Although the extreme weather was undoubtedly a massive factor in the drop in sheep and cattle numbers this year, there is evidence of a longer-term decline."This highlights the scale of the challenge facing Scotland's red meat industry - particularly for Scotch Beef which has relatively high production costs."NFU Scotland said the census figures had come as little surprise to those close to the agricultural sector, given the "exceptional and extreme" weather endured by Scottish farmers in the winter and spring.Spokesman Bob Carruth commented: "Those weather events significantly changed the shape of the Scottish arable sector and ensured that our cattle and sheep numbers remained under pressure."But what a difference a year makes. The 2013 harvest, with potatoes still to be completed, will probably go down as one of the easiest to conduct on record."He added: "Ideal weather conditions across much of Scotland for harvesting and sowing crops means that 2014 is already, on paper, shaping up to be a more normal year for our arable sector."Record prices for cattle and solid trade for sheep also hint at improved fortunes for those sectors."That will be needed if we are to stem the decline that we have seen in our cattle herds and sheep flocks in recent years."</body>

      <body>A Royal Navy lieutenant crashed his yacht into an oil tanker in The Solent after sailing too close during a Cowes Week race, a court has heard.Roland Wilson, 32, of Stanley, Perthshire, is accused of negligence in the moments before the collision with the 120,000-ton vessel in August 2011.Prosecutors allege Mr Wilson sailed into the path of the tanker, despite having seen it from five miles away.Mr Wilson denies three counts of contravening maritime regulations.One member of the eight-strong crew of the 33ft (10m) racing yacht suffered head injuries in the collision, while another abandoned ship, Southampton Magistrates Court heard.Mr Wilson, who was a serving officer at the time of the crash, but is now a reservist, owned and skippered the yacht - called Atalanta of Chester - during the regatta.Despite shipping by-laws requiring vessels to maintain a safe distance from larger ships, the Atalanta crashed into the 853ft-long (260m) Hanne Knutsen tanker, which was heading to Fawley oil refinery.Charles Row, prosecuting, said: "The sea was calm, visibility was excellent, in excess of 10 miles (16km), with 10 to 12 knots of wind."Unfortunately, despite these favourable conditions, the Atalanta was towards the back of the race, nevertheless she was making seven knots."Mr Row said Wilson failed to comply with a "moving prohibited zone" of 1,000m (0.6 miles) in front and 100m (328ft) either side of a vessel greater than 150m (492ft).He said the situation had been complicated by a motor vessel that suffered engine failure to the tanker's starboard, forcing the Hanne Knutsen to change its course.Mr Row said, although the tanker had begun to make a port turn, the Atalanta should not have been in such a close position and Mr Wilson failed to turn on the yacht's engines to avoid the collision.He said, under the circumstances, the action would have been permitted under race rules and would not have led to his disqualification.Describing the collision to the court, Mr Row said: "One of the crew took the decision to abandon ship approximately five or six seconds before the collision."He passed down the starboard side of the Hanne Knutsen. Having abandoned ship he was picked up by a spectator vessel."The Atalanta mast struck the bow of the Hanne Knutsen and was pivoted round to the port. She was dismasted and one of her crew suffered head injuries which required hospital treatment."Mercifully, there was no other injury as a result of what happened."The trial continues.</body>

      <body>The Scottish government is giving an additional £3m to poor countries struggling with climate change, First Minister Alex Salmond has announced.The announcement was made to coincide with an international "climate justice" conference in Edinburgh.The grant matches an award of £3m from the Scottish government's climate justice fund in 2012.The first minister claimed Scotland is in "the forefront" of the fight against climate change.Mr Salmond said: "We are taking practical action on the ground to help those most vulnerable to climate change, those in the world's poorest communities in countries like Malawi, Scotland's historic sister nation."By doubling the climate justice fund we can provide genuine life-saving and life-changing help to those communities."The Scottish Government has been at the forefront of the fight against climate change, such as our ambitious emissions reduction and renewables targets."The new funding was welcomed by environment campaigners.Tom Ballantine, chair of the Stop Climate Chaos Scotland coalition, said: "It is great to see Scotland setting a positive example to other wealthy nations by reconfirming its commitment to the Climate Justice Fund with the additional money announced today."This will enable Scotland to provide urgently-needed support to people living in poverty in developing countries who are already struggling to plant and harvest their crops in the face of increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather."</body>

      <title>Prestwick Airport 'can make profits'</title>
      <description>Prestwick Airport, which is on the brink of being brought into public ownership, can be profitable if the right approach is taken, the deputy first minister says.</description>

      <body>Prestwick Airport can be profitable if the right approach is taken, the deputy first minister has said.The Scottish government announced at Holyrood on Tuesday it was negotiating to buy the airport.The Ayrshire facility, which was put up for sale last March by New Zealand-based owners Infratil, has been running annual losses of £2m.Nicola Sturgeon said she believed that "over time" Prestwick could go "back to profit".A six-week timetable of detailed negotiations has now begun with Infratil.Ms Sturgeon told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "We are embarking on commercial negotiations with the current owners of the airport so things like purchase price for the airport will require to be resolved in terms of the negotiation."The minister defended the government's decision to step in to buy the airport, saying it was the "only realistic alternative to closure".She explained that, once the airport was in public ownership, there would be a detailed business case made that would include levels of investment and a timescale on turning around its fortunes.Ms Sturgeon added: "With the right financial investment, with the right commercial management, the right marketing over a period of time, Prestwick can be brought back into profit."The Scottish government's bid to buy Prestwick comes just months after struggling Cardiff Airport was sold to the Welsh government for £52m.Although publicly owned, Cardiff Airport is being managed by an "at arm's length" body rather than by the government, and "on a commercial basis".In a ministerial statement to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said the closure of Prestwick would be a "serious and unwelcome development" for the Ayrshire and Scottish economies, with about 1,400 jobs linked directly or indirectly with the airport.Infratil has agreed to ensure the airport is kept fully open and operational during the negotiation process with the government.The only scheduled passenger airline at Prestwick, Ryanair, welcomed the likely government takeover.</body>

      <title>Sir Menzies to stand down in 2015</title>

      <date>1381333574</date>
      <body>Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell has announced he will stand down as an MP at the next general election, due in May 2015.Sir Menzies, or Ming as he is widely known, said he had written to Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg to inform him of his decision.He has served as MP for North East Fife since 1987 and was leader of the Lib Dems from 2006-07.Sir Menzies said it had been "an enormous privilege" to serve as an MP.During his career representing his "wonderful" Scottish constituency, he said: "My wife and I have made many friends and have been supported by constituents of all political persuasions and none."It is always a regret to begin the process of retiring from the House of Commons but I believe now is the time to start."Mr Clegg said Sir Menzies was "a towering presence" in British politics and had "served this country and our party with unparalleled distinction"."As well as being an outstanding leader, Sir Menzies is a brilliant orator and someone who commands both attention and affection from all sides of the House in Westminster."Of his many achievements in politics, I suspect he will be most vividly remembered for his passionate and articulate opposition to the war in Iraq."Sir Menzies told the BBC he was leaving because of his age. He will be 80 when the next Parliament is due to end."I have had a good innings but it's time to give someone else a go," he told the BBC News Channel's chief political correspondent Norman Smith.He had contemplated leaving Parliament after he resigned as Liberal Democrat leader, he added.There is speculation that Sir Menzies will be offered a place in the House of Lords.Sir Menzies first stood as a candidate for the Liberal Democrats seat in 1976, but did not win his constituency for 11 years.He had originally intended to stand for two Parliaments, he told the BBC, but he has now have served in six Parliaments.In his first career as a sprinter, he held the UK 100m record from 1967 to 1974 and ran in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.He later became a QC, and spoke for his party on foreign affairs, defence and Europe for more than a decade.Earlier this year, he was included in the Queen's Birthday Honours list, which cited him as "one of the most respected politicians of his generation"."It is a complete surprise. I am delighted and honoured," he said at the time."Other contemporary holders include Lord Coe and Judi Dench, and it is a privilege to join such company."</body>

      <title>More energy price rises expected</title>
      <description>Consumer groups predict that the UK's other major energy suppliers will raise prices after SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24475868</url>
      <date>1381419415</date>
      <body>Consumer groups are predicting that the UK's other major energy suppliers will raise prices after SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills.SSE said its average annual dual fuel energy bill would rise by £106 to £1,380 on 15 November.One industry expert described the move as "the final nail in the coffin for affordable energy", but SSE said that many costs were beyond its control.The decision prompted fevered political debate over who to blame for the rise.Citizens Advice is expecting an "avalanche" of increases but has called on the other energy firms to freeze prices."This price rise will be a blow for stretched budgets," said the charity's chief executive Gillian Guy."I hope other energy firms show an understanding of their customers' financial situation by not raising their prices this winter."Many households are facing a daily battle try to make their frozen incomes cover mounting energy, food and travel costs. Further increases will push people into poverty."SSE said that 8.2% was an average rise. Customers in the North of England and central Scotland would see the smallest increase, of 7%, in their dual fuel price. Customers in the South East of England would see the biggest, up 9.7%.It added that the rise reflected higher costs of buying wholesale energy and paying to deliver it to customers' homes, plus government levies.The move has amplified political debate about the issue of energy bills.Labour leader Ed Miliband, who pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election, described SSE's price rise as a "scandal". He accused the government of "letting energy companies get away with this".But Prime Minister David Cameron branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas.SSE's price rises will affect about 4.4 million domestic electricity customers and 2.9 million domestic gas customers.One of those customers is Gary Waywell, from Somerset, who has been a SSE customer for eight years.He said he was surprised by the size of the price rise and angry at the timing just before winter."I can hardly go to my boss and say, 'would you mind giving me an extra £16 a week for the winter. I don't think he is going to smile at that," he said.SSE's Will Morris said he understood customers' frustration."We're sorry we have to do this," he said."We've done as much as we could to keep prices down, but the reality is that buying wholesale energy in global markets, delivering it to customers' homes, and government-imposed levies collected through bills - endorsed by all the major parties - all cost more than they did last year."SSE, made up of Southern Electric, Swalec and Scottish Hydro, said that for a typical dual-fuel customer, wholesale energy prices had gone up 4%, paying to use delivery networks was 10% more expensive, and government levies were 13% higher.Up to 11% of a customer's bill goes on government programmes to save energy, reduce emissions and tackle climate change, according to regulator Ofgem. SSE said it wanted this to be included in general taxation, rather than added to bills.However, Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: "Half of an average energy bill is made up of the wholesale cost of energy. This far outweighs the proportion of a bill that goes to help vulnerable households with their bills and to cut energy waste."SSE's announcement comes about a year after the last set of gas and electricity price rises.Between August and December 2012, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%.Ann Robinson, from price comparison website Uswitch, which could benefit from consumers swapping suppliers, said: "This is a crippling blow for consumers, who are still reeling from last winter's price hike. Adding to an already sky-high energy bill will leave consumers buckling under the pressure. It's the final nail in the coffin for affordable energy."Of course the danger now is that the other big six suppliers will follow suit. This raises the spectre of yet more households forced to cut back on their heating."The latest calculations from the regulator found that the average profit margin made by an energy supplier on an average £1,315 bill is £65.SSE, formerly Scottish and Southern Energy, said it expected its annual profit margin to average about 5% over a three-to-five-year period, which it believed was "a fair amount".It said its profit margin was 4.2% in the 2012-13 financial year and was expected to fall short of the 5% target again this year."We know we will come in for a great deal of criticism for this decision and politicians will no doubt be lining up to condemn us," said SSE's Mr Morris."But over many years, policymakers themselves have failed to highlight adequately the cost to consumers of the policies they have pursued in government."They can't expect to have power stations replaced with new technologies, the network to be upgraded and nationwide energy efficiency schemes all to be funded for free."And as an energy provider, we are in the unenviable position of having to pass this cost on to consumers through energy bills."The BBC understands that the government is prepared to look at easing green taxes on smaller energy companies. These costs include paying for measures to save energy, reduce emissions and tackle climate change, and also include the cost of social programmes to help vulnerable customers.At present, companies with 250,000 customers are liable to pay the green levy.This threshold could be changed in order to encourage smaller energy companies to enter the market and challenge the big six. Only three smaller energy firms are operating in the UK at the moment.</body>

      <body>Threatened industrial action by ScotRail train drivers looks set to be called off after the union Aslef said it would recommend a new pay offer.Aslef members have been holding a ballot over action short of a strike, which could severely disrupt Sunday rail services in Scotland.But the union is now backing a ScotRail offer to raise pay by 4% this year and 3.4% in 2014.Train drivers currently earn an average of just under £40,000 a year.Two previous pay offers have been rejected by Aslef members.Aslef's director for Scotland, Kevin Lindsay, told BBC Scotland: "We are currently holding a ballot for action short of a strike, and the result is due on 17 October."However, my executive committee will make a decision next week on whether this offer is acceptable or whether to go ahead with the action."My recommendation is that we call off the action and hold a referendum with our members over the pay offer."Aslef, which counts most of ScotRail's 1,100 train drivers as members, said industrial action would involve an overtime ban which would hit Sunday services.First ScotRail welcomed the pay deal, which runs until 31 March, 2015.A spokesman said: "It secures the long-term stability for the travelling public as it runs until the end of the current ScotRail franchise."Common sense prevailed today, and we welcome the swift resolution which delivers the best possible outcome for the staff and customers."</body>

      <title>Building firms set up blacklist fund</title>
      <description>Some of the biggest firms in the construction industry are to compensate thousands of workers who were blacklisted from working on building sites.</description>

      <body>Some of the biggest firms in the construction industry are to compensate workers who were blacklisted from working on building sites.Trade unions say thousands of people on the list were denied work for years.The eight companies have apologised for their involvement with an organisation that kept the list but have not admitted liability.The blacklist was uncovered following a raid by the Information Commissioner's Office in 2009.It found that dozens of construction firms had been checking potential employees against a blacklist which contained details of about 3,200 workers.The list was held by a company called The Consulting Association (TCA).While most on it were members of unions, some had simply raised health and safety concerns on sites.In a statement, the companies - Balfour Beatty, Carillion, Costain, Kier, Laing O'Rourke, Sir Robert McAlpine, Skanska UK and Vinci - said they all apologised "for their involvement with TCA and the impact that its database may have had on any individual construction worker"."At this time we are not able to share any further information on the proposed scheme," they added.While the construction firms have not admitted liability for any involvement in blacklisting, they are asking unions to work with them to establish a compensation scheme.They added that they would support the introduction of a code of conduct "to ensure nothing like this can happen within the industry again".Justin Bowden, national officer for the GMB union, said the next step for the companies was to "clean up and pay up"."The victims and their families will either be fairly compensated including the offer of jobs or GMB will ensure justice for its members through the High Court," he said.The union also called for a new code of practice for the construction industry covering how it employs people.Another union, Unite, described the proposals as "encouraging", but said unions and employers needed to "thrash out the details".Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said: "It must be a priority to get blacklisted workers back into work. Unite is calling on contractors to employ and where relevant, support the up-skilling of blacklisted workers."Many of these workers have spent years out of work as a result of being blacklisted. Employers have a moral duty to give them back the jobs that were wrongly taken away from them."</body>

      <title>Rooney turned down Scotland - Vogts</title>
      <description>England star Wayne Rooney rejected the chance to play for Scotland as a 16-year-old, former Scots boss Berti Vogts reveals.</description>

      <date>1381400560</date>
      <body>England striker Wayne Rooney turned down the chance to play for Scotland as a 16-year-old, former national coach Berti Vogts has revealed.German Vogts, who managed Scotland between 2002 and 2004, says Rooney qualified for the team because his grandmother is Scottish."I spoke to him - a young lad of 16 years of age. I said to him 'you can play for Scotland'," explained Vogts."You have to speak to the player but he told me 'I'm sorry boss, I'm English'."Rooney, 27, made his England debut in February 2003, aged 17, and has scored 36 goals in 84 international appearances.Vogts, now in charge of Azerbaijan, made the trip to Merseyside to speak to the teenage Rooney, who was playing under his present Manchester United boss David Moyes at Everton."The Scottish Football Association found the grandmother and I made the call," recalled Vogts."I flew from Glasgow to Everton. He was playing under David Moyes at Everton and I spoke to him."Explaining Rooney's reaction, the German coach beat his chest theatrically and said: "(Rooney told me) 'I am English, I am English!' OK, sorry."Vogts had been asked about the issue of national eligibility following the debate surrounding United's young winger Adnan Januzaj.The 18-year-old scored two goals on Saturday as Manchester United came from behind to win 2-1 at Sunderland, and is being tracked by a number of national teams - Belgium, Serbia, Albania, Turkey and potentially England in the future on the basis of his residency.Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere said this week that living in England for five years "doesn't make you English," but Vogts, who won the World Cup as a player with Germany in 1974, sees no problem with it."It's a Fifa rule. We have to accept it. It is not only in Great Britain but also here in Azerbaijan," he said, speaking at a news conference ahead of his side's World Cup qualifier against Northern Ireland.</body>

      <body>Midfielder Morgaro Gomis has returned for a second spell at Dundee United on a deal until the end of the season.France-born Gomis, 27, left Birmingham City in the summer after signing for the Midlands club from United in 2011.During his previous spell on Tayside he played 180 games, scoring seven goals and was a member of the Scottish Cup-winning team in 2010."The opportunity to get back playing at Dundee United makes me very happy," said Gomis.A product of the Chelsea youth system, Gomis made his full international debut for Senegal in March 2009 while playing for United.Formerly with Montpellier, he had brief stays at several English non-league clubs before moving to Scotland with Cowdenbeath.He has been training with United since September and has impressed manager Jackie McNamara with his approach."I know United fans will have great affection for Morgaro for what he achieved here previously but I have decided to offer him a contract based on what he has shown me over the last five weeks in training," said McNamara."His attitude, application and professionalism has been first class and added to the fact that he has excellent ability makes signing him an easy decision."Having him as part of the squad will allow me to select alternative tactics and formations at certain grounds and he brings great experience to the squad."This signing is very much about making the squad stronger and the length of deal will allow Morgaro and the club to see how the partnership can develop going forward."Gomis first moved to Tanandice in 2007, having done well in his four months at Cowdenbeath."After initially being offered the chance to keep my fitness level up, I have been impressed by the quality within the squad and have been welcomed by everyone," he explained."I have great memories of Tannadice but I want to help create more good times for the club."</body>

      <body>Striker Jordan Rhodes has withdrawn from the Scotland squad for next week's match with Croatia.The 23-year-old, who has scored nine goals for Blackburn this season, misses the final World Cup qualifier due to a groin injury.Rhodes has scored three goals in 11 international games but has only started once under manager Gordon Strachan.No replacement has been called up for Tuesday's meeting at Hampden.Rhodes also missed Scotland's last match, the 2-1 victory over Macedonia in Skopje last month, after being sent home with a hand injury sustained in training.Strachan had previously suggested that the forward was unsuited to a lone striker role.However, when naming his squad, the manager hinted heavily at a starting role for Rhodes against Croatia."Losing Jordan is a real blow," said assistant manager Mark McGhee."The manager feels a little bit frustrated that he's not been able to give Jordan a real opportunity."Jordan might have got that chance this time around and now he's out."Strachan used Wolves' Leigh Griffiths then Everton's Steven Naismith to lead the attack in the World Cup qualifiers against Belgium and Macedonia in September, while George Boyd and Ross McCormack are the other listed forwards in the squad.Shaun Maloney and Steven Fletcher were already missing through injury and Steven Whittaker is suspended.Robert Snodgrass, who scored when Scotland beat Croatia away in June, has yet to join the squad since his wife is expecting a baby but Ikechi Anya, who was a doubt with a thigh injury, has been training.</body>

      <title>Why did Nelson Mandela thank Glasgow?</title>
      <description>Why did Nelson Mandela thank Glasgow?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-22976781</url>
      <date>1381306559</date>
      <body>Three years after his release from almost three decades in prison, Nelson Mandela went to Glasgow to thank the city for its support in the fight against apartheid in his native South Africa.Nelson Mandela praised the "Citizens of Glasgow" for being the first to offer him the Freedom of the City, at a time more than a decade earlier when many others were still condemning him as a terrorist for his role in challenging the system of racial segregation in his home country.In a speech at the City Chambers in Glasgow on 9 October 1993, he said: "While we were physically denied our freedom in the country of our birth, a city 6,000 miles away, and as renowned as Glasgow, refused to accept the legitimacy of the apartheid system, and declared us to be free."Mandela's visit to Scotland's largest city in 1993, the year before he became president of the Republic of South Africa, was the culmination of a long association between people in the city and his campaign for freedom, which began when he was imprisoned in 1962.Scottish anti-apartheid activist Brian Filling campaigned from the 1960s against the system in South Africa which allowed the white minority to oppress the majority black inhabitants.He had joined the campaign when his parents got to know the English theatre director Cecil Williams, who had allowed Mandela to pretend to be his chauffeur and had been in the car with him when he was arrested.Mandela had been convicted of charges including conspiring to commit acts of sabotage and guerrilla warfare for the purpose of violent revolution.However, the trial was condemned by the United Nations Security Council and nations around the world.Mr Filling says that, despite some of the dreadful things happening in South Africa in 1960s and 70s, it was "not fashionable to be associated with Mandela because he was widely regarded and reported in our media as a terrorist".However in 1981, Glasgow Council decided to set its face against this opinion and awarded Mandela the Freedom of the City.Mr Filling remembers that just a couple of years earlier the previous Lord Provost of Glasgow, David Hodge, had hosted a lunch with the South African ambassador, which had sparked a protest outside the City Chambers and a threat by catering staff not to prepare the food.He says: "The incoming Lord Provost, Michael Kelly, partly as a reaction to all this, wanted to give the freedom of the city to Nelson Mandela."Dr Kelly says: "It was a bold step for the Labour Party in Glasgow because Mandela was regarded as a terrorist by a lot of people and many people thought Glasgow should not become involved in this at all."So it was an uphill struggle and we received a lot of bad publicity, but eventually when Mandela's story got through people began to see that we and he were in the right."Glasgow's promotion of Mandela's cause quickly led to other cities following suit and within a year Kelly had launched a declaration for the release of Nelson Mandela. It went on to gain support from 2,500 mayors from 56 countries around the world.The declaration got the backing of the United Nations in New York and Dr Kelly, on behalf of the city of Glasgow, had the "privilege" of being invited to speak first in support of the petition.In 1986, Glasgow brought more attention to the jailed freedom fighter by changing the name of St George's Place in the city centre to Nelson Mandela Place.The name change was made more significant by the fact that the South African consulate-general was based on the fifth floor of the Stock Exchange building, at an address which now bore the name of the country's most famous political prisoner.By now the efforts to free Mandela had become mainstream with global pop stars such as Jim Kerr, from Glasgow band Simple Minds, writing songs and playing concerts in support of his freedom.International pressure, in the form of sanctions against the South African regime, eventually led to Mandela's release.At the age of 71, Mandela was freed on 11 February 1990 after 27 years in prison.During the 1980s he had been given the Freedom of the City by nine UK regions - Aberdeen, Dundee, Greenwich, Islwyn in Gwent, Kingston Upon Hull, Midlothian, Newcastle, Sheffield and, of course, Glasgow.It was the city which was chosen to host Mandela as he arrived to accept all these awards in October 1993.Brian Filling, who set up the 1993 trip and spent two years getting agreement from all the other cities that Glasgow should be the venue, says: "He was very appreciative of the people of Britain for their support, rather than the government - which seemed to hold out against imposing sanctions on South Africa."I think there is a special place in terms of his heart and mind for the people of Scotland."Dr Kelly was able to ask Mandela if he knew about Glasgow awarding him the freedom of the city back in 1981, while he was locked up on Robben Island.The former lord provost says: "He confirmed there was a grapevine and through that he'd received these snippets of information. So at the time he had known about the award, and it kept him and his fellow prisoners going."Mr Filling says there had always been a concern about whether the man he had campaigned to free for so many years would live up to the "legend"."But in fact, he did. If anything, he was even greater than he had been imagined."</body>

      <title>CSI Scotland: How forensics caught Peter Tobin</title>
      <description>How forensics caught serial killer Peter Tobin</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-24430345</url>
      <date>1381273998</date>
      <body>The discovery of the body of young Polish woman Angelika Kluk hidden under the floorboards of a Glasgow church led to one of the most high-profile forensics investigations in recent years. Senior Forensic Scientist Carol Weston was the woman who gathered the evidence which would eventually catch serial killer Peter Tobin.Angelika Kluk, a 23-year-old languages student, went missing in September 2006. She had last been seen in the grounds of St Patrick's Roman Catholic Church in the Anderston area of Glasgow.Days later her body was found hidden below a small wooden hatch in the floor of the church, her hands were tied and she was covered by a tarpaulin.The chief investigating officer on the case, Det Supt David Swindle, tells the BBC's Crime Scene Scotland the way she was found showed a "total disrespect for human life".Det Supt Swindle says he was "mindful of removing the body without disturbing evidence" and so he called in a specialist forensics team. The key person was Carol Weston.Ms Weston, 39, says she felt "very strongly" that Angelika's body should not be moved and samples should be taken "in situ"."So I wanted to actually go under the floorboards down beside the body so I could get the maximum amount of forensic evidence," she says.However, the entrance to the hatch containing the body was very small and it was "bisected" by a beam.The team discussed cutting the beam but instead it was decided that Ms Weston would squeeze in through the hole beside the body."The first thing we had to do was remove the items which were obscuring the body, which was a tarpaulin and a black bin bag with items in it," says Ms Weston."At first we were worried because they smelt so strongly of decomposing matter."We were worried there were perhaps other body parts or something else down there biological."But it turned out it was very heavily blood-stained clothing, a towel and what, in our opinion, was the murder weapon used to stab Angelika - a knife."Angelika had suffered a "very violent death", with multiple stab wounds to the head and body.Her clothing was in disarray, suggesting a sexual motive for the attack.Ms Weston says: "Eventually we did take all her clothing off in situ."The reason for that was to preserve anything that was on the clothing."Once Angelika had been stripped we could look at moving the body."She adds: "I thought the whole examination would take an hour. I was shocked when I came out from the floorboards and realised how long I had actually been there - three and a half hours."The earth beneath Angelika's body had to be laid out in grids, removed and sieved in case there was something significant buried in the soil. Key exhibits were logged. The pathologist took "intimate samples", which would prove any sexual activity.Ms Weston says it is only after all the work is complete that there is time to deal with human aspect of her job.She says: "You have finished your examination, stopped thinking so much just as a scientist and that's when it becomes a bit real."You are always very aware that you are dealing with somebody's daughter, somebody's brother. It's not some evidence. It is always a person."The last man to see Angelika alive had been the church handyman, who was known as Patrick McLaughlin.He quickly became the police's prime suspect but evidence was needed.Officers had been unable to find where the murder had taken place.Angelika had last been seen at the garage attached to the church parish house but at first there was no evidence of a violent murder.Crime scene examiner Michael Young says: "It was not obvious to anyone there was anything in there."I remember Carol finding a very tiny blood spot within the garage and she put a highlighter around it."Then she found another one and another and I remember standing back and seeing the fine spray."At first the spray was not visible because of the dark red sandstone brick but then they traced evidence of "impact spatter blood spots", which are produced when someone is beaten or struck or kicked."As soon as we found these blood spots we knew we had the right place," Ms Weston says.It took four days to painstakingly log every item in the garage.Having found evidence of the crime being committed they still needed to link their prime suspect to the murder.Seminal fluid inside Angelika's body indicated that she had sexual intercourse about the time she was murdered.Ms Weston was confident that swabs of the fluid would be able to give her a DNA profile which would match with the Scottish DNA database, which contains about 280,000 profiles.But, surprisingly, there was no hit on the database.Ms Weston says: "It is your worst nightmare. You do a lot of work. You get a profile and you've got no name."The murder was in Scotland, the prime suspect was Scottish, so a hit in England seemed remote.However, the English database came back with the name Peter Tobin, who had been convicted of a sex offence in Hampshire in 1993 and released in 2003.Fingerprint evidence from the bin bag and tarpaulin was also linked back to Tobin.There was also a wooden table leg with blood on it found in the garden of the church.The hunt was on for Tobin and he was discovered by chance when a nurse at a hospital in London recognised his picture in the media.When Tobin was arrested he was wearing a T-shirt which was stained on the lower front.The staining proved to be a mixture of his semen and cellular material matching Angelika Kluk.In May 2007, Tobin was found guilty of raping and murdering Angelika.Judge Lord Menzies said Tobin should serve a minimum of 21 years, describing him as "an evil man".The case later helped link Tobin to the murders of two other young women: Vicky Hamilton and Dinah McNicol.Crime Scenes Scotland: Forensics squad is one BBC One Scotland on Wednesday 9 October at 22:35.</body>

      <title>Illegal migrants face new crackdown</title>
      <description>Illegal immigrants will find it harder to set up home in the UK under planned new laws, says Home Secretary Theresa May.</description>

      <body>Illegal immigrants will find it harder to set up home in the UK under planned laws, says Home Secretary Theresa May.The Immigration Bill would force private landlords to quiz tenants about their immigration status and restrict access to bank accounts for people in the country without permission.It also aims to streamline the appeals process in immigration cases.Labour said the bill did nothing about bigger problems like the "shambolic" state of UK border controls.The bill, which is expected to become law in spring 2014, subject to approval by MPs, will include measures to allow the UK to "deport foreign criminals first and hear their appeal later" when there is "no risk of serious irreversible harm".BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani says this could lead to an increase in air fare costs for the Home Office, if it has to fly back migrants who are successful in their appeal.A requirement is also included for temporary migrants, such as overseas students, to make a contribution to the National Health Service to prevent so-called "health tourism".Other new measures in the bill include:Immigration minister Mark Harper said: "The Immigration Bill will stop migrants using public services to which they are not entitled, reduce the pull factors which encourage people to come to the UK and make it easier to remove people who should not be here."We will continue to welcome the brightest and best migrants who want to contribute to our economy and society and play by the rules. But the law must be on the side of people who respect it, not those who break it."Mrs May said the measures were about "making it harder for people who are here illegally to stay here".She said it was a "point of principle" that people who used public services should be expected to contribute to them, but she would not comment on the cost to the country of "health tourism".She denied claims that forcing private landlords to check the immigration status of prospective tenants would be unworkable, saying they would just be "required to ask some simple questions" in the same way that employers have to do when interviewing workers.But an organisation representing private and public sector landlords said the measures would "make it much harder for non-British people to access housing even when they have a legal right to live in the UK".Gavin Smart, director of policy and practice at the Chartered Institute of Housing, said: "Checking immigration status is complicated so landlords may shy away from letting to anyone who appears not to be British."Don Flynn, director of Migrants' Rights Network, criticised moves to restrict access to the NHS, saying: "There are very small numbers of migrants who come here with pre-existing health conditions and find themselves registering with the health service."I simply do not believe there is any significant evidence that something like the NHS is a pull factor."The British Medical Association (BMA) is also critical of the plans.Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chairman of the BMA's GPs committee, told BBC Radio 5live there is already a system in place for hospitals to recover the cost of treating patients who are ineligible for NHS care."Clearly that could be improved, but introducing a system for general practice could be a bureaucratic nightmare," he said."The reality is people don't come to the UK to use the NHS, they're more likely to come to work in the NHS."Labour said there was nothing in the bill to tackle problems at the UK's "increasingly shambolic" border controls or to deal with "long delays in getting electronic checks in place, or the UKBA (UK Border Agency) bureaucratic failings that have prevented foreign criminals being deported".Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: "It doesn't seem to address some of the serious issues around border control and some of the problems about exploitation of immigration in the labour market, particularly low-skill immigration, which has caused concerns about jobs and wages."Campaign group the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants welcomed what it claimed was a "climb down" by the Home Office, which had not included in the bill proposals to introduce immigration checks by GPs.It said the new proposals would deter students from wanting to study in the UK but would have "no impact whatsoever on 'illegal' immigration - the declared intention of this bill".UKIP said "pressganging landlords, doctors and private citizens under the threat of sanctions to carry out the work of border agencies is simply wrong" and the government needed to treat the cause of immigration problems rather than the symptoms.And Bill Walker, of the Institute of Directors, warned that some of the government's rhetoric was starting to make the UK "look unwelcoming and hostile to the people on whom our export markets depend".The Conservatives say they want to reduce net migration from non-EU countries - the difference between the number of people emigrating and arriving in the UK - to less than 100,000 a year.But the latest Office for National Statistics figures show net migration rose to 176,000 in the year ending December 2012 - up from 153,000 people in the year to September 2012 - appearing to buck the recent downward trend.There are no official estimates of the number of illegal immigrants in the UK. A 2009 study by the London School of Economics produced an estimate of 618,000 but the Migration Watch pressure group said this under-estimated the number of people who had overstayed their visas and the true figure was more like 1.1 million.</body>

      <title>Royal Mail sale: Small bids favoured</title>
      <description>Investors who applied for £750 worth of Royal Mail shares will receive their full allocation, the BBC has learned.</description>

      <body>Small investors will be favoured in the privatisation of the Royal Mail, at the expense of those seeking a large allocation, the BBC has learned.Anyone who subscribed for the minimum entitlement of £750 will receive 100% of their application, according to BBC business editor Robert Peston.But those who have applied for £10,000 worth of shares or more, will not receive any, he said.Demand for Royal Mail shares far outstripped the supply.Robert Peston said: "A government source said to me that ministers wanted to reward the Mrs Migginses, but not the big professional investors."Royal Mail's shares will be priced at 330p, which is at the top end of what the government was hoping for and values the entire Royal Mail at £3.3bn.Shares were initially priced between 260p and 330p, but strong demand led the government to revise the figures upwards on Friday last week.There were more than 700,000 individual applications for shares, which far outstripped the value of shares available.Retail investors could apply for up to £10,000 worth of Royal Mail shares online, but could bid for a much bigger allocation if they applied through a stock broker.But the government has decided to favour more modest investors and any applications seeking more than £10,000 worth of shares will receive none.The applications indicate that individual investors had about £4bn to spend on Royal Mail shares, which is much more than the £517m worth of shares on offer.Applications for shares from professional investors also far outstripped the amount allocated to them.Our business editor says that combined, individual and professional investors may have had £15bn available to invest.He also said that individual investors could be allotted as much as 33% of the total shares on offer, up from the original amount of 30%, while professional investors could expect their share to be reduced slightly to 67%.The government will sell 52.2% of the company, the maximum it was prepared to sell at this stage, he adds.That puts the value for the Treasury of the privatisation at £1.7bn.Full trading in Royal Mail shares begins next Tuesday on the London Stock Exchange.However, investors have been able to speculate on the value of Royal Mail ahead of the official start of trading on what is known as the grey market.Financial bookmaker IG Index says that, as of Thursday morning, orders placed by its clients indicate Royal Mail shares could be worth between 405p and 425p each.However, that is just an indication and the market may react differently next week.Under the terms of the share sale, a 10% stake in the business has been reserved for Royal Mail employees.Members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) are voting on whether to strike over the government's privatisation plan.The ballot closes on 16 October and strike action could begin as early as 23 October.Royal Mail says the fundraising will provide it with the money needed to modernise and compete in a competitive parcels market.Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna criticised the government on Monday for "short-changing" taxpayers.In particular, Labour says the privatisation may be undervaluing Royal Mail's property, some of which is in prime locations.However, on Wednesday, Business Secretary Vince Cable told a parliamentary committee: "We're confident that it's priced in the right place".</body>

      <title>More energy price rises expected</title>
      <description>Consumer groups predict that the UK's other major energy suppliers will raise prices after SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24475868</url>
      <date>1381419415</date>
      <body>Consumer groups are predicting that the UK's other major energy suppliers will raise prices after SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills.SSE said its average annual dual fuel energy bill would rise by £106 to £1,380 on 15 November.One industry expert described the move as "the final nail in the coffin for affordable energy", but SSE said that many costs were beyond its control.The decision prompted fevered political debate over who to blame for the rise.Citizens Advice is expecting an "avalanche" of increases but has called on the other energy firms to freeze prices."This price rise will be a blow for stretched budgets," said the charity's chief executive Gillian Guy."I hope other energy firms show an understanding of their customers' financial situation by not raising their prices this winter."Many households are facing a daily battle try to make their frozen incomes cover mounting energy, food and travel costs. Further increases will push people into poverty."SSE said that 8.2% was an average rise. Customers in the North of England and central Scotland would see the smallest increase, of 7%, in their dual fuel price. Customers in the South East of England would see the biggest, up 9.7%.It added that the rise reflected higher costs of buying wholesale energy and paying to deliver it to customers' homes, plus government levies.The move has amplified political debate about the issue of energy bills.Labour leader Ed Miliband, who pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election, described SSE's price rise as a "scandal". He accused the government of "letting energy companies get away with this".But Prime Minister David Cameron branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas.SSE's price rises will affect about 4.4 million domestic electricity customers and 2.9 million domestic gas customers.One of those customers is Gary Waywell, from Somerset, who has been a SSE customer for eight years.He said he was surprised by the size of the price rise and angry at the timing just before winter."I can hardly go to my boss and say, 'would you mind giving me an extra £16 a week for the winter. I don't think he is going to smile at that," he said.SSE's Will Morris said he understood customers' frustration."We're sorry we have to do this," he said."We've done as much as we could to keep prices down, but the reality is that buying wholesale energy in global markets, delivering it to customers' homes, and government-imposed levies collected through bills - endorsed by all the major parties - all cost more than they did last year."SSE, made up of Southern Electric, Swalec and Scottish Hydro, said that for a typical dual-fuel customer, wholesale energy prices had gone up 4%, paying to use delivery networks was 10% more expensive, and government levies were 13% higher.Up to 11% of a customer's bill goes on government programmes to save energy, reduce emissions and tackle climate change, according to regulator Ofgem. SSE said it wanted this to be included in general taxation, rather than added to bills.However, Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: "Half of an average energy bill is made up of the wholesale cost of energy. This far outweighs the proportion of a bill that goes to help vulnerable households with their bills and to cut energy waste."SSE's announcement comes about a year after the last set of gas and electricity price rises.Between August and December 2012, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%.Ann Robinson, from price comparison website Uswitch, which could benefit from consumers swapping suppliers, said: "This is a crippling blow for consumers, who are still reeling from last winter's price hike. Adding to an already sky-high energy bill will leave consumers buckling under the pressure. It's the final nail in the coffin for affordable energy."Of course the danger now is that the other big six suppliers will follow suit. This raises the spectre of yet more households forced to cut back on their heating."The latest calculations from the regulator found that the average profit margin made by an energy supplier on an average £1,315 bill is £65.SSE, formerly Scottish and Southern Energy, said it expected its annual profit margin to average about 5% over a three-to-five-year period, which it believed was "a fair amount".It said its profit margin was 4.2% in the 2012-13 financial year and was expected to fall short of the 5% target again this year."We know we will come in for a great deal of criticism for this decision and politicians will no doubt be lining up to condemn us," said SSE's Mr Morris."But over many years, policymakers themselves have failed to highlight adequately the cost to consumers of the policies they have pursued in government."They can't expect to have power stations replaced with new technologies, the network to be upgraded and nationwide energy efficiency schemes all to be funded for free."And as an energy provider, we are in the unenviable position of having to pass this cost on to consumers through energy bills."The BBC understands that the government is prepared to look at easing green taxes on smaller energy companies. These costs include paying for measures to save energy, reduce emissions and tackle climate change, and also include the cost of social programmes to help vulnerable customers.At present, companies with 250,000 customers are liable to pay the green levy.This threshold could be changed in order to encourage smaller energy companies to enter the market and challenge the big six. Only three smaller energy firms are operating in the UK at the moment.</body>

      <title>Minister considers gassing badgers</title>
      <description>The government is exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB, environment secretary Owen Paterson tells MPs.</description>

      <date>1381404261</date>
      <body>The government is exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has told MPs.A six week trial of badger culling in Somerset has now ended.But the firm behind it has asked for more time after its marksmen fell short of killing the target of 70% of the badger population.Mr Paterson said the Department for Food and Rural Affairs was looking at other methods including the use of gas.Responding to a question from Green MP Caroline Lucas in the Commons, Mr Paterson said: "Until we can establish vaccines, we have to use the tools used by other sensible countries - which is to remove wildlife - we made it quite clear in our TB strategy we would look at other methods of removing wildlife, and yes we are looking at gassing, but we will not use it unless it is proven to be safe, humane, and effective."Labour MP Barry Sheerman called the badger cull "morally reprehensible" and asked Mr Paterson "why doesn't he resign?" during heated Commons exchanges.Marksmen only managed to shoot 60% of the badgers in the trial area in Somerset, although estimates have been lowered as to how many badgers lived in the region in the first place.The company behind the cull has asked for more time and a similar time extension is being sought for a trial cull Gloucestershire.The government is due to make a decision on extending the culls later this week.Farmers have long blamed badgers for spreading bovine TB in cattle but animal rights groups say evidence does not support this.At one time gassing was the preferred method of culling but it was dropped in favour of shooting, which is seen as more humane.The RSPCA said it was "opposed to the use of gas to control badgers on welfare grounds and believes it is not humane as it may cause badgers to suffer prolonged deaths underground"."We are extremely concerned about the government's admission that they are looking into using gassing to cull badgers," the organisation said in a statement."Culling badgers will not solve the problem of bovine TB in cattle, whatever the method of culling."The possible gassing of badgers adds a further outrageous twist to this misguided policy. The RSPCA will look into reports that badgers have been gassed in and around the pilot cull areas."Martin Surl, Police and Crime Commissioner for Gloucestershire, has warned that plans to extend the cull could stretch police resources in his area.Mr Surl told the the Stroud News and Journal: "My concern is that the cull operators are feeling the pressure and may become more desperate in their attempts to shoot their quota of badgers while the people opposed to the cull are getting equally frustrated, all of which adds up to an unhelpful situation."But Laurence Robertson, Conservative MP for Tewkesbury, dismissed Mr Surl's concerns, accusing him in the Commons of being "publicity-seeking", adding that it was for the government to decide whether to extend the cull.In the trial which has just ended, the plan was to shoot and kill 70% of badgers in the areas of west Somerset and Gloucestershire by free shooting.Across both regions this meant around 5,000 badgers were to be killed in total.But Defra sources said these targets were based on population estimates from 2012 that have proved to be highly inaccurate.Explaining the failure to meet the target on Wednesday, Mr Paterson said: "The badgers moved the goalposts."We're dealing with a wild animal, subject to the vagaries of the weather and disease and breeding patterns."But rock star and campaigner Brian May, a leading opponent of the cull, branded the trial an "utter failure" and described the application for an extension as a "farce"."They were warned this would happen and they did not listen to the scientists," he added.</body>

      <title>Royal Household sees income rise</title>

      <body>The Royal Household generated more than £11.6m in income in 2012-13, up from £7.5m in 2007-08, the National Audit Office has reported.But 39% of occupied Royal palaces were in worse condition than had been aimed for, the report said.The report was prepared for the Public Accounts Committee, which will look at Royal finances on Monday.The Sovereign Grant, which funds the Queen's spending as Head of State, will rise in 2014 from £36.1m to £37.9m.The report said that the household had used its reserves to fund official activities in recent years and as of 31 March, the Sovereign Grant Reserve stood at £1m.The report asked whether that amount is "adequate to meet unexpected costs".It said that Royal Household income had increased due to the commercial letting of properties and by using its facilities for commercial events - measures that had previously been recommended by the Public Accounts Committee.And the report said that between 1991-92 and 2011-12, the Household reduced spending by 55% in response to decreases in funding.It said the net expenditure in 2011-12 was £32.9m, compared to an equivalent of £72.6m in 1991-92.The way the Royal Family is funded was changed on 1 April 2012, in the first major overhaul of how it is financed for 250 years.Previously, the Civil List - which dated back to 1760 - met the official expenses of the Royal Household and separate grants were paid to cover things such as travel and maintenance of palaces.That was replaced by the Sovereign Grant, which is a single payment given to the monarch based on 15% of the Crown Estate's revenue from two years previously.This funding arrangement will last seven years before it is reviewed.The Crown Estate has a property portfolio which includes, among other things, Regent Street in central London, Windsor Great Park and much of the UK coastline.Also under the changed funding structure, the Civil List reserve was transferred into the Sovereign Grant Reserve.</body>

      <title>Snowden leaks damaging, says Clegg</title>
      <description>Leaked intelligence material published by the Guardian has damaged the UK, but it is legitimate to debate the security services' work, says Nick Clegg.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24476047</url>
      <date>1381410210</date>
      <body>The publication of sensitive information about UK intelligence programmes has been damaging, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has said.Mr Clegg said stories in the Guardian about GCHQ "would have been of immense interest to people who want harm".There was however a legitimate debate to be had about the use of mass surveillance programmes, he added.His comments came after the Guardian vowed to publish more leaks from US ex-intelligence worker Edward Snowden.Speaking on his weekly LBC radio phone-in, Mr Clegg said he had "no doubt" that some of the information published by the newspaper "would have been of immense interest to people who want harm".But he added that the development by the agencies of powerful new communications surveillance techniques raised wider issues of concern.He said: "I think there is a totally legitimate debate to be had - and my experience speaking to people in the intelligence agencies is they recognise this - about the use of these new, incredibly powerful technologies."We have regulations that were designed for an age which is quite different now."Both terrorists and states and security agencies now conduct this battle online in a way that was unimaginable just a few years ago."What that means for privacy and proportionality, that is a totally legitimate area of debate. How you hold the secret parts of any state to account is an incredibly important issue.Mr Clegg backed the security services' calls for a measure of secrecy, which he said was necessary to keep Britain safe.But, he said, "you can only really make secrecy legitimate in the eyes of the public if there is proper form of accountability".His comments came after the director general of MI5, Andrew Parker, warned in a speech that the disclosure of the "reach and limits" of GCHQ's capabilities was a "gift" to terrorists.Mr Parker dismissed suggestions that the agencies were trawling through people's private lives for anything that looked interesting as "utter nonsense".Responding to Mr Parker's criticism, the Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger insisted his newspaper was right to publish the information leaked by US security contractor Edward Snowden.And he said that more would follow as the leaked documents were "slowly and responsibly" worked through.Speaking on a visit to York, Prime Minister David Cameron said that when newspapers get hold of vast amount of information that has been "effectively stolen", they have to "think about their responsibilities and are they helping to keep our country safe".He continued: "To be fair to the Guardian, when I sent the Cabinet Secretary [Sir Jeremy Heywood] to tell them about how dangerous it was to hold this information, they agreed to have a whole lot of it destroyed."They have understood it on some occasions but they need to show understanding about this issue because it does go to our ability to fight terrorism."Meanwhile, Mr Snowden's father Lon arrived in Russia on Thursday to visit his son.Edward Snowden was granted asylum in Russia in August after weeks spent in a transit zone at Moscow airport when the US revoked his travel documents.Lon Snowden said he felt "extreme gratitude that my son is safe and secure and he's free".In the US, Edward Snowden faces charges of theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified intelligence.</body>

      <title>Whitehall warned on 'food confusion'</title>
      <description>The UK's response to the horse meat scandal illustrated the "confusion" surrounding food policy in government, the National Audit Office says in a report.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24461896</url>
      <date>1381369820</date>
      <body>The response to the horsemeat scandal illustrated the "confusion" surrounding food policy in the UK government, the National Audit Office has claimed.A 2010 re-organisation had blurred the division of responsibilities between the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Food Standards Agency, it said.And local authorities had been unsure who had been taking the lead.Officials said intelligence sharing and food monitoring were being improved.Leading British supermarkets recalled processed beef products found to contain horsemeat after the first cases of adulteration came to light in January following an investigation by Ireland's Food Safety Authority.Others took frozen goods off their shelves as a precaution.Since then, tests on 24,480 samples by British food retailers and processors found horsemeat in 47 products, while testing by local authorities of 514 products labelled as containing beef as a major ingredient revealed two containing horse DNA and four with traces of pig DNA.So far three people have been arrested in the UK under the Fraud Act although no-one one has yet been prosecuted.In a report examining the response to the scandal in England, the public spending watchdog found the public's expectations about the authenticity of food were not being matched by the effectiveness of controls in place.Its main findings were:While the Food Safety Agency (FSA) is responsible for food safety issues, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs takes the lead on food authenticity and composition while the Department of Health is in charge of nutritional labelling issues.The National Audit Office's (NAO) criticisms echo those of the Commons Environment Committee, which said in July there had been a "lack of clarity" within Whitehall over where responsibility lay for dealing with such issues."The division of responsibility for food safety and food authenticity has created confusion," Amyas Morse, the watchdog's head, said."The government needs to remove this confusion and improve its understanding of potential food fraud."Labour said there was a case for food safety and food fraud issues to be brought back under one roof."The chaotic structure put in place after the election should be urgently reviewed," Maria Eagle, the shadow environment secretary, said."It is clear from this report that David Cameron's botched departmental re-organisation created confusion about who was responsible for ensuring that meat was not wrongly being passed off as beef."Added to this confusion was the complete failure of ministers to take seriously the possibility that horsemeat was entering the food chain despite clear indications of an increased risk that this was taking place."The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the watchdog was satisfied that controls in place to guarantee food safety were effective but that the government "wanted to prevent food fraud as well"."Defra and the FSA have already identified and begun work on the issues raised by the NAO," a spokeswoman said."We are improving intelligence-sharing and identifying parts of the food chain which need the closest monitoring."Food authenticity testing is making sure that consumers can be confident in the foods they purchase."However, it is important to work more closely with industry and local authorities so that resources can be targeted where they will be most effective."</body>

      <title>Sir Menzies to stand down in 2015</title>
      <description>Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell is to stand down as an MP at the next general election, due in May 2015.</description>

      <body>Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell has announced he will stand down as an MP at the next general election, due in May 2015.Sir Menzies, or Ming as he is widely known, said he had written to Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg to inform him of his decision.He has served as MP for North East Fife since 1987 and was leader of the Lib Dems from 2006-07.Sir Menzies said it had been "an enormous privilege" to serve as an MP.During his career representing his "wonderful" Scottish constituency, he said: "My wife and I have made many friends and have been supported by constituents of all political persuasions and none."It is always a regret to begin the process of retiring from the House of Commons but I believe now is the time to start."Mr Clegg said Sir Menzies was "a towering presence" in British politics and had "served this country and our party with unparalleled distinction"."As well as being an outstanding leader, Sir Menzies is a brilliant orator and someone who commands both attention and affection from all sides of the House in Westminster."Of his many achievements in politics, I suspect he will be most vividly remembered for his passionate and articulate opposition to the war in Iraq."Sir Menzies told the BBC he was leaving because of his age. He will be 80 when the next Parliament is due to end."I have had a good innings but it's time to give someone else a go," he told the BBC News Channel's chief political correspondent Norman Smith.He had contemplated leaving Parliament after he resigned as Liberal Democrat leader, he added.There is speculation that Sir Menzies will be offered a place in the House of Lords.Sir Menzies first stood as a candidate for the Liberal Democrats seat in 1976, but did not win his constituency for 11 years.He had originally intended to stand for two Parliaments, he told the BBC, but he has now have served in six Parliaments.In his first career as a sprinter, he held the UK 100m record from 1967 to 1974 and ran in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.He later became a QC, and spoke for his party on foreign affairs, defence and Europe for more than a decade.Earlier this year, he was included in the Queen's Birthday Honours list, which cited him as "one of the most respected politicians of his generation"."It is a complete surprise. I am delighted and honoured," he said at the time."Other contemporary holders include Lord Coe and Judi Dench, and it is a privilege to join such company."</body>

      <title>Leaders in Commons energy clash</title>
      <description>Ed Miliband says David Cameron has "no answer" to Labour's pledge to freeze energy prices - but David Cameron calls it a "gimmick, not a policy".</description>

      <body>Ed Miliband has said David Cameron has "no answer" to Labour's pledge to freeze energy prices if it wins power, as the two clashed in the Commons.The Labour leader said bills had risen by £300 since 2010 and yet the prime minister was still backing "the energy companies not the consumer".But Mr Cameron called the proposed freeze a "gimmick not a policy".He suggested Mr Miliband wanted to live in a "Marxist universe" where the state could control market prices.Labour's pledge to cap energy price rises for 20 months from May 2015, should they be elected, dominated the leaders' exchanges in the first Prime Minister's Questions since their party conferences.Mr Miliband suggested the prime minister had been left "floundering" by the announcement, arguing it would help 27 million households and nearly two and half million businesses facing rising bills.In contrast, he said the government's pledge to ensure energy companies put consumers on the lowest tariff would leave 90% of people no better off."He says he wants lower prices but prices are going up on his watch. That is the reality," he told MPs."We have a cost of living crisis in this country. Energy bills are rising and he supports the energy companies not the consumer. We have a prime minister who always stand up for the wrong people."But Mr Cameron said energy prices had doubled under Labour and the opposition's support for a target for de-carbonising the energy sector would add another £125 to household bills.Consumers, he added, would not benefit from Labour's initiative as energy prices would increase before and after the price freeze and the solution was increasing competition in the market."I know he would like to live in some sort of Marxist universe where you can control all these things but he needs a basic lesson in economics."He added: "This is not a policy, it is a gimmick. Of course we all want to see lower energy prices - and we are tackling the cause of high prices."Earlier on Wednesday, the government announced plans to cap the amount that some regulated rail fares could rise - one of series of initiatives expected in the coming weeks to help families with pressure on their living standards.The Labour leader said Mr Cameron did not understand an "economic policy is about the cost of living" but the prime minister said Labour's policy to help family finances would lead to higher borrowing, debt and mortgage rates.</body>

      <body>Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has accused the Conservatives of refusing to look "imaginatively" at new ways of tackling the UK's drugs problem."I don't think we're winning the drugs war," Mr Clegg told BBC Three's Free Speech programme."I find it very frustrating that my Conservative coalition partners are not prepared to look more openly" at changing drugs policy, he said.Home Secretary Theresa May has insisted the current approach is working."We keep banging our head against the wall," Mr Clegg continued.But he added: "I don't actually think that waving a magic wand and making everything legal is necessarily the right option."The comments come after Lib Dem ex-transport minister Norman Baker moved to the Home Office in the recent reshuffle.He promised to make Mrs May's department "more liberal" and said he would take an "evidence-based" approach to drugs policy.Labour leader Ed Miliband told Free Speech the answer to the drugs problem lay in better education and prevention measures.He said: "We know the effect of drugs can be harmful and I don't want us to be saying to young people: 'We should legalise drugs, or decriminalise drugs.'"What I do want to say to young people is let's have proper education about drugs in schools so that people understand the dangers of drugs. Let's have early intervention where people are going off the rails through drug use and let's have proper drug treatment."I don't think the answer is decriminalisation or legalisation, I think the answer lies in better education, better prevention and better treatment."In 2012, Mr Clegg backed calls for a royal commission to consider decriminalising illegal drugs, despite opposition from Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron."We can't be complacent, we owe it to the many many children in this country who still get snarled up by drugs, whose education chances are blighted by drugs, whose health is damaged by drugs, we owe it to them to constantly restlessly look for better ways of dealing with the scourge of drugs," he said at the time.Mrs May has said calls for a public debate on what could be done differently are "unnecessary".There were "promising signs" that progress was already being made and the "drugs landscape had been transformed", she added.</body>

      <title>Failings found in border safeguards</title>
      <description>A multi-million pound system used to stop criminals and terror suspects entering the UK is failing to check on a third of passengers, an inspector says.</description>

      <body>A multi-million pound system to stop criminals and terror suspects entering the UK is failing to check on a third of passengers, an inspector has said.John Vine, chief inspector of borders and immigration, said the e-borders scheme had failed to meet its promises.He said airports were not meeting those with terrorist alerts against them on arrival, and "not one person" had been stopped boarding a plane to the UK.Mr Vine noted successes including arrests due to e-borders information.The Home Office said UK border technology was the most advanced in Europe but agreed there was more to do.The total cost of the e-border programme is expected to be £536m from 2007-15, and Mr Vine said a "fundamental re-think" was needed.The scheme, devised by the Home Office in 2003, was meant to improve immigration controls by collecting advanced passenger information (API) on every scheduled inbound and outbound journey to and from the UK.A target was set to collect data on at least 95% of passenger movements by December 2010 but, at the time of the inspection last year, only 65% were being recorded.The report blamed legal difficulties in collecting API on European flights and a failure to test the e-borders concept on train and sea routes.The data was meant to enable staff to "export the border" - preventing passengers from boarding planes to the UK where this was considered a threat.This included people who had previously been deported from the UK, but Mr Vine said "not one person" had been stopped under that system.Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said people with an alert against their name for "terrorist sympathy or activity" should be met at airport arrivals gates by border staff, but that was only being done at Heathrow.The report, which contains 14 recommendations, also criticised the "poor quality" of data on watch lists used by the e-borders system to alert border staff of criminals, terrorists and other suspects.It said this created inefficiencies and a greater volume of work which officials were unable to manage."This, coupled with a policy of prioritising immigration work over customs work, resulted in the deletion... of over 649,000 records concerning potential drug and tobacco smuggling, over a ten-month period," the report said.It said the deletions had a "significant impact on the ability of staff at the border to seize prohibited and restricted goods and deal with those responsible".Inspectors also found the data set was not extensive enough for the e-borders programme to "count in and out" all foreign national passengers - and that this would not be possible until 2018 at the earliest.Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper asked Home Secretary Theresa May to "urgently explain why hundreds of thousands of possible drug smuggling records were deleted in 2012 without having ever been read".And she said it was "unacceptable that the Home Office will not provide any information about the sections of the report that have been redacted", saying two of the three top three recommendations have been edited.Meanwhile, a spokesman for the PCS union - which says it represents about two-thirds of UK border staff - said the report showed, "as we said from the outset, that this very expensive technology is no substitute for having well resourced and properly-trained staff"."Like other areas of the public sector, the agency must recognise that modernisation does not mean simply relying on computers," he added.The Home Office said it now carried out advance checks on 78% of those flying to Britain and required API from everyone coming from outside the EU.Immigration Minister Mark Harper said everyone who arrives at UK borders is checked, and the e-borders scheme is an extra level of security."We have the best coverage of any country in Europe but we are working to improve our coverage further," he said.The Home Office played down the importance of the information that had been deleted, saying anyone who had committed a serious offence would already be on a separate "warnings index" and intercepted on arrival.Officials said the details that had been removed were potential matches between two databases, less than 1% of which would have prompted an alert.Among a series of positive findings, inspectors said information gathered as a result of the e-borders scheme had resulted in the arrest of thousands of people for offences including murder and rape.Mr Vine said he was pleased the e-borders "high-profile alerts" system was being used to intercept high-risk individuals at the arrivals gate at Heathrow - but pointed out that this was not happening at any other port or airport.He said: "The Home Office should now define clearly what the aims of the e-borders programme are ahead of the new procurement exercise, and be transparent about what e-borders will deliver and by when."</body>

      <title>The land of hope is Tory - Cameron</title>
      <description>David Cameron says the Tories are the party of "the many, not the few" in a conference speech also trailing possible benefit cuts for young people.</description>

      <body>David Cameron vowed to get behind business to create a "land of opportunity for all", in his big speech to close the Conservative conference.His 50-minute address sought to set out dividing lines with "the 1970s-style socialism" he said Labour now offered.He claimed the economy was "turning the corner" and the "land of hope is Tory", while "the land of despair was Labour".Mr Cameron also hinted that benefits for under-25s could be cut in an effort to get more young people into work.But Labour said the prime minister had failed to address the "cost-of-living crisis" and offered a land of opportunity "for just a privileged few".During the 50-minute speech, Mr Cameron contrasted his own party's philosophy with that of the opposition, saying: "If Labour's plan for jobs is to attack business, ours is to back business."He criticised Labour leader Ed Miliband, who promised in his end-of-conference address last week to freeze energy prices and increase corporate tax on big firms, telling Tory activists that "profits, tax cuts and enterprise... are not dirty, elitist words".Mr Cameron argued that adding more state borrowing and spending to ease the "cost-of-living crisis" would risk putting the UK on the economic trajectory of Greece."It's all sticking plasters and quick fixes cobbled together for the TV cameras - Red Ed and his Blue Peter economy, " said the prime minister.Earlier in the week, Chancellor George Osborne announced plans to make the long-term unemployed undertake work placements if they want to continue receiving benefits.In his speech, Mr Cameron did not make any specific policy announcements, but suggested his party was looking at further changes to the welfare system to include in its manifesto for the 2015 general election.It was wrong that young people could "choose the dole" and right to "offer them something better".Mr Cameron added: "And let no one paint ideas like this as callous."Think about it: with your children, would you dream of just leaving them to their own devices, not getting a job, not training, nothing?"No - you'd nag and push and guide and do anything to get them on their way… and so must we. So this is what we want to see: everyone under 25 - earning or learning."Mr Cameron, who did not repeat previous no-notes speeches, often looked straight into the lens of the TV camera to address directly the audience outside the Manchester conference centre.The BBC's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said it was a surprisingly sober speech in parts, with Mr Cameron stressing there was still much work to do to fix Britain's economy.It was not enough just to clean up Labour's "mess" and pay off the deficit, he wanted to "build something better in its place".He added: "In place of the casino economy, one where people who work hard can actually get on; in place of the welfare society, one where no individual is written off; in place of the broken education system, one that gives every child the chance to rise up and succeed."Mr Cameron invoked the spirit of his predecessor Margaret Thatcher, the winner of three general elections, who died earlier this year, saying she had "made our country stand tall again, at home and abroad".He also made efforts to distance his party, and himself, from the Liberal Democrats, with whom the Tories have ruled in coalition for more than three years.He promised: "When the election comes, we won't be campaigning for a coalition, we will be fighting heart and soul for a majority Conservative government - because that is what our country needs..."This party at its heart is about big people, strong communities, responsible businesses, a bigger society - not a bigger state."To cheers, Mr Cameron attacked the Lib Dems for "trying to take all the credit" for lowering the minimum earnings threshold at which people start paying income tax.He joked: "Well, memo to the Lib Dems: you lecturing us on low taxes is like us lecturing you on pointless constitutional tinkering."We are Tories, we believe in low taxes and, believe me, we will keep on cutting the taxes of hard-working people in our country."Mr Cameron received a standing ovation after the speech, his ninth to conference since becoming leader in 2005.But, afterwards, Labour leader Ed Miliband said the prime minister had offered nothing to address "the cost-of-living crisis facing Britain's hard-working families".The Lib Dems said they, not the Conservatives, had made a manifesto commitment in 2010 to raise the level at which people start paying tax to £10,000.And UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the pro-business message conflicted with the reality that membership of the EU was costing the UK "billions in red tape and direct payments from high taxes".But there was a more favourable response from business groups, with CBI director-general John Cridland saying the prime minister had "sent out a strong message about how vital British business is to the future prosperity of people across the UK".Simon Walker, director-general of the Institute of Directors also welcomed the speech, but warned that firms would "be looking for him to match the sentiment with action - if tax cuts aren't dirty, let's have a few more of them".</body>

      <title>Miliband: We'll freeze energy prices</title>
      <description>Ed Miliband tells his party conference Labour will freeze energy prices if they get into power - but energy firms criticise the plan.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24213366</url>
      <date>1380040625</date>
      <body>Labour would freeze gas and electricity bills for every home and business in the UK for 20 months if it wins the 2015 election, Ed Miliband has said.The big energy firms would be split up and governed by a new tougher regulator to give people "a fairer deal".Labour says the move will save average households £120 and businesses £1,800 - but cost the energy giants £4.5bn.But energy companies said the policy could lead to power shortages, and jeopardise investment and jobs.The Labour leader said firms had been overcharging "for too long" and it was time to "reset" the energy market.The Tories accused him of a "sleight of hand", saying people would have to "pay more for their electricity" under the plans.Speaking for more than hour without notes at his party's annual conference in Brighton, Mr Miliband set out his vision of how "Britain can do better" under Labour, with an economy that works for "ordinary people once again".In other developments at Labour's conference:Mr Miliband used his speech to pledge action on what he has called Britain's "cost of living crisis", setting out an alternative vision of Britain's economy to that pursued by the Conservatives, with higher skills and wages."David Cameron talks about Britain being in a global race. But what he doesn't tell you is that he thinks the only way Britain can win is for you to lose."Mr Miliband said that means "the lowest wages, the worst terms and conditions, and the fewest rights at work - a race to the bottom", adding: "The only way we can win is in a race to the top."In an upbeat speech peppered with swipes at David Cameron and George Osborne for being out touch and lacking aspiration for the country, Mr Miliband repeatedly used the phrase "We're Britain, we're better than this" to cheers and applause from Labour activists.He received standing ovations for defending the NHS and promising to axe "the bedroom tax" - and tackled Tory criticism that he lacks leadership skills head-on, saying: "If they want to have a debate about leadership and character - be my guest."Unlike David Cameron, he told the party faithful, he had stood up to vested interests on media regulation and the tobacco lobby and made the right call on Syria. There was no mention in the speech of Mr Cameron's coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats.Explaining what he believes has gone wrong with the economy under the coalition, he said: "Too many of the jobs we're creating in this country are just too low paid, too many of the gains in our economy are just scooped up by the privileged few, including those big bonuses, and too often you are left being charged over the odds."They used to say 'a rising tide lifts all boats'. Now the rising tide just seems to lift yachts."The Labour leader has used his week in Brighton to set out some of the policies on which he will fight the next election but saved what is likely to be one of the centrepieces of the manifesto for his big speech.He vowed to abolish energy watchdog Ofgem and replace it with a new regulatory regime that ensures customers get a "fair deal"."We will legislate for this in our first Queen's Speech and it will come into effect in 2017," the Labour leader told activists."But in the meantime I am not willing to just stand by. So the next Labour government will freeze gas and electricity prices until the start of 2017."Your bills will be frozen, benefitting millions of families and millions of businesses. That's what I mean by a government that fights for you, that's what I mean when I say: Britain can do better than this."The companies won't like it because it will cost them money. But they have been overcharging people for too long because of a market that doesn't work. It is time to reset the market."Labour says the energy giants have been overcharging customers to the tune of £3.9bn since 2010 by not passing on reductions in wholesale prices to consumers.The party denies that the policy is a return to discredited "price controls" of the 1970s, arguing it is a temporary measure aimed at helping consumers while the party sets up a new regulator, which would force firms to openly sell their wholesale energy in a pooled market.But RWE npower, one of the big six energy firms targeted by Labour, criticised what it said were "easy", "simple solutions"."In reality, there are three main factors that influence prices - fixing inefficient housing stock, the investment required to replace the UK's energy infrastructure, and the cost of the buying energy on the global market," said chief executive Paul Massara.Another firm, SSE, said bills were rising because of "well-intentioned" government initiatives, not fuel costs.Chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said: "Instead of price freezes which will lead to unsustainable loss-making retail businesses, the Labour Party should put policy costs into general taxation, taking them off energy bills."Angela Knight, of industry body Energy UK, said freezing prices could hit the sector, making "energy shortages a reality, pushing up the prices for everyone".In his speech Mr Miliband also pledged to help small firms by freezing business rates in England, paid for by halting a planned increase in UK-wide corporation tax for large companies.And he said that by 2020 under Labour 200,000 houses would be built a year, with a fresh generation of new towns and "garden cities".An incoming Labour government would also scrap the £1,3bn Energy Companies Obligation, launched earlier this year to make the energy giants improve efficiency, and replace it with a more "cost-effective" regime.Unite union general secretary Len McCluskey said he was "pleased" with some of the issues raised by Mr Miliband."The most important thing was he highlighted the problems with the minimum wage and low pay and that fact that wage depression is something that needs to be tackled," he added.But John Longworth, from the British Chambers of Commerce, said talking about "controlling prices and wages sends a very bad signal" to businesses.John Cridland, from the CBI, said the plan "will deter much-needed investment" and would be viewed by business as "a setback for Labour's pro-enterprise credentials".Every Labour activist in the hall was given a copy of a book called One Nation Economy after the leader's speech.</body>

      <title>We must stay in government - Clegg</title>
      <description>The Lib Dems must be part of a coalition government after the next election to stop the Tories or Labour "messing up", Nick Clegg tells his party conference.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24137394</url>
      <date>1379527774</date>
      <body>Nick Clegg has urged the British people to put the Liberal Democrats back in government in 2015 to curb the excesses of the Tories or Labour."We are the only party that can finish the job of economic recovery, but finish it fairly," he told the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow.After three years of coalition Britain was now a "step closer" to the death of single party government, he claimed.He also spoke at length about his family and personal values.The BBC News Channel's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said Mr Clegg stuck to the argument he has been making all week - namely that coalition government works and the Lib Dems want another go at it.In a 51-minute speech aimed at preventing the Conservatives from claiming all the credit for the economic upturn, Mr Clegg said Lib Dem policies such as infrastructure spending and more apprenticeships had made all the difference."The big question mark that has always hung over the Liberal Democrats - could we handle government? And handle it when the going got tough? - that question mark is now gone."This recovery wouldn't be happening without us."He said Lib Dems had proved wrong the critics who said coalition would never work - but he also looked ahead to the next election, saying that "left to their own devices" Labour or the Tories would "mess it up".Speaking openly about forming a power sharing deal with the two bigger parties - something he avoided doing before the last election - he said: "Labour would wreck the recovery. The Conservatives would give us the wrong kind of recovery."He listed a series of Conservative policies which he claimed the Lib Dems had blocked, including "inheritance tax cuts for millionaires, profit-making in schools, firing workers at will, regional pay for public sector workers, scrapping housing benefit for young people, ditching the human rights act and closing down the debate on Trident".But he stressed that the Lib Dems were "no-one's little brother", adding: "We have our own values and beliefs."The speech contained no new policies, following Tuesday's headline-grabbing announcement on free lunches for all children in their first three years at school in England.Saying Lib Dems would extend the scheme to all primary school children, he said: "Their (the Conservatives) priority is to help some families over others, with a tax break for married couples."That tells you everything you need to know about their values."By contrast, he said his party was helping "young children get the best possible start in life, and that tells you everything about ours".The Lib Dem leadership have seen off challenges from activists to its nuclear weapons and economic policies, although delegates voted for a review of housing benefit rules - what critics call the "bedroom tax".And he scoffed at suggestions that coalition was all about personal chemistry between the party leaders, saying any coalition depended on the result of the election.In what will be seen as a hint that he is thinking of stepping down after the next election, he told activists in Glasgow that he "will not be in politics forever".But he used the speech to set out how his liberal values came to be formed, his "privileged" childhood and his "internationalist" outlook.He said the Lib Dems had always backed "home rule" for Scotland but would be urging a "no" vote in next year's independence referendum to keep the UK together.But he hoped the cross-party consensus would continue after the referendum to push for "the next advance in Scottish devolution".And he said the Lib Dems would be the party of "in" when it came to an EU referendum.Summing up what his pitch would be at the next election, he said: "In the past the Liberal Democrats would eke out an existence on the margins of British politics."Now we hold the liberal centre while our opponents head left and right. I have spent my entire life watching the other two mess it up. We cannot stand idly by and let them do it all over again."Lib Dem colleagues praised Mr Clegg's "intensely personal speech" but Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman said that, far from restraining the Conservatives, the Lib Dems had backed them all the way."He didn't mention the million young people out of work on his watch, the tax cuts for millionaires his party helped to introduce, or the cost of living crisis that means that since he became deputy prime minister wages are down an average of £1,500 a year," she added."Nothing he said today made any difference to the fact that Nick Clegg is propping up a Tory-led government that's making things worse for ordinary families."</body>

      <title>We want Britain back, says Farage</title>
      <description>UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage calls for an immediate EU exit, telling his party's conference the UK could go it alone.</description>

      <body>Britain would flourish outside the EU, Nigel Farage has said, predicting UKIP will cause a "political earthquake" in European elections next year.Addressing the party's annual conference, he said leaving the union would "open a door to the world".He described his party as the "true Europeans" as he claimed credit for shifting the terms of the debate on immigration and holding a referendum.But the speech was overshadowed by a row over remarks by MEP Godfrey Bloom.Mr Bloom has had the whip removed after he referred to a group of female activists as "sluts" - although he maintained that it was meant and taken as a joke.UKIP has reached unprecedented heights in the opinion polls under Mr Farage, coming second in the European elections in 2009 and winning hundreds of seats in the May local elections.Mr Farage has refused to predict how the party's Westminster candidates would fare in an election in 2015 but said he wants to turn the next European elections "into a referendum on EU membership"."My ambition and my conviction is that we can come first across the United Kingdom," he told activists."Let us send an earthquake through Westminster politics and let's say we want our country back."The party has sought to broaden its appeal beyond its core message of EU withdrawal, announcing policies in recent days on energy and welfare.But, in a speech dominated by Europe, Mr Farage said the European Commission had "hijacked" the EU's original ideals and the UK would begin a process of "national renewal" by going its own way.Those who warn that British trade would be harmed by a UK exit were the "true voices of Little England", he told party members."Those 10,000 trucks a day coming in from the Continent bringing goods into this country. They won't stop coming," he said."The idea that the EU will start a trade war with Britain is simply not credible. The real reason the EU won't be able or willing to stop trading with us is that the German car industry won't allow it."UKIP was growing in strength and, by the time of the next election, Mr Farage said it would be the third largest party in the country in terms of membership, overtaking the Liberal Democrats.The party is meeting just days after one of its former deputy leaders quit the organisation, frustrated by what he had described as its "totalitarian" leadership.Mike Nattrass, West Midlands MEP and a member for 15 years, accused Mr Farage of silencing dissent and surrounding himself with "cronies".But Mr Farage, by far the party's best-known figure, outlined his popularity with voters, saying in his speech: "They are fed up to the back teeth with the cardboard cut-out careerists in Westminster, the spot-the-difference politicians... the politicians who daren't say what they really mean."While there was no mention of the members who quit in protest at his leadership, he acknowledged internal clashes.Mr Farage told party members he had a "blistering row" with Godfrey Bloom, the UKIP MEP who courted controversy recently by claiming British foreign aid goes to "bongo-bongo land".Alluding to the comments, he referred to "public pronouncements that I would not always choose myself" and urged those with passionate views to focus on the "big messages".Immigration was the "biggest single issue facing" the UK, he said, as he warned of an "even darker side to the opening of the door".He claimed London had been gripped by a "Romanian crime wave"."This gets to the heart of immigration," he said. "We should not be opening our doors on 1 January to Romanian criminal gangs."The "Establishment" had dismissed anyone wanting to debate immigration as "bad and racist", he claimed.UKIP gained 16.5% of the popular vote, second only to the Conservatives, in the 2009 European elections and returned 13 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs).But, at the 2010 general election, support dwindled to 3.1% and UKIP did not win a Westminster seat.Earlier on Friday, the party's energy spokesman Roger Helmer announced it would invest profits from shale gas extraction in a sovereign wealth fund.The two-day conference is also set to discuss plans to ensure migrants have private health insurance and for social housing to be prioritised for people whose parents or grandparents were born locally.</body>

      <title>Questions raised over indy oil fund</title>
      <description>Scottish ministers were warned by their own economic advisers that plans for an oil fund under independence may require tax rises or spending cuts.</description>

      <date>1381413910</date>
      <body>Scottish ministers were warned by their own economic advisers that plans for an oil fund under independence may require tax rises or spending cuts.The advice, written for the government last year and published under freedom of information laws, has been seen by the BBC and the Daily Mail newspaper.Pro-Union campaigners claimed the pubic was being deceived.But the Scottish government said the private advice had since been overtaken by events.It warned that, if Scotland became independent, it would have to raise taxes, cut services or borrow to create the oil fund.But it also said Scotland could have paid off its debts 30 years ago if it had been independent and had had oil revenues.The advice calculated the tax surpluses of the 1980s could have been set aside to create a Norwegian-style oil fund which would have been worth £117bn by 2011.The emergence of the paper led to stormy exchanges during first minister's questions at the Scottish Parliament, where Labour and the Conservatives accused the SNP government of trying to hide information detrimental to its case for independence, ahead of the referendum on 18 September next year.Labour leader Johann Lamont asked the first minister: "When was he going to tell us his choice to raise taxes or cut public spending? The answer is, never. Honesty is not something this government deals in."When Ms Lamont was asked to withdraw the remark by Holyrood's presiding officer, she continued: "I accept the advice of the presiding offer, but I have to say I do not know what word you use to describe a government that says one thing in private and something different in public."The fact of the matter is, Scotland is on pause and we will not be given the full facts with this government ahead of a referendum."But Mr Salmond said the contents of the private advice had come before recommendations published last week by the Scottish government's fiscal commission working group set out a scenario where, under independence, money could be put into two separate oil funds without spending and taxation changes.One fund would help stabilise finances as revenue fluctuates, while the other would be a long term investment fund, similar to the one operated by Norway.The first minister said: "We've got a fiscal commission report which sets out clear criteria, how we can marshal Scotland's resources and make sure that asset is used for the benefit of this generation and for future generations."Nobody would seriously argue that the UK has handled oil well as a resource over the last 40 years. Nobody would seriously dispute that Norway - the country across the North Sea - has handled that resource much better.""The fiscal commission have put forward a proposal which allows Scotland to get towards the fortunate position of Norway, as opposed to making the unremitting bungles of Westminster and successive United Kingdom chancellors."However, Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said she ran both the private advice and the fiscal commission report through "university cheating software".She went on: "And what did I find? Whole sections cut and pasted - entire paragraphs on Scotland's projected net fiscal debt, on the country's debt interest payments and on notional borrowing costs."All the good stuff made the grade. All the bad stuff hit the bin.Ms Davidson added: "It seems when the government reached any section in here - and there were plenty - that said that an oil fund would mean higher taxes, more borrowing or lower public spending, they simply hit delete."Earlier, on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Alistair Darling, who is former chancellor and head of pro-Union Better Together, said: "If you were to set up an oil fund you would have to borrow money to save it so that seems to be complete nonsense."The problem we have here is yet again we are being told one thing in public when the SNP knows something else is the case in private."Finance Secretary John Swinney told the same programme that if debt in an independent Scotland was reducing it would be prudent to invest in an oil fund.He added: "People will have mortgages, which is debt, it is an obligation to pay back, at the same time many people will also be saving - if they have the money to put aside for their future - and that is exactly what we are trying to do as a country."</body>

      <title>Hospital waiting list jump 'crisis'</title>
      <description>Figures show another significant rise in the number of patients who have had to wait more than nine months for hospital treatment.</description>

      <body>Figures show another significant rise in the number of patients who have had to wait more than nine months to start hospital treatment.More than 13,000 had been waiting over 36 weeks in August, a rise of over 2,000 in one month.The Welsh government's own target is for no-one to wait that long.The Welsh Conservatives have written to the first minister calling on him to personally intervene to deal with what they called "an escalating crisis".Darren Millar, the party's shadow minister for health, told Carwyn Jones the situation needed "immediate priority".He said: "I hope you will agree that patients across Wales - particularly the elderly and vulnerable - should not be faced with such long waits."Meanwhile, Kirsty Williams, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said the figures were a "national disgrace"."Why must patients in Wales have to put up with such an inferior service when compared to the rest of the UK?" she said."Years of Welsh Labour incompetence has led to thousands of people having to wait an awful long time until the start of their treatment."No one should have to wait this long, but it's particularly dreadful to think of the large amount of elderly people that are being forced to wait months on end."On Tuesday, it was announced that the Welsh NHS would be given £570m of extra funding over three years during the Welsh government's draft budget.Finance Minister Jane Hutt said the extra money would help the NHS in Wales to avoid a scandal such as the one in Stafford Hospital, where hundreds of patients died as a result of neglect and abuse.The Welsh government is expected to comment on the figures later.</body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Beginner's guide to PM's speech</title>
      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21013771</url>
      <date>1358939858</date>
      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant?What has happened?Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning.Why the big deal about the speech?Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech.So what did Cameron say?Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech.What sorts of powers does the UK want back?The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK."Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders?The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK.So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU?David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market."What has been the reaction in the UK?Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement.Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party.The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts.What about the reaction around Europe?The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction.What about the reaction from business?A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".Where can I get more detail on the speech?If you click on the link below you can read the whole text, with key bits picked out and analysed by BBC expertsAnnotated transcipt: Key excerpts</body>

      <description>The details of Labour leader Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet following the recent reshuffle.</description>

      <date>1381232529</date>
      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his October 2013 reshuffle.The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction.He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire.The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011.As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper.Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children.The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign.Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury.Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011.Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development.Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. The MP for Leeds West was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament.A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader.As the son of former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest.One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress.Moving to defence from shadow Northern Ireland secretary in October 2013, the MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted having smoked cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip.The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing". Like many leading female MPs, the former union worker entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide. Responsible for the controversial eco-town project as housing minister before becoming Europe minister in 2008. Supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011.One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the Cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. She supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leader of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.Chris Leslie has been appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in the latest Labour frontbench reshuffle. The former Bradford councillor was elected MP for Shipley - a Tory stronghold in Yorkshire - in 1997. He held several junior positions in the former Labour government within the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Constitutional Affairs. He lost his Shipley seat in 2005, but re-entered Parliament in 2010 as MP for Nottingham East. He went on to serve as shadow financial secretary to the Treasury on Labour's front bench in the Commons.Mary Creagh has moved from shadow environment secretary to shadow transport secretary in October 2013. When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before. The Wakefield MP worked for the European Parliament and in academia before entering Parliament in 2005. A keen Europhile, she is fluent in French and Italian. Worked as parliamentary private secretary to Andy Burnham but voted for David Miliband in the leadership contest.Maria Eagle moved in October 2013 to shadow environment secretary in a job swap with Mary Creagh. She is the sister of Angela but chose to support Ed Miliband in the leadership contest. Ms Eagle was a solicitor in Liverpool before entering Parliament in 1997. She held a series of ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including children's minister and equalities minister. Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player.Jim Murphy was moved - demoted in many people's eyes - in October 2013 from shadow defence secretary. He is a Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign. He has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football.Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. But when that constituency was torn up in boundary changes she made the move to Westminster in 2010. Under her, Labour took back Glasgow East having lost it in a by-election defeat by the SNP in 2008.

He is also currently vice-chairman of the Labour Party.Gloria De Piero was appointed shadow women and equalities minister in the October 2013 reshuffle.

      <title>UK immigration acts through the ages</title>
      <description>At-a-glance guide to a century of British immigration acts</description>

      <date>1381365531</date>
      <body>The government has published its Immigration Bill, which will change the rules on access to the NHS and impose tougher penalties for illegal working. But what legislation has been passed over the last century or so?This targeted "undesirable aliens" - such as paupers, lunatics, vagrants and prostitutes - who could be refused entry.This granted the common status of British subject upon those persons who had specified connections with the Crown's dominions.The Empire's dominions each adopted their separate citizenships, but retained the common status of British subject.This required certain potential migrants to supply proof that either they, their parents or grandparents had been born in Britain.Commonwealth citizens lost their automatic right to remain in the UK, meaning they faced the same restrictions as those from elsewhere. They would in future only be allowed to remain in UK after they had lived and worked here for five years.A partial "right of abode" was introduced, lifting all restrictions on immigrants with a direct personal or ancestral connection with Britain.This act ensured that only one wife or widow of a polygamous marriage had a right to enter the country.It also ensured people with freedom of movement in the European Community did not need leave to enter or remain in the UK.It became a criminal offence to employ anyone unless they had permission to live and work in the UK.The act removed benefits from asylum seekers and created the National Asylum Service to house them, taking pressure off local authorities.This created the first English test and citizenship exam for immigrants and introduced measures against bogus marriages.This act introduced a single form of appeal that remains to this day and made it a criminal offence to destroy travel documents. It limited access to support for those told to leave the UK.A five-tier points system for awarding entry visas was created.Those refused work or study visas had their rights of appeal limited.The act brought in on-the-spot fines of £2,000, payable by employers for each illegal employee, which could include parents taking on nannies without visas.This provided the UK Border Agency with powers to tackle illegal working and automatically deport some foreign nationals imprisoned for specific offences, or for more than one year.It gave immigration officers police-like powers, such as increased detention and a search-and-entry roles.The act brought in the power to create compulsory biometric cards for non-EU immigrants.This act amended the rules so people from outside the European Economic Area had to have residential status for eight years before being eligible for naturalisation.Those seeking naturalisation through wedlock had to be married for five years first.The act also allowed immigration and customs officers to perform some of each other's roles and imposed a duty on home secretaries to safeguard children.</body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Help to Buy mortgage scheme</title>
      <description>How will the new mortgage scheme work?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24447335</url>
      <date>1381239589</date>
      <body>The government says that its Help to Buy scheme will assist people trying to get on the housing ladder who can afford mortgage repayments but are struggling to raise a deposit.But critics say that the government guarantee, that forms part of the second phase of the scheme, could create a housing bubble in the UK.Not all mortgage seekers will be able to sign up, and those who do will still have to go through "rigorous" affordability checks by their lender.Haven't I heard about this for a while?Yes, in fact some parts of the scheme have been operating for a few months.The first phase started in April in England. This sees the government offering a 20% equity loan to buyers of newly-built properties. These buyers must offer a 5% deposit.Similar schemes operate in Wales and Scotland - all of which are aimed at encouraging housebuilding.But that's not all, is it?No, the second phase of the scheme, originally planned for January 2014, has been brought forward so mortgage products are available from now.Under this system, borrowers across the UK can put down a deposit of as little as 5% of the property price. The lender offers a mortgage covering the other 95%.Lenders can sign up to the Help to Buy scheme and pay a fee to the government, which will provide a seven-year taxpayer guarantee covering 15% of the loan value. That guarantee can be called in if the borrower defaults.It is available for properties sold for up to £600,000 in the UK. The scheme is expected to continue for three years.Are the lenders keen?There has been a mixed response so far.RBS and Lloyds Banking Group - both of which are taxpayer backed - are participating in the second phase of Help to Buy.Smaller lenders Virgin Money and Aldermore have announced that they will be involved as well, from January.However, among the lenders still deciding whether to sign up are Barclays, Santander and Nationwide Building Society.How much do these mortgages cost?A few lenders have started to reveal the pricing of these 95% mortgages.RBS and NatWest are offering a two-year, fixed-rate mortgage starting at 4.99% for those with a 5% deposit, with no fee.Halifax will be taking applications in a few days at a rate of 5.19% with a £995 fee for those with the same deposit.That is relatively competitive compared with prices outside of Help to Buy, although borrowers are likely to get a better deal if they save up longer for a deposit. These 95% mortgages have all but disappeared from the market since the start of the financial crisis.Is there a chance of a return of irresponsible lending?The government says that various rules have been included to ensure this does not happen.For example, no interest-only or offset mortgages will be allowed. The system cannot be used for the purchase of second homes or for mortgages for buy-to-let investors.In addition, lenders must put these borrowers through new affordability checks. These were brought in for everyone to avoid a return of the reckless lending of the last boom.You mention boom, isn't this just going to create another one?That's the fear from many commentators who say that Help to Buy is simply going to help some relatively well-off people move up the housing ladder.Critics, including Labour, say that this does nothing to tackle the shortage of affordable homes to buy, so it wants more focus on housebuilding.Treasury officials suggest that the system will correct a failure in the market and stimulate builders to get going again with bricks and mortar.</body>

      <title>Will EDL survive leader's exit?</title>
      <description>Tom Symonds on the impact of leader's decision to quit group</description>

      <date>1381235375</date>
      <body>The English Defence League (EDL) began life as a street movement in opposition to Islamist extremists who protested against British troops in 2009 in Luton.It has stayed on the streets, its marches attended by men and women who say they are working class, and anti-Muslim.But the EDL has rarely been able to mobilise thousands for its marches. And often the hundreds who have turned out have been met by similar numbers of anti-racist campaigners.It has struggled ideologically too. There has been growing tension between supporters who appear to oppose all Muslims and the EDL's leaders who say they only oppose Muslim extremists.It has been suggested the leadership has "marketed" the EDL in this way, in contrast to the views of most of its members.Officially the EDL denies being racist, and rejects the suggestion it is of the far right.The group says it does not condemn all Muslims, and Tommy Robinson has said he does not "want to lead a war against all Muslims".However, in the past, he has talked about "Muslim communities feeling the full force of the EDL" - a comment he explained by suggesting this would be through democratic processes, not violence.For its part the British National Party appears to believe the EDL's leadership has not been radical enough.An article on its website states: "As genuine nationalists we have deep ideological differences with the EDL leaders who openly support the ethno-cultural genocide of the indigenous English through mass colonisation and multi-racialism."This tension is probably the best explanation as to why twelve senior members of the EDL have now left.Mr Robinson appears to have decided that a street movement that seems to confront all Muslims is not changing minds.But there is another explanation. EDL members say the personal pressure on Tommy Robinson in particular has been intense.In the wake of the stabbing of Lee Rigby in Woolwich, Mr Robinson tweeted that he'd received 200 death threats, including to cut off his head.He told BBC Radio 5Live that when supporters threatened to bomb mosques he would be blamed "when I pick my kids up from school". He insisted "that's not what I stand for".That pressure may simply have got to him.The anti-extremism group Quilliam appears to have played its part too.It has suggested that there is a negative symbiotic relationship between far-right extremism and Islamism, and this argument appears to have helped convince Tommy Robinson to make his announcement - through Quilliam itself.It is not yet clear in what ways the group has engaged with Mr Robinson and other EDL members.Their departure has weakened the movement, and its mobilisation of anti-Muslim working class sentiment.It remains to be seen if new leaders will emerge, or whether the EDL will melt away, leaving the British National Party alone on the right.</body>

      <title>The reshuffled face of politics</title>
      <description>What impact will the frontbench changes have?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24438875</url>
      <date>1381180644</date>
      <body>Reshuffles. Like the old cliché about buses, you wait ages for one then three come along at once. But how much of an impact will the latest changes in personnel have?Inside the coalition, the Conservative and Lib Dem leaders independently decided the fate of their ministers.And Ed Miliband, no longer encumbered with a shadow cabinet chosen by his MPs, had a free hand to promote fresh talent.But has the political territory shifted, or is it just the personalities that have been moved?In some ways, the face of politics is changing.Across the board, women are taking more prominent roles - so far, a net increase of four in government, and 44% of Labour's shadow cabinet are female.Among the beneficiaries are two former stars of GMTV - Esther McVey for the Conservatives, and Labour's Gloria De Piero.The equation telegenic + down to earth = promotion has been proven. Though some rather less telegenic but talented people have done well too.For the Conservatives, the reshuffle has also, in part, been about class as well as gender.That isn't a misprint.For the Conservatives, the reshuffle has also, in part, been about class.What some of our tabloid colleagues have depicted as a process of replacing the "top hats" with the "flat caps".In fact Monday didn't really amount to a revolution in millinery. It's simply that some of those who haven't been to public school are winning more prominence.Racing up the junior ranks is Sajid Javid, son of a bus driver from Rochdale.And Mike Penning - a plain-speaking former soldier and fireman - will welcome the challenge of taking the heat for welfare reforms. As a former spokesman for Iain Duncan Smith, he should, at least, have a good working relationship with his boss.So expect some of the non-cabinet ministers to speak with less expensive accents.Allies of the chancellor have also done well from the reshuffle: the aforementioned Mr Javid; Matthew Hancock, a former chief of staff to George Osborne; and the former Treasury whip Greg Hands, are all moving up.Their careers may be moving forward but their advancement doesn't signal a change in direction.None of the better-known Conservative figures around the cabinet table have been moved - any purge at the top will await the outcome of next year's European parliament elections.It was, in fact, Nick Clegg rather than David Cameron that engaged in the night of the long knives. Or, rather, the long knife.It was plunged into the front rather than the back of Micheal Moore, the Secretary of State for Scotland.He had very competently carried out negotiations on the forthcoming referendum on Scottish independence.But now that thorny issues over timing and, crucially, what question to put to the Scottish people, have had been smoothed over, it was felt that it was time to move on from the constitutional niceties and in to campaigning mode.So step forward the robust figure of the former Lib Dem chief whip Alistair Carmichael, whose job it is now to tweak Alex Salmond's tail.But at more junior level, Jeremy Browne was dismissed. This surprised some at Westminster as he had been seen as close to Nick Clegg, and he could never be described as a coalition-sceptic. Certainly working with Conservative ministers didn't seem to trouble his conscience.So it's possible that the Lib Dem leader - while continuing to liaise closely with David Cameron's colleagues - also wants his own ministers to spell out the differences between the two coalition partners more clearly in the run-up to the next election.But even Lib Dems raised eyebrows at Mr Browne's replacement at the Home Office, the former transport minster Norman Baker, the author of a book alleging a cover-up over Dr David Kelly, the government scientist whose death led to the Hutton inquiry.At first glance Ed Miliband's reshuffle marks more of a shift in position - away from his party's Blairite past.At education, Stephen Twigg - who had praised a "free school" in his area and worked hard to find a way of reconciling Michael Gove's creations with Labour's existing (and more hostile) policy - has been dumped from the shadow cabinet, as has Liam Byrne - the former shadow work and pensions secretary who accepted the principle of a cap on benefits payments.And it just so happens that in an interview with the left-of-centre New Statesman earlier, the leader of the Unite trade union Len McCluskey had described both politicians in unflattering terms.Labour sources, naturally, say that Ed Miliband didn't discuss his reshuffle with union leaders.And certainly Tristram Hunt's appointment to replace Stephen Twigg hardly marks a lurch to the left.He is close to Peter Mandelson and was parachuted into his Stoke constituency at the last election with the blessing of the then leadership.And while he has reportedly described free schools as "a vanity project for yummy mummies", expect him to champion "parent-led academies" in the future .Rather, he represents a bit of generational shift - someone who is younger than the Labour leader (not yet 40) and who can potentially appeal beyond the Westminster village - albeit to viewers of TV history shows on BBC Two and Four, rather than breakfast telly.Labour insiders say they wanted to make space for some of the 2010 intake who could prove to be energetic campaigners. That was more important than whether they were Brownite or Blairite, David or Ed.The new shadow women's and equalities minister Gloria De Piero is an admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as her party leader.And there was additional ballast against the "Blairite purge" stories - which some of the papers will write tomorrow - in the shape of Lord Falconer. He is Tony Blair's former flatmate and he has agreed to advise the party on the transition from opposition to government.The shunting of the former shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle to the environment brief has led to speculation that Labour is preparing to derail HS2.Instead, party sources insist, Mary Creagh's move to transport from shadowing Defra is a tribute to her campaigning flair during the horsemeat scandal.She is now going to be tasked with standing up not for the consumer but the commuter, arguing against higher fares as part of Labour's pre-election theme of tackling what it calls the cost-of-living crisis.But if she is a fan of HS2, she may have to turn her campaigning skills to greater effect against some of her shadow cabinet colleagues who think the money could be better spent.Amongst the sceptics is Ed Balls, supportive of the rail project in principle, but in practice stressing he can't back it "at any price".And the shadow chancellor, like his opposite number, will be pleased to see some of his key allies in important posts - including Rachel Reeves, his former number two, taking over the work and pensions brief, and Vernon Coaker moving to shadow defence.Michael Dugher, a redoubtable attack-dog who initially backed Ed Balls for leader, has been given a key role in planning for the next general election.He will be joined by Douglas Alexander (in addition to his foreign affairs role) and Spencer Livermore - the former Gordon Brown apparatchik who was - he believed unfairly - criticised by some of his colleagues for the handling of the 2007 election-that-never-was.Well, with fixed-term Parliaments now, there is little doubt when the next election will come.But perhaps the wider significance of the Labour reshuffle is what it says about the other Ed.The fact that Messrs Twigg and Byrne accepted demotions, and Jim Murphy moved from defence to international development, suggests that his leadership is secure - that there is no prospect of a shadowy group of Blairites outside of the shadow cabinet waiting - or campaigning - for Ed Miliband's political demise.At least, not this side of an election.So, in the days and months ahead, the battle lines will be more clearly drawn between rather than within the parties.</body>

      <title>EU law and budget: a video guide</title>
      <description>Matthew Price explains EU laws and budget</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23782683</url>
      <date>1377100903</date>
      <body>The EU has a reputation for being slow and cumbersome - largely because of the difficulty of getting agreement among 28 member states with different languages and traditions.Here BBC Europe correspondent Matthew Price gives a video guide to the complex bargaining that results in new EU laws and the EU budget.The right to initiate legislation in the EU belongs to the European Commission - the union's civil service and rule-enforcer.Usually Commission proposals go through many amendments before becoming law - a process that takes years.In most policy areas the Council of Ministers - representing EU governments - and the European Parliament reach joint decisions through negotiation. Their role is called "the ordinary legislative procedure". During their negotiations they come under pressure from lobby groups, for example industrial firms or environmentalists.Often EU laws arise because national governments and MEPs tell the Commission that there is a need for them. Public consultations, scientific research and impact assessments also feed into the legislation.Once a measure becomes EU law the member states have two years to adopt it nationally - "transpose" it, in the jargon. The Commission can fine them for failure to do so.The budget is one of the most contentious policy areas among the member states, whose priorities differ greatly. The 2013 EU budget is 132.8bn euros (£113bn; $178bn).The size of the budget has to be decided annually, but there is also a seven-year budget framework, agreed in advance so that money can be set aside for long-term projects.This year for the first time EU leaders agreed to cut the multi-year budget (for 2014-2020), under pressure from the UK and some other countries, including the Netherlands and Sweden.The eurozone crisis has exacerbated tensions in the budget negotiations. Net contributors to the budget - the richer countries including the UK - argue that it should reflect the tough austerity policies adopted nationally. But net beneficiaries, such as the new member states in Central and Eastern Europe, oppose EU cuts to key areas like agriculture and infrastructure projects.EU spending is a small fraction of what the national governments spend in total, but those governments have to pay for big public sector areas like education and health, which are largely outside the EU's remit.</body>

      <title>Alice Munro wins Nobel Literature Prize</title>
      <description>Canadian author Alice Munro wins the 2013 Nobel Prize for Literature, making her only the 13th woman to receive the award since its inception in 1901.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24477246</url>
      <date>1381409500</date>
      <body>Canadian author Alice Munro has won the 2013 Nobel Prize for Literature.Making the announcement, Peter Englund, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, called her a "master of the contemporary short story".The 82-year-old, whose books include Dear Life and Dance of the Happy Shades, is only the 13th woman to win the prize since its inception in 1901."I knew I was in the running, yes, but I never thought I would win," Munro told Canadian media.Presented by the Nobel Foundation, the award - which is presented to a living writer - is worth eight million kronor (£770,000).Previous winners include literary giants such as Rudyard Kipling, Toni Morrison and Ernest Hemingway.Mr Englund told The Associated Press that he had not been able to contact Munro ahead of the announcement so left a message on her answering machine, informing her of her win."She has taken an art form, the short story, which has tended to come a little bit in the shadow behind the novel, and she has cultivated it almost to perfection,'' he added.Munro, who began writing in her teenage years, published her first story, The Dimensions of a Shadow, in 1950.She had been studying English at the University of Western Ontario at the time.Dance of the Happy Shades, published in 1968, was Munro's first collection, and it went on to win Canada's highest literary prize, the Governor General's Award.In 2009, she won the Man Booker International Prize for her entire body of work - but she downplayed her achievements."I think maybe I was successful in doing this because I didn't have any other talents," she once said in an interview with Book Lounge.BBC Arts Editor Will Gompertz said Munro had been "at the very top of her game since she started"."Very few writers are her equal," he said, adding "she gets to the heart of what it is to be human"."I thought she might not win because she's not overtly political; and of late the Nobel has tended to go to political writers."The award "probably won't make a commercial difference" to the author, he added, but it "makes a huge difference to how her work will be viewed in historical terms"."If she hadn't won it before she died, I think it would have been a terrible, terrible omission."Often compared to Anton Chekhov, she is known for writing about the human spirit and a regular theme of her work is the dilemma faced by young girls growing up and coming to terms with living in a small town.The Nobel academy praised her "finely tuned storytelling, which is characterised by clarity and psychological realism".Munro, whose daughter woke her to tell her she had won the Nobel, said she was "terribly surprised" and "delighted".Speaking to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), she said she always viewed her chances of winning as "one of those pipe dreams" that "might happen, but it probably wouldn't"."It's the middle of the night here and I had forgotten about it all, of course," she added.Since the 1960s, Munro has published more than a dozen collections of short stories, many of which take place in her native southwest Ontario.Her writing has brought her several awards. She won The Commonwealth Writers' Prize, the National Book Critics Circle prize for Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage, and is a three-time winner of the Governor General's prize.Other notable books include Lives of Girls and Women, Who Do You Think You Are, The Progress of Love and Runaway.In 1980, The Beggar Maid was shortlisted for the annual Booker Prize for Fiction and her stories frequently appear in publications such as the New Yorker and the Paris Review.Several of her stories have also been adapted for the screen, including The Bear Came Over the Mountain, which became Away from Her, starring Julie Christie and Gordon Pinsent.Munro revealed earlier this year that her latest book, Dear Life, published in 2012, would be her last."Perhaps, when you're my age, you don't wish to be alone as much as a writer has to be," she told Canada's National Post.In 2009, Munro revealed she had been receiving treatment for cancer. She also had bypass surgery for a heart condition.Notriously publicity-shy, Munro shies away from public events.According to American literary critic David Homel: "She is not a socialite. She is actually rarely seen in public, and does not go on book tours.Munro will be presented with her latest award at a formal ceremony in Stockholm on 10 December, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, who established the prize.Last year's recipient was Chinese novelist Mo Yan.</body>

      <body>A printing mix up led to early copies of the latest Bridget Jones book having a chunk of Sir David Jason's memoirs in the middle.About 40 pages of Sir David's My Life were printed in Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, both of which came out on the same day."The printers have had a Bridget moment," said publishers Vintage.It said it was recalling the misprinted copies and replacing them with correct versions."A printing error has been detected in some of the very early copies of Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy," said a Vintage spokesman."Copies printed on one day have given readers an accidental preview of David Jason's autobiography."Both Fielding and Sir David's book were published on what the publishing world has dubbed "Super Thursday", when publishing houses put out some of their highest-priority titles for the Christmas market.Among other books released are Jennifer Saunders' autobiography Bonkers, My Life in Laughs; Mo Farah's Twin Ambitions and John Bishop's How Did All This Happen?Mad About the Boy signals the final chapter of hapless "singleton" Bridget Jones's diaries.Fans may already know one of the significant plotlines after extracts were earlier published in the Sunday Times Magazine.Although Fielding herself approved the reveal, some fans were shocked to be told of such a major twist before the book had even been published.</body>

      <body>A painting by Francis Bacon of his friend and fellow artist Lucian Freud is expected to sell for at least $85m (£53m) when it is auctioned for the first time in New York next month.The triptych, Three Studies of Lucian Freud (1969), is considered to be one of Bacon's greatest masterpieces.It will have its first ever UK public viewing at Christie's from 13 to 18 October during Frieze Art week.A smaller, preparatory triptych of Freud sold at auction for £23m in 2011.Three Studies for a Portrait of Lucian Freud, painted in 1965, had been expected to sell for between £7m and £9m.Francis Outred, head of Post-War and Contemporary Art at Christie's, Europe said the Three Studies of Lucian Freud, completed four years later, was "a true masterpiece and one of the greatest paintings to come up for auction in a current generation"."It is an undeniable icon of 20th Century art and a painting that Bacon preserved as one of his favourites."Outred said the first public unveiling of the complete painting in London was "quite a moment"."The work is a very important international painting but it's also a conversation between two masters who happen to be British."It marks Bacon and Freud's relationship, paying tribute to the creative and emotional kinship between the two artists," he added.Bacon and Freud met in 1945 and became close companions, painting each other on a number of occasions, before their relationship cooled during the 1970s.Bacon, known for his triptychs, painted Three Studies of Lucian Freud in 1969 at London's Royal College of Art, after his studio was destroyed in a fire.With its sunshine yellow background, it is an "extraordinary piece of paintwork" and one of only two existing, full length triptychs of Freud.The other, painted in 1966, was last seen in 1992, according to Outred, "but no one knows where it is".Exhibited in Bacon's renowned retrospective at the Grand Palais, Paris in 1971-1972, the three panels that form the painting were separated for almost fifteen years in the mid-1970s.One panel was shown at the Tate in 1985 before the three sections were reassembled in their original splendour.The complete work was displayed in New Haven, Connecticut in 1999.According to the curator Martin Harrison: "Bacon was deeply distressed when the triptych was dismantled, noting on a photograph of the left panel that it was only 'a fragment of a triptych… and I think it is meaningless unless it is united with the other two panels.'"Its reassembly into the form he intended would, if he lived to see it, have caused him profound satisfaction, given that this was among the surprisingly small number of his paintings he held in high regard."</body>

      <title>Katzenberg: My $75m Breaking Bad bid</title>
      <description>The CEO of DreamWorks Animation, Jeffrey Katzenberg, reveals he offered to pay $75m for three new episodes of hit series Breaking Bad to form part of a pay-per-view TV experiment.</description>

      <date>1381406561</date>
      <body>Jeffrey Katzenberg, the CEO of DreamWorks Animation, has revealed he offered to pay $75m (£47m) for three new episodes of Breaking Bad.He told Mipcom TV festival in Cannes that he wanted to air the hour-long episodes online, in six-minute chunks.Mr Katzenberg hoped the subscription service would prove the "greatest pay-per-view television event for scripted programming anybody's ever done".Hit AMC drama Breaking Bad came to a dramatic finale earlier this month."There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that millions of people would have downloaded those episodes," said Mr Katzenberg of his attempt to prolong the show's life beyond its five seasons.Elaborating on the unsuccessful Breaking Bad pitch, Mr Katzenberg told The Guardian newspaper: "My idea was literally that you'd pay 50 cents a day for 30 days, so it would be $15, and I actually think there are 10 million people around the world that would have done that."That's $150m, so the $75m I was prepared to pay would have delivered a 100% return on investment. And I'm trying to get people to think about this space in a new way by telling that story. It's emblematic of an opportunity coming."While giving Mipcom's keynote speech, he told TV executives that distributors would continue to pay a premium for high-quality content, whether it lives on traditional television or online.According to The Hollywood Reporter, the DreamWorks chief recently paid $33m (£20.7m) for Brian Robbins' YouTube channel AwesomenessTV, a deal he said is an "enormous opportunity".It currently has 909,000 subscribers and 176 million views and it has spawned a successful Nickelodeon series of the same name, utilising the YouTube content."It gets us directly in touch with the teen audience in a way that movies and TV can't," said Mr Katzenberg.He made the point that younger consumers are not only watching more content online, but are far more engaged with content viewed on touch-screen devices than they are with traditional televisions.Mr Katzenberg said the internet is "a great incubator of talent and concepts" and has the "ability to drive viewers" to television, as it has already been doing with AwesomenessTV.DreamWorks Animation also has a five-year deal to create 300 hours of original "kid-targeted" content for Netflix."Whether the media is old or the media is new, content continues to drive success," said Mr Katzenberg.He insisted films would remain the "heart and soul" of the DreamWorks Animation brand but it would "look like a very different company" in 15 years time.</body>

      <description>Julian Assange refused to meet Benedict Cumberbatch while he was preparing to play the WikiLeaks founder on film, a leaked email reveals.</description>

      <date>1381398547</date>
      <body>Julian Assange refused to meet Benedict Cumberbatch while he was preparing to play the WikiLeaks founder on film, a leaked email has revealed.In the letter, sent in January, Assange described Cumberbatch's film, The Fifth Estate, as "toxic" and "distorted".He also urged the actor: "Reconsider your involvement in this enterprise".The Australian whistle-blower has been living at the Ecuadorean embassy in London after claiming asylum a year ago to avoid extradition to Sweden.Released by Wikileaks, his email was written in response to the actor's request for a meeting, something Assange called "a bad idea"."By meeting with you I would validate this wretched film," he wrote."I cannot permit this film any claim to authenticity or truthfulness. In its current form it has neither, and doing so would only further aid the campaign against me."The Fifth Estate received a standing ovation at its world premiere during the Toronto Film Festival last month and is released this Friday 11 October in the UK and in the US next week.It has received mixed reviews from critics, although they have been favourable towards Cumberbatch's performance.Assange did praise Cumberbatch's previous work and said the two would "forever be correlated in the public imagination"."I believe you are a good person, but I do not believe that this film is a good film," said Assange"It is based on a deceitful book by someone who has a vendetta against me and my organisation."The film draws on a memoir by former WikiLeaks spokesman Daniel Domscheit-Berg, Inside WikiLeaks: My Time with Julian Assange and the World's Most Dangerous Website.It also uses material from WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy, by British journalists David Leigh and Luke Harding.Assange continued: "Feature films are the most powerful and insidious shapers of public perception, because they fly under the radar of conscious exclusion. This film is going to bury good people doing good work, at exactly the time that the state is coming down on their heads."It is going to smother the truthful version of events, at a time when the truth is most in demand."As justification it will claim to be fiction, but it is not fiction. It is distorted truth about living people doing battle with titanic opponents. It is a work of political opportunism, revenge and, above all, cowardice."The email was published in full on a number of websites including Variety.In comments accompanying the release of the letter, Assange said the DreamWorks film, directed by Bill Condon, was "a geriatric snoozefest that only the US government could love."WikiLeaks angered the United States in 2010 by publishing hundreds of thousands of classified documents on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and US diplomatic cables.In June 2012, Assange walked into the Ecuadorean embassy in London when his appeal against extradition to Sweden, for questioning on accusations of sex crimes, was turned down.He denies the allegations and claims they are politically motivated, but Britain refuses to grant him safe passage out of the country, leaving him stuck inside the embassy.In January's email Assange warned Cumberbatch: "You will be used, as a hired gun, to assume the appearance of the truth in order to assassinate it. To present me as someone morally compromised and to place me in a falsified history. To create a work, not of fiction, but of debased truth.""Not because you want to, of course you don't, but because, in the end, you are a jobbing actor who gets paid to follow the script, no matter how debauched."Cumberbatch revealed last month that he had considered quitting the movie after receiving the email, which he called a "considered, thorough, charming and intelligent account" of why he should not take part.</body>

      <body>Actor and director Simon Callow is to receive an award for outstanding contribution to British theatre at this year's UK Theatre Awards.Callow, 64, made his stage debut at the Edinburgh Festival in 1973.Since then, he has directed more than 30 productions and worked with the Royal Shakespeare Company, the National Theatre and in London's West End.He will tour the UK this year in a revival of Francois Billetdoux's comedy Chin-Chin with Felicity Kendal.Rachel Tackley, president of the Theatre Managers' Association said she was "delighted" to give Callow the award."[He] has had a vital and lasting influence on theatre stages all over the country and been a great ambassador for British theatre during a long and illustrious career," she added.Callow is known for his one-man plays, including a version of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, The Importance of Being Oscar and Inside Wagner's Head, which he performed earlier this year at the Royal Opera House's Linbury Studio; and The Man Jesus at the Lyric Belfast.As well as stage work, Callow has appeared in many popular films, including Four Weddings and a Funeral, Shakespeare in Love, Phantom of the Opera and Amadeus.The UK Theatre Awards recognise stage productions presented throughout England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Actor Edward Petherbridge, director Sir Jonathan Miller and playwright Sir Alan Ayckbourn are among those up for this year's honours, which will be distributed at London's Guildhall on 20 October.</body>

      <title>Tori Amos debuts 'magical' musical</title>
      <description>Singer Tori Amos says it was "magical" to see her long-awaited debut stage musical open at the National Theatre.</description>

      <date>1381389773</date>
      <body>Singer Tori Amos says it was "magical" to see her long-awaited debut stage musical open at the National Theatre.The Light Princess, which Amos co-wrote with Samuel Adamson, is based on George MacDonald's 19th Century fairy tale about a girl who floats in the air.They have given the story a modern twist, examining the impact of grief and sexual awakening on teenagers."Its been a completely inspiring project - it's pushed me," said Amos immediately after the opening night.The American singer-songwriter - whose 13 albums include Little Earthquakes and Under The Pink - has been working on the The Light Princess for more than five years.It had been scheduled to open in April 2012, but was postponed for rewrites at the suggestion of National Theatre boss Sir Nicholas Hytner.Both Amos and Adamson told the BBC the delay had made their writing partnership stronger."Musicals take a long time to get right, the ecology of them is quite delicate," said Adamson."I think it's stronger as a result of the delay and we pulled our socks up, frankly."Staged at the Lyttleton Theatre, The Light Princess is directed by Marianne Elliott, whose theatre credits include War Horse and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.Like those productions, The Light Princess mixes live action with puppetry and back projection.The story takes place in opposing kingdoms where a princess and a prince have lost their mothers.In one kingdom, Princess Althea - unable to cry - becomes light with grief and floats into the air. In the other, Prince Digby becomes so heavy-hearted that he can never smile and trains as a soldier."There were areas we wanted to pursue that were not in the original fairytale," explained Adamson."Lightness is metaphor for all sorts of things that teenagers of either gender go through."Teenagers of any age deal with drugs and sex and finding out who they are, and we wanted to make sure that within the fairytale context that we addressed all those issues."Amos, who has a 13-year-old daughter, added: "It is a rite if passage becoming an adult - it's really tough whether in your teens or your 20s having to be responsible and to deal with things. These are not easy times."Our biggest challenge was that we had to make sure that a fairytale could work in the 21st century."The role of the 16-year-old floating princess Althea is played by flame-haired Rosalie Craig, who on stage resembles a young Tori Amos.The actress sings and acts, seemingly effortlessly, while upside down or being twirled around in the air."It's something I've learned over time, now it's second nature - it's as big a surprise to me as anyone," she said.Having composed her debut stage musical, Amos isn't ruling out writing another one."Being a writing partnership - which is what I have become with Sam - I wouldn't be hurt if he went off and wrote with someone else. I would understand that," she said."But if I got another crack at it I'd sure like Samuel Adamson along for the ride."</body>

      <body>More than one million people visited this summer's Gromit Unleashed arts trail in Bristol, bringing more than £75m to the city, organisers have said.Wallace and Gromit's Grand Appeal said 1.18 million people saw the sculptures, based on the famous Aardman animation.The 81 5ft (1.5m) dogs were decorated by artists and celebrities, including Sir Quentin Blake and Jools Holland.Aardman's chairman David Sproxton hopes to set up another project in 2015 involving Shaun the Sheep.Mr Sproxton said everyone at the Bristol-based company had been "bowled over" by the way people responded to the sculptures."Gromit Unleashed is the most successful project we've ever done beyond what we're usually associated with."We keep being asked 'what's next?' and it's certainly going to be a challenge to top this."The project partners are keen to see if we can scale up the idea with Shaun the Sheep in 2015 and roll it out nationally - or even internationally."Mr Sproxton said the project was at an exploratory stage but, with 2015 being the Chinese Year of the Sheep, it seemed like the "perfect time".The Gromit sculptures, which each weighed about 90lb (40kg), were on show in and around the city from 1 July to 8 September.They went to auction on 3 October, and raised over £2.3m for the Wallace and Gromit's Grand Appeal, the Bristol Children's Hospital Charity.A total of 92 lots - which included an additional 11 3ft (1m) Gromits weighing 33lb (15kg) each - made up the fundraising total.Pixar's Gromit Lightyear - based on the Toy Story character - was the star lot, reaching £65,000.Nicola Masters, director of Wallace and Gromit's Grand Appeal, said: "The figures are astonishing but the economic impact is only part of the equation as the project has not only helped bring people to visit this wonderful city, but got Bristol people out to explore parts of the city they have never seen before."The charity said the direct impact of the Gromit Unleashed project was more than £77m, which includes money spent on paid accommodation, travel, gifts and refreshments.Just over half of the visitors were from Bristol, with 42% coming from around the UK and the remaining 2% from overseas, in particular North America, Europe and Australia.Nearly 900,000 visitors came to the city specifically to see the sculptures, it is claimed.</body>

      <title>Banksy 'may abandon commercial art'</title>
      <description>Graffiti artist Banksy, who recently began a month-long unofficial residency painting the streets of New York, has suggested he may abandon art galleries.</description>

      <date>1381333491</date>
      <body>Graffiti artist Banksy, who recently began a month-long unofficial residency painting the streets of New York, has suggested he may abandon art galleries."I started painting on the street because it was the only venue that would give me a show," the British artist told the Village Voice."Now I have to keep painting on the street to prove to myself it wasn't a cynical plan," he said."Commercial success is a mark of failure for a graffiti artist.""We're not supposed to be embraced in that way."In a rare interview with the New York publication conducted via email, the self-styled guerilla artist - whose identity remains a secret - appears to regret his commercial success, which has seen celebrities such as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie paying millions of dollars for his artwork."Obviously people need to get paid - otherwise you'd only get vandalism made by part-timers and trust-fund kids," said Banksy, who is believed to be former public schoolboy Robin Gunningham."But it's complicated, it feels like as soon as you profit from an image you've put on the street, it magically transforms that piece into advertising.""When graffiti isn't criminal, it loses most of its innocence."'Pointless'The premise of his new project is to create a new piece of art on the streets of New York, for each day in October.Entitled Better Out Than In, the public art show promised "elaborate graffiti, large scale street sculpture, video installations and substandard performance art"."I know street art can feel increasingly like the marketing wing of an art career, so I wanted to make some art without the price tag attached.""There is no gallery show or book or film. It's pointless," he said. "Which hopefully means something."However, in some quarters at least, his work appears to have been met with hostility. His first piece - entitled The Street Is In Play - which depicted two boys reaching for a spray can inside an official Graffiti is a Crime sign was defaced and painted over in less than 24 hours.His second and third efforts were met with a similar fate: "I used to think other graffiti writers hated me because I used stencils, but they just hate me."As promised, Banksy - who is living incognito in the US city - also unveiled videos and sculptures as part of the residency.He claimed he had been focusing on sculpture following success with his Oscar-nominated documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop in 2010."I've been learning to make big sculptures out of clay - partly because it's a challenge and partly because after a year in an editing studio I wanted to do something standing up.""It seems to me the best way to make money out of art is to not even try," said the artist, whose works have been physically cut from the concrete they were painted on and sold at auction all over the world."It doesn't take much to be a successful artist - all you need to do is dedicate your entire life to it."</body>

      <title>Hanks: Diabetes restricts my choices</title>
      <description>Tom Hanks says he has had to rule out roles which require drastic weight gain following his diagnosis with Type 2 diabetes.</description>

      <body>Tom Hanks has ruled out taking on roles which require drastic weight gain following his diagnosis with Type 2 diabetes.The two-time Oscar- winning actor has often taken on roles that have required him to manipulate his weight, such as Castaway and A League Of Their Own.But he told the BBC those sort of roles were "a young man's game".Hanks is in the UK to promote sea piracy thriller Captain Phillips, which opened the London Film Festival.He added: "I've talked to a number of actors who have gained weight for roles and - just out of the sheer physical toll on one's knees and shoulders - no-one wants to do it again."I think that's more or less a young man's game. I'm 57 and I don't think I'm going to take on any job - or go on any vacation again - and see to it that I can gain 30lbs."The actor revealed he had been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes on US TV's Late Show with David Letterman earlier this week.He told Letterman he had been showing the symptoms for some time."I went to the doctor, and he said, 'You know those high blood-sugar numbers you've been dealing with since you were 36? Well, you've graduated! You've got Type 2 diabetes, young man.The actor, who won best acting Oscars for Philadelphia and Forrest Gump, added: "It's controllable. Something's going to kill us all, Dave,"Type 2 diabetes affects the body by either not producing enough insulin - the hormone that turns sugar into energy - or by resisting insulin.People might get diabetes because of family history, age and ethnic background. They are also more likely to get Type 2 diabetes if they are overweight.Speaking at the Captain Phillips press conference on Wednesday, Hanks said: "Gaining and losing of weight may have had something to do with this because you eat so much bad food and you don't get any exercise when you're heavy."But I think I was genetically inclined to get it and I think it actually and goes back to a lifestyle I've been leading ever since I was seven years old, as opposed to 36."The actor added his diabetes was "part of life" and he felt "just fine".In a later interview with BBC Arts Editor Will Gompertz, Hanks said: "I always joke: you've got to maintain the temple. I get regular exercise and I eat right - which everybody should do - and I take certain meds."He said pizza was a key ingredient when he bulked up for roles. "Pizza is the most delightful thing ever invented and it's - for me - diabolically dangerous."Asked about recent developments in the entertainment industry, Hanks said the advent of long-form television had "changed the game"."The time you get to spend with the characters has made it possible to become truly engrossed in really great story telling at home," he said."The economics of making movies and showing them are harder than they have ever been with an audience that can see almost anything they want to any time."Hanks is receiving Oscar buzz for his role in Captain Phillips, which is based on the true story of the 2009 hijacking of the US container ship Maersk Alabama by a crew of Somali pirates.The film focuses on the relationship between the Alabama's commanding officer, Captain Richard Phillips (Hanks) and the Somali pirate captain, Muse (Barkhad Abdi), who takes him hostage.Hanks said he met the real Captain Phillips on two occasions and spent several hours with him to find out the "little details".The film's British director Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy, United 93) said it was a "great honour and privilege" to have his film opening a festival "in a city where a lot of movies are made".</body>

      <title>Saunders reconsiders Ab Fab film</title>
      <description>Comedian Jennifer Saunders says she hopes to get the long-delayed Absolutely Fabulous film off the ground next year.</description>

      <body>Jennifer Saunders says she hopes to get the long-discussed Absolutely Fabulous film off the ground next year.The comedy writer and actress told BBC Radio 4's Front Row that, after years of delays, she may finally bow to pressure from fans."Because everyone's saying 'Why don't you write it?', I'm thinking 'Yeah, why don't I write it?'," said Saunders."It would be quite easy, Joanna Lumley would like it. You know, I might well do it," she continued.Saunders, who played PR Edina Monsoon in the hit comedy series opposite Lumley's magazine editor Patsy Stone, said she felt a lot of pressure to deliver a script that was good enough."Everyone keeps going, 'Oh why don't you do a film? Why don't you do some more?'. And you keep thinking, 'Because the expectation is so high!'"You think 'Well we could really mess it up'. And so, why mess up something that is actually still perceived as being quite good?"But, with her diary currently clear for 2014, Saunders said the film was looking more likely than ever."I'll do something, I've got some little pet projects that I keep tinkering away with," she said."One of them might be the Ab Fab film, I don't know. As we're going into winter, a nice little summertime film seems rather attractive."Saunders recently resurrected Absolutely Fabulous for three special episodes to celebrate the sitcom's 20th anniversary.They were aired on BBC One on Christmas Day 2011, New Year's Day 2012 and in July to mark the London 2012 Olympic Games.Since then, the comedian has seen her short-lived Spice Girls musical open and close within six months.Saunders said she did not know whether Viva Forever!, which was produced by Mamma Mia's Judy Cramer, would ever return to the stage.Front Row's Mark Lawson asked her if she blamed critics for its failure:"I sort of do, yes. People were saying, 'Oh you'd better have your hard hat on because they're going to go for you'. And that was before anyone had ever seen it. So there was that feeling around that they were waiting to give it a bad review," she said."It was such a massive oil tanker of a thing to get going because of all the rights and the music and the orchestrations. And the castings, which are so bizarre, because every part has to be covered by someone else who's already in the cast, and all the dancers and all the rest of it."It's just a massive vehicle. It was an astounding thing to work on."Saunders has just published her autobiography, Bonkers: My Life in Laughs."I probably wouldn't have written it if someone hadn't asked me to write it, that's the truth. I always said I'd never write a book. Dawn (French) has written a book - it seemed like really hard work," she said."It was all Clare Balding's fault. She wrote that terrific book, I went to her book launch and was persuaded by her rather charming editor to have a go. So I did."You can hear the full interview on Front Row on BBC Radio 4 at 19:00 BST on Wednesday, 9 October.</body>

      <body>Rapper Coolio has surprised a group of students by cooking them a meal and performing in their front room.The impromptu performance of his 1995 hit Gangsta's Paradise came after the students met the American star at a gig in Preston.Before performing, he prepared a three-course meal after taking the students to a supermarket to buy ingredients.A film of the performance made by one of the students has received around one million views on YouTube.Fashion student Olivia Johnson-Aley, from Liverpool said it was "such a crazy and surreal moment, I had to film it"."It is amazing how many people have already watched it," she said. "We have been getting calls from media in the UK and America ever since."The 50-year-old hip-hop star had been performing at Macs Bar in Preston when he met the students and offered to cook them a meal.Law student Melissa Bryan, 21, from the Isle of Man said the rapper said he would "cook for us and he was true to his word".She said his "delicious" menu comprised of Coolio's Caprese Salad, Chicken á la Daaaamn, and Peach Crumble.Miss Bryan said that the food was "great and the sing-along was even better"."I was three when Gangsta's Paradise was released but it is a classic."We all knew the words off by heart. Every student does."Coolio, who has sold more than 17 million albums worldwide, has sold more than six million copies of Gangsta's Paradise since its release.Lorcan O'Mahony, who accompanied the rapper on his guitar, said he had "conveniently left" it in the room when he heard the rapper was coming to the house."After dinner, I asked if he would perform Gangsta's Paradise and we all got involved."It is something I will never forget."He added that he had "only learnt the chords a few hours earlier".The rapper eventually left the house at 03:00 BST to catch a flight.</body>

      <body>An Irish primary school has been asked to change the date of a major religious event for Catholic children because it clashes with a pop concert.About 30 pupils at Raheen Gaelscoil in Limerick city are due to receive their First Communion in May 2014.However, a number of the eight-year-olds have tickets for a One Direction concert in Dublin on the same day and some parents wanted the date changed.The school balloted all the families, who voted to keep the original date.The Irish Independent newspaper reported that there were "heated exchanges" during a school meeting on Tuesday night when the parents of three children insisted that the Communion celebrations should be moved to another day so their children could attend the concert.The paper said other parents who attended the meeting were infuriated by what one described as "disrespect shown to the blessed sacrament".First Communion is one of the seven sacraments of the Catholic faith. Children usually receive their First Communion between the ages of seven and eight and the ceremony is normally organised by their primary school.In a statement, Raheen Gaelscoil (Gaelscoil an Ráithín) said: "Further to requests from a small number of parents to change the planned date of May 24 next for the reception of Holy Communion for the first time for our 2nd Class (Year Two) pupils, Gaelscoil an Ráithín, in order to reach the fairest outcome for all concerned, balloted parents overnight on this matter."The result of that ballot has been overwhelmingly in favour of retaining the original date," the statement added."Staff, parents and children of Gaelscoil an Ráithín look forward to preparing for this very special celebration next May."Tickets for One Direction's three Dublin concerts sold out within minutes of going on sale last month and some have been placed on sale on other websites for more than twice face value.The pop group shot to fame three years ago, after auditioning as solo singers for the ITV talent show, The X Factor.Since then, they have had more than 60 chart-topping singles and albums across the world.They are also the first British band since The Beatles to have two number one albums in the same year in the US charts.</body>

      <title>Appeal Court jails child sex artist</title>
      <description>Artist Graham Ovenden is jailed after his suspended sentence for child sex offences was found to be "unduly lenient".</description>

      <date>1381338030</date>
      <body>Internationally-renowned artist Graham Ovenden has been jailed after his suspended sentence for child sex offences was found by the Court of Appeal to be "unduly lenient".Ovenden, 70, of Bodmin Moor, Cornwall, has had his sentence increased to two years and three months in custody.In June, he was given a 12-month term, suspended for two years.He was convicted at Truro Crown Court of six counts of indecency with a child and one of indecent assault.After his trial, Ovenden was cleared on three counts of indecency and two of indecent assault.He was accused of abusing children, as young as six, who posed for his paintings in the 1970s and '80s at his studio in Cornwall and former home in Hounslow, west London.The sentence was referred to the Court of Appeal by Attorney General Dominic Grieve and reviewed by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, sitting with Mr Justice Henriques and Mr Justice Blake.Lord Thomas, who said Ovenden had not shown a "shred of remorse" for his victims, ruled the sentence passed at Plymouth Crown Court should not have been suspended and imposed the prison term.The judges rejected the defendant's claims that his interest in young girls was artistic and not sexual.Lord Thomas said the girls had "no understanding of the true purpose" behind what Ovenden was doing."There was no doubt that his purpose was sexual," he said. "There is no doubt that he had a sexual interest in children."He added Ovenden's reputation as a landscape artist enabled those who were closest to the children to trust him.The judges heard a bid by the defendant, who denied abusing his subjects, to challenge his conviction.He had previously admitted taking the pictures of children, including those in various states of undress, but claimed they were not indecent.The court rejected his application for permission to appeal, ruling the verdicts were "safe".Lord Thomas said the court had seen victim impact statements in which they described how giving evidence at Ovenden's trial was the worst experience of their lives.When suspending the prison term, the sentencing judge Judge Graham Cottle said he took into account Ovenden's age, the length of time since the offences, and his "steep fall from grace and irretrievably tarnished reputation".But it was argued on behalf of the Attorney General that "reputational impact" was not a reason for suspending the sentence.Lord Thomas said Ovenden had shown "no contrition", maintaining that he had done nothing wrong.Following his trial, Ovenden had claimed he was the victim of a "global witch-hunt against artists"."He seeks to blame others and asserts a conspiracy against him," Lord Thomas said."It is self-evident he has no understanding of the very serious harm he has done to the victims by his serious criminal misconduct."He still asserts that art is being put on trial. That is nonsensical bearing in mind the facts."Speaking after the hearing, Mr Grieve said: "Graham Ovenden committed terrible sexual offences against vulnerable young girls who were in his charge and ought to have felt safe. He manipulated them and abused his position of trust."The Court of Appeal agrees that the 12-month suspended sentence handed to him was unduly lenient, and I am satisfied they have replaced it with 27 months' custody."It is right that sexual crimes, whether committed many years ago or more recently, should be punished appropriately."Following Ovenden's conviction, the Tate removed more than 30 prints from its online collection.</body>

      <body>Thousands of school children are being given the chance to explore the work of poet Dylan Thomas as part of centenary celebrations.Developing Dylan will see 2,000 sessions on the poet run in schools across Wales between now and next July.The creative writing workshops are part of the Swansea-based Dylan Thomas 100 Festival, marking 100 years since his birth.The project was launched at Fitzalan High School in Cardiff."Developing an interest in literature from an early age is an essential part of inspiring our young people to write and create their own stories," said the Welsh education minister Huw Lewis at the launch.""Literacy is a skill needed throughout a person's life and it's extremely important we develop and refine this skill."It's for that reason, improving standards of literacy is at the heart of my raising standards and performance across the board here in Wales."The Welsh government and the UK's Department for Education and Skills are jointly funding the new project.The workshops have been developed for children aged from seven to 16, and reflect the current demands of the national curriculum followed in Wales at Key Stages 2, 3 and 4.Speaking at the launch of the project in Cardiff, Dylan Thomas's granddaughter, Hannah Ellis, said the workshops would help "captivate and delight children"."They can experiment and play with language, discover how magical each and every word is, and sneak through the doors of the 'two storied houses', and learn about the secrets that lie beyond."The Dylan Thomas 100 Festival is a year long event to mark the birth of the poet in Swansea in 1914.The festival, for which Prince Charles is the royal patron, will see theatre, television and film performances, as well as exhibitions and workshops such as Developing Dylan.</body>

      <title>Ford up for Blade Runner sequel</title>
      <description>Actor Harrison Ford has revealed he has been talking to director Sir Ridley Scott about appearing in a sequel to cult movie Blade Runner.</description>

      <date>1381324830</date>
      <body>Actor Harrison Ford says he has been talking to director Sir Ridley Scott about appearing in a sequel to cult sci-fi movie Blade Runner.The Indiana Jones star told a games and entertainment website that he and British film-maker Scott had "been chatting about it"."I truly admire Ridley as a man and as a director," he told IGN.com."I would be very happy to engage again with him in the further telling of this story," added the 71-year-old star.Two years ago, producers announced that Sir Ridley was planning a follow-up to his mysterious 1982 tale, which blended sci-fi and noir detective novels.Alcon Entertainment said the film would be a prequel or sequel, rather than a remake of the original movie - which was based on Philip K Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?Ford played Rick Deckard, a police officer who hunts down genetically engineered lifelike robots, known as replicants. It co-starred Sean Young, Rutger Hauer and Daryl Hannah.At the time, producer Andrew Kosove said it was unlikely Ford would return in his role as Rick Deckard."In no way do I speak for Ridley Scott, but if you're asking me will this movie have anything to do with Harrison Ford? The answer is no."This is a total reinvention, and in my mind that means doing everything fresh, including casting."Despite receiving two Oscar nominations for special effects, the original Blade Runner was a sleeper hit - it received lukewarm reviews at the time of its release but flourished on home video.In 1993, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".</body>

      <body>Disney-owned animation studio Pixar is to close its studio in Vancouver, Canada, resulting in 100 job losses."A decision was made to refocus operations and resources under the one roof," Barb Matheson, a Disney spokesman told Canadian news site The Province.Since it opened in 2010, Pixar Canada has made short animated films Air Mater and Partysaurus Rex.All of the film studio's operations will now be based in California.Disney Pixar is responsible for hit films such as Brave, Up and Finding Nemo. The Vancouver studio was responsible for producing short films based on established Pixar characters such as Woody and Buzz Lightyear from the Toy Story movies.The closure is seen as a surprise within the industry as Canada has been a fertile ground for digital production companies drawn to Vancouver by tax incentives.A statement from Pixar, published in Variety magazine, said: "The team at Pixar Canada is incredibly talented and we are so proud of the excellent work we have produced there."However, as we look at the creative and business needs of our studio, we've made the decision to refocus our efforts and resources under one roof in Emeryville and will be closing the studio in Vancouver."</body>

      <title>BBC Playlister service goes live</title>

      <body>A beta version of the BBC Playlister, a new digital service that allows listeners to tag any piece of music they hear on the BBC and listen to it later, has gone live.BBC Radio 1's Zane Lowe claimed the project puts the BBC "at the heart of what is happening now"."The whole essence of radio is to communicate: To be able to say 'I love this song'."Now we can really listen to what [the audience] is into and what they love."The aim of Playlister is to give audiences an easy way to find out what music is being played on BBC Radio networks (and, later, on BBC TV shows) and to listen to it again.From Wednesday, every song played on BBC radio will be made listed on the relevant programme website.Anyone with a BBC account can click an "add this" button to add tracks to a personal playlist, and export them to a outside streaming service, such as YouTube, Deezer and Spotify, where they can be played back in full.The homepage of the Playlister website also lists the BBC's most recently-played songs, as well as the most popular or most searched-for music.Mark Friend, BBC controller for multi-platform radio and music, said the service was "easy to use [and] accessible for everyone", adding that it would "join up your BBC experiences with the music experiences you have on the rest of the internet".The launch comes one year on from the launch of BBC iPlayer radio, which "brought together all of the music and the radio from the BBC into one online product... and transformed the BBC's role in digital music," he said.Following the initial Playlister launch on Wednesday, further developments will include the launch of the same functions within the iPlayer radio app, broadening the Playlister to include number of TV programmes - such as Strictly Come Dancing and The Voice - and the introduction of presenter playlists.The presenter playlist will allow BBC DJs and presenters "to be able to curate their own chosen music and present that to the audience" within the Playlister function."It's about enhancing people's music experience," explained Mark Foster, of Deezer, one of the BBC Playlister's commercial partners."A service like ours has 25 million tracks... being able to use trusted curators, like Zane, is all about building trust, building confidence and helping people navigate through this fantastic selection of music that we have.""The ability to discover music and follow people whose musical taste has really shaped yours is going to add a really level of texture to our services," echoed Chris Maples, of fellow commercial partner Spotify.Playlister "will influence the way we make radio," said Lowe, adding, "the traffic goes both ways; communication between presenters and the audience becomes very direct."Playlister gives the BBC a chance to do that globally, which is a big part of what the BBC's future.""People want to keep up-to-date," added Maples. "What's really cool about this is that I can take the perceived cool of Zane and add it to my playlist."Statistics suggest that last year, more than 26 million people listened to music on the BBC radio network every single week and nearly 50 million watched some music from the BBC."Audiences want an easy way to find out and remember the music they hear on our programmes and to get good music recommendations," said Mr Friend"Playlister presents a huge creative opportunity, not just to the audience, but also to us the programme-makers."</body>

      <title>Robin Thicke ad ruled 'too sexual'</title>
      <description>An advert featuring singer Robin Thicke performing his number one hit Blurred Lines must not be shown before 19:30 as it is too sexual, the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) rules.</description>

      <date>1381281844</date>
      <body>An advert featuring singer Robin Thicke performing his number one hit Blurred Lines must not be shown before 19:30 as it is too sexual, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has said.The ruling was made after 97 complaints about the ad for Beats Pill speakers, which features scantily clad women.The ASA said while it accepted some viewers might find the ad distasteful, it would not cause widespread offence.However, it ruled the "overall tone" was sexual.The advert, which is based on the controversial music video for Thicke's song, shows three female models dancing and interacting with the product while dressed in hot pants and crop tops.It also features one woman kneeling on her hands and knees with a Beats Pill laid on her back.Those that complained said the commercial was sexist, objectified women and was degrading to women.Others said it was inappropriate at a time when children would be watching.In its response, Beats Electronics International said the advert was not intended to be offensive or encourage any inappropriate stereotypes, saying the women were confident, self-assured individuals who were "not subservient to the male character".It added the dominant images were of the product being used as dumbbells, a hotdog, binoculars and medicine, which were "strong, playful images that most viewers would not see as having any sexual connotation".In its ruling, the ASA acknowledged some viewers could find elements of the advert distasteful - "particularly the shots of the women's bodies with their heads obscured and the shot of the woman on all fours".It said as the shots were brief, it did not consider the ad - when taken as a whole - showed any sustained, overtly sexual or provocative behaviour.However, it concluded the overall tone was sexual and was not suitable for broadcast before 19:30.The unrated video for Thicke's Blurred Lines - in which the female models appeared topless - was branded misogynistic and banned from YouTube earlier this year.A second version of the video, featuring the women in the same outfits they wore in the Beats Pill advert, later replaced the original.</body>

      <title>Romeo and Juliet gets classic revamp</title>
      <description>Julian Fellowes updates Romeo and Juliet for a new audience</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24442185</url>
      <date>1381377956</date>
      <body>Academy award-winning screenwriter and Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes is renowned for his period dramas.For his latest project, he has adapted one of Shakespeare's most celebrated love stories, Romeo and Juliet.Fellowes' version is the latest in a string of adaptations of the famous tale and follows Baz Luhrmann's successful 1996 update, starring Leonardo Di Caprio and Claire Danes.Where Lurhmann's film captivated teenage audiences with its contemporary style, Fellowes' update, directed by Carlo Carlei, seeks to take a "different approach" more akin to Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 classic, narrated by Laurence Olivier."That was the last one in medieval costume and filmed against the walls of the castles of Italy," says Fellowes, whose update is set in the northern city of Verona."That did seem a long time not to have revisited it in film in the traditional storytelling, romantic context."But Fellowes has been criticised by Shakespeare experts for rewriting certain passages and altering the language used in the Bard's work.He rejects the criticism, saying the film was never intended to be a straight adaptation of the original."When people say we should have filmed the original, I don't attack them for that point of view, but to see the original in its absolutely unchanged form, you require a kind of Shakespearian scholarship and you need to understand the language and analyse it and so on."I can do that because I had a very expensive education, I went to Cambridge. Not everyone did that and there are plenty of perfectly intelligent people out there who have not been trained in Shakespeare's language choices."Film producer Ileen Maisel chose Fellowes, who won the best screenplay Oscar for Gosford Park in 2002, to write the script as she wanted someone who could "update Shakespeare's language and story while staying true to its poetic cadence and compelling plot lines".Fellowes adds: "We wanted [a wider group] to enjoy a version of Romeo and Juliet much more than they would expect to."That was our goal, to allow them to enjoy the great beauty of the speeches, but at the same time to tell the story in a way they could follow and wouldn't feel alienated or left out," he says.The cast features the young Oscar-nominated American actress Hailee Steinfeld as Juliet alongside Douglas Booth - the British model and actor who gained acclaim for his portrayal of Boy George in the 2010 BBC Two drama, Worried About the Boy.Homeland star Damian Lewis and Oscar-nominated US actor Paul Giamatti add further international appeal as Lord Capulet and Friar Lawrence.Booth says the film's Italian setting and sumptuous costumes helped its authenticity, also aided by the fact the acting protagonists are close in age to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.Fellowes adds Steinfeld's youth "is a tremendous bonus in the film". She was 15 at the time of filming, two years older than the original Juliet."We intended from the start to get an actress who was as young and who could reasonably play her," he explains."There is something about real youth as opposed to Max Factor youth that is very moving."With first love - when it blots out everything else - when the protagonists are very young, you can believe that disproportionate reality of love that seems to transcend everything else in your life. I feel that's what Hailee gave to us."Booth says the element of youthfulness was one of the reasons he wanted to be involved in the film."The chance to play Romeo doesn't come along every day and the chance to bring this to a new generation was tempting."It's terrifying at first as it comes with a whole load of baggage, but it was a challenge and that's why I wanted to take it on."I wanted to take that baggage and throw it out the window and start fresh with the character."By us being younger, I thought it would bring a different take on the film, an innocence that had not been done before."Before Romeo and Juliet, Booth appeared in Fellowes' From Time To Time alongside Dame Maggie Smith and Timothy Spall, before landing the role of Boy George in the BBC's drama."Playing Romeo was completely different to Boy George, but at the same time you have to find the human core of who these people are," he adds.Booth credits Lewis and Giamatti with being "inspirational" on set, particularly Giamatti for helping to create a realistic, tender relationship between Romeo and the friar.Fellowes says he wanted Friar Lawrence to embody a surrogate, paternal role, particularly as Lord Montagu doesn't have much of a look in."There is a kind of gap in Romeo's back story of an adult who loves him and I think Lawrence fits that very naturally."Where the relationship between Juliet and her nurse, played by Lesley Manville, is pretty faithful to the original - caring and comedic in equal measure - Fellows saw the friar as a "slightly odd character" whose motives for intervening in the young lovers' lives are "difficult to understand"."I did feel that if we could find in the character a genuine affection for Romeo and a desire for his happiness - and beyond that a desire for his marriage to make the community happier and to end the dispute that is ruining everyone's lives - then his involvement would become more logical and easier to understand."Romeo and Juliet is released in UK cinemas on Friday 11 October.</body>

      <title>The band who opened a record shop</title>
      <description>Is this Britain's hardest working band?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24437766</url>
      <date>1381284402</date>
      <body>When indie band Frankie and the Heartstrings released their second album this summer, they were so alarmed by the lack of record shops in which to sell it that they decided to open their own."We were coming to the completion of our second record and the main story on the news one day was the fact HMV had gone bust," says singer Frankie Francis."At the time, a couple of local record shops had gone bust as well. We thought 'We've got this record coming out, but there might not actually be anywhere to sell it on the High Street.'"So we thought we'd take a stand and open our own record shop."With help from Sunderland City Council, the band took over the empty tourist office in their home town. "There's no call for it any more, for various reasons," Francis says solemnly.Pop Recs Ltd was only supposed to open for two weeks to mark their album's release in June. But the band say the reaction has been so good that they are keeping it open for as long as they can and have plans for in-store gigs through to next February.Four out of the five bandmates work there full time and, last month, the venture earned them the title of hardest working band in Britain from the Association of Independent Music.When I visit, the lead singer is manning the coffee machine, busily grinding beans and frothing milk as the shop fills up before an in-store gig by visiting Manchester band Dutch Uncles.Drummer Dave Harper and bassist Steve Dennis are behind the counter in a state of harangued dishevelment - passing coffee cups, jabbing the till, fetching supplies, pausing to chat to friends.Indie circuit stalwarts, Frankie and the Heartstrings made the top 40 with their debut album in 2011 and have a loyal live following, but are still waiting for that breakthrough to the big time."We're a band with not much money… and we've put what money we have into this project just to show bands can take a stand," Francis says."If we can do it on a street level, why can't people further up in the music business be as proactive as us?"We're engaging with loads of bands and labels to come and do things and because of that we're selling records in Sunderland for all these bands. That wouldn't have happened if this project didn't exist."But does it really matter whether we have real record shops selling real records any more? "I guess it matters more to us because we're in a band and we know how many records people sell," Francis replies."Even 10 years ago you would have sold double, three times, four times the amount of records that you sell now."I think it's very important to engage with people and make them realise the value of actually owning music, especially on vinyl because we're very romantic in that we take a lot of time over the artwork and the way it's laid out and the way the whole thing feels and looks."We just want to try and make that connect with people and explain to them why it's such a cherished item."A few months ago, Francis was simply a flamboyant indie rock front man. Now, he talks about business plans and the deals he has struck with various record labels."We're five kids from Sunderland who have been messing around in the back of a van for five years touring the world," he says."It's quite easy to slip back into the crazy gang mentality, but we've had to put our businessmen heads on."The group's second album missed the top 40 and they are now between record contracts. With minimal money to be made from album sales, mid-ranking indie bands must find other sources of income.Dutch Uncles are critical favourites but their three albums have not troubled the top 40. Singer Duncan Wallis says the idea of making money from selling records just does not occur to bands such as his."It's just not something you really consider," he says. "You only think about the money to be made out of touring, at this level anyway."Frankie and the Heartstrings say they have sacrificed summer festival fees in order to work in the shop, which earns them "enough to get by, and that's all we care about".The alternative would be much worse - getting proper jobs."The shop, if you maintain it correctly, could become an income for the band," Francis says. "If it wasn't for the shop we would all have to be in work now."Until now, the band have survived on the money they have made from their music. When a pizza company used one of their songs in a TV advert, the group lived for a year on the proceeds.Francis says: "I don't think there's any shame in that any more because you don't make any money from selling records, so you've got to make an income somehow."In the store, the band also sell their own coffee blend and brand of beer, and Francis admits they make more money from coffee than records most days. Like many other independent record stores, they know they cannot survive by selling music alone.Work by local artists and photographers adorns the walls and there are dedicated racks promoting records by local bands."We've had kids from the local area who've come into the shop, bought some records and the next week they've come in and said, 'We've just started a band, can we have a gig in here?'" Francis says.But the most prominent space is reserved for the new album by Frankie and the Heartstrings.The singer laughs: "If we're going to run a record shop, we're going to be number one in the charts every week in this store."</body>

      <title>The hunt for a long-lost John Wayne film</title>
      <description>Film buffs hunt for a long-lost John Wayne film</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24407455</url>
      <date>1381368054</date>
      <body>John Wayne was the archetypal screen cowboy, embodying the rough independence of the American west for generations of film fans. Now, newly discovered still photographs offer fresh insight into a western he made that was last seen more than three-quarters of a century ago.Kent Sperring was raised in Ocala, Florida, in the 1940s by his mother, a widow who worked as a chemist's clerk."Money was kind of scarce," he said.Luckily, he could see "a double-feature western for nine cents" at the Ritz theatre on Saturdays. The movies made an impression."You came away from the movie knowing that if you did something bad or wrong, you were going to get punished for it," he said.Wayne and other good cowboys wore white hats. The bad ones wore black hats."It was almost that clear-cut," he said. "If you watched the films long enough, you'd see that those bad guys - they didn't end up too well."The films were wildly successful. Today, Wayne ranks as one of the most popular film stars of all time, admired by Sperring and countless others.Yet despite Wayne's iconic stature, one of his films is missing.The Oregon Trail, released by Republic Pictures in 1936, was shown in theatres - then disappeared. There are no known remaining prints.In the film Wayne plays John Delmont, a retired army captain who falls in love with a frontier woman played by Ann Rutherford, who later appears in Gone With the Wind. The plot hinges on the discovery of a journal bound in black that once belonged to Delmont's father.Reading the diary, Delmont learns that his father has been killed or was left to die by a renegade - and vows to hunt down the killer.Earlier this year Sperring, a retired telephone company manager in Duluth, Georgia, discovered 40 still photographs taken on the sets of The Oregon Trail.He came across the photos while ordering Wayne memorabilia from a video store, Eddie Brandt's Saturday Matinee, in North Hollywood."They sent me the negatives," said Sperring. "I think they did it by mistake."Decades ago, photographers would take pictures of actors, either during a scene or after it had been shot, with an 8in by 10in (20cm by 25cm) camera. The photographs, known as movie stills, were then displayed in glass cases outside of theatres.Sperring scanned the stills into a computer and sent them to the Lone Pine Film History Museum in Lone Pine, California, so they could be stored in the archives.These photographs and other promotional material are the film's lasting legacy. They provide insight into the film, showing the locations where it was shot and other details about the production.The promotional materials are also striking images. Aside from the stills, three posters remain. Painted in garish colours, Wayne fords a river in a stagecoach pulled by a team of wild-eyed horses.The Lone Pine museum, which celebrates the western film genre, hosts an annual film festival.This year it will take place from 11-13 October and will feature Jake Thorne in The Life and Legend of John Wayne.Lone Pine museum director Bob Sigman, former president of Republic Pictures, started his own search for the film a decade ago. He prides himself on his hard-nosed approach to the film world. He is the kind of person who says: "I've been in this business a long time.""If we could have brought out The Oregon Trail, it would have generated a million dollars in revenue," he said, standing in a room with klieg lights at the museum last summer.As he spoke, a Comstock Cowboys CD played in the background. The music has simple chords with lonely-guy lyrics: "I rode in the deadwood one dark, stormy evening."Sigman said he believed The Oregon Trail was misfiled and placed in the wrong canister.He picked up a rusted canister, a storage case for movie prints, that been lying on the floor. It was empty, except for a brochure from a 2003 film festival.He said the canister with The Oregon Trail may be sitting in a warehouse somewhere. He has travelled to Latin America in search of the film and has spoken with film distributors in Europe and the UK."I looked all over the world for it," he said. "It is one of the treasures that everybody wants."Should a print be found, it would not be the first time a lost film was rediscovered.Another film from the 1930s featuring Wayne - a pre-censorship version of Baby Face - was missing until a curator found it at the US Library of Congress in 2004.Too Much Johnson, a 1938 picture by Orson Welles, was discovered more recently in an Italian warehouse. The US premiere of the film will take place at the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York, on 16 October.By 1935, when The Oregon Trail was shot, Wayne, then 28, had already appeared in dozens of films.But his career prospects looked grim.His 1930 star turn in Raoul Walsh's The Big Trail was artistically ambitious but flopped at the box office.He spent the next several years appearing in poverty-row westerns, as the low-budget films were called. For a while he worked as a singing cowboy.Yet he was not a quitter. Courage, he once said, "is being scared to death but saddling up anyway".After The Oregon Trail, he appeared in several more films before he was propelled to stardom as the Ringo Kid in John Ford's Stagecoach in 1939.Wayne's earlier films are now prized by collectors and studied by fans and historians.Wayne himself described the work in simple terms. As he said in a BBC interview in 1964, the films tell "the story of the West - the story of a man fighting against the elements".The most compelling characters, he said, were men of action."There's no nuance," he said in a BBC interview in 1974."They drive ahead," Wayne said, "usually fighting something bigger than a petty little argument with someone."A historian at the museum, Chris Langley, is using the movie stills to track down locations where the film was shot. In this way, he hopes to deepen the public's understanding of the movie - and of Wayne.One Saturday morning last summer, Langley tossed a manila folder into the front seat of his car and drove about 10 miles (16km) to the Alabama Hills, where The Oregon Trail was shot in December 1935.Known as Hollywood's back lot, Alabama Hills was also the setting for Gunga Din, a 1939 movie based on a Rudyard Kipling poem, several Firestone tyre commercials, and Quentin Tarantino's recent Django Unchained.Mt Whitney's 14,497ft (4,418m) peak loomed in the distance. Granite rocks were scattered across a lunar landscape.Grabbing the folder, Langley climbed out of the car."I thought if I were ever in trouble, I'd like John Wayne to ride up," he said. "It's like a father figure, but it's more than that."It was a wet morning, with a sharp breeze that wrapped around your legs. Chunks of broken glass jutted from the dirt, and it was quiet. One could hear raindrops splash on dark leaves, and the place smelled like sage and Marlboro Lights."You're now leaning exactly where John Wayne is," said Langley. He held up a movie still. In the photograph Wayne leans against a rock. He wears a white jacket with fringe, cinched with a silver buckle.Sperring is now in Lone Pine for the film festival at the weekend. He too spent time in Alabama Hills, visiting places where Wayne acted out scenes in The Oregon Trail and other films."I don't want to sound goofy, but it's almost like you feel their presence," Sperring said. "It's a good feeling."For Sperring and others, Wayne was part of their childhood. As Joan Didion wrote in a 1965 essay for The Saturday Evening Post: "He determined forever the shape of certain of our dreams."The Oregon Trail is gone, but some things remain."I'll look at a rock that was there 75 years ago," Sperring said."It erodes, but it erodes very slowly because it's hard granite. You look, and you see that very little changes. The rocks will split and fall down, but they are still there."</body>

      <title>'I used to watch 800 films a year'</title>
      <description>London Film Festival boss watches 500 films a year</description>

      <body>The BFI London Film Festival (LFF) opens later with sea piracy thriller Captain Phillips, starring Tom Hanks, directed by British film-maker Paul Greengrass.The film is based on the true story of Captain Richard Phillips, who was taken hostage by Somali pirates in 2009.The festival will close on 20 October with Saving Mr Banks, in which Hanks stars alongside Emma Thompson in the story of how the Disney classic Mary Poppins made it to the big screen.Among the 234 fiction and documentary features over 10 days are screenings of Stephen Frears' Philomena, the true story of a woman's search for her lost son starring Dame Judi Dench and Steve Coogan, and Steve McQueen's 12 Years A Slave, starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender and Benedict Cumberbatch.Other gala screenings include Alfonso Cuaron's space-set thriller Gravity, starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, Ralph Fiennes' The Invisible Woman, a period romance centring on the affair between Charles Dickens and actress Nelly Ternan, and the Coen Brothers' Inside Llewyn Davis, about the 1960s New York folk scene.We spoke to the festival's director Clare Stewart, in charge for a second year, ahead of Wednesday's opening night.The festival is about to start. Is this the calm before the storm?[laughs] There are various elements of the storm along the way. There's the storm of the programme being locked down, there's the pre-production storm that we're in now, and there's the storm of the festival itself.Was it important to you to have a British director opening the festival?Having a British director for the first time since 2006 was a really exciting element, but it was the film itself that completely won me over and, of course, Paul Greengrass knows how to direct a fantastic thriller.Captain Phillips is much more complex than your average action film in that it's based on the true story of a 2009 hijacking of a US container ship by Somali pirates. It looks at two men caught up in something they are not in control of and it reflects on broader global economies and politics.Tom Hanks book-ends the festival. How important is the Hollywood "A list" presence?The LFF plays an increasingly important role in the awards season build-up for both the Baftas and Academy Awards.Big films like Philomena, Gravity, 12 Years a Slave and Inside Llewyn Davis and Jason Reitman's Labor Day are definitely going to be featuring in awards season campaigns.But they also open the festival out to a broader audience and help us to introduce other more surprising, discovery films to people who might be attracted in by these big films.What did you learn from your debut experience in London last year?We made a lot of change to last year's festival, we opened it up to a wider footprint across London, we introduced new programme sections, such as Thrill, Dare and Sonic, and we took a number of big screenings out across the UK.That changed the landscape of the festival by opening it up for new audiences and if that hadn't worked I would have reassessed it. But we had a 13% increase in attendance and 33% of the people coming to the festival last year were first timers.How has that influenced this year?I felt for this year it was important to consolidate that, and let those changes really prove themselves.You previously ran the Sydney Film Festival. Do audiences in London and Sydney differ?I feel that one of the similarities is that there is an adventurousness and an openness to new things. One tangible difference is that here in London the connection to European films is much stronger, whereas obviously in Australia the Asian connection is much stronger.Was there a particular film you had to go the extra mile for to get on your programme?That's a festival director's best kept secret! A number of films are very fresh out of the edit suite and when that happens there's still a lot of thinking going on about release strategy around the world. I was really thrilled to be able to secure our closing night film Saving Mr Banks, which is a world premiere.The one that almost got away is 12 Years Slave. I'm so glad it's there - Steve McQueen's new film is in hot demand around the world and had only just finished in time for Toronto. I was pleased to secure the European premiere for London.What do you say to those who say the LFF is in the shadow of Toronto and Venice film festivals?I think not. Our timing means we have an important role in exposing the great films that have screened in other festivals in the course of the year but have not yet had exposure in the UK, alongside building the profile for films that are gearing up for Bafta and Academy campaigns.We are becoming increasingly important as an entry to Europe for number of significant films. Both our opening and closing night films did not play in either Venice or Toronto.You grew up in a small Australian town with no cinema. How much does that account for the fact you're now running one of the world's biggest film festivals?My usual line is that I've been over-compensating ever since. The passion for movies took me by surprise in my teenage years when I moved to Melbourne to study at university and the journey has been an incredibly exciting one. On a daily basis, it does feel like I'm a long way from Korumburra.How many films do you see in the course of year?I surprised someone the other day when I said it used to be about 800 and now it's down to 500. I've got a great team of internal programme advisers here at London. I had to do a lot more personal viewing in Sydney than I do here.But I loved that response because for most people 500 films is still a hell of a lot of films in one year.The BFI London Film Festival runs from 9-20 October.</body>

      <body>With hundreds of radio stations now broadcasting across the country, it is difficult to imagine how uncrowded the airwaves were 40 years ago. BBC Radio had a domestic monopoly - with no legal commercial competition on UK soil.That all changed on 8 October 1973 with the opening of the first Independent Local Radio station - LBC in London. Capital Radio, also in London, was next - and stations in Glasgow, Birmingham and Manchester soon followed. Within a decade, over 40 stations were on air.Here, as UK commercial radio celebrates a landmark birthday, spend a few minutes on a trip back in time to hear how it all started - and how the foundations of today's digital radio landscape were laid.All copyrights acknowledged.

      <title>Ofcom price hike alarms mobile firms</title>
      <description>Mobile networks left "disappointed" as Ofcom proposes quadrupled licence fees, leading to concerns the cost may be passed on to consumers.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24475802</url>
      <date>1381406086</date>
      <body>Mobile network operators may have to pay more than four times the current amount to use the radio spectrum, under new proposals from Ofcom.The regulator said the new licensing fees reflected market value based on other European countries.Operators told the BBC the increase was "excessive". Vodafone said it was "disappointed".Some analysts have raised concerns the increased costs might be passed on to the public."The size of these figures may come as bad news to the mobile networks, but more worryingly could sound alarm bells for consumers," said Adam Kirby, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com."The proposed new costs reflect a huge leap in the amount networks will have to pay the regulator for using the spectrum - our concern is that it will be consumers who are left to foot the bill."However, the good news for concerned consumers is that no increases have been confirmed as yet - Ofcom are now consulting on the fees. It remains to be seen how much these costs will actually rise, and if the networks can fight back and keep a lid on these increases."An Ofcom spokesman told the BBC that while it had no control over how much operators charged customers, it did not expect the rise to have an impact on bills.In an advisory note, financial services firm JP Morgan said it expected the competitiveness of the mobile market would stop costs being passed down.However, operators contacted by the BBC expressed concern that the rise had been higher than they had budgeted for.The affected companies - Vodafone, O2, EE and Three - each told the BBC that they would respond to Ofcom's announcement in due course.EE said it would aim to stress that "there must be a balance between licence fees and the critical 4G network investment consumers and businesses are demanding to drive growth and jobs for the UK economy".Vodafone criticised Ofcom, saying: "We are disappointed that Ofcom is proposing a 430% increase in the fees we pay for our existing spectrum at a time when we are investing more than ever in vital national digital infrastructure."The regulator should be encouraging such private sector investment in infrastructure and new services like 4G, which will benefit consumers, businesses and the wider British economy for many years to come."Prices for the 900Mhz and 1800Mhz spectrum bands were set when it was used for 2G services several years ago. Ofcom has since "liberated" the spectrum - the term given when a certain band is freed up for different purposes.In this case, it meant that operators could use the bands for higher-speed services such as 4G.In 2010, the government instructed Ofcom to revisit the cost of the licences for 900Mhz and 1800Mhz which - in comparison with other equivalent services across the EU - were considered to be very cheap.The new prices will see Vodafone and O2's individual fees rise from £15.6m to £83.1m. EE will pay £107.1m, up from £24.9m, and Three will go from £8.3m to £35.7m.The increase comes at a time when operators are facing a drop in income via calls made while customers are overseas. The European Union is pressing hard for far lower roaming costs in a bid to reduce so-called "bill shock".A source at one of the affected operators said he expected operators would now engage in a tug of war with Ofcom to see the proposed amounts lowered.In response, the regulator said: "It's a consultation - we welcome the views of our stakeholders. Nothing's final at this stage."They've been expecting this for some time and we've based our proposed annual license fees on market value."Ofcom also dismissed the suggestion that the price hike is in response to a lower-than-expected return from the recent auction of 4G spectrum, which took place earlier in the year.That sale raised £2.3bn - less than the £3.5bn expected by the Office for Budget Responsibility.The shortfall is being investigated by the National Audit Office, which expects to publish its findings early next year.Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC.</body>

      <body>The US Army is working to develop "revolutionary" smart armour that would give its troops "superhuman strength".It is calling on the technology industry, government labs and academia to help build the Iron Man-style suit.Other exoskeletons that allow soldiers to carry large loads much further have already been tested by the army.The Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (Talos) would have such a frame but would also have layers of smart materials fitted with sensors.The suit would also need to have wide-area networking and a wearable computer similar to Google Glass, the US Army said.It should be made of smart material fitted with sensors to monitor body temperature, heart rate and hydration levels.The exoskeleton, which could be attached to arms and legs, would be likely to use hydraulics to greatly increase strength."The requirement is a comprehensive family of systems in a combat armour suit where we bring together an exoskeleton with innovative armour, displays for power monitoring, health monitoring, and integrating a weapon into that," said Lt Col Karl Borjes, a science adviser at the US Army's research, development and engineering command."It's advanced armour. It's communications, antennas. It's cognitive performance. It's sensors, miniature-type circuits. That's all going to fit in here, too," he added.According to US Army Sgt Maj Chris Faris, "no one industry can build it".Instead the army is calling on research and development organisations, private industry as well as government labs and academia to support the project.The US Army said it was likely that scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology would be involved in the design.An MIT team is currently developing liquid body armour - made from fluids that transform into a solid when a magnetic field or electrical current is applied.In an interview with US news site NPR, MIT professor Gareth McKinley compared the futuristic armour to that seen in Hollywood films."It sounds exactly like Iron Man," he said."The other kind of things that you see in the movies... would be the kind of external suit that Sigourney Weaver wears in Aliens, where it's a large robot that amplifies the motions and lifting capability of a human."The aim is the get the Talos armour out in the field within three years.</body>

      <title>Ultrasound offers gesture control</title>
      <description>Ultrasound technology to enable mobiles and tablets to be controlled by gesture has been developed.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24474342</url>
      <date>1381418869</date>
      <body>Ultrasound technology that enables mobiles and tablets to be controlled by gesture could go into production as early as next year.Norwegian start-up Elliptic Labs is in talks with Asian handset manufacturers to get the chip embedded in devices.The technology works via an ultrasound chip that uses sound waves to interpret hand movements.The move towards gesture control has gathered pace and there are now many such products on the market.What sets Elliptic's gesture-control system apart from others is its wide field of use, up to a metre away from the phone. It means it can identify mid-air gestures accurately.Because it uses sound rather than sight, the sensor can recognise gestures from a 180-degree field. It also consumes less power and works in the dark.By contrast Samsung's Galaxy S4 uses an infrared sensor that can only interpret hand movements within a very small zone."The user needs to learn the exact spot to gesture to instead of having a large interactive space around the device," said Erik Forsstrom, the user interface designer for Elliptic Labs.Allowing users more freedom in how they gesture is vital if such products are to become mainstream, he thinks."With a small screen such as a phone or a tablet, the normal body language is not that precise. You need a large zone in which to gesture."If consumers can quickly see the effects their gestures have on screen, he thinks, "it is quite likely that this is the next step within mobile".The technology was recently shown off at Japanese tech show Ceatec.In the demonstration, an Android smartphone was housed in a case containing the ultrasound transmitters.But Elliptic Labs said it had formed partnerships with a number of Asian handset manufacturers who are looking at building the ultrasound chip into devices, as early as next year.Increasingly firms are experimenting with gesture control.PrimeSense, the company that developed gesture control for Microsoft's Kinect console, has also made strides towards bringing the technology to mobile.By shrinking down the sensor used in the Kinect, the firm showed it working with a Nexus 10 at a Google developers' conference in May.Meanwhile Disney is testing technology that allows users to "feel" the texture of objects on a flat touchscreen.The technique involves sending tiny vibrations through the display that let people "feel" the shallow bumps, ridges and edges of an object.Ben Wood, analyst with research firm CCS Insight thinks such devices could be ready for the mass market."Apple's success has made gestures a part of everyday life. Now consumers understand they can manipulate a screen with a gesture or a swipe everyone is racing to find innovative ways to exploit this behaviour."Ultrasonic is particularly interesting as you don't need to touch the screen which can be an almost magical experience."It is ideal if you have dirty or sweaty hands. A common example people use is flicking through a recipe when cooking. Other examples include transitioning through a slideshow of photos or flicking through music tracks or turning the page on an ebook," he said."The big challenge that remains is how you make users aware of the capability."See more tech from the Ceatec show on Click this weekend</body>

      <title>Ford car wrests control of steering</title>
      <description>Ford is testing a car that takes control of the steering wheel away from the driver if it believes they are failing to take the action necessary to avoid a crash.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24464480</url>
      <date>1381330900</date>
      <body>A car that takes control of the steering wheel when it detects the risk of a collision is being tested at a research facility in Germany.Ford said the Obstacle Avoidance system first warned the driver of danger and then took charge if they did not react.The firm said the equipment had been fitted to one of its vehicles as part of a project involving other carmakers and suppliers.One analyst said it was a staging post on the route to "driverless cars".The system scans up to 200m (650ft) ahead by using three radars, a number of ultrasonic sensors and a camera, which are all installed in the vehicle.An additional built-in display shows a warning sign and sounds a chime. Then, if necessary, it applies the brakes, scans for a gap in the road ahead, and steers to avoid a crash."You're driving down the road and a pedestrian or something comes out from either side of your vehicle from your peripheral vision where you don't have a good look at it," said Barb Samardzich, vice-president of product development at Ford's European division."Obstacle Avoidance can sense that the pedestrian or that object is coming across the front of your vehicle. If it doesn't sense you responding accordingly in your vehicle by braking or manoeuvring, it will take over."The firm showed off the tech at a facility in Lommel, Belgium, earlier this week.The new technology builds on safety features already offered by Ford.Last year it introduced Lane Keeping Alert, a feature that vibrates the wheel - but does not take control - if it detects the driver is drifting out of a lane without using an indicator.Ford's existing Active City Stop facility also aims to reduce the severity of collisions by applying the brakes if it detects an object in front of the vehicle. But it works only if the object is static or travelling less than 30km/h (19mph) faster than the car.By contrast, the company said the new tech was being tested at speeds of over 60 km/h (38mph).Other manufacturers involved in the project at Aachen include BMW, Fiat, Daimler, Volvo and Volkswagen. They will share data from the tests to develop systems of their own.Volvo - which is owned by China's Geely - has already introduced its own pedestrian and cyclist alert system, which sounds an alarm and applies the brakes. The firm told the BBC in March that it was now adapting the system so it would soon be able to recognise animals.There may be resistance from some to the idea of a car taking control from its driver.But Ford points out that fewer than one-third of all drivers involved in rear-end collisions had attempted to steer clear of the accident, according to data collected by Germany's Federal Statistical Office.With that in mind, one independent analyst said it should not be too hard for manufacturers to convince motorists of the innovation's benefit."The logic behind the technology is impeccable - anything that can avoid a potentially dangerous situation that can cause injury or death sounds like a good piece of equipment," said Tim Urquhart, senior analyst at consultants IHS Automotive."Obviously it will come at a price. But there will be less resistance to a piece of technology like this than there will be to the concept of totally driverless cars."But autonomous vehicles are already being tested by Google, Daimler and others, and taking steering control in an emergency situation is obviously a pretty significant step along the road."Ford said more tests were needed and it was not yet ready to announce a launch date for its Obstacle Avoidance system.</body>

      <description>Russian police reportedly arrest a man on suspicion of masterminding two infamous hacking tools.</description>

      <date>1381320000</date>
      <body>Russian police have reportedly arrested a man on suspicion of masterminding two infamous hacking tools.He is suspected of being the man behind the alias Paunch - the nickname used by the creator of the Blackhole and Cool exploit kits, sold to cybercriminals to infect web users with malware.The Russian authorities have not confirmed the details.But security firms said they had already detected a decline in the programs' use.A spokesman for the law enforcement agency Europol told the BBC: "Europol and the European Cybercrime Centre has been informed that a high-level suspected cyber criminal has been arrested."We can only refer you to the Russian authorities, they are the ones who should speak about this topic."The Russian police's press office said it had nothing to add at this time.However, Alexander Gostev, chief security expert at the Moscow-based internet protection provider Kaspersky Lab, said the arrest had been confirmed to him by "anonymous sources".The Blackhole kit, released in 2010, dominated the crimeware market throughout 2012 and the start of 2013, according to Fraser Howard, a researcher at the anti-virus company Sophos.He said the code had been sold for an annual licence of $1,500 (£940) or could be rented from its creator for $200 (£125) for one week's use, among other price plans.The software targeted a range of vulnerabilities in the Java programming language, Adobe's Flash media player, Windows software and PDF files.It had two ways of doing this:Among the malware downloaded was:Although Mr Howard said Blackhole was once the biggest threat of its kind, he added that in recent months it had been overshadowed by rival kits, including Sweet Orange and Neutrino.According to the researcher, the Blackhole and Cool kits put together were only involved in about 4% of all malware detected by Sophos in August, down from 28% the previous year.The figure had since dropped to 2% in recent days, he added.Another independent security blogger stressed that the arrest was still significant."If it's true that the brains behind the Blackhole has been apprehended it's a very big deal - a real coup for the cybercrime-fighting authorities, and hopefully cause disruption to the development of one of the most notorious exploit kits the web has ever seen," said Graham Cluley."However, it's worth remembering that nature abhors a vacuum, and there would surely be other online criminals waiting to take their place, promoting their alternative exploit kits and malicious code."Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, agreed."If indeed it is Paunch that they arrested, that is a major arrest - he is a big deal," he told the BBC."He was clearly the biggest player in providing exploit kits - not just by selling them, but also renting and leasing them to online criminals."Both Blackhole and its successor Cool have been very popular."Users didn't have to be very technical to operate them - there was a manual that came with them - they just had to get them running and be able to break into a high-profile website, or create a new one from scratch, to install something bad on your computer."</body>

      <body>Global shipments of personal computers (PCs) have hit a five-year low, according to new figures from the research firm Gartner.Shipments totalled 80.3m units in the three months to September, down 8.6% from a year ago.PC sales have now fallen for six quarters in a row, hurt by the growing popularity of tablets and smartphones.Gartner said falling prices of tablets had further hurt sales of PCs in emerging markets."Consumers' shift from PCs to tablets for daily content consumption continued to decrease the installed base of PCs both in mature as well as in emerging markets," Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner, said in a statement."A greater availability of inexpensive Android tablets attracted first-time consumers in emerging markets, and as supplementary devices in mature markets."Research firm IDC, also released figures on Thursday, which showed global shipments of PCs fell by 7.6% to 81.6m units over the period.Gartner and IDC use slightly different methods to calculate PC shipment data.IDC said it was likely the ongoing decline in PC sales would continue into next year."Whether constrained by a weak economy or being selective in their tech investments, buyers continue to evaluate options and delay PC replacements," Loren Loverde, vice president of IDC's Worldwide PC Trackers, said in a statement.In July this year, IDC had said it was still looking for some improvement in growth during the second half of the year. It has now reversed that view."The third quarter was pretty close to forecast, which unfortunately doesn't reflect much improvement in the PC market, or potential for near-term growth," said Mr Loverde.</body>

      <date>1381319804</date>
      <body>Samsung Electronics, the world's best-selling smartphone maker, has launched a handset with a curved display screen.Called the Galaxy Round, the smartphone will feature a 5.7in (14.5cm) display.The launch comes just days after rival LG said it would begin production of curved-screen phones next year.Digital display technology has been progressing towards curved screens. Both Samsung and LG already offer curved organic light-emitting diode (OLED) television sets.Samsung said the curved screen display would help consumers use some of the features on the phone, including those that enable users to check information such as date, time and missed calls when home screen is off, with more ease.At the same time, users can also change music tracks on their phone, even while its display is off.The Galaxy Round will initially be launched only in South Korea. The firm gave no indication of its plans for a global launch.The global smartphone market has been growing rapidly.According to research firm CCS Insight, worldwide smartphone sales will hit nearly one billion in 2013 - accounting for more than half the total of 1.7 billion mobile phones sold.As as result, smartphone manufacturers have been keen to offer new products to win consumers.With display technology moving towards flexible and bendy screens, it is one area that companies have been looking at.Some analysts said that while the initial offering of curved-screen phones may not see huge sales, the segment of flexible displays was one to keep an eye on."These phones may not be a game-changer today, but they are definitely an indication of things to come," Manoj Menon, managing director of consulting firm Frost and Sullivan, told the BBC."Flexible displays have a huge role to play as the market place for 'internet of things' grows."This refers to the idea that many things in homes or offices - not just typical computers - will soon be connected to the internet.The sector is tipped by many to be a major industry in the near future.Mr Menon said that as flexible screens became more advanced and cost-effective to make, it was likely to speed up growth in the sector.</body>

      <title>Guardian plans more Snowden leaks</title>
      <description>The Guardian's editor says he plans to publish more revelations from Edward Snowden despite MI5 warning that such disclosures cause "enormous damage".</description>

      <body>Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger says he plans to publish more revelations from Edward Snowden despite MI5 warning that such disclosures cause enormous damage.Mr Rusbridger insisted the paper was right to publish files leaked by the US intelligence analyst and had helped to prompt a necessary and overdue debate.His comments come after criticism from the new head of MI5, Andrew Parker.Making public the "reach and limits" of intelligence-gathering techniques gave terrorists the advantage, he said.Mr Snowden, a former CIA contractor, fled to Russia with a wealth of secret data including some 58,000 files from GCHQ, Britain's electronic eavesdropping agency.The stories that followed in the Guardian newspaper, based on material provided by Mr Snowden, revealed the huge capacity of British and US intelligence agencies - GCHQ and NSA - to monitor communications.Mr Rusbridger said more stories would be published in the future as the leaked documents were "slowly and responsibly" worked through.In his first public speech since his appointment to director general in April, Mr Parker said intelligence gathered by GCHQ had played a vital role in stopping many UK terrorist plots over the past decade.Without mentioning Mr Snowden by name, he said ''it causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques".He warned that terrorists now had tens of thousands of means of communication "through e-mail, IP telephony, in-game communication, social networking, chat rooms, anonymising services and a myriad of mobile apps".Mr Parker said it was vital for MI5 to retain the capability to access such information if it was to protect the country.Mr Rusbridger said those on the security side of the argument wanted to keep everything secret and did not want a debate."You don't want the press or anyone else writing about it. But MI5 cannot be the only voice in the debate," he told BBC Radio 4's World at One.He added that his newspaper had revealed the "extent to which entire populations are now being potentially put under surveillance"."I just spent a week in America where everybody is talking about this, from the president down."He added: "It's quite surprising to me that the number of MPs in this country who have said anything at all in the last four months can be counted on one hand - Malcolm Rifkind, Tom Watson, David Davis."So, if Parliament's not going to have this discussion and if the courts can only do this in private then I think absolutely it falls to the press to stimulate a discussion, which as I say, throughout America, throughout Europe, is one that the public are intensely interested in."Asked about Mr Parker's suggestion that publishing the documents was helping terrorists, Mr Rusbridger said: "They will always say that. You read histories of intelligence and you go back to the 1990s and the security people were saying the same."The independent MP Patrick Mercer said intelligence data should not be published if it compromised public security."If in any way our security is compromised by revealing too much, that's a mistake. Just imagine if we had revealed the whole Enigma secret during the Second World War."That might have been in the public's interest - but we'd have lost the war."</body>

      <body>Panasonic, the Japanese electronics company, is to stop production of plasma TV screens in 2014, according to reports.The company will close its plasma screen factory in Amagasaki and put it up for sale next year, Nikkei business daily and Reuters have said.Panasonic's plasma TV division made huge losses in recent years.But a Panasonic spokesman told the BBC: "Nothing has been decided at this stage."Other electronics companies, such as Hitachi and Pioneer, have already pulled out of the sector.In its last financial year, Panasonic as a whole made a loss of 754bn yen (£4.85bn), following a 772bn yen loss the previous year.This is despite the fact that its plasma TVs are critically acclaimed, with the European Imaging Sound Association voting Panasonic's Viera TX-P60ZT65 European home cinema TV of the year 2013-2014.Plasma screens, which use electrically charged ionised gases, are praised for their brightness, deep blacks, and rich colour displays, but tend to use more electricity than other screen technologies."In the last two or three years plasma TVs have lost most of the advantages they had to LCD [liquid crystal display] TVs," said Tom Morrod, senior director of consumer electronics at research company IHS."We're forecasting that they will be gone completely by 2018."Panasonic president Kazuhiro Tsuga's is focused on jettisoning underperforming divisions and concentrating on higher-margin products in a bid to return the group to profitability.Panasonic, along with its domestic rivals Sharp and Sony, have all struggled to cope with falling electronics prices and stiff competition from South Korean and Taiwanese manufacturers.Meanwhile, new screen technologies, such as LCD, organic light emitting diode (OLED), and the most recent ultra-high-definition 4K standard, may have hastened plasma's demise.</body>

      <body>A beta version of the BBC Playlister, a new digital service that allows listeners to tag any piece of music they hear on the BBC and listen to it later, has gone live.BBC Radio 1's Zane Lowe claimed the project puts the BBC "at the heart of what is happening now"."The whole essence of radio is to communicate: To be able to say 'I love this song'."Now we can really listen to what [the audience] is into and what they love."The aim of Playlister is to give audiences an easy way to find out what music is being played on BBC Radio networks (and, later, on BBC TV shows) and to listen to it again.From Wednesday, every song played on BBC radio will be made listed on the relevant programme website.Anyone with a BBC account can click an "add this" button to add tracks to a personal playlist, and export them to a outside streaming service, such as YouTube, Deezer and Spotify, where they can be played back in full.The homepage of the Playlister website also lists the BBC's most recently-played songs, as well as the most popular or most searched-for music.Mark Friend, BBC controller for multi-platform radio and music, said the service was "easy to use [and] accessible for everyone", adding that it would "join up your BBC experiences with the music experiences you have on the rest of the internet".The launch comes one year on from the launch of BBC iPlayer radio, which "brought together all of the music and the radio from the BBC into one online product... and transformed the BBC's role in digital music," he said.Following the initial Playlister launch on Wednesday, further developments will include the launch of the same functions within the iPlayer radio app, broadening the Playlister to include number of TV programmes - such as Strictly Come Dancing and The Voice - and the introduction of presenter playlists.The presenter playlist will allow BBC DJs and presenters "to be able to curate their own chosen music and present that to the audience" within the Playlister function."It's about enhancing people's music experience," explained Mark Foster, of Deezer, one of the BBC Playlister's commercial partners."A service like ours has 25 million tracks... being able to use trusted curators, like Zane, is all about building trust, building confidence and helping people navigate through this fantastic selection of music that we have.""The ability to discover music and follow people whose musical taste has really shaped yours is going to add a really level of texture to our services," echoed Chris Maples, of fellow commercial partner Spotify.Playlister "will influence the way we make radio," said Lowe, adding, "the traffic goes both ways; communication between presenters and the audience becomes very direct."Playlister gives the BBC a chance to do that globally, which is a big part of what the BBC's future.""People want to keep up-to-date," added Maples. "What's really cool about this is that I can take the perceived cool of Zane and add it to my playlist."Statistics suggest that last year, more than 26 million people listened to music on the BBC radio network every single week and nearly 50 million watched some music from the BBC."Audiences want an easy way to find out and remember the music they hear on our programmes and to get good music recommendations," said Mr Friend"Playlister presents a huge creative opportunity, not just to the audience, but also to us the programme-makers."</body>

      <body>Disney researchers have found a way for people to "feel" the texture of objects seen on a flat touchscreen.The technique involves sending tiny vibrations through the display that let people "feel" the shallow bumps, ridges and edges of an object.The vibrations fooled fingers into believing they were touching a textured surface, said the Disney researchers.The vibration-generating algorithm should be easy to add to existing touchscreen systems, they added.Developed by Dr Ali Israr and colleagues at Disney's research lab in Pittsburgh, the vibrational technique re-creates what happens when a finger tip passes over a real bump."Our brain perceives the 3D bump on a surface mostly from information that it receives via skin stretching," said Ivan Poupyrev, head of the interaction research group in Pittsburgh.To fool the brain into thinking it is touching a real feature, the vibrations imparted via the screen artificially stretch the skin on a fingertip so a bump is felt even though the touchscreen surface is smooth.The researchers have developed an underlying algorithm that can be used to generate textures found on a wide variety of objects.A video depicting the system in action shows people feeling apples, jellyfish, pineapples, a fossilised trilobite as well as the hills and valleys on a map.The more pronounced the feature, the greater the vibration is needed to mimic its feel.The vibration system should be more flexible than existing systems used to give tactile feedback on touchscreens, which typically used a library of canned effects, said Dr Israr."With our algorithm we do not have one or two effects, but a set of controls that make it possible to tune tactile effects to a specific visual artefact on the fly," he added.</body>

      <title>BBC plans to help get UK coding</title>
      <description>The BBC will launch an initiative in 2015 to get coding more widespread in schools and homes.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24446046</url>
      <date>1381233705</date>
      <body>The BBC's director general, Tony Hall, has announced plans to "bring coding into every home, business and school in the UK".It comes 30 years on from a BBC push to make computing mainstream by putting BBC Micro computers in the majority of schools.In a speech to staff, Mr Hall said that the initiative would launch in 2015."We want to inspire a new generation to get creative with coding, programming and digital technology," he said.Government and technology experts are becoming increasingly worried that vital computing skills are no longer being taught in schools.Meanwhile interest in higher-education IT and computing courses is falling, giving rise to fears about a massive skills gap.This term a new computer science curriculum has been introduced to schools in England, and Education Minister Michael Gove has made it clear that he wants to see coding taught as a priority.Ralph Rivera, director of future media at the BBC, said: "The BBC has played a hugely important role in inspiring a generation of digital and technology leaders in the past, and now it's time to reignite that creativity.""We want to transform the nation's ability and attitude towards coding," he added.Details of the programme were limited, but the BBC said that it would partner with government, educators and technology companies."From working with children and young people, to stimulating a national conversation about digital creativity, the BBC will help audiences embrace technology and get creative," the corporation said in a blog post.A range of tools would be made available to give people "the skills to solve problems, tell stories and build new business in the digital world", it added.Experts appearing in a video to accompany the speech, agreed that action was needed.Martha Lane Fox, charged with getting more people online via her organisation Go on UK, said: "We are going to need a million more people who can work in the technology sector over the next 10 years. We don't have them. We've got to help to encourage people to go into that sector."Meanwhile, Eben Upton - founder of the Raspberry Pi budget computer project - said he looked forward to seeing how the scheme developed."A generation of UK developers got their start thanks to the original BBC Computer Literacy Project and the BBC Micro," he said."This initiative represents a welcome return to computing education from the organisation that was responsible for my interest in the subject."However, the comparison of the project to the BBC Micro raises potential controversy.The broadcaster's decision to partner with Acorn Computers three decades ago angered Sir Clive Sinclair as he prepared to launch a rival machine, the ZX Spectrum."They are marvellous at making programmes and so on, but by God they should not be making computers, any more than they should be making BBC cars or BBC toothpaste," he told Practical Computing magazine in 1982."They were able to get away with making computers because none of us had sufficient power or pull with the government to put over just what a damaging action that was. They had the unmitigated gall to think that they could set a standard - the BBC language. It is just sheer arrogance on their part."However, Apps for Good - an organisation which has helped students research, design and make software for three years - was not concerned by the new scheme."The BBC is entering a market where there's a number of players, but players who already work quite collaboratively," said Debbie Forster, the organisation's chief operating officer."Because there is such a big issue at stake and it is so important to so many different organisations what we are finding is that partnerships are formed more easily and more positively."Obviously the devil is in the detail in making it work - it always is - but it's a fascinating space and we look forward to hearing more and would be delighted for the BBC to join forces with everyone who is in here doing something."Learning Tree International - a firm which makes money from running programming training courses - was also unworried about the idea of the BBC becoming a competitor."From the point of view of getting people more inspired about IT and into that world, as such, it can only be a positive thing," said the firm's marketing director Christian Trounce.</body>

      <title>Four arrested over Silk Road links</title>
      <description>Four men arrested in UK over links to illegal online marketplace Silk Road.</description>

      <date>1381226248</date>
      <body>Four men have been arrested in the UK over their role in illegal online marketplace Silk Road.Three men in their early 20s were arrested in Manchester while a fourth man, in his 50s, was detained in Devon.The men were initially arrested on suspicion of drug offences. More arrests are expected in the coming weeks.Such sites would be a "key priority" for the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA), its director general said.The Silk Road, one of the world's largest websites selling illegal drugs, has now been closed down.Ross Ulbricht, the alleged operator of the site was arrested in San Francisco by the FBI at the beginning of October.Last week 40-year-old Steven Lloyd Sadler was arrested in Seattle. He is alleged to be one of the most prolific sellers on the Silk Road.The site operated on Tor, a so-called "dark web" service that anonymises users, making it much more difficult for authorities to track locations. Such areas of the internet are not covered by standard search engines.The site sold a range of items, but was most famous for offering a host of illegal drugs, paid for using virtual currency Bitcoin.Keith Bristow, the NCA's director general, warned that users who think they can hide their identity on the internet need to think again."These arrests send a clear message to criminals; the hidden internet isn't hidden and your anonymous activity isn't anonymous. We know where you are, what you are doing and we will catch you.""It is impossible for criminals to completely erase their digital footprint. No matter how technology-savvy the offender, they will always make mistakes."Exeter-based officers worked closely with American law enforcement officers to identify significant UK users of the Silk Road.It is hoped that the investigation will give them insights into how criminals use the dark net."These criminal areas of the internet aren't just selling drugs; it's where fraud takes place, where the trafficking of people and goods is discussed, where child abuse images are exchanged and firearms are traded," said Andy Archibald, head of the NCA's national cybercrime unit.The Silk Road may now be defunct but it seems that users are planning to resurrect the service.Technology news site TechCrunch reports that Silk Road version 2 could be "ready to launch".</body>

      <title>Nokia gives deadline for Symbian apps</title>
      <description>Nokia will no longer publish any content for Symbian on its app store from the end of the year.</description>

      <body>Nokia has sounded a further death knell for the operating systems Symbian and MeeGo, announcing no new content will be published on its app store from 1 January 2014.The company told developers they had just three months left to update content.The news has angered loyal fans still using the handsets.Nokia took the decision to make Windows Phone 7 its default operating system in 2011.The email outlining the timetable reads: "If you have Symbian and MeeGo content in the Nokia store, it will continue to be available for download to customers, and you will continue to receive download and revenue reports as well as payouts for downloaded content."However, starting January 1, 2014, you will no longer to be able to publish any new content or update existing content for Symbian and MeeGo."Microsoft bought Nokia's mobile phone business for 5.4bn euros ($7.2bn; £4.6bn) last month.The purchase is set to be completed in early 2014, when about 32,000 Nokia employees will transfer to Microsoft.While the news is unsurprising, some had thought the eco-system around the operating systems would continue for a few more years. Technology firm Accenture is contracted to provide support to Nokia for its remaining Symbian handset until 2016.Customers and developers took to Twitter and other online platforms to express their anger about the swiftness of the close-down.</body>

      <title>Blu-Ray albums target hi-fi fans</title>
      <description>Record companies are trying to tempt fans away from MP3s by releasing albums in a crystal-clear Blu-Ray format.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24441979</url>
      <date>1381241353</date>
      <body>Record companies are trying to tempt fans away from MP3s by releasing albums in a crystal-clear Blu-Ray format.Nirvana's Nevermind and Amy Winehouse's Back To Black will be among the first records to be released in the format, which comes to the UK this month.Listeners will need a Blu-Ray player and a stereo system to play the discs, which promise to deliver "the sound as it was intended by the artist".However, high-fidelity audio products have failed to catch on in the past.DVD-Audio and Super Audio CD (SACD), both of which launched in the early 2000s, delivered better quality sound than ordinary CDs but faltered in the marketplace.The new format, officially called Pure Audio, uses similar encoding techniques to those predecessors but, crucially, has the support of all the major record labels from the outset.Pioneered by Universal Music, it launched in France earlier this year, where the initial batch of 35 titles have already achieved sales of more than 500,000.One album, Mylene Farmer's Monkey Me, has sold 84,000 copies on Blu-Ray alone - which would be enough to ensure a top 10 placing in the UK charts.The BBC was given several tracks to audition, comparing them directly to the equivalent songs on CD and MP3 through a home stereo system.Stevie Wonder's I Wish opened up, with a rounder, fuller bass and the intricate hi-hat work sounding crisp and bright.Bob Marley's Is This Love sounded more spacious than the muddy MP3, with Marley's soulful vocals so clear he could almost have been in the room.The clarity wasn't always an advantage, however: Serge Gainsbourg's spittle-flecked come-ons in L'hotel Particulier sounded doubly creepy in full resolution.But despite the improvements, the question remains: Will fans accept the format?Although they are lower quality than a CD, the portability of MP3s and Apple's iTunes format proved more alluring to consumers than either SACD or DVD-Audio, which are no longer manufactured in any great number."It's all about timing," said Olivier Robert Murphy, global head of new business at Universal."When SACD launched it was supported by only part of the industry, and you had to buy a 1,000 euro (£842) player. Here, we have 33% of the population that already has a Blu-Ray player at home.""The magic of this format is that you buy a £60 player, you put the disc in, you play it through a basic stereo sound system - the sound is incredible."Warner Music and Sony have already released albums on Blu-Ray in France and Japan, while Universal plans to issue 200 albums in 14 countries "very quickly".At launch, the UK catalogue will contain albums such as The Velvet Underground and Nico's self-titled debut, Queen's A Night At The Opera and Marvin Gaye's What's Going On?Classical releases include the Berlin Philharmonic's interpretation of Mahler's Symphony No.5 and Rolando Vilazon's collection of Verdi's works for the tenor.Murphy acknowledged the selection relied heavily on heritage acts."It's not necessarily a strategy," he told the BBC, "but what we realised is that initially we're talking to specialists, we're talking to a niche"."I'm talking about the guy who spent 40 grand on his hi-fi system. Let's face it, this guy is probably 35-plus, and likes heritage artists."However, Murphy said the long-term goal was to release new albums in the format, too."For me, it could represent a very nice percentage of physical sales," he said."When I see that we're selling more vinyl now than in 2002, I know there is an appetite for this kind of music."But, in an admission of modern listening habits, albums purchased in the Blu-Ray format will come with a free copy of the lower-quality digital version."Blu-Ray is a copy-protected format," said Murphy. "If someone has spent £15 on a product, he should have the right to put it on their iPod and listen to it when he's doing his fitness programme."Eventually, the Pure Audio files could be distributed digitally themselves - but with a four-minute song needing 1GB of storage space, Murphy said it would be "three to four years" before that was a reality.</body>

      <title>Samsung devices face US import ban</title>
      <description>Some older Samsung gadgets look set to be banned from being imported to the US thanks to a patent row with Apple.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24445266</url>
      <date>1381249277</date>
      <body>Some older Samsung gadgets look set to be banned in the US following a patent row with Apple.In early August, Apple won a case at the US International Trade Commission (ITC) that found Samsung had infringed two patents covering mobile technology.That victory called for an import ban on some Samsung products but this was postponed pending an appeal.A US official overseeing the patent row has now rejected Samsung's appeal, meaning the ban will come into force."After carefully weighing policy considerations, including the impact on consumers and competition, advice from agencies and information from interested parties, I have decided to allow the commission's determination... to become final," said US trade representative Michael Froman.The patents in dispute cover detecting fingers on a touchscreen and the workings of the audio jack on smartphones and tablets. In August, Samsung was cleared of violating four other patented technologies.So far, it is not clear which products will be banned from sale. In its appeal, Samsung said it had, for newer products, developed its own technologies that did not draw on Apple's patented ideas. The ITC has already approved the workarounds for the disputed technologies.In August, US President Barack Obama overturned another ITC ruling that called for a ban on Apple products. He issued the first presidential veto for 26 years on an ITC matter when he decided to stop the ban on older iPhones and iPads.Apple and Samsung have regularly clashed in court over the past few years and have fought patent battles across 10 countries.</body>

      <body>Electrical supply problems at a National Security Agency data centre have delayed its opening by a year, reports the Wall Street Journal.Power surges at the giant Utah centre had ruined equipment costing almost a million dollars, it said.The technical problems had also led to lengthy investigations that had meant its opening date had been pushed back.The Utah plant is one of three the NSA is building to boost its data gathering and surveillance capabilities.Over the past 13 months, 10 separate electrical surges have occurred at the data centre in Bluffdale, Utah, according to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), which is reported to have cost $1.4bn (£872m) to build.Each surge had burnt out and wrecked about $100,000 worth of computers and other equipment, it said.The Bluffdale facility is more than one million sq ft (93,000 sq m) in size and its power costs are expected to top $1m (£622,000) a month, according to the WSJ.The NSA had been supposed to start using the data storage and analysis centre in October 2012, it said, but this had been delayed by the damage caused by the power surges and a six-month investigation into their cause.The WSJ added it had seen technical documents indicating experts called in to find out the cause had rowed over whether the problem had been fixed.It said civil contractors were confident the problem had been solved but a special US Army engineer investigation team had said the cause was "not yet sufficiently understood" to be sure that it would not happen again.The amount of surveillance that the NSA carries out has come under scrutiny in recent months thanks to whistleblower Edward Snowden.He leaked documents allegedly detailing its activities including the Prism programme that garners data from web firms including Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Yahoo.In addition, the NSA has been found to be gathering data on phone calls made by US citizens.</body>

      <description>Sir Jony Ive, Apple's design chief, unveils a one-off camera he has designed for Leica that will be sold at a charity auction.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24458783</url>
      <date>1381312111</date>
      <body>If you've ever wondered what an iCamera might look like, a Jony Ive-designed Leica might offer a few hints.Apple's feted design chief teamed up with industrial designer Marc Newson to create the device as a bespoke item for a charity auction.While some may want to see it go into wider production, the amount of work that went into it means that the price would be out of reach for most.It is expected to fetch between $500,000 (£312,000) and $750,000.The special edition Leica M camera features an anodised aluminium case with tens of thousands of individual perforations.The camera took 85 days and more than 735 hours to manufacture.During that time more than 550 models and 1,000 prototype parts were made and tested; 55 engineers worked on the process.As for the specifications under the bonnet, it is similar to the standard $7,000 Leica and features a 24-megapixel full-frame CMOS sensor and comes with a 50mm f/2 aperture lens.The RED charity, founded by U2's Bono, will host the auction in New York on November 23. All proceeds will go to the Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria.Other items to be auctioned include a grand piano picked by the two designers, gold Apple earbuds and a cosmonaut suit.</body>

      <title>Hi-tech $100 banknote goes into use</title>
      <description>The US Federal Reserve issues a new high-tech $100 banknote, comprising several new security features designed to beat the counterfeiters.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24431952</url>
      <date>1381195653</date>
      <body>The US Federal Reserve has issued a new hi-tech $100 banknote comprising several new security features.It includes a blue 3D security ribbon and a bell and inkwell logo that authorities say are particularly difficult to replicate.These combine with traditional security features, such as a portrait watermark and an embedded security thread that glows pink under ultraviolet light.The 2010 design was delayed because of "unexpected production challenges".The 3D security ribbon - which is woven into the note, not printed on it - features images of 100s that change into bells and move upwards or sideways depending on how you tilt the paper.Referring to the embedded security thread Chadwick Wasilenkoff, chief executive of security paper company Fortress Paper, told the BBC: "It's not a small incremental step up for security, it's a giant leap."Tilting also reveals a green bell within a copper-coloured inkwell to the right of the blue ribbon.In addition, the 100 number in the bottom right-hand corner shifts from copper to green.The redesigned banknote, which features a portrait of US founding father and scientist Benjamin Franklin, also includes raised "intaglio" printing that gives the notes a distinctive feel, and microprinted words that are difficult to read without magnification.Over a decade of research and development has gone into the new note, the Fed said, in a joint project with the US Secret Service and the Department of the Treasury.Advances in design software and high-resolution copying and printing have made it easier for counterfeiters to print fake money and harder for retailers to spot the forgeries.US authorities say that $100 bill is the most counterfeited of all US banknotes, but accurate figures for the total value of counterfeit cash in circulation are hard to come by.The US Secret Service estimates that counterfeit bills account for less than 0.01% of the $1.1 trillion (£683bn) of US money in circulation.It says about $80.7m of counterfeit currency changed hands domestically in 2012, and about $14.5m abroad.The authorities seized $9.7m in counterfeit cash before it could make it in to the US money supply, and seized $56.8m abroad in 2012.Bruce Schneier, security expert at BT, told the BBC: "Bills have to be easy to produce cheaply and in large quantities by the government, yet hard to reproduce in small quantities by counterfeiters."Making something that costs less than a dollar to produce and over $100 to reproduce is a very difficult problem."</body>

      <title>Preparing for the digital afterlife</title>
      <description>Society's struggle over who owns the dead's digital files</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24380211</url>
      <date>1381276180</date>
      <body>When 15-year-old Eric Rash committed suicide in 2011, his family and friends wanted to know why.In a bid to find answers, they went to Eric's Facebook account, and after failing to guess his password, appealed to the social media giant to grant them access.Facebook refused.Giving unauthorised access to someone other than the account holder, the company said, was against its privacy policy.The Rashes, who live in Virginia, tried to fight their case in court, but soon found there just wasn't any legislation that covered the management of "digital assets".The family's tragic battle is just one of many examples in which the internet has been shown to be woefully unprepared for dealing with death.In the two years since the Rashes' case, which led to the drafting of a federal law concerning the data of minors, few countries have issued clear guidance on the rights of families to access their deceased loved ones' data.And despite the fact that we put more of our lives in the cloud than ever before, few of us are preparing for our digital afterlife."We're accumulating far more digital records in our lives than we are physical ones," says Evan Carroll, who runs The Digital Beyond, a website which explores the subject of digital death."But we haven't yet entered the age where we are taking the question of what happens to those records seriously."Since Mr Carroll and his friend John Romano first raised the issue of the digital afterlife at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in 2009, some prominent companies have developed policies for dealing with deceased customers.Google has a step-by-step process allowing users to plan what they want done with their account, and will sometimes provide the contents of an email account which hasn't left specific instructions, after a "careful review".Facebook and Yahoo have taken a stricter stance, and won't hand over data without a court order, but the former allows relatives to choose whether they want to close an account or turn it into a memorial page.However many web companies are lagging behind.Cloud-based services which store our financial details, emails, music collections, social media interactions, photos and many other potentially precious items have different policies on data ownership, if indeed they have any.As a result, it is more difficult to bequeath your iTunes library to a loved one than it is to leave your CD collection to them in a shoebox.So why are we leaving our digital identities hostage to fortune?Part of the problem is that internet users have tended to be too young to be worrying about their mortality.But as the average browser gets older (the Office for National Statistics reckons almost 70% of all 65-74-year-olds in the UK are online), the idea of drafting a "digital will" is taking hold."We've seen several thousands sign up to our various membership packages," says Paul Golding, who co-launched Cirrus Legacy - a service which allows you to record login details for all your online accounts and leave instructions to a nominated guardian - just a year ago."People are beginning to realise what they could lose."Putting details of your online life in an actual will is not an option, as they are publicly accessible documents, but highlighting where they can be found is a safer bet. Although with passwords and usernames changing all the time, the challenge is to keep the information up to date.Digital estate planning, as the process of filing your details with a third party has become known, is an increasingly popular business, and many online services offer much more than simply making arrangements for accessing accounts.Some, such as My Wonderful Life, allow members to write messages to be sent to their dear ones from beyond the grave. Others, such as the ifidie Facebook app, give people the opportunity to share a posthumous joke, or record a confessional video to be released upon their demise.But it is the more conventional services offered by these companies which are proving vital to grieving families.Most of the time, families don't even know which online accounts their relative had signed up to, let alone the login details.And the cost of not knowing even a simple email password can be enormous, explains Evan Carroll."Email serves many purposes, only one of which is the digital equivalent of our mailboxes," he says. "It is the master key to many other accounts."But although leaving a list of your online accounts and passwords with a digital estate service might seem like a good solution, it is riddled with risks.Putting all your online security details in one place puts you at the mercy of a successful hacking attack. And, as Mr Golding admits, if he received "correct information" from a court of law, requiring him to hand over a list of passwords, he would "have to comply".Furthermore, using the login details left by a dead family member is potentially illegal. The terms and conditions of most established online services state that nobody other than the owner is allowed to use the account.Your loved ones may also not thank you for some posthumous revelations. Details of extra-marital affairs or a gambling addiction, which would otherwise have been taken to the grave, could be made available to mourners.But although much of the digital will-making process is still being ironed out, Mr Carroll urges people to do something, even if it is just writing a manual list and putting it in a safe place known only to a spouse."Many people say 'I don't have anything that I care about online'," he says."But you never know what will one day be of value to your family."</body>

      <body>There's no doubt that the Raspberry Pi bare-bones computer has captured the imagination of makers, hackers and artists around the world.The computers have been put to some novel uses, including a controller for a robot boat that is piloting itself across the Atlantic Ocean.As the millionth Raspberry Pi rolls off its UK production line, the BBC takes a look at a few of the more ambitious and creative projects that the bare-bones computer has made possible.Created by US teenager Chris Marion, Fire Hero mates the Raspberry Pi with canisters of propane and a microcontroller to add pyrotechnic effects that synchronise to music being played on an electric guitar.Hit the right notes and flames will shoot from a rig of six small propane "poofers", four medium-sized "poofers" and two huge cannons.The big ones produce flames that shoot more than 30m (100ft) into the air.Mr Marion said work on the original Fire Hero began in 2010, but the Pi helped him refine his control of the flames.The Pi sits at the centre of the system, reading data from the guitar and passing it to a separate device that opens and closes valves releasing the propane that is then ignited.Programming the Pi to act as the controller was not the hardest part of the project, he told the BBC."The real programming magic lies in the intelligent note and chord detection algorithms to transfer the data stream from the instruments to the Fire Hero device," he said.Fire Hero 3 has been shown off at a few music festivals in the US and its success has led Mr Marion to plan a bigger, flamier set up that, he estimates, will be six times the size of the latest version.It will still have a Pi at its core and is set to debut at a festival in 2014."My vision is to be able to bring a revolutionary new kind of special effects to live performances that enthrals the audience and provides additional sensory stimulation to further immerse them in the performance," he said.The Pi is not just helping people, man's best friends are benefiting too.In particular, a Hungarian vizsla dog called Judd has done very well thanks to a Pi-controlled treat dispenser.Created by Judd's owner, John Saunders, the little web-connected gadget dispenses doggy treats when an email is sent to a specific address.The dispenser drew on many of Mr Saunders's skills, but as he was weakest at coding, getting the Pi to co-ordinate all the moving parts had been tricky, he said."I'm not a programmer by trade, so that was much harder for me than the machining and design," he said.At the time the project was being developed, there was little information or code examples online to help get the gadget working. A web-based appeal helped him debug his code.The Pi was essential to the interactive part of the treat dispenser, he said. Rival controllers, such as the Arduino, were just as good at connecting to electronics but the Pi was much better when it came to working with the web."The machine received so many emails (including corresponding "thank you" emails) that Google shut down the account due to spam-suspicion - so that was frustrating," he added.Judd liked it too."The servo motor does a 'wiggle' upon receiving an email (which happens a few seconds before the treats fall out)," Mr Saunders told the BBC. "Judd learned to recognise this servo noise just about anywhere in the house and would run over to the machine."Most Pi projects just use one of the machines as a central controller. But one was nowhere near enough for Simon Cox, an engineering professor at the University of Southampton.Prof Cox created a supercomputer for less than £2,500 using 64 interconnected Raspberry Pi devices. The computing cluster runs off mains power and can address 1TB of memory."Building it was absolutely not about computer power," he said. Instead the system, dubbed Iridis Pi, was built to help people get to grips with the computational challenges of working with large numbers of tightly connected computers."It's about understanding all the pain of getting them to work together and the intricacies of building an algorithm to use them," he said.That was a skill all engineers needed in order to design and test their ideas, he said, but one that few had a chance to exercise before they reached university.The schematics and software for Iridis-Pi had been publicly released so anyone could replicate it and start developing that much-needed competence with computational science, said Prof Cox.Most Pi-based projects flaunt their wires and make a virtue of the tiny computer at their heart. Not so with Scott Garner's Beet Box project.In the creation of these interactive vegetables, Mr Garner, a designer and craftsman, was more interested in what he calls "invisible technology"."I like the idea of the next generation growing up in a world that isn't all screens and buttons - I think some nice wood and a few vegetables make for a good alternative," he said."Having done some experiments with both capacitive sensors and 'edible circuits', I decided it would be interesting to combine both concepts," he added."I spent a little time trying to think of the perfect vegetable-instrument combo and once I hit on beats from beets there was no looking back."The Pi won out over other ways to connect up and control sensors and speakers because of its processing power. Despite its flexibility this Pi project did present some unique problems."Dealing with produce as part of a circuit definitely comes with some challenges," said Mr Garner."The biggest difficultly is that as the beets dry out, their ability to conduct the touch signals is weakened."In practice, though, they suffered cosmetic damage from so many hands long before they failed as sensors, so having a few spares at the ready was necessary."The Raspberry Pi computers that Brendan O'Connor has used for his project are also hidden, albeit for very different reasons.Mr O'Connor has used the devices to help create some passive surveillance devices that can sit and sip the air for all the data leaking out from smartphones, tablets and laptops.Mr O'Connor's plan was to spread a series of the Pi-powered sensors, or Distributed Object Locators (Dols), around a city and use them to gradually build up information about the gadgets that pass by.Each one is about the size of a can of spam and is battery powered so it could sit unobtrusively in a locker, on top of a cupboard or in a bush in a park for weeks grabbing data.The Pi helped make it possible to get the boxes co-ordinating the information they find and sending it to their controller.The boxes - called CreepyDols - gather up the many status and query messages sent out by the gadgets that people carry around, said Mr O'Connor.Most of them had no idea their gadgets were broadcasting this information or that it could be used to pick them out of a crowd."Even a very savvy user has no way to stop it being shared," he said.Passive surveillance systems were also finding a role in environmental monitoring, said Mr O'Connor, where many different local conditions, such as humidity, temperature and rainfall, needed to be logged over a long period of time.</body>

      <title>The tech modernising Kenya's matatus</title>
      <description>How tech is modernising Nairobi's ramshackle buses</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24426676</url>
      <date>1381187146</date>
      <body>Matatus - the ramshackle public minibuses seating between 14 and 24 people that zip along the streets of Kenya's capital Nairobi - carry a third of the city's residents to and from work each day.The journey from the city centre to the working-class suburb of Rongai takes between 45 minutes and two hours, depending on traffic.Yet inside the "Ferguson" matatu - named for its colourful images of the former Manchester United manager - half a dozen passengers seem oblivious to the length of their commute.Instead, they sit glued to their smartphones, checking the latest news, YouTube videos and catching up on emails.Ferguson is one of more than 1,000 matatus in the city now equipped with free wi-fi for passengers to enjoy through a service called Vuma Online, launched this April by Safaricom, Kenya's biggest telecom company.The goal, according to Kevin Bett of Safaricom, is to "convert [passengers] to internet users".But for matatu drivers and conductors it's giving them an edge over intense competition for passengers."We get more passengers," says Victor Njuguna, a Vuma-equipped matatu conductor. "They actually wait for our bus - they want to enjoy free wi-fi."Nairobi is East Africa's economic, business and technology hub.It has grown from half a million residents in the 1970s to more than three million today. It has grown outward, not upward resulting in an unplanned semi-urban sprawl.It is perhaps no surprise then that the city ranks as the fourth most painful commute in the world, according to IBM's Commuter Pain Index.The government estimates that traffic jams cost the economy more than 50m Kenyan shillings (£365,000; $585,000) per day in lost productivity, fuel consumption and pollution.While the government has ambitious plans to build new roads and bypasses for the city, and even establish a mass rapid transit system and rapid light rail by 2030, progress, like the traffic itself, seems painfully slow.Though Nairobi's commute is dreadful to most, for some of Kenya's burgeoning "silicon savannah" techies, it's an opportunity."Commutes can be up to three hours long," says Jeremy Gordon, chief executive of FlashCast, a Kenyan tech start-up. "That's a captive audience whose time is pretty under-used."Launched in 2012, FlashCast has designed a location-based advertising system for buses and matatus, using a red LED marquee display connected to a GPS unit and 3G modem installed in the vehicles.Yet advertising alone can be boring."If we can't make it an entertaining, engaging experience, it's not worth it for them," explains Mr Gordon. "We also display news headlines, short quizzes, games, word scrambles and discussion topics."For example, in April they asked riders on selected buses to nominate the #BestDressed Passenger on the bus.The replies ended up being a huge hit, with responses such as "Red lipstick grey top blue jeans seated back seat next 2 the window on the left side. #pliz…""People have a desire to be stimulated when they're sitting in traffic," says Mr Gordon, "so it's a win win."It's also a win for the vehicle owners, since they earn a share of the advertising revenues.However, entertaining commuters - and occasionally helping them hit on each other - isn't the only service FlashCast offers.Since its GPS units track vehicles in real time, it is making that traffic information available through its Android mobile app so that customers can track the location and movement of certain buses, to help figure out which route to take to beat the traffic.Traffic delays are just one part of Nairobi's commuter woes. A greater problem lies in the structure of the public transportation system itself - a semi-formal and chaotic set-up of 20,000 privately owned matatus and buses.Although in theory there may be set prices, the market forces of supply and demand come into play. So if it rains, for example, prices go up.And since passengers pay cash fares directly to drivers or conductors, the matatu and bus owners have no way of knowing how much profit their vehicles are making.As a result, owners simply demand a flat daily fee from their staff, with the remaining profits split between the driver and conductor.While in Europe and other parts of the world prepaid cashless systems for public transportation are the norm, in Nairobi cash is still king.Yet that may be about to change. In May, Google launched a cashless, prepaid card system for the city's public transport, called BebaPay.Conductors are equipped with small, NFC (near-field communication) enabled smartphones. Passengers simply tap their BebaPay card to the phone.Money is then digitally transferred from the card to the phone, and passengers get a message on their phone confirming the transaction.The physical BebaPay cards can be purchased and topped up with credit at various locations across the city. The service doesn't require a bank account - just a Google account - and the cards and phones work without an internet connection."Cashless will lead to greater transparency, accountability, organisation… and ultimately better public transportation infrastructure," says Denis Gikunda from Google's Nairobi office.BebaPay is part of Google's broader strategy to "simplify payments", he says, and improve lives of people in emerging markets."Transport was a great place to begin, because it captures all the problems - a lot of transactions, frequently, all cash-based."Eventually, he says, BebaPay will not just be used for transportation, but for payment services across the city - from taxis, to public toilets and small retail kiosks.These high-tech solutions are certainly helping commuters in various ways, but few address one of passengers' main concerns - safety.The World Health Organization's Global Status Report on Road Safety estimates that there were nearly 8,500 deaths from traffic incidents in Kenya last year.One-third of all fatalities are passengers, many a result of "unsafe forms of public transportation". The finger is often pointed at reckless matatu drivers."What [passengers] want most is safety - to arrive at the destination in one piece," says Simon Kimuta of the Matatu Owners Association of Kenya.For that, he says, what Nairobi needs is better fleet management to monitor activity, and vehicles fitted with gadgets to monitor speeding, so owners can react.Yet more simple methods may also be effective.An initiative called the Zusha Project, funded by Georgetown University, recently randomly assigned stickers to the passenger cabs of 2,500 matatus around Kenya, with mottos such as "stand up and speak up" against bad driving.The idea was to get passengers to complain directly to the drivers about their reckless driving.After looking at aggregated insurance data, the project found matatus with stickers were in fact half as likely to get into accidents.As Billy Jack, associate professor of economics at Georgetown University who was part of the project, puts it: "Sometimes it's a low-tech solution that works the best."</body>

      <title>How to get broadband to rural UK</title>
      <description>How to get broadband to rural Britain</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24366190</url>
      <date>1381100451</date>
      <body>Over the summer there was a lot of digging going on in the Lancashire countryside.Nothing unusual there you may think until you realise that these trenches are being built to house a fibre optic network with speeds to rival those that Google is installing in Kansas City.The community-led Broadband 4 Rural North (B4RN) scheme offers speeds of up to 1Gbps (gigabit per second) to communities along its route.And as it expands its network, more villages are asking if they can be connected too, proving that if you build it, they will come.The project has hit problems - some minor, like a delay over the summer caused by some nesting lapwings, but some bigger, for example when Network Rail refused permission for the ducts to run over a bridge, forcing it to reroute in a river.However its biggest problem is money. Despite raising £300,000 worth of local investment, the team behind the project estimate that the total cost will be £1.86m.It applied for a government grant but is still waiting to hear whether it will qualify while it is also finding it tricky to get a loan.It illustrates the difficulty of getting even a small-scale broadband network up and running and also begs the questions - why would farmers digging the trenches even want to take on such a project?The reality is that they and other local residents are fed up with slow or non-existent broadband.Commercial broadband providers like BT see no profit in rolling out complicated networks to a handful of houses in the middle of nowhere.And that is rather galling for the people living in such communities who need broadband just as much, in some cases more, than their urban counterparts.Broadband is now widely acknowledged as the fourth utility, and the government is all too aware that it needs to close the digital divide between town and country.But its solution - to offer £530m to councils to subsidise rural broadband roll-outs - has been widely criticised, most recently in a report from a group of MPs who make up the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).The process has been painfully slow. Initially the Department of Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) planned to complete the roll-outs by 2015.Now that has been put back to 2017, with the caveat that up to 10% of the country will still not be covered.When it became clear that former telecoms monopoly BT had won every single council contract, there were some angry reactions.The PAC report accused the DCMS of ripping off taxpayers by simply handing public money to BT.This week as BT puts the final dots on those contracts, the big question is where does it leave the community schemes like B4RN?While the current subsidy is now gone, the PAC report recommended the government make every effort to ensure that the next round of public funding - the £250m earmarked for the final 10% not covered in current plans - is spent more wisely."It can't simply be put into a pot marked BT. There has to be more competition. This is a good opportunity to make government funding go a lot further," said Malcolm Corbett, who heads up the independent networks co-operative association (Inca).He estimates that the local community broadband schemes supported by his organisation can offer a much faster service to remote communities and require far less state aid than that demanded by BT, largely because they rely on co-investments with the local people.It is a view that the government does not seem to share. A separate £20m provided by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to specifically fund innovative rural broadband schemes, including Lancashire's B4RN project, looks like it could be going the same way as the money provided by the DCMS."Our information indicates that almost all of the money will go to BT," said Mr Corbett."I'm on the point of giving up. Whatever we do and despite an extraordinarily critical government report, we still can't get these schemes out there. BT is just so powerful," he said.BT's managing director of Next Generation Access, Bill Murphy, is not surprised that community schemes are struggling to gain headway."Our payback on rural broadband is 15 years. This is not for the faint-hearted. If people want to go build, then go build but, as I tell them, broadband networks aren't just for Christmas,"And he is dubious that community schemes can roll out networks cheaper than BT."I spend a lot of time sitting in village halls hearing about how they want to build their own thing but none of them have ever built anything before. I admire their passion and commitment but I'm not going to be preached at by people who don't have the experience. Don't tell me that you can build a network cheaper than me," he said.One of the biggest criticisms in the PAC report was that BT and local authorities are failing to provide detailed information about how far their roll-outs would extend.Without such information it will be hard for rivals to offer projects to compete with BT.Gigaclear is one such rival. It is offering a 1Gbps fibre to the home service to homes in Oxfordshire and Rutland and hopes to extend its footprint to Hampshire and Kent.But lack of certainty about where BT may build networks is hampering its efforts."Under the current contracts drawn up with BT, councils can't say what areas will be upgraded until three months beforehand," said their marketing director Joe Frost."It means that whole areas will not be told anything for two years. That is a problem for them and for us," he said.The issue has led the Countryside Alliance to demand change."BT and the local authorities aren't being transparent about where the roll-out will cover. We need to see a map with postcode trackers showing what communities will be left out," said their head of policy Sarah Lee.For its part, BT said that it is up to local authorities to provide this information and that increasingly they are doing so.Anyone wanting to know whether their community will be covered by the current roll-out has simply to phone their council, added Mr Murphy.One of the most interesting things about the alternative community schemes is that they tend to favour faster fibre to the home technology (FTTH) over BT's preferred fibre to the street cabinet (FTTC), even though it is far more expensive to lay.Retired engineer Walter Wilcox has campaigned for years to get better broadband in the village of Ewhurst in Surrey and when it finally did come, he was unhappy with it."There are 76 houses that can't get the service, two properties where the fibre service is worse than the one they had before and we estimate 226 properties out of about 942 are unable to achieve the lower limit of 24 Mbps," he said.The upgrade was done by BT using FTTC.BT admits that the upgrade in Ewhurst took "longer than it should" and that 'there is still work to do"."There are about 5% of people in the village who can't get the service but we are working on solutions to fix this." said Mr Murphy.But what has happened in Ewhurst could be replicated around the country because, with a few exceptions, it is the technology that will form the backbone of BT's rollout.Many worry that FTTC is already an outdated technology, ill-suited to rural communities because the speed you get is in relation to how close you live to a street cabinet.In contrast the FTTH technology favoured by B4RN and other community schemes offers the same speed to everyone - and with a top speed of 1Gbps it is not going to be past its sell by date any time soon.As Chris Conder who sits on B4RN's management team puts it: "Fibre to the cabinet is like giving people a cold water tap whereas with fibre to the home they can have a hot power shower."B4RN already has plenty of satisfied customers on its network but whether it and others like it are really equipped for a nationwide fibre battle with BT remains distinctly uncertain.But there are plenty of people living in some of Britain's remotest places rooting for them.</body>

      <title>Can we trust the spying state?</title>
      <description>Assessing the impact of Edward Snowden</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24399213</url>
      <date>1380887494</date>
      <body>How worried should we be by the state's capability to spy on us?Top secret documents, leaked by former American intelligence analyst Edward Snowden, have revealed the huge capacity of Britain and America's intelligence agencies - GCHQ and the NSA - to capture communications.Snowden and his supporters have argued that the public should know more about what is happening, while governments have argued that exposure has endangered national security.Four months after the first revelations in the Guardian newspaper, a picture has emerged of Britain and America's intelligence-gathering capabilities.Taken together, the reports point to an ambition to be able to reach into the vast global tide of digital communications and be able to pick out any message and read it, as well as to conduct wide-ranging searches of billions of records to look for patterns and connections."Even if you're not doing anything wrong you're being watched and recorded," argued Edward Snowden. "You should decide if they should be doing this."Those who have worked inside the secret state say that the power is vital for national security and only used for national security."You have to have a powerful capability to find the small amount you're looking for - but that doesn't mean the state is reading everyone's emails," former GCHQ director Sir David Omand told the BBC."What the state needs and law enforcement needs is the possibility of accessing the communications of the terrorists, the criminals, the kidnappers, the proliferators, the paedophiles. But those communications are all mixed up with everyone else's communications - there are 204 million emails a minute buzzing around the globe."So you have to have a powerful capability to find the small amount that you are looking for. But it doesn't mean that the state is reading everyone's emails, nor would that conceivably be feasible."But can we trust the state with this power?Technology allows it to do things it could never have done before - collecting and sifting through billions of records using data mining to find a connection or reconstructing a person's social interactions from the trail they leave behind online.The lack of sufficient oversight worries those who have campaigned on civil liberties."Part of the problem here is an age problem," says David Davis, a former Conservative Shadow Home Secretary."My generation of politicians - up to ones 20 years younger than me - don't really understand the extent to which we are intruding into people's privacy."Mr Davis believes the current system of oversight and accountability is not strong enough, especially when access to metadata about communications and interactions only requires internal authorisation within an intelligence agency - and not the warrant that is required to intercept the actual content of communications."There is no need to trust the state unless it has got a good reason and they must justify that to someone else - a judge or a magistrate or someone who is outside their system and can check they are using it properly," he argues.The claim that encryption standards have been deliberately weakened or had so-called "backdoors" added to allow access by intelligence agencies caused particular anger among those who have spent their careers trying to improve internet security and ensure the privacy of communications."The NSA's actions have done more than undermine online security - they've threatened to break the internet," Ross Anderson, Professor in Security Engineering at Cambridge University says of its attempts to ensure access."In order to do this they have compromised in various ways the protocols on which the internet relies. When you introduce these vulnerabilities, they are not just for the spies to use. They are available for bad guys to use as well."The Snowden documents have surprised many, including Prof Anderson, in terms of the scale of what they reveal."To find that they had built this machine and got it working is an eye-opener," he told the BBC.Critics of the intelligence agencies believe the disclosures have been important in starting a public debate about whether we know enough about the state's capability and whether there are enough controls and oversight.But many of those inside the intelligence world point to the damage which they say the revelations have done. They fear that since Edward Snowden is in Russia, the Russian state will have found some way of accessing the information."Part of me says that not even the KGB in its heyday of Philby, Burgess and Maclean in the 1950s could have dreamt of acquiring 58,000 highly classified intelligence documents," Sir David Omand told the BBC.The concern is also that the more that is revealed in public, the more the targets of surveillance adapt their behaviour. Sir David believes Snowden's actions will do real damage to national security."My fear is that we are now going to witness a slow-motion car crash in which gradually sources dry up, targets such as terrorists and cybercriminals will work out what are the kind of capabilities we have, and they will adopt their methods and be harder to track down," says the former GCHQ director.In the last week, the BBC was given direct access to a small selection of original documents held outside the UK that form the basis of stories the Guardian newspaper has already published.The scale of the capability they reveal - and the secrets they contain - make clear there are serious issues involved in balancing the public interest and national security. That balance lies at the heart of this debate - between the public interest and the right to know about what the state can do and the need for the state to protect its secrets and its capabilities for the sake of national security.The question remains - who gets to decide?</body>

      <title>World adopts landmark mercury treaty</title>
      <description>Nations have begun signing a legally binding treaty designed to curb mercury pollution and the use of the toxic metal in products around the globe.</description>

      <body>Nations have begun signing a legally binding treaty designed to curb mercury pollution and the use of the toxic metal in products around the globe.Mercury can produce a range of adverse human health effects, including permanent damage to the nervous system.The UN treaty was formally adopted at a high level meeting in Japan.The Minamata Convention was named after the Japanese city that, in the 1950s, saw one of the world's worst cases of mercury poisoning.In January, four years of negotiations concluded with more than 140 countries agreeing on a set of legally binding measures to curb mercury pollution.UN data showed that mercury emissions were rising in a number of developing nations.The convention regulates a range of areas, including:Earlier this year, the UN Environment Programme (Unep) published a report warning that developing nations were facing growing health and environmental risks from increased exposure to mercury.It said a growth in small-scale mining and coal burning were the main reasons for the rise in emissions.As a result of rapid industrialisation, South-East Asia was the largest regional emitter and accounted for almost half of the element's annual global emissions, it said.'Highly toxic'Mercury - a heavy, silvery white metal - is a liquid at room temperature and can evaporate easily. Within the environment, it is found in cinnabar deposits. It is also found in natural forms in a range of other rocks, including limestone and coal.Mercury can be released into the environment through a number of industrial processes including mining, metal and cement production, and the burning of fossil fuels.Once emitted, it persists in the environment for a long time - circulating through air, water, soil and living organisms - and can be dispersed over vast distances.The World Health Organization (WHO) says: "Mercury is highly toxic to human health, posing a particular threat to the development of the (unborn) child and early in life."The inhalation of mercury vapour can produce harmful effects on the nervous, digestive and immune systems, lungs and kidneys, and may be fatal."The inorganic salts of mercury are corrosive to the skin, eyes and gastrointestinal tract, and may induce kidney toxicity if ingested."The Unep assessment said the concentration of mercury in the top 100m of the world's oceans had doubled over the past century, and estimated that 260 tonnes of the toxic metal had made their way from soil into rivers and lakes.Another characteristic, it added, was that mercury became more concentrated as it moved up the food chain, reaching its highest levels in predator fish that could be consumed by humans.Campaigners urged nations to sign the land-mark agreement."Millions of people around the world are exposed to the toxic effect of mercury," said Juliane Kippenberg, senior children's right researcher at Human Rights Watch."This treaty will help protect both the environment and people's right to health."</body>

      <body>Russia has replaced the head of its space programme, Vladimir Popovkin.The move follows a series of setbacks including an unmanned rocket that crashed and exploded seconds after lift-off.Oleg Ostapenko, who was previously a deputy defence minister, was appointed the new space chief by prime minister Dmitry Medvedev.Prior to his ministerial role, Ostapenko served as commander of the military's space forces.Speaking to Mr Ostapenko, Mr Medvedev said: "You've been engaged in the space industry all your life including at the military posts."Now you are set to be involved with space in a slightly different dimension. No doubt that this topic is complex and requires greater attention from the state."The outgoing Vladimir Popovkin had been in the role for two-and-a-half years. He was appointed in April 2011 during a time of difficulty with the country's space programme. Russia had lost three satellites when a rocket crashed into the Pacific Ocean.Mr Popovkin had pledged to improve manufacturing standards and quality checks, but he struggled to deliver.His time as head was marked by embarrassments including the explosion of an unmanned Russian Proton-M rocket, crashed after its launch from the Russian Baikonur facility in Kazakhstan.The accident was captured live by Russian television in July and the crash spread hundreds of tonnes of toxic rocket fuel.Other countries still depend on Russia to launch manned rockets to the International Space Station.</body>

      <body>American scientists are scrambling to preserve vital research programmes amid the US government funding shutdown.Key projects investigating ice loss in Antarctica are among those at risk as plans for fieldwork are stalled.If the expeditions do not go ahead, it could jeopardise investigations that have gathered data over decades.Medical research, including studies of degenerative disease, is also held up as government-employed scientists have been sent home.The case of the National Science Foundation is typical of many US funding bodies - it has closed its front door and no-one is answering calls or emails. Websites of the likes of Nasa are redirecting to holding pages.The chief concern among scientists is that long-running projects monitoring change could now be harmed by a sudden break in the flow of data.One major initiative known as IceBridge - which uses aircraft to study the edges of the ice-sheet in West Antarctica, and is regarded as crucial for understanding future sea-level rise - has been delayed by two weeks already.The planes are fitted with laser and radar systems to measure the height of the ice sheet as it approaches the coast - and gathering annual data is essential for researchers trying to understand patterns of change.The plan for the approaching field season in Antarctica was to operate the plane from landing strips on the ice but this will become impossible later next month as temperatures rise with the Southern Hemisphere summer, potentially putting at risk the entire season's fieldwork.Teams involved in the project are known to be working on contingency plans in the hope that a budget deal can be struck soon by US President Barack Obama and the House of Representatives.With official lines of communication between funding agencies and scientists currently suspended, many have resorted to private corridors to maintain some level of organisation. Information is being passed through Gmail and Hotmail accounts, and through social media such as Facebook and Twitter.The message put out to Antarctic researchers on Wednesday was that the upcoming season was not all lost. Many groups are not due to go out until December, and so there is still the chance that some projects can be rescued."But there is this overwhelming sense of confusion and frustration, and the inability to get clear information on what is going on because the NSF has closed along with the other government agencies," one university glaciologist told the BBC."We've been told to keep planning for the Antarctic season, but it's like being at school and all the teachers have gone home; you don't know where to go for guidance because they're not there."With many major research projects now run internationally, the effect of the US shutdown will also be felt by scientists beyond the United States.Several British polar scientists are thought to be scheduled to join American expeditions but face being delayed or even losing out completely.For the moment, the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) is insisting that the impact on UK polar science will be minimal.But Prof Jane Francis, director of BAS, warned in a statement that, "the potential loss of data which would be collected by American scientists, and shared with other research teams, would have an impact on the science we conduct."At present, BAS is working on the assumption the US financial situation will be resolved soon, and any joint work can go ahead as planned. We are monitoring the situation on a daily basis."One American project known as RICE, investigating a margin of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, is due to involve scientists from China, New Zealand, Denmark and one researcher from the UK. At the moment, its fate is uncertain.Other fields of research are vulnerable, too - and British scientists are among those raising concerns.Prof John Hardy, of University College London, said: "Vital work on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's is being held up while hardworking scientists are being forced to stay at home, without even being allowed to read their email. It is difficult to see how this is fiscally responsible."Imran Khan, chief executive of the British Science Association, said: "The biggest lesson we should take from this week's Nobel Prizes is that science doesn't belong to one nation; it's an international and collaborative human enterprise."Our scientists work with American scientists, and the UK public benefits enormously from research that goes on there, as well as vice versa."If the shutdown continues, it's bad news for both scientists and the public here in the UK as well as across the pond."American satellites are still functioning and data is being gathered, but Nasa scientists are among those refused funding to travel to international conferences - a key part of the process of scientific exchange.One leading space agency scientist, speaking from home, told me that the shutdown was "deeply frustrating and very bad for morale - it's illegal for us to work".Instead of managing a research project, he's keeping himself busy in his garden. "The koi pond has never looked better," he said.</body>

      <title>Minister considers gassing badgers</title>
      <description>The government is exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB, environment secretary Owen Paterson tells MPs.</description>

      <body>The government is exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has told MPs.A six week trial of badger culling in Somerset has now ended.But the firm behind it has asked for more time after its marksmen fell short of killing the target of 70% of the badger population.Mr Paterson said the Department for Food and Rural Affairs was looking at other methods including the use of gas.Responding to a question from Green MP Caroline Lucas in the Commons, Mr Paterson said: "Until we can establish vaccines, we have to use the tools used by other sensible countries - which is to remove wildlife - we made it quite clear in our TB strategy we would look at other methods of removing wildlife, and yes we are looking at gassing, but we will not use it unless it is proven to be safe, humane, and effective."Labour MP Barry Sheerman called the badger cull "morally reprehensible" and asked Mr Paterson "why doesn't he resign?" during heated Commons exchanges.Marksmen only managed to shoot 60% of the badgers in the trial area in Somerset, although estimates have been lowered as to how many badgers lived in the region in the first place.The company behind the cull has asked for more time and a similar time extension is being sought for a trial cull Gloucestershire.The government is due to make a decision on extending the culls later this week.Farmers have long blamed badgers for spreading bovine TB in cattle but animal rights groups say evidence does not support this.At one time gassing was the preferred method of culling but it was dropped in favour of shooting, which is seen as more humane.The RSPCA said it was "opposed to the use of gas to control badgers on welfare grounds and believes it is not humane as it may cause badgers to suffer prolonged deaths underground"."We are extremely concerned about the government's admission that they are looking into using gassing to cull badgers," the organisation said in a statement."Culling badgers will not solve the problem of bovine TB in cattle, whatever the method of culling."The possible gassing of badgers adds a further outrageous twist to this misguided policy. The RSPCA will look into reports that badgers have been gassed in and around the pilot cull areas."Martin Surl, Police and Crime Commissioner for Gloucestershire, has warned that plans to extend the cull could stretch police resources in his area.Mr Surl told the the Stroud News and Journal: "My concern is that the cull operators are feeling the pressure and may become more desperate in their attempts to shoot their quota of badgers while the people opposed to the cull are getting equally frustrated, all of which adds up to an unhelpful situation."But Laurence Robertson, Conservative MP for Tewkesbury, dismissed Mr Surl's concerns, accusing him in the Commons of being "publicity-seeking", adding that it was for the government to decide whether to extend the cull.In the trial which has just ended, the plan was to shoot and kill 70% of badgers in the areas of west Somerset and Gloucestershire by free shooting.Across both regions this meant around 5,000 badgers were to be killed in total.But Defra sources said these targets were based on population estimates from 2012 that have proved to be highly inaccurate.Explaining the failure to meet the target on Wednesday, Mr Paterson said: "The badgers moved the goalposts."We're dealing with a wild animal, subject to the vagaries of the weather and disease and breeding patterns."But rock star and campaigner Brian May, a leading opponent of the cull, branded the trial an "utter failure" and described the application for an extension as a "farce"."They were warned this would happen and they did not listen to the scientists," he added.</body>

      <title>Material could be strongest yet</title>
      <description>A material called carbyne could be stronger even than graphene or diamond, according to researchers who have calculated its properties.</description>

      <body>A material called carbyne could be stronger even than graphene or diamond, according to researchers who have calculated its properties.A team says carbyne could have a range of remarkable properties, if it can ever be made in bulk - and some experts have doubted whether this is possible.They have published their findings in the journal ACS Nano.Carbyne is a chain of carbon atoms held together by double or alternating single and triple chemical bonds.In their paper, Boris Yakobson and colleagues from Rice University in Houston show that carbyne's tensile strength - the ability to withstand stretching - surpasses that of "any other known material" and is double that of graphene, the flat sheet of carbon atoms that is often held up as a "supermaterial".Scientists have already calculated that it would take an elephant balancing on a pencil to break through a sheet of graphene.They also calculated that carbyne has twice the tensile stiffness of graphene and carbon nanotubes and nearly three times that of diamond.It should display a number of other useful properties say the researchers. For example, it could be turned into a magnetic semiconductor (these are materials with electrical conductivity between that of a metal and an insulator like glass) and could be used as a sensor to detect twisting.Some scientists have reported synthesising small amounts of carbyne in the lab, but it was thought to be extremely unstable. And some chemists have suggested that two strands coming into contact could react explosively."Our intention was to put it all together, to construct a complete mechanical picture of carbyne as a material," said Vasilii Artyukhov, also from Rice University."The fact that it has been observed tells us it's stable under tension, at least, because otherwise it would just fall apart."</body>

      <title>Alzheimer's find is 'turning point'</title>
      <description>A chemical which can stop brain cell death in a neurodegenerative disease could hold the key for treating Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntingdon's diseases, scientists say.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24462699</url>
      <date>1381395409</date>
      <body>The discovery of the first chemical to prevent the death of brain tissue in a neurodegenerative disease has been hailed as the "turning point" in the fight against Alzheimer's disease.More work is needed to develop a drug that could be taken by patients.But scientists say a resulting medicine could treat Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's and other diseases.In tests on mice, the Medical Research Council showed all brain cell death from prion disease could be prevented.Prof Roger Morris, from King's College London, said: "This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer's disease."He told the BBC a cure for Alzheimer's was not imminent but: "I'm very excited, it's the first proof in any living animal that you can delay neurodegeneration."The world won't change tomorrow, but this is a landmark study."The research team at the Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit, based at the University of Leicester, focused on the natural defence mechanisms built into brain cells.When a virus hijacks a brain cell it leads to a build-up of viral proteins. Cells respond by shutting down nearly all protein production in order to halt the virus's spread.However, many neurodegenerative diseases involve the production of faulty or "misfolded" proteins. These activate the same defences, but with more severe consequences.The misfolded proteins linger and the brain cells shut down protein production for so long that they eventually starve themselves to death.This process, repeated in neurons throughout the brain, can destroy movement or memory or even kill, depending on the disease.This process is thought to take place in many forms of neurodegeneration, so safely disrupting it could treat a wide range of diseases.The researchers used a compound which prevented those defence mechanisms kicking in and in turn halted neurodegeneration.The study, published in Science Translational Medicine, showed mice with prion disease developed severe memory and movement problems. They died within 12 weeks.However, those given the compound showed no sign of brain tissue wasting away.Lead researcher Prof Giovanna Mallucci told the BBC news website: "They were absolutely fine, it was extraordinary."What's really exciting is a compound has completely prevented neurodegeneration and that's a first."This isn't the compound you would use in people, but it means we can do it and it's a start."She said the compound offered a "new pathway that may well give protective drugs" and the next step was for drug companies to develop a medicine for use in humans.Prof Mallucci's lab is also testing the compound on other forms of neurodegeneration in mice but the results have not yet been published.Side effects are an issue. The compound also acted on the pancreas, meaning the mice developed a mild form of diabetes and lost weight.Any human drug would need to act only on the brain. However, this gives scientists and drug companies a starting point.David Allsop, professor of neuroscience at Lancaster University described the results as "very dramatic and highly encouraging" but cautioned that more research was needed to see how the findings would apply to diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.Dr Eric Karran, the director of research at the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said: "Targeting a mechanism relevant to a number of neurodegenerative diseases could yield a single drug with wide-reaching benefits, but this compound is still at an early stage."It will be important for these findings to be repeated and tested in models of other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease."</body>

      <title>Fresh glitches hit Boeing Dreamliner</title>
      <description>Japan Airlines says it has turned around two of its Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft during flights due to technical problems.</description>

      <body>Japan Airlines (JAL) says it has turned around two of its Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft during flights due to technical problems.On one plane one of the two anti-ice systems, which prevent ice building up around the engine, failed.Meanwhile, an electrical glitch made six toilets unusable on another flight.These are the latest technical issues to hit the Dreamliner, which saw the entire fleet being grounded earlier this year following battery problems.The anti-icing system failed on a Tokyo-bound flight that took off from San Diego.A spokesperson for JAL told the BBC that a similar issue had forced a Tokyo-to-Singapore flight to be turned back in June this year.Meanwhile, an electrical system failure connected to the lavatories affected a flight from Moscow to Tokyo.The failure resulted in six of the seven toilets on the plane not being able to flush.The airline said that it was looking into the problems.The 787 Dreamliner has suffered a series of technical and safety problems in recent months.In January, its entire fleet was temporarily grounded. That move was prompted after a fire broke out on one of JAL's Dreamliners, and an All Nippon Airways (ANA) flight was forced to make an emergency landing because of a battery fault and a fire in one of the electrical compartments.Though the planes have since been allowed back into the air, other issues have emerged.In July, a fire broke out on a 787 jet operated by Ethiopian Airlines while it was parked at Heathrow airport. It was traced to the upper rear part of the plane where a locator transmitter is located.Then in August, ANA said it had found damage to the battery wiring on two 787 locator transmitters during checks. US carrier United Airlines also found a pinched wire during an inspection of one of its six 787s.The issues have hurt Boeing.Earlier this week, JAL announced a $9.5bn (£5.9bn) plane deal with rival Airbus. It is the first time that it has agreed to buy Airbus planes, having preferred Boeing for many decades.Analysts have hinted that issues with the Dreamliner may have played a role in JAL's decision.However, despite the issues the Dreamliner is still considered to be one of the most advanced planes in the industry and continues to remain popular.Boeing has received orders for more than 950 jets since its launch.</body>

      <title>Mixed fortunes for Cape vultures</title>
      <description>Expanding networks of pylons and power lines in southern Africa are extending Cape vultures' foraging range but it comes at a cost, say scientists.</description>

      <body>Cape vultures in southern Africa are using expanding networks of pylons and power lines to extend their range, say scientists.At the same time these lines are also contributing to this threatened bird of prey's decline through fatal collisions and electrocutions.The study involved a team of experts from the UK and South Africa tracking individual bird movements using GPS.The results are published in the online journal PLoS One.Southern Africa's Cape vultures (Gyps coprotheres) - like many other species of vulture - are in decline. Contributing factors include feeding on illegally poisoned carcasses and fatal collisions with wind turbines and power lines.To understand more about their movements, and how these vultures interact with power lines, a team of scientists fitted GPS devices to five adult and four immature birds."What we were trying to find out was how far they were going and what sort of areas they were feeding in," explained lead researcher Louis Phipps from Nottingham Trent University, UK.They thought the birds would be travelling large distances, but were not expecting the vultures to be travelling across almost the whole of southern Africa."Their individual home ranges on average cover an area larger than the British Isles which is a huge area and among the largest areas of any vulture," said Mr Phipps.From the capture site the birds travelled up to 1,000km (621 miles) in a straight line and as a group entered five different countries, regularly crossing international borders."It seems that their movement actually followed the pattern and distribution of where those [power] lines were and have been constructed," he said.According to Mr Phipps these vultures are using the pylons and power lines as roosting and perching sites where no other suitable perches are available, allowing them to travel beyond the recognised range for this species.And because they are spending more time in the vicinity of these power lines, the vultures are at a higher risk of colliding with the overhead wires. Even though they could travel further by using the power lines as roost sites, there is an increased risk of fatalities."So just as a mortality factor power lines are bad, but potentially they may be benefitting them by furthering their range to the west," Mr Phipps told BBC Nature.The study also examined the role of protected areas and wildlife reserves."Our data actually shows that although vultures, especially Cape vultures, definitely need these areas for protection...they actually spend most of their time foraging on private farmland."This leaves them exposed to the full range of threats in the wider landscape, more exposed to poisoned livestock carcasses and harmful veterinary drugs which was the cause of the Asian vulture population collapse."Mr Phipps explained that as GPS tracking is very accurate it shows exactly where vultures are foraging, building on this data in the future will allow co-ordinated cross border conservation measures to be implemented in exactly the right areas."There are lots of factors playing against each other that make the vultures' daily life a very big struggle," Mr Phipps told BBC Nature."On balance power lines are not a good thing for vultures."Join BBC Nature on Facebook and Twitter @BBCNature.</body>

      <title>Computer chemists win Nobel prize</title>
      <description>The Nobel Prize in chemistry has been awarded to three scientists who "took the chemical experiment into cyberspace".</description>

      <body>The Nobel Prize in chemistry has gone to three scientists who "took the chemical experiment into cyberspace".Michael Levitt, a British-US citizen of Stanford University; US-Austrian Martin Karplus of Strasbourg University; and US-Israeli Arieh Warshel of the University of Southern California will share the prize.The trio devised computer simulations to understand chemical processes.In doing so, they laid the foundations for new kinds of pharmaceuticals.Today, scientists routinely use modelling to understand how different biological molecules interact, to probe the mechanisms of disease and to design novel drugs."The Nobel Laureates in Chemistry 2013 have made it possible to map the mysterious ways of chemistry by using computers," said the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences."Today the computer is just as important a tool for chemists as the test tube."Detailed knowledge of chemical processes makes it possible to optimise catalysts, drugs and solar cells."Warshel told a news conference in Stockholm by telephone that he was "extremely happy" to be woken in the middle of the night in Los Angeles to find out he had won the prize."In short, what we developed is a way for computers to take the structure of a protein and then to eventually understand how exactly it does what it does," he told reporters.Marinda Li Wu, president of the American Chemical Society, said the award was "very exciting"."The winners have laid the groundwork for linking classic experimental science with theoretical science through computer models."The resulting insights are helping us develop new medicines; for example, their work is being used to determine how a drug could interact with a protein in the body to treat disease."Martyn Poliakoff, vice-president of Britain's Royal Society, said the award was "important recognition" for a major advance in theoretical chemistry."Their novel approach combined both classical and quantum physics, and now enables us to understand how very large molecules react," he explained."This prize highlights the increasing role that theoretical and computational chemistry are playing in this area of science."All three men spent varying periods at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK. Michael Levitt started his PhD at the Medical Research Council facility at the end of the 1960s.Dr Richard Henderson, a current LMB scientist, said the trio's work was hugely important."They came at it from different angles but with a common goal," he told BBC News."They developed computer mathematical models for the forces that hold together mainly proteins, but other biological structures as well. They listed all the forces between atoms, and then they put these into one big computer program and set it running."In this way, they could simulate in the computer the behaviour of real proteins as they folded and unfolded, as they bind substrates and ligands."They were really the first people to push this field forward, and today it has become a worldwide industry."Michael Levitt himself said this success was due in large part to the spectacular performance of modern computing: "I've told people that the silent partner in this prize is the incredible development in computer power."When we started this, no-one had any clue that computers were going to become so powerful; no-one knew about Moore's Law."This incredible increase in computer power has taken everybody by surprise, and I think this is one of the reasons why our field has become so important. And it's just going to get bigger and bigger."</body>

      <title>Extension sought for badger cull</title>
      <description>The original targets for culling badgers are changed as new, more accurate information on population numbers becomes available.</description>

      <body>Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has told the House of Commons that extensions of the badger culls in west Somerset and Gloucestershire are now being considered by Natural England.In a written statement, Mr Paterson said that the pilot culls could be extended by up to three weeks as marksmen have failed to kill enough badgers to reach their original targets.He told the Commons that 850 badgers had been shot in Somerset during the six-week trial, just over 40% of an initial target of 2,081.But he insisted the Somerset scheme had been effective and successful.The controversial pilot culls set out to study if badgers could be killed safely, effectively and humanely.They are being carried out in an attempt to control TB in cattle, which can be spread by badgers - though opponents say the culls will have no impact.The plan was to kill 70% of the badgers in the areas of west Somerset and Gloucestershire by free shooting.Across both regions, this meant around 5,000 badgers were to be killed in total.But the environment secretary said these targets were based on population estimates from 2012 that have proven to be highly inaccurate.As the cull started in August, hundreds of hair traps were set so that DNA could be extracted and analysed to give a more up-to-date assessment of badger numbers.In west Somerset, the environment secretary said the badger population, which had been estimated at 2,400, was now being revised downwards to 1,450. In Gloucestershire, the numbers have been lowered from 3,400 to 2,350.There are a number of reasons behind the apparent decline according to Mr Paterson, including the impact of last winter's bad weather, disease and lack of food."These badger populations go up and down," he said."We're dealing with a wild animal, whose numbers will go up and down depending on weather, disease and other conditions."As a result of the updates, the targets for culling have also been revised downwards to about 2,600 for both areas combined."Badgers moved the goalposts," Mr Paterson told BBC Spotlight in the West Country.To kill 70% of the badgers now estimated to live in west Somerset, the culling company needs to kill 1,015 badgers.After six weeks of shooting, they had achieved 59%, and the company is now seeking an extension of its licence for another two to three weeks.Peter Kendall, president of the National Farmers' Union, said the number of badgers to be killed had been reduced because it was important not to "wipe out" entire populations.He told BBC Breakfast the marksmen needed "a few more weeks" to "meet the best criteria that the scientists have set"."Last year, 38,000 cattle were killed and we've got to do something about the spread of this ghastly disease," he added.Asked why the desired number of badgers had not been killed, especially given the lower total population now estimated, Mr Kendall said these were pilot schemes and those involved are "learning as we go".He said there had been some "protester activity" and all shooting had been stopped whenever a person was "spotted in a vicinity", though he said the protesters were not the reason the target number had not been reached.The environment secretary said that even on the lower figures, the culling exercise had been effective."The chief veterinary officer has advised that the 60% reduction this year will deliver clear disease benefits as part of a four-year cull," he told the House.Mr Paterson said that the culling company carrying out the Gloucestershire cull had also sought an extension.The Labour Party were quick to condemn the move for an extension of the cull, with new Shadow Environment Secretary Maria Eagle saying the process was "entirely bad.""Culling is not working, not effective and not based on any scientific evidence," she said.Any extension of the culling period could, in fact, increase the spread of TB as badgers were disturbed by the shooting, she said.Campaigning groups also criticised the extensions and the new numbers, saying they were suspiciously convenient. They also criticised the increased costs that would result."We estimate that the cull so far has cost around £2m, including police costs," said Dominic Dyer, policy advisor for Care for the Wild International."If they kill around 2,000 badgers, that works out at about £1,000 each - this must be the most expensive cull in history. Vaccinating badgers would be much cheaper."</body>

      <title>Higgs boson wins Nobel physics prize</title>
      <description>Peter Higgs and Francois Englert have won the Nobel prize in physics for their work on the theory of the Higgs boson, discovered at Cern in 2012.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24436781</url>
      <date>1381240861</date>
      <body>Two scientists have won the Nobel prize in physics for their work on the theory of the Higgs boson.Peter Higgs, from the UK, and Francois Englert from Belgium, share the prize.In the 1960s, they were among several physicists who proposed a mechanism to explain why the most basic building blocks of the Universe have mass.The mechanism predicts a particle - the Higgs boson - which was finally discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Cern, in Switzerland."This year's prize is about something small that makes all the difference," said Staffan Normark, permanent secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.Prof Higgs is renowned for shying away from the limelight, and he could not be located for interview in the immediate aftermath of the announcement."He's gone on holiday without a phone," his Edinburgh University physics colleague Alan Walker told the BBC, adding that Higgs had also been unwell."He is taking a break from all of this, taking some time to relax, because he knows when he comes back he'll have to face up to a media storm."But the university released a prepared statement from Higgs, 84, who is an emeritus professor of theoretical physics:"I am overwhelmed to receive this award and thank the Royal Swedish Academy," he said."I would also like to congratulate all those who have contributed to the discovery of this new particle and to thank my family, friends and colleagues for their support."I hope this recognition of fundamental science will help raise awareness of the value of blue-sky research."Francois Englert, 80, said he was "very happy" to win the award, speaking at the ceremony via phone link."At first I thought I didn't have [the prize] because I didn't see the announcement," he told the committee, after their news conference was delayed by more than an hour.Higgs was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, but it was in Edinburgh in 1964 that he had his big idea - an explanation of why the matter in the Universe has substance, or mass.His theory involved a missing particle in the Standard Model of physics, which has come to be known as the Higgs boson.Within weeks, Francois Englert had independently published his own, similar theory, alongside his now deceased colleague Robert Brout.Three other physicists - Gerald Guralnik, Tom Kibble and Carl Hagen - also made key contributions to the theory, and spoke at the announcement of the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012.Hagen has long argued for the name of the particle to be changed, protesting at the "rock star" status in which Higgs is held.And Higgs, too, has expressed his discomfort with the attention he has received, preferring to call the particle "the scalar boson".In a statement on Tuesday, Kibble, of Imperial College London, said he was "glad" the Nobel prize had gone to the work of Higgs and Englert."My two collaborators, Gerald Guralnik and Carl Hagen, and I contributed to that discovery, but our paper was unquestionably the last of the three to be published."It is therefore no surprise that the Swedish Academy felt unable to include us, constrained as they are by a self-imposed rule that the prize cannot be shared by more than three people."My sincere congratulations go to the two prize winners, Francois Englert and Peter Higgs."And the renowned physicist Prof Stephen Hawking added his praise: "In the early 60s, theorists were struggling to understand why particles have mass. Peter Higgs and Francois Englert proposed a mechanism called symmetry breaking. This mechanism also predicted a massive particle, the Higgs boson. The discovery last year at Cern of a particle with the correct properties confirms this prediction and is a triumph for theory."Proving the theory correct took almost half a century and involved creating the biggest and most sophisticated machine humankind has ever built.The LHC at Cern lies in a circular tunnel 27km (17 miles) round. It is so big it is partly in Switzerland, partly in France. It took 10 years and thousands of scientists and engineers to build it.Cern director general Rolf Heuer said he was "thrilled" that this year's prize had gone to particle physics."The discovery of the Higgs boson at Cern... marks the culmination of decades of intellectual effort by many people around the world," he commented.The Nobel prizes - which also cover chemistry, medicine, literature, peace and economics - are valued at 8m Swedish krona (£775,000; $1.2m). Laureates also receive a medal and a diploma.The official citation for Englert and Higgs read: "For the theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles, and which recently was confirmed through the discovery of the predicted fundamental particle, by the Atlas and CMS experiments at Cern's Large Hadron Collider".David Willetts, UK minister for universities and science, said the award was "an incredible endorsement of the quality of UK science".Prime Minister David Cameron said: "This brilliant achievement is richly deserved recognition of Peter Higgs' lifetime of dedicated research and his passion for science."It is also a credit to the world-leading British universities in which this research was carried out."It took nearly 50 years and thousands of great minds to discover the Higgs boson after Prof Higgs proposed it, and he and all those people should be extremely proud."</body>

      <body>China has criticised the US space agency Nasa over its decision to bar Chinese scientists from attending a conference in the United States.The meeting is a key event for scientists searching for planets beyond the solar system.Nasa has rejected applications from Chinese nationals, citing a new security law.In Beijing, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying called the move "discriminatory".The conference is for US and international teams who work on Nasa's Kepler space telescope programme.It will be held at Nasa's Ames research centre in California next month.Nasa has based its ban on a new law which prohibits anyone from China setting foot in any of its buildings.The law, passed in March, is part of a broad and aggressive move initiated by congressman Frank Wolf, chair of the House appropriations subcommittee that has jurisdiction over Nasa.The counter-espionage legislation aims to restrict foreign nationals' access to Nasa facilities.Nasa's decision has angered many US scientists who say Chinese students and researchers in their labs are being discriminated against.A growing number of US scientists have decided to boycott the meeting in protest, with senior academics withdrawing individually, or pulling out their entire research groups.Rep Wolf himself called Nasa's decision "inaccurate".He said the purpose of the law was to prevent Nasa from co-operating with the Chinese government and Chinese-owned companies, not individuals.At a regular news briefing in Beijing, Chinese spokeswoman Ms Hua said she was aware of reports on Nasa's decision."At the same time I have also noticed that the discriminatory action by Nasa has also met opposition" in the United States, she added."We think that these academic meetings should not be politicised."</body>

      <body>The US Army is working to develop "revolutionary" smart armour that would give its troops "superhuman strength".It is calling on the technology industry, government labs and academia to help build the Iron Man-style suit.Other exoskeletons that allow soldiers to carry large loads much further have already been tested by the army.The Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (Talos) would have such a frame but would also have layers of smart materials fitted with sensors.The suit would also need to have wide-area networking and a wearable computer similar to Google Glass, the US Army said.It should be made of smart material fitted with sensors to monitor body temperature, heart rate and hydration levels.The exoskeleton, which could be attached to arms and legs, would be likely to use hydraulics to greatly increase strength."The requirement is a comprehensive family of systems in a combat armour suit where we bring together an exoskeleton with innovative armour, displays for power monitoring, health monitoring, and integrating a weapon into that," said Lt Col Karl Borjes, a science adviser at the US Army's research, development and engineering command."It's advanced armour. It's communications, antennas. It's cognitive performance. It's sensors, miniature-type circuits. That's all going to fit in here, too," he added.According to US Army Sgt Maj Chris Faris, "no one industry can build it".Instead the army is calling on research and development organisations, private industry as well as government labs and academia to support the project.The US Army said it was likely that scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology would be involved in the design.An MIT team is currently developing liquid body armour - made from fluids that transform into a solid when a magnetic field or electrical current is applied.In an interview with US news site NPR, MIT professor Gareth McKinley compared the futuristic armour to that seen in Hollywood films."It sounds exactly like Iron Man," he said."The other kind of things that you see in the movies... would be the kind of external suit that Sigourney Weaver wears in Aliens, where it's a large robot that amplifies the motions and lifting capability of a human."The aim is the get the Talos armour out in the field within three years.</body>

      <description>Birds, such as great and blue tits, locate food in the morning but return to feed in the afternoon to evade predators, scientists say.</description>

      <body>Birds, such as great and blue tits, search for food in the morning but only return to eat it in late afternoon, scientists have found.The team believe the behaviour maximises their chances of avoiding predators during the day without starving to death overnight.Researchers from the University of Oxford tracked the birds' winter foraging movements using tiny tags.All five of the studied species of songbirds behaved in the same way.The results are published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters."Our results are important because they provide a new hypothesis for how animals forage," said Damien Farine, lead author from the University of Oxford."They suggest that animals integrate the different risks they face into one strategy that can be applied to satisfy both their need to avoid predation and avoid risk."Scientists have been studying bird populations at Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, UK since 1947.Finding food becomes more and more relevant towards the end of the winter when large sources of food, such as beech mast, have become depleted.The team knew from previous studies that, when the predation risk appears high, birds delay putting on fat until late in the day."In the 1970s, when there were almost no sparrowhawks, tits used to be much fatter [in winter], which helped them avoid the risk of starvation."When sparrowhawks returned [in greater numbers], the average body weight of great tits, for example, decreased," Mr Farine told BBC Nature.According to Mr Farine these birds had shifted from a strategy of being fat, to a strategy where they delayed putting on fat until late in the day."However, no one had previously thought to test how birds manage the need to find food so that they can ensure that there will be enough food left at the end of the day in order to put on the necessary amount of fat and survive the long winter nights," he said.Instead of simply idly waiting until the afternoon, birds were actively seeking out new sources of food to work out where their next meal was coming from.Mr Farine said: "They can vary their strategy within the day in order to satisfy multiple needs, in this case avoiding predation but also finding ephemeral food."Mr Farine said he was hoping to test a number of questions that arose from these results.Previous studies have shown that along the social ties, information about food sources are transmitted between individual birds within a population."We would like to test if individuals vary in their use of this social information over the course of a day. For example, if they have not gained good quality information in the morning, do they ignore it and search for their own food?" Mr Farine told BBC Nature."We would then like conduct further research on the afternoon and evening strategies in order to test whether the birds actually do remember what the best site was that they visited by placing different quality foods out for them to discover."Join BBC Nature on Facebook and Twitter @BBCNature.</body>

      <title>European link to Jewish ancestry</title>
      <description>A new genetics study challenges some previous theories on the maternal ancestry of Ashkenazi Jews.</description>

      <date>1381311947</date>
      <body>A new genetics study has challenged previous theories about the maternal ancestry of Ashkenazi Jews.The study suggests that most female ancestors came from southern and western Europe, not the Middle East as some authors assume.The new work in Nature Communications indicates that Jewish groups could have absorbed European converts about 2,000 years ago.However, others working in the field are not convinced by the findings."The origins of the [Ashkenazi Jews] is one of the big questions that people have pursued again and again and never really come to a conclusive view on," said Martin Richards from the University of Huddersfield, UK, one of the authors on the new paper.The team studied mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the genetic information in the cell's "batteries", which is passed on only via women. It can be used to probe a population's maternal history.The researchers used mtDNA lineages from Europe, the Caucasus and the Middle East. Their conclusions were that Ashkenazi maternal lines were most closely related to those from southern and western Europe."This suggests that, even though Jewish men may indeed have migrated into Europe from [the Levant] around 2,000 years ago, they seem to have married European women," explained Prof Richards.He added that women could have been among early European converts to Judaism."The great majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not brought from the Levant, as commonly supposed, nor recruited in the Caucasus, as sometimes suggested, but assimilated within Europe."It's a very exciting time for the prehistory of Europe. There will be work coming out in the next few years that will really give us a good picture of what happened over the last 30,000-40,000 years."Ashkenazi Jews are thought to have migrated from the Levant to Italy in the first or second centuries, and then moved to western and then eastern Europe, where populations expanded in number during the 13th Century.This new study makes the suggestion that more than 80% of Ashkenazi Jews can trace their ultimate maternal ancestry to prehistoric Europe. But studies looking at the Y chromosome (which is passed down from father to son only) have shown that the male line of descent does trace back to the Middle East.Harry Ostrer at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University in New York, US, told BBC News the latest study was an "interesting paper".He added: "It's not terribly surprising that there are mitochondrial genomes that coalesce to a long time ago in Europe because that is representative of the first founding event of Ashkenazi Jewry in Europe."The genetic, historical and the archaeological records are pretty clear. What we see in the genomes of contemporary Ashkenazi Jews is that they are the descendants of people who have gone through a 'bottleneck' of moving from western to eastern Europe."As for the debate over geographic origins, Prof Ostrer said there was a belief that most of Jewish history happened in the Levant region but, in his view, "it didn't necessarily; it was happening all over the western world".However, Karl Skorecki, at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, said that in his view the new work contained serious flaws at the level of phylogenetic analysis - the study of where a lineage sits on a family tree."While Costa et al have re-opened the question of the maternal origins of Ashkenazi Jewry, the phylogenetic analysis in the manuscript does not 'settle' the question," he told BBC News.Doron Behar, a geneticist at Gene by Gene in Houston, US, was also unconvinced by the findings, but said he would prefer "to first address this issue in a scientific journal".Another point to note, according to David Goldstein at Duke University in North Carolina, US, was that "the genetic composition of populations changes from generation to generation".He said that the paper "could be right but we have no way of really knowing" because of these changes - what researchers call "genetic drift"."It really is the fundamental framework for analysing the data that is at issue here. A framework that ignores real population genetics just doesn't work," Prof Goldstein added.</body>

      <title>Plane noise 'link' to heart disease</title>
      <description>The risks of stroke, heart and circulatory disease are higher in areas which have a lot of aircraft noise, researchers have found.</description>

      <body>The risks of stroke, heart and circulatory disease are higher in areas with a lot of aircraft noise, researchers say.Their study of 3.6 million residents near Heathrow Airport suggested the risks were 10-20% higher in areas with the highest levels of aircraft noise.The team's findings are published in the British Medical Journal.They agreed with other experts that noise was not necessarily to blame and more work was needed.Their work suggests a higher risk for both hospital admissions and deaths from stroke, heart and circulatory disease for the 2% of the study - about 70,000 people - who lived where the aircraft noise was loudest.The lead author, Dr Anna Hansell, from Imperial College London, said: "The exact role that noise exposure may play in ill health is not well established."However, it is plausible that it might be contributing - for example, by raising blood pressure or by disturbing people's sleep.""There's a 'startle reaction' to loud noise - if you're suddenly exposed to it, the heart rate and blood pressure increase."And aircraft noise can be annoying for some people, which can also affect their blood pressure, leading to illness."The relative importance of daytime and night-time noise from aircraft also needs to be investigated further."The study used data about noise levels in 2001 from the Civil Aviation Authority, covering 12 London boroughs and nine districts outside of London where aircraft noise exceeds 50 decibels - about the volume of a normal conversation in a quiet room.The authors say fewer people are now affected by the highest levels of noise (above 63 decibels) - despite more planes being in the skies - because of changes in aircraft design and flight plans.The researchers - from Imperial and also King's College London - adjusted their work in an effort to eliminate other factors that might have a relationship with stroke and heart disease, such as deprivation, South Asian ethnicity and smoking-related illness.They stressed that the higher risk of illness related to aircraft noise remained much less significant than the risks from lifestyle factors - including smoking, a lack of exercise or poor diet.In an accompanying editorial, Prof Stephen Stansfeld, from Queen Mary University of London, said: "These results imply that the siting of airports and consequent exposure to aircraft noise may have direct effects on the health of the surrounding population."Planners need to take this into account when expanding airports in heavily populated areas or planning new airports."The study covered 12 London boroughs in the centre and west of the capital - and nine council districts beyond London, including Windsor and Maidenhead, Slough and Wokingham.Heathrow Airport's director of sustainability, Matt Gorman, said: "We are already taking significant steps to tackle the issue of noise."We are charging airlines more for noisier aircraft, offering insulation and double glazing to local residents and are working with noise campaigners to give people predictable periods of respite from noise."Together these measures have meant that the number of people affected by noise has fallen by 90% since the 1970s, despite the number of flights almost doubling."A government spokesman said: "The number of people affected by high levels of noise around Heathrow has been falling for years due to improvements in aviation technology, better planning of flight paths and other factors. We would expect to see this trend continue."A separate study, also published on Wednesday in the BMJ, demonstrates a higher rate of admission to hospital with cardiovascular problems for people living near 89 airports in the US.Prof Kevin McConway, from the Open University, said: "Both of these studies are thorough and well-conducted. But, even taken together, they don't prove that aircraft noise actually causes heart disease and strokes."A major difficulty in interpreting what these studies tell us is that they are based on data for geographical areas, not for individual people."Over the coming months, Public Health England will recruit experts to further examine the public health issues around exposure to noise.</body>

      <title>Toddler brain scan language insight</title>

      <body>The brain has a critical window for language development between the ages of two and four, brain scans suggest.Environmental influences have their biggest impact before the age of four, as the brain's wiring develops to process new words, say UK and US scientists.The research in The Journal of Neuroscience suggests disorders causing language delay should be tackled early.It also explains why young children are good at learning two languages.The scientists, based at King's College London, and Brown University, Rhode Island, studied 108 children with normal brain development between the ages of one and six.They used brain scans to look at myelin - the insulation that develops from birth within the circuitry of the brain.To their surprise, they found the distribution of myelin is fixed from the age of four, suggesting the brain is most plastic in very early life.Any environmental influences on brain development will be strongest in infanthood, they predict.This explains why immersing children in a bilingual environment before the age of four gives them the best chance of becoming fluent in both languages, the research suggests.It also suggests that there is a critical time during development when environmental influence on cognitive skills may be greatest.Dr Jonathan O'Muircheartaigh, from King's College London, led the study.He told the BBC: "Since our work seems to indicate that brain circuits associated with language are more flexible before the age of four, early intervention for children with delayed language attainment should be initiated before this critical age."This may be relevant to many developmental disorders, such as autism, since delayed language is a common early trait."Early childhood is a time when language skills develop very rapidly.Babies have a vocabulary of up to 50 words at 12 months but by the age of six this has expanded to about 5,000 words.Language skills are localised in the frontal areas of the left-hand side of the brain.The researchers therefore expected more myelin to develop in the left-hand side of the brain, as the children learned more language.In fact, they found it remained constant, but had a stronger influence on language ability before the age of four, suggesting there is a crucial window for interventions in developmental disorders."This work is important as it is the first to investigate the relationship between brain structure and language across early childhood and demonstrate how this relationship changes with age," said Dr Sean Deoni from Brown University, a co-researcher on the study."This is important since language is commonly altered or delayed in many developmental disorders, such as autism."Commenting on the study, Prof Dorothy Bishop of the department of Developmental Neuropsychology at the University of Oxford said the research added important new information about early development of connections in brain regions important for cognitive functions."There is suggestive evidence of links with language development but it is too early to be confident about functional implications of the findings," she said."Ideally we would need a longitudinal study following children over time to track how structural brain changes relate to language function."The study was funded by the National Institutes for Mental Health (US) and the Wellcome Trust (UK).</body>

      <date>1381226019</date>
      <body>"Ancient humans" used toothpicks nearly 1.8 million years ago, a study of their teeth has revealed.A team studied hominid jaws from the Dmanisi Republic of Georgia - the earliest evidence of primitive humans outside Africa.They also found evidence of gum disease caused by repeated use of what must have been a basic toothpick.Writing in PNAS, the team says its findings help to explain the diversity found in hominid teeth.The researchers used a new forensic approach to look at variations on the teeth of hominids thought by some to be early European ancestors.Teeth can shed light on what the individuals ate and how old they may have been, but until now it was not clear why there was so much diversity in the Georgian hominid mandibles, or jaws.Ani Margvelashvili, lead author of the study at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, said that scientists dealing with fossil hominid mandibles should pay close attention to tooth wear and the fossil individual's age."Progressive tooth wear triggers bone remodelling processes that substantially modify the shape of the jaw during an individual's lifetime. These effects are typically underestimated when attributing fossil hominid jaws to different species," she told BBC News."The individual who was using a toothpick was young, as his or her teeth were not worn down. We also discovered a damaged area between the tooth area and the gum. There was a small cylinder-shaped lesion - in this area, if you place a toothpick it goes through."The researchers analysed four mandibles from one of the biggest collections of well-preserved early human remnants known anywhere in the world.The Dmanisi site has been valued as an important place to look at how hominids migrated from Africa."It's not very often you have one site with four mandibles. It has allowed us to see special features that have not been seen before," explained David Lordkipanidze of the Georgian National Museum.This included horizontal scratches on a lesion, visible on the root surface of one of the teeth."Scientists often describe groups with new characters as different species. Here we show in one group you can see many characteristics. It shows once more how complicated the story of human evolution is," Prof Lordkipanidze, co-author of the work, told BBC News.It is still unclear what species the Dmanisi hominids were. Experts once believed it was Homo erectus who first ventured out of Africa.But the Dmanisi hominids were not typical of the tall-standing and big-brained H. erectus. Instead, the Dmanisi individuals were short, long-armed, small-brained and thin browed. The fossils are therefore now sometimes referred to as Homo georgicus.Louise Humphrey from the Natural History Museum, London, said there had been a longstanding interest in the causes and implications of the high degree of variation in their mandibles and crania."This paper demonstrates that remodelling of the mandible associated with heavy tooth wear and continuous tooth eruption could contribute to that variation."Peter Ungar from the University of Arkansas, US, said the study could provide a new way of looking at fossils."Tooth pick markings are not uncommon in fossil hominids from this time period, but this clinical, forensic approach is new and potentially useful."Analyses of tooth movements due to wear have been more-or-less limited to anatomically modern humans, and this paper introduces the approach to paleoanthropology," Prof Ungar added.</body>

      <title>Planck telescope set for switch-off</title>
      <description>The European Space Agency is about to dispose of its Planck Surveyor, the telescope which mapped the "oldest light" in the Universe in unprecedented detail.</description>

      <date>1381226105</date>
      <body>The process of disposing of the Planck space telescope has begun.The satellite, which mapped the "oldest light" in the Universe in unprecedented detail, has completed its mission and will be turned off in two weeks' time.It is currently some 1.6 million km from Earth, where it is undergoing some final engineering tests.European Space Agency controllers will initiate a big burn on Planck's thrusters on Wednesday, pushing it away from the planet into a separate orbit.A second burn on 21 October will run the satellite's propellant supply to exhaustion."We drain everything so there's no possibility of having an exploding tank in the future," explained Steve Foley, Esa's spacecraft operations manager for Planck."We'll disconnect the batteries and switch off the transmitters, patching the software so they can never be re-activated. Final contact is scheduled for 23 October, and that will be it - Planck will just drift off," he told BBC News.The 600m-euro (£515m) telescope will end its days making a slow turn around the Sun. It will not come anywhere near the Earth again for another 13-14 years; and even then, the closest it will get will be about 10 million km.Planck has returned an extraordinary treasure trove of information, picking out thousands of objects in the sky not previously recognised. It has even mapped the sum of all the matter in space.But its main quest was to survey the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) - the "first light" to sweep out across space once a post-Big-Bang Universe had cooled sufficiently to permit the formation of hydrogen atoms.Before that time, scientists say, the cosmos would have been so hot that matter and radiation would have been "coupled" - the Universe would have been opaque.Today, the CMB pervades the entire sky, and scientists can measure tiny temperature variations in it to glean information about the shape, age and contents of the cosmos.Planck scanned the full microwave background five times before its High Frequency Instrument ran out of helium coolant in January 2012.The Low Frequency Instrument has continued operations, surveying the complete sky a further three times. This additional data will be used to help clean the telescope's final CMB map of any obscuring light sources, principally from our own galaxy.Scientists presented their first take on Planck's view of the cosmos in March, but promise an update in summer 2014.Of key interest will be whether the telescope has detected a particular type of polarisation in the ancient light known as the B-Mode.Theory holds that the Universe experienced a faster-than-light expansion in the first moments of its existence, and that this superluminal event is imprinted on the polarisation of the CMB.If Planck can resolve this very subtle "twist" in the directional quality of the light, it would open up a completely new way to probe the physics of the Big Bang.Commentators say such a discovery would likely also draw the attention of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which annually selects the Nobel Prizes.Prof Mark McCaughrean, Esa's senior scientific advisor, told BBC News: "Planck has done a fantastic job and has lasted considerably longer than expected. Any sadness about it being turned off is completely outweighed by the scientific results it has already delivered, namely the most precise assessment of the composition, structure, and early evolution of the Universe ever made."And the best may be yet to come; the amazing possibility of probing the Universe less than a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a second after it began."Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos</body>

      <title>'Digital baby' screen for sperm donors</title>
      <description>A service that digitally weaves together the DNA of prospective parents to check for potential disease in thousands of "virtual babies" is set to launch in the US by December.</description>

      <date>1380885044</date>
      <body>A service that digitally weaves together the DNA of prospective parents to check for potential disease in thousands of "virtual babies" is set to launch in the US by December.New York start-up Genepeeks will initially focus on donor sperm, simulating before pregnancy how the genetic sequence of a female client might combine with those of different males.Donors that more often produce "digital children" with a higher risk of inherited disorders will be filtered out, leaving those who are better genetic matches.Everything happens in a computer, but experts have raised ethical questions."We are just in the business right now of giving prospective mothers, who are using donor sperm to conceive, a filtered catalogue of donors based on their own underlying genetic profile," Genepeeks co-founder Anne Morriss told BBC News."We are filtering out the donor matches with an elevated risk of rare recessive paediatric conditions."Ms Morriss, an entrepreneur, gave a presentation on the company at the Consumer Genetics Conference in Boston last week.She was motivated in part by her own experience of starting a family. Her son was conceived with a sperm donor who happened to share with Morriss the gene for an inherited disorder called MCADD.MCADD (medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency) prevents those affected from converting fats to sugar. It can be fatal if it is not diagnosed early. Luckily, in Ms Morriss's case, the condition was picked up in newborn screening tests."My son has a pretty normal life," Ms Morriss said, "but about 30% of children with rare genetic diseases don't make it past the age of five."Genepeeks has formalised a partnership with a sperm bank - the Manhattan Cryobank - and has a patent pending on the DNA screening technology.The start-up benefits from the rapid pace of change in genetic technology.Indeed, six months ago, Genepeeks' founders decided it was able to use a superior system for DNA analysis (called "targeted exon sequencing") than the one originally envisaged - a result, says Anne Morriss, of falling costs and increased flexibility.For couples planning babies, other companies already screen one or both partners for genes that could cause disease if combined with a similar variant - so-called "carrier screening".One academic who studies the use of genetic technology commented: "This is like that, but ramped up 100,000 times."Ms Morriss's business partner, Prof Lee Silver, a geneticist and expert on bioethics at Princeton University, New Jersey, told BBC News: "We get the DNA sequence from two prospective parents. We simulate the process of reproduction, forming virtual sperm and virtual eggs. We put them together to form a hypothetical child genome."Then we can look at that hypothetical genome and - with all the tools of modern genetics - determine the risk that the genome will result in a child with disease. We're looking directly for disease and not carrier status. For each pair of people that we're going to analyse, we make 10,000 hypothetical children."The process will be run for the client and each potential donor one by one, scanning for some 600 known single-gene recessive conditions. In this way, the highest-risk pairings can be filtered out.Anne Morriss added: "At this stage our clients won't be receiving any genetic information back. We're very much focused on the practical utility of helping prospective parents who want to protect their future kids, giving them the option of additional analysis to what is currently being offered in the industry."But the company's founders have plans to expand the screening beyond single-gene recessive disorders to more complex conditions in which multiple genes play a part.Indeed, going to the trouble of simulating thousands of digital children deliberately lays the ground for this: "[It's] impossible to get towards an accurate risk calculation in any other way," said Anne Morriss.And in a video produced by the company, Prof Silver says: "My hope for the future is that any people who want to have a baby can use this technology to greatly reduce the risk of disease being expressed in their child."To some, such a prospect might appear like a step towards designer babies - until now the preserve of science fiction literature and films such as Gattaca, which envisaged a future of genetic "haves" and "have-nots".Bio-ethicists approached by the BBC said Genepeeks was a logical outcome of the increasing demand for more information when making reproductive decisions.However, some raised potential concerns about risk communication and the expansion of screening beyond rare single-gene disorders. But they suggested there were few, if any, regulatory barriers.One ethicist told BBC News: "The biggest question for me, just from the outset, is the understanding of uncertainty. Even people who have been doing genomics for years still have a hard time figuring out exactly what a risk for a particular genetic predisposition really means for a family."Gene-environment interactions can lead to people either having disease or not having disease."Dr Ewan Birney, associate director of the European Bioinformatics Institute in Hinxton, UK, echoed the point: "It's good that they're focusing on the carrier status of these rare Mendelian disorders where it's potentially more clear-cut. That said, these things are more complex than they first seem," he said."I'm sure the scientists appreciate that complexity. But when transmitting that complexity to everyday people, these things can sound more absolute than they really are."He added: "The thing I would want to stress here is just how complex this is. It's great that people are thinking of using this technology in lots of different ways, but our knowledge gap is very large."Risk communication to clients was, said Anne Morriss, "absolutely critical to anyone in this industry"."We have to be crystal clear about what we're testing for, what risks we're helping to reduce; that there's no guarantee you won't give birth to a sick child," she said.Prof Mildred Cho, associate director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics in California, raised questions over whether the sperm donor should also receive information about their genome gleaned from the screening process."Unlike hair colour, occupation or family history - those are things, presumably, the donor already knows - the thing that's different about this that I see is it could create information that the donor doesn't already have. It also has implications for the donor's other biological family members," Prof Cho told BBC News.This week it also emerged that California-based consumer genetics company 23andMe had submitted the patent on a DNA analysis tool for planning a child.Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter</body>

      <body>An official strategy is due to be unveiled later that aims to protect the UK's broadleaved tree species.The strategy has been developed by Forest Research, part of the Forestry Commission, and two charities, the Earth Trust and Future Trees Trust.It will be launched by environment minister Lord De Mauley at an event in Westminster.It encourages people to choose seeds and saplings carefully to ensure that the trees which they plant do well.Broadleaved trees are those which have wide leaves rather than the needle-like leaves of conifers. They include ash, beech, birch, elm, holly, hornbeam, lime, oak and poplar.The document's authors say broadleaved woodlands have declined over the past 200 years, resulting in 95% of hardwood timber now having to be imported.The 16-page vision, called A Future With Broadleaved Trees, says the trees have a "very special place in our national psyche" but are "much more than just beautiful things".Co-author Dr Steve Lee from Forest Research - the scientific arm of the Forestry Commission - explained: "If they are good quality and grow well, they will lock up carbon for a long period of time. Also, you can make good quality products from the timber, which will last for a very long time."The act of planting a tree, and the cost of that tree, is probably going to be the same regardless of where you get it from," he told BBC News."So you could plant a maladapted tree, wait a long time and it does not grow very well. Yet you could invest the same amount of money in another tree, which grows very well and remains more resilient to any changes that come along in terms of climate, pests and diseases."What we are really saying that the effort is the same, so look around before you plant and think hard about what it is and why it is you are planting those trees."The strategy, which looks ahead to 2025, is centred around three core objectives:Earth Trust chief executive Jayne Manley explained: "Our much loved broadleaved trees could provide significant benefits to people and the environment as well as the rural economy."We need to focus on these trees rather than take them for granted and part of this is identifying and planting 'improved' trees which are productive, healthy and adaptable."Dr Lee added: "What you are really after is something that will remain well adapted on that site and will remain resilient to any environmental impacts that may occur over the 80-year or so rotation period."The suggestion is that the local material, which you might have planted in the past without really thinking about it, might not be the most resilient in the future."</body>

      <title>'No bailout' for the Earth's climate</title>
      <description>Governments forced to rescue the world's banking system are being warned by the OECD that there will be no bailout if there is a climate crisis.</description>

      <body>Governments forced to rescue the world's banking system are being warned there will be no bailout if there is a crisis in the Earth's climate system.That is the view of the head of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).Angel Gurria is expected to rebuke nations failing to curb CO2 emissions in a speech on Wednesday.He will say the analysis of the climate threat is far clearer than were the warning signs for the financial crisis.Mr Gurria is due to address the topic of climate change, investment and energy policies in a London lecture co-organised with the London School of Economics and the Climate Markets and Investors Association (CMIA)The talk coincides with a report in The Independent newspaper that claims UK Chancellor George Osborne is about to reject the recommendations of government advisers by slowing the drive to tackle global warming.In his speech, Mr Gurria will ask if leaders overseeing the financial system that led to the "train wreck" of the banking crisis would have been happy to take the risks if they had known the consequences.“Unlike the financial crisis, we do not have a 'climate bailout option' up our sleeves,” he will say.“And despite all the attention given to climate change deniers, our understanding of the scale of the risk is much better developed than our understanding of the financial risks, pre-crisis.”An OECD source said the secretary-general's remarks were directed both at countries which had dragged their feet on reducing emissions and those which had taken a leadership position but were now starting to wobble.Asked if the latter group included the UK, where the chancellor argued last week that Britain "should not be in front of the rest of the world” in tackling climate change, the source said the OECD was fully aware of the situation in Britain and all its member states.Mr Gurria will also warn that renewable technologies will be harmed by stop-start policies. Renewables firms in the UK have benefited from a stable policy framework in the medium term, but are uncertain about long-term investments as right-wing Conservatives attempt to abandon CO2 targets for 2030, arguing that they damage competitiveness.He also takes a swipe at fossil fuel subsidies, currently estimated at over $500bn a year globally. These typically provide cheap motoring for the rich, he says, and fail to help the poor.The world, he says, needs to become zero-carbon in the second half of the century, and needs to start on that pathway immediately if climate change is to be stabilised.Mr Gurria, like the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon last week, is trying to galvanise action for an ambitious agreement in the planned 2015 UN climate conference in Paris.Rich nation governments struggling against recession have been going slow on climate change policies, and developing nations have argued that they need space to expand emissions to grow their economies and draw people out of poverty.Mr Gurria will argue that creating an infrastructure that leaves people dependent on fossil fuels will prove more costly overall in terms of the economy and public welfare.Interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, he said: "Countries like Britain have been leading the charge (on climate change) and have to continue to do that. It's because of leadership of UK that EU has seen that this is the way to go - and the rest of the world too."He said energy policy has become extra challenging following technology improvements on exploiting fossil fuels. "We grew up with scarcity of oil and fuel, now we are entering a world of abundance so we're really going to have to think very hard on this."The OECD is to publish a paper on the most effective ways of managing carbon cuts in the economy.Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin</body>

      <title>Too much sex kills male marsupials</title>
      <description>Some species of marsupials are dying from sex after engaging in strenuous mating activities.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24443104</url>
      <date>1381237115</date>
      <body>A new study suggests that some species of marsupials mate with such vigour and intensity that it quite literally kills them.The scientists say that males die in large numbers after mating with as many partners as possible in sex sessions lasting up to 14 hours at a time.A key factor in this costly coitus is the promiscuous behaviour of females who all breed at the same time of year.The study is published in the journal PNAS.Suicidal reproduction or semelparity is well known in many species of plants and fish but is rare in mammals.This new study looks at the mating behaviour of 52 different species of small, insect eating marsupials in Australia, South America and Papua New Guinea.They found that in some of these animals, such as the antechinus, the phascogale and the dasykaluta, male attempts to father offspring cost them their lives.This "dying-off" trait is more likely to be found in species living in regions where food was plentiful in one period of the year.This makes the females of the species more likely to shorten their mating seasons so they only give birth when there is plenty to eat.In these marsupials, the females have also synchronised their reproductive cycles.They are also highly promiscuous, as this promotes sperm competition among the males, explained Dr Diana Fisher from the University of Queensland, the lead author of the study."The females that mate with more males, get to weed out the poor quality males because of this sperm competition," she said."The ones that succeeded in fertilisation were the ones with better offspring survival."While this ensures sturdy descendents, the process is fatal for the fathers.The males attempt to mate with as many females as possible in long, laborious bouts, driven by high levels of hormones including testosterone.These chemicals in turn elevate their levels of stress hormones and their systems are unable to cope, says Dr Fisher."If we humans get huge stress, we have a feedback system and we bring it down."But the marsupials just keep ramping it up more and more and are driven to spend all their time mating competitively.She added: "And its the stress hormone that does that."Dr Fisher says that this is sexual selection driven by females. It is a different strategy to other mammals where the males sometimes fight for the right to mate or are selected by the females on the basis of looks or strength."In this case, it is having the one that's best at sperm competition," she said.The research team says that the strategy of losing half the species in the act of reproduction can work well as an evolutionary strategy if the population is dense."Every other animal has a cost of reproduction," said Dr Fisher."It's just they've got it all at once."Follow Matt on Twitter.</body>

      <title>Plastic pollution 'threatens lakes'</title>
      <description>Researchers say that the problem of plastic pollution is posing a growing threat to lakes as well as oceans.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24434378</url>
      <date>1381183230</date>
      <body>Pollution with plastic waste is not confined to the oceans but poses a growing threat to lakes as well.That is the view of researchers who found significant concentrations of the substance in Italy's Lake Garda.They say the levels are similar to those found in samples taken from marine beach sediments.They are concerned that these tiny plastic particles are accumulating in freshwater species and are "likely" to get into the food chain.The research is published in the journal, Current Biology.The problem of large amounts of plastic polluting the world's oceans has been well documented in recent years.As well as bigger pieces that can choke sea creatures when ingested, there is an equally serious issue with very small fragments called micro-plastics.But research on the problems caused by plastic in lakes has been lacking.This new study looked at Lake Garda, a large, sub-alpine body of water. The researchers found significant concentrations of plastic in sediment samples. On the north shore they found around 1,000 larger particles per square metre and 450 micro-plastic particles in the same area."We were surprised," lead author Prof Christian Laforsch from the University of Bayreuth told BBC News."We have similar amounts of plastic particles in the sediment of the lake's ecosystem as we find in marine ecosystems."Chemicals found in plastics can be poisonous, can damage endocrine systems or in some cases cause cancers.They can also transport dangerous organic pollutants into clean environments like lakes.Previous research on fish and other marine creatures has shown that these species tend to accumulate tiny plastic fragments into their tissue. Prof Laforsch worries that this is happening in Lake Garda and elsewhere."What we show is that filter feeders and sediment feeders and organisms that feed on the surface layer of the lake, all swallow these plastic particles mistaking them for food."There might be impacts when it affects the hormone system, they could become sterile for example. It could also be, that when fish are feeding on these organisms they accumulate these particles also in their tissue."The problem is being caused by human use of plastic materials say the researchers.Apart from water sports, and tourist and fishing boats, the main sources of waste entering Lake Garda were discarded plastic products and debris which may originate from landfill sites.The scientists are also concerned that the discovery of significant amounts of plastic in lake environments could have implications for human populations as the waters are often used for drinking and for agriculture.And they argue that, as in the seas, plastic pollution is likely to be widespread in freshwater bodies."There is nothing particular about Lake Garda," said Prof Laforsch."We are testing in Bavaria and it looks pretty much the same. It is, I think, a problem all over Europe and maybe all over the world."Follow Matt on Twitter.</body>

      <title>EU hails global green tax on flights</title>
      <description>The EU and its critics both claim victory in the battle over green taxes on flights to and from Europe, after a deal was struck.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24429721</url>
      <date>1381151032</date>
      <body>The EU and its critics are both claiming victory in the battle over green taxes on flights to and from Europe, after a deal was struck.The world's governments agreed that all airlines should join a global scheme to cut carbon emissions. But details will not be negotiated until 2016.There is still pressure on the EU to delay imposing its Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) on aviation.The EU said its leadership had led to the deal, but greens disputed that.Environmentalists accused the EU of caving in to pressure.The new deal was reached on Friday after long negotiations in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).It ends for the first time the notion of exceptionalism that has been cultivated by the industry.The aviation sector will attempt to negotiate by 2016 a market-based mechanism (taxes, tradeable permits or carbon offsets) to tackle emissions from flying.Technical innovations will play a part too. The deal will be in place by 2020, when the new UN climate deal - not yet negotiated - is due to start.An EU spokesman told BBC News: “It’s a very positive outcome. After more than 15 years of talks we got a deal. The reality is, if it hadn’t been for EU pressure [through extending the ETS to aviation] this probably wouldn’t have happened.”Paul Steele, executive director of the industry-wide Air Transport Action Group, said it was "clearly an historic resolution"."It represents significant progress. We now have agreement on a global scheme and a timeline and the building blocks to deliver it.”But there was fierce resistance from some nations in the ICAO to curbing aviation emissions, especially from emerging economies with big territories like Brazil, China and India. And developing countries, particularly in Africa, have secured what appears to be a complete get-out clause.Bill Hemmings from the green group Transport and Environment said: “The EU ETS, the only international measure that actually reduces emissions from international aviation, has been hamstrung by ICAO delegates more interested in evading responsibility than protecting the environment. The text is full of holes… exactly what it was supposed to avoid.”Samantha Smith from the environmental group WWF said “the science is clearer than ever - 2020 is too late".Last month the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said there was convincing evidence that human activity was causing global warming."Right after the recent IPCC release, this was the first chance for governments in ICAO to take decisive action, and they failed,” Ms Smith said.It is not clear what happens now to the ETS aviation scheme. Plans to extend it to aircraft were previously put on hold, as the EU compromised to avoid a trade war.The ICAO meeting voted to prohibit any nation imposing its own scheme without a global agreement. But the EU is not convinced that this vote is binding and a spokesman told me there would be discussions in coming weeks over the way ahead.This agonised process for just one sector indicates just how hard it will be to get a global deal on greenhouse gas emissions that the UN expects in 2020.Follow Roger on Twitter</body>

      <title>Pollution 'hampers bees' foraging'</title>
      <description>Honeybees' ability to find flowers could be hampered by a chemical in diesel exhaust, say scientists.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/24364637</url>
      <date>1380805275</date>
      <body>Honeybees' ability to find flowers could be hampered by a chemical in diesel exhaust, say scientists.Tests showed that exhaust degraded some floral scent chemicals the bees "home in on" when they are foraging.The study, published in Scientific Reports, also revealed that a specific group of chemicals found in diesel exhaust, known as NOx, diminished the insects' response to floral scents.They say the results are evidence that air quality should be improved."We got into this, because we were aware of the impacts of airborne pollutants on human health, so it didn't seem so wild that there may be impacts that extended beyond human health," said University of Southampton neuroscientist Dr Tracey Newman, who was involved in the work.To drill down to the chemical effects of pollution on the pollinators, the researchers made a mixture of the volatile, or smelly, chemicals that make up the scent of oilseed rape.They then used a diesel-powered generator to create a mixture of air and exhaust that closely matched levels of exhaust found on a busy road, and mixed this lab-made air pollution with the floral scent mix."We saw that there was loss of two of the components [of the floral odour mixture]," Dr Newman said.The two odour chemicals that were "lost" had chemically reacted with a component of the diesel exhaust, mono-nitrogen oxide, known as NOx.Having worked out how the pollution affected the chemistry of floral scents, the team set out to discover if the bees were affected by this change."Bees need to decipher the chemical messages they're getting [from flowers] to be able to home in on the flowers they know will give the best yield [of nectar]," said Dr Newman.The pollinators, she said, learned to recognise the scents of nectar-rich flowers and this enabled them to forage more efficiently.The team carried out a test that involved teaching bees to associate the smell of a particular chemical with being given a drop of sugary liquid.Bees respond to the taste of the sugar by sticking out their tongues - just as they do when drinking nectar from a flower. So after a few trials where the scent of the odour is followed closely by a sweet drop of liquid, the bees stick out their tongues as soon as they detect the scent."Having trained a bunch of bees, we then tested to see if they would respond in the same way to the mixture that was depleted by exposure to NOx [the reactive chemical in diesel exhaust]," said Dr Newman.When these odour chemicals were degraded by NOx, the bees were much less responsive to their smell and would not stick out their tongues.Biologist and lead researcher Dr Guy Poppy added that the airborne pollution appeared to be interfering with "the complex relationship" that had evolved between plants and animals."Flowers have evolved to produce chemical mixtures that attract pollinators," he told BBC News.Dr Newman added that the study highlighted the need to reduce pollution and improve air quality, in order to protect pollinating insects as well as improve human health.The value to food production of so-called "pollination services" is estimated to be hundreds of millions of pounds per year in the UK alone.Prof James Nieh, who studies honeybee health and behaviour at the University of California San Diego, said that the research posed a "largely unexplored question"."Most research on such contaminants has focused on pesticides," he told BBC News."But bees are subject to a much wider variety of pollutants and contaminants. The influence and potential synergy of these pollutants with pesticides should be studied."</body>

      <body>A platypus that got stuck in a car engine in Australia has been safely released back into the wild, Australian conservation officials say.The female platypus wedged itself inside the engine bay of a car driving through a flooded river crossing south of Canberra late on Wednesday.It was driven more than 15km (9 miles) before the driver realised an animal was in the car.Officials described the incident as a "one-in-a-million" event.The driver, Cameron Blaseotto, said he heard scratching from under his car bonnet when he parked his car.He and his friend "originally thought a possum or something was going to jump out at both of us", he told Australian broadcaster ABC."We had a bit of an argument about who was going to open the engine bay," he added.They were surprised to discover a platypus stuck in the engine bay, and called the territory's Parks and Conservation Service."Our urban wildlife rangers get calls ranging from snakes in houses to quolls (a carnivorous marsupial) in trees, but this was definitely one of our most unusual calls," Regional Operations Manager Brett McNamara said."There's obviously many moving parts within an engine bay and given platypus have claws there is not much to hang onto," he said."How this animal was able to climb up inside, hang on, and then drive all the way back into Canberra is a truly remarkable story."Mr McNamara added that the platypus, who was in perfect health, was returned to her home and released on Thursday morning.Platypuses - egg-laying mammals with a duck-like bill - are native to Australia.</body>

      <body>A rare egg of an endangered bird from India has been discovered at the University of Aberdeen, and it is hoped it could help save the species.The breeding habits of the Jerdon's Courser are mysterious.DNA analysis was used to identify the egg as belonging to the bird, after it was unearthed within an old collection at the institution's zoology museum.It is now hoped the discovery could help conservationists working to save the species in India.Dr Alan Knox, the university's emeritus head of museums who found the egg among a collection dating back to the 1900s, said: "I was looking through drawers of uncatalogued eggs when I spotted an egg labelled as belonging to this species."It was one of those eureka moments - finding something nobody else knows about, something so rare and exciting. I could hardly believe my eyes."My first question was how do you identify something that the books say has never been discovered?"He continued: "Very little is actually known about this extremely rare bird which inhabits an area only a few kilometres wide."It was seen only a few times in southern India before it was presumed extinct around 1900. It was rediscovered in 1986 but is listed as a critically endangered species."Without any others to compare it with, the process of correctly identifying the egg was a challenge."Dr Knox took the egg to the Natural History Museum in Tring, Hertfordshire, and the identification was confirmed after DNA was extracted from dried-up membrane scraped from the inside of the egg.He added: "We are hoping the discovery will help conservationists working to save the species in India."</body>

      <title>Is altruism self-interest in disguise?</title>
      <description>Does it matter why we help others?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24457645</url>
      <date>1381360309</date>
      <body>Is altruism simply self-interest in disguise? And can a mathematical equation hope to answer the question?In 1968, an academic almost unknown in the UK walked into University College London and presented its staff with an equation so remarkable, that they offered him an honorary position and the keys to his own office.His name was George Price, and his equation addressed a problem that has vexed scientists since Charles Darwin published On The Origin of Species more than a century earlier. If we are selfish creatures, engaged in a battle for survival, why do we display altruism? Why do we show kindness to others even at a cost to ourselves?Price's equation explained how altruism could thrive, even amongst groups of selfish people.It built on the work of a number of other scientists, arguably beginning with JBS Haldane, a British biologist who developed a theory in the early 1950s. When asked if he would sacrifice his own life to save that of another, he said that he would, but only under certain conditions. "I would lay down my life for two brothers, or eight cousins."Haldane's reasoning was a simplistic explanation of a theory that has come to dominate evolutionary biology - that of "kin selection".Since he would share 50% of each brother's genetic makeup, and 12.5% of each cousin's, his genes would survive even if he were to die.It took until the early 1960s for another scientist, William Donald Hamilton, to popularise the theory. He wrote a simple equation to explain that an organism would demonstrate self-sacrificing behaviour if it would enhance the reproductive chances of those it was closely related to.In 1967 Price arrived in London from the United States, where he had been a scientist and journalist, but with no background in the field of evolutionary biology.He discovered Hamilton's theory in a public library and thought he could improve upon it. Working in seclusion, he rewrote the equation in a simpler but more wide-reaching way. It explained the relationship between different generations of a population, and could be used to show how the prevalence of particular traits would change over time.Although it was a fairly simple statement, it had never been expressed in clear mathematical terms, and the staff at the University College London recognised his insight as wildly original.A debate about the scientific roots of altruism still rages to this day, but kin selection remains a hugely influential theory, and Price's contribution is held in high regard by many."It underpins a lot of modern evolutionary biology research," says Andy Gardner, an evolutionary biologist at Oxford University, who uses the Price Equation in much of his work.Oren Harman, who wrote Price's biography in 2010, says the view is shared by plenty of people in the field."Although there are those who fail to see the precise use of the equation, others think of it as the most simple and brilliant description of the dynamics of natural selection."But Price began to find the implications of his work very difficult to deal with, according to Harman. If altruism was simply an attempt to ensure the survival of one's own genes, could it be considered altruism at all?Lee Dugatkin, professor of Biology at the University of Louisville, thinks it was this thought that triggered a major change in Price. "That was what got him going," he says. "He was so depressed when he found out that Hamilton was right."In the summer of 1970, Price became a devout Christian and embarked on a radical project - giving himself over to the service of others."He was going to go out to try and show that human beings are the only species that can beat out their own nature. And he was going to do that by becoming a pure selfless altruist," says Harman.Price began giving money to homeless people, and invited many of them to live with him in his flat near Oxford Circus. His increasingly erratic behaviour left him penniless. He left his flat and eventually moved into a squat in Kentish Town.It is not universally agreed that Price's equation triggered his downfall - he was undoubtedly suffering from some form of mental illness as well. And in the winter of 1975, Price took his own life.For Harman, the two are inextricably linked. "I think the fact that George killed himself due to his interpretation of the equation really focuses the problem to the utmost degree."Price's story is laced with tragedy, but need his scientific work imply a dark, depressing view of human nature?Samir Okasha, professor of the philosophy of science at Bristol University, thinks not. "The idea that what evolutionary theory shows is that altruism is self-interest in disguise is, to my mind, a questionable thing to say."Behaviour in some animal species is indeed genetically determined, he says, but with humans "that certainly isn't the case". He argues that culture sets us apart from animals in that respect, and points to the huge variance in social norms in different countries, and over short periods of time."We have seen rather dramatic change over, say, a 300-year period, which cannot be explained by genetics," he says.Harman also disagrees with Price's interpretation of his own work. "It is not a necessary logical conclusion. It was his own conclusion, the conclusion of a troubled mind, but it's what led him to a terrible realisation that there is no true kindness in the world."If we want to understand behaviour, biology is part of it - it has to be by definition. But that's never an entire and complete explanation for the complexity and grandeur of the human condition."Gardner thinks it is always possible to think of people as attempting to protect and reproduce their own genetic material. "But that's not necessarily always selfish," he says. "There's room for altruism in that logic."Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>NSA chief pledges more transparency</title>
      <description>US electronic spy agency chief speaks to the BBC</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24470450</url>
      <date>1381407161</date>
      <body>The US electronic spy agency is committed to being more transparent, a senior official has told the BBC.In a rare interview on a recent visit to London, National Security Agency (NSA) Deputy Director Chris Inglis spoke to the BBC about cyber-security.His comments came in the wake of revelations about the agency's work from former contractor Edward Snowden.Mr Snowden's leaks sparked a debate about secrecy and the scale of the agency's powers.In the interview, Mr Inglis said there was a need to consider the balance between secrecy and transparency in order to have the public's confidence.With the world becoming more reliant on the internet, Mr Inglis outlined concerns over three threats in cyberspace: the theft of intellectual property and secrets; disruption of networks (for instance, attacks that have taken websites of American banks offline in recent months); and destructive acts such as those that targeted Saudi Aramco last year, destroying tens of thousands of computers."There is no failure of imagination in this space," he said of those seeking to exploit the internet.Dealing with threats requires more being done by both the private sector and the government to better defend networks and deter adversaries, he said.Responses to cyber attacks - such as those on American banks, which many commentators believe came from Iran - needed to be carefully thought through and might involve a range of tools, the NSA's number-two said."If at the end of the day we were to determine that those were attributable to another nation state, then surely we might think that is then the crossing of a red line," Mr Inglis said. "But the response should be proportionate," adding that it may come from the private sector rather than government.Dealing with commercial espionage in cyberspace, he said, might also involve a range of measures including private or public diplomatic pressure and the targeting of individuals for criminal prosecution.The job of the NSA, Mr Inglis said, was to exploit networks to collect intelligence in cyberspace and to defend certain networks - but not carry out destructive acts."NSA had a responsibility from way back, from our earliest days, to both break codes and make codes," he said. "We have a responsibility to do intelligence in a space we once called the telecommunications arena - now cyberspace - and the responsibility to make codes or to defend signals communications of interest."That's different than what most people conceive as offence or attack in this space."That task of destructive cyber attack, if ordered, lies with the US military's rapidly expanding Cyber Command.However, both the NSA and Cyber Command are led by the same man - General Keith Alexander - because the three fields of exploiting, defending and attacking are closely related."We realised a long time ago that the predicate for all those actions is first understanding how cyberspace works," Mr Inglis said. "Second: finding, fixing, holding in your mind's eye the thing that you would either defend, or exploit or attack. And then - and only then - do you make that final choice about what you are going to do about that."At least in the military component, the US has chosen to invest all those things in a single person such that that person may then orient and synchronise those activities in a way that they complement each other."Mr Inglis has worked for more than 25 years in the NSA, the last seven as deputy director, the highest-ranking civilian.There is no doubt that the last few months will have been the most difficult as the NSA - which was so secret people used to joke that its initials stood for "no such agency" - has been thrust into an uncomfortable spotlight by the leaks by Mr Snowden."I do think there needs to be more transparency," Mr Inglis told the BBC."We've had a discussion many times across the summer about the need to perhaps rebalance the balance between national security and civil liberties," he said."I don't think that is the case. I think that both of those must be given equal and full support. I don't think that we trade one for the other."But I do think we have to consider the balance between secrecy and transparency in order to have the public's confidence or [that of] those who stand in the shoes of the public and act on their behalf, say in the Congress," Mr Inglis added. "There needs to be greater transparency and we are committed to that."The revelations from Mr Snowden have indicated a scale of capability that has surprised even close observers of the NSA and its British partner GCHQ, and this has raised concerns over whether the capabilities are sufficiently accountable."I can appreciate that people are nervous," Mr Inglis said."And we ourselves at NSA need to respect that and therefore offer up whatever is necessary in terms of transparency to secure the confidence of our overseers and beyond them the American public - and for that matter allies."One of the tensions for the NSA over many years is the balance between its two roles of defending networks and exploiting them for intelligence.The most controversial revelation within the cyber security community was the claim that the NSA had been deliberately weakening some of the security protocols surrounding encryption, either by introducing back doors or by modifying international standards to ensure it could gain access to gather intelligence on its targets."What we have found over time is that our adversaries are using precisely the same communication systems, services, pathways as our citizens," Mr Inglis told the BBC."But in pursuing our adversaries we must also defend our citizens," he said. "We must not hold them at risk. And so we do try to crack the encryption used by terrorists and other adversaries in that system. We need to make sure that we do not hold at risk the encryption that is used by US citizens.""So that's rule one and we do in fact find ways to do precisely that," he added. "It is false to imagine or say that NSA broadly has the capability to decrypt most of the encryption that is used by any citizen in the world but in particular US citizens."The revelations by the Guardian newspaper that the NSA was collecting metadata about US communications raised concerns that the agency was getting involved in domestic surveillance.Mr Inglis argued that this collection operated under constraints."Beyond saying that I'm not Big Brother I think we are committed to demonstrating we are not Big Brother," he said, adding that this would involve illuminating the controls on the NSA's actions and performance statistics on those controls.Even beyond the revelations by Mr Snowden, the role of the NSA in cyberspace and the resulting questions of where responsibility lies for defence, intelligence gathering and attack mean the agency is unlikely to be able to retreat back into the secrecy that it enjoyed for so long.</body>

      <title>Bloodhound Diary: Building on the tides</title>
      <description>Precise engineering that factors in the tides</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24458799</url>
      <date>1381334307</date>
      <body>A British team is developing a car that will be capable of reaching 1,000mph (1,610km/h). Powered by a rocket bolted to a Eurofighter-Typhoon jet engine, the vehicle will mount an assault on the land speed record. The vehicle will be run on Hakskeen Pan in Northern Cape, South Africa, in 2015 and 2016.Wing Commander Andy Green, world land-speed record holder, is writing a diary for the BBC News website about his experiences working on the Bloodhound project and the team's efforts to inspire national interest in science and engineering.It was exactly 30 years ago that Thrust 2 broke the World Land Speed Record - 633mph - and brought the record back to Britain.Until then, it seemed that the US had taken the record away from us for good, with all their new-fangled jet and rocket technology.Fortunately for Britain, a certain Richard Noble decided that we should get it back.When he set the record in 1983, he reminded us (and the rest of the world) that Britain was still a world-beater.Now, 30 years later, we're building something that would go past Thrust 2 like it's standing still - Bloodhound SSC, the world's first 1,000mph car.We have the best motorsports industry in the world (if you need proof, just have a look at where all the Formula 1 teams are based) and one of the best aerospace industries (see the RAF's world-class new Typhoon aircraft for further details).Bloodhound is going to be a product of both industries, with a bit of space technology thrown in.It's another world champion in the making.The car is being assembled at our Technical Centre in Bristol, and every time I see it, more parts have been added.It's also attracting attention from all over the globe: we've got more than 200 countries following it on the Bloodhound SSC website.One of the impressive things about the build is the precision involved.For example, we are aiming to assemble the fin to an accuracy of better than 1/12th of a degree.The whole car is being assembled with this kind of precision with the aid of a "surface table" - a super-flat, 7m-long slab of cast iron that weighs 10 tonnes.The accuracy of the build is regularly checked using a Hexagon laser, which will measure the position of any part of the car, in three dimensions, to one millionth of a metre.This has given us a bit of a problem, though, as the surface table (all 10 tonnes of it) keeps moving.After a lot of checking, it would appear that the surface table, and the whole of our Technical Centre, is actually floating.The ends of the table move up and down by a couple of millimetres or so with the tide. We're only a few hundred metres from the River Avon and the tide in the river makes the floor (and the surface table, and therefore our chassis) go up and down very slightly.If we're fitting new components, the first thing we have to do is re-level the chassis, so that the new bits go on perfectly straight.No-one said that building a 1,000mph car was going to be easy - but we didn't expect to be afloat while we were doing it!The last of the rear upper-chassis ribs have now been delivered.These are the big heavy ribs that will have to support the fin, while it's keeping the car straight.The fin has been stressed to take a 25kN (2.5 tonne) side load.I'm staggered by how much that is (we could lay the car on its side and park two normal road cars on the fin) and how little it is (at 1,000mph, the fin will develop 25kN of side load at a yaw angle of only 0.9 degrees).Sounds like my driving might have to be as accurate as the chassis build - although the 2.5 tonnes of correcting force should help.Don't forget that while the fin is doing its best to keep us pointy-end forwards, you can be right there (or at least your name can). If you want your name to travel at 1,000mph, then sign up here to our fin programme.There's more good news from the aerodynamics team this month.We've been worrying about something called the "yaw static margin" for a while now.The yaw static margin is the distance between the centre of gravity and the aerodynamic centre of the car. In other words, this is what keeps the car pointy-end forwards at high speeds.Ideally, we want the car to look like a dart, with the weight up front and big feathers at the back.We were worried that the static margin (a measure of how dart-like the car is) was smaller than we wanted. It turns out that we'd made two small errors in the calculation.One was in the aerodynamic model of the fin, which hadn't captured the latest changes to extend the trailing edge, so that made the centre of yaw move back a bit.The other change was finding an error in the (hugely complex) centre of gravity calculation, which moved it forward almost 300mm. That's a big gain, and suddenly the car is looking a lot more stable.This will make it easier to keep the car pointy-end forwards and, since that's my job as the driver, I'm delighted.While we're running the car on the desert, one of the key things we'll be checking is the wheel loads.These wheel loads are the result of the car's weight plus all the aerodynamic loads on the vehicle, so we're going to be checking all the aerodynamic forces (and pressures) very carefully.I've just seen a computer programme written by David Naumann, a PhD student at Swansea University. David's programme will compare the real-world pressures, from 120 pressure sensors on the car, with the predicted pressures from the Swansea computer model.This will allow us to check the car's performance very rapidly.We're planning to publish the programme before we start running, so that you can check the car's performance for yourself at home, every time we run.It will also let the 5,500 schools in our Education Programme follow the science as we test it. If your school hasn't signed up to our free programme yet, then join the Bloodhound Education Programme here. It's going to be quite an adventure.URT is now finishing off our carbon-fibre intake duct, which is essentially just a tube to feed air to the car's EJ200 jet engine.The intake was made in two halves and then bolted together to form the 2.2m-long tube. It's another part of the car that will see some big forces.At 1,000mph, the intake will be pressurised to 1.6 Bar (24lb per sq inch), which will try to force the two halves apart with a force of 290kN. That's 29 tonnes.Put another way, each bolt that holds the two halves together will take a load of 13.2kN, or 1.3 tonnes.So after parking two average-sized cars on the side of the fin, we could pick each of them up in turn with just one bolt from the intake.That would explain why the bolts cost about £20 each!If that wasn't enough to worry about, the intake has also been designed to withstand an engine "backfire" without collapsing.If the airflow into a jet engine breaks down, the jet can burp back the air it has been ingesting, known in the jet engine world as a "surge". This could briefly push the intake pressure up almost 3 Bar (44 psi), increasing the load on the intake to over 50 tonnes. That's the weight of four double-decker buses.The bad news is that this load would pretty much wreck the intake. The good news is that we're using the Typhoon's EJ200 engine, one of the world's best jet engines.In normal operation it just doesn't ever surge. I can floor the throttle pedal (which controls the jet engine) at a standstill, and the engine will give me as much power as possible, without any risk that it will surge.The intake doesn't have much to worry about - and neither do I.</body>

      <title>The Nasa probe keeping tabs on our turbulent Sun</title>
      <description>The news from Nasa's highly productive solar observatory</description>

      <body>Brett Sapper has the unique responsibility of controlling Nasa's eye on the Sun.From a modest office in the agency's Goddard Space Center, in Greenbelt, Maryland, Sapper is in charge of the day-to-day operations of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), a satellite equipped with high-speed cameras capable of registering the Sun's activity nearly without interruptions.Launched in 2010 from Cape Canaveral, SDO has already been able to beam back 140 million images of the Sun, and some estimates predict that it will end up transmitting as much as 50 times more scientific information than any other mission in Nasa's history.Researchers hope this massive amount of data will help them forecast the effects of our turbulent star's behaviour on Earth. Intense solar activity can knock out power grids, GPS navigations and radio communications.From SDO's mission operation centre and surrounded by computers showing event logs and colourful displays of the satellite, Sapper says his work is fascinating because he is able to control "a robot in space" that he can't see and is located 36,500km (22,600 miles) above the Earth.But he immediately adds a caveat: "We are like fire fighters. We want to be bored, because if it's exciting it means there's a big problem."Up to now, according to this electrical engineer, there have not been any moments of fear, and he has been able to swiftly work with eight other scientists to control the mission's daily operations.They send commands and instructions to the satellite to tell it where to move, get all the "housekeeping information" back and also control two satellite dishes located at the White Sands Facility, in New Mexico, that are entirely dedicated to tracking the SDO while it collects scientific information."We do all that from here instead of having to call someone and have him do it for us", says Sapper. "That's something new here at Goddard and we are the only mission that does that: control the ground station from the mission operation centre".The satellite has got three instruments used by scientists to analyse not only the stellar surface, but also the star's interior. The possibility of looking inside the Sun is of vital importance to heliophysicists as they aim to decipher the very source of solar activity - the solar dynamo. This refers to the plasma currents that generate the Sun's unpredictable magnetic field.Scientists are now able to peer into the Sun by analysing the star's own acoustic waves, which are generated by its boiling turbulence. Using one of SDO's instruments, researchers are capable of turning those waves into clear pictures of the Sun's inner structures, just as geologists analyse the Earth's interior by studying earthquakes.Of course, Sapper and his colleagues at the mission operation centre cannot do all that work by themselves. In Goddard, his team only controls the technical aspects of the satellite and the antennas, whereas the science is done mainly by laboratories and universities across the country.One of Brett Sapper's colleagues at Goddard is helioseismologist William Dean Pesnell, whose job consists of interacting with the science groups. In other words, Pesnell is responsible for transforming Sapper's technical work into concrete results that may shed light on the solar dynamics that have an impact on the Earth's environment."We look at our satellite 24 hours a day and we get the data very quickly, so we can use it for immediate space weather purposes," says Dr Pesnell.This is important because the Sun's unpredictable behaviour could wreak havoc on the Earth: Nasa cites a 2008 report by the National Academy of Sciences, according to which a century-class solar storm could cause 20 times more economic damage than hurricane Katrina, considered the costliest US hurricane on record.It is therefore relevant for Dr Pesnell and his scientific team to try to understand what the Sun will do next."The goal of all our research is to predict what the magnetic field is going to do," he says."We aim to tell people: 'a flare is going to happen and if that is a concern to you, you should take steps to protect yourself'."But in order to accomplish their goal, both Sapper and Pesnell still have a lot of work ahead of them. SDO set out on a five-year mission, but mission scientists hope Nasa will extend the spacecraft's life by a few more years after 2015.After all, they know that a priceless treasure is at stake: the desire to understand the behaviour of our explosive star.</body>

      <title>Higgs: Five decades of noble endeavour</title>
      <description>Nobel recognises Higgs theory after near-50-year wait</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24445325</url>
      <date>1381271378</date>
      <body>Fifty years is a long time to wait for recognition of a brilliant idea. But this is the burden that Peter Higgs and Francois Englert have had to bear since they first proposed a mechanism to describe how matter in the Universe acquires mass.Englert and fellow Belgian Robert Brout were first to publish their ideas in August 1964. Higgs followed in October.The view - certainly, the one expressed by the Nobel committee on Tuesday - is that their papers were independent and indistinguishable, and that their work should therefore be jointly honoured.Of course, it is the standard practice not to award a Nobel posthumously, and so it is only Higgs and Englert who take the limelight, as their peer in this great endeavour, Robert Brout, died in 2011.Every advance owes something to previous generations - even Newton said he stood on the shoulders of giants; and sometimes it takes the insights of those who follow to truly see the implications.Prof Tom Kibble from Imperial College London probably falls into this latter category. His work with Americans Gerald Guralnik and Carl Hagen is regarded as being instrumental in the eventual application of the ideas expressed by Higgs, Englert and Brout."As you probably know, there were three groups working on this problem back then, but everyone's work in 1964 received essentially no attention at all, apart from the scepticism of various people," he recalls."The papers had hardly any citations for two or three years."If the Nobel committee's rules permitted more than three recipients per gong then the Imperial man could well have been standing in front of Tuesday's TV lights as well. As it is, he's applauding from the wings and proud to do so."I'm just really pleased they've recognised this work and this field," he told me.Particle physics is not the easiest subject to grasp for the lay audience, but a great many of us have come to absorb a vague concept of what the Higgs field and its associated boson entail - however fumbling.It is this notion that the Universe contains an all-pervasive field that elementary particles - the fundamental building blocks of matter - must traverse; and it is the drag these particles experience as they pass through the field that determines their mass. The boson is the thing that mediates the interactions.The maths may be beyond most of us, but everyone can appreciate that without an adequate description of mass - the very essence of stuff - then the cosmos can make no sense. There would be no form, no substance.The key reason it has taken nearly 50 years to prove the Higgs mechanism is that only now do we have an experimental set-up capable of nailing its existence.Others tried, but it took the scale and energy of the $10bn Large Hadron Collider to find the evidence.This colossal underground machine accelerates clutches of proton particles to fantastic speeds around a ring, colliding them in full view of sensitive detectors positioned at two widely separated locations.Only about one collision in every trillion produces a trace of the Higgs boson, and even then it is a process of deduction because all the scientists actually see are the products into which the particle decays.But the two independent detector sites confirmed each other's observations, and the boson was duly announced to great fanfare in July 2012."It is absolutely apt that it is recognised by a Nobel; it is one of the great discoveries of the 21 Century," says Prof Jim Virdee, another Imperial scientist and former spokesperson for one of those LHC detectors, the CMS experiment."One has to put it in some perspective. Our Standard Model [to describe how the basic building blocks of matter interact] wasn't built in a day. The first particle, the electron, was discovered by Thompson in 1897, and the Higgs is the last particle of the Standard Model - the 17th. So it was an enormous endeavour."Not that this is the end of the story. The LHC has barely got going and other discoveries are virtually guaranteed as it crashes together proton particles at ever greater energies."The LHC is a tremendous development," says Kibble. "We could never have pictured the experimental work that has burgeoned from those theoretical efforts in the 1960s."Which does raise the interesting question of why the LHC itself, its host institution Cern, and the thousands of scientists who work there, could not also be recognised in some form.The Nobel committee's rules for the physics prize do not seem to allow for this, but there is the precedent of another scientific body - the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - being given the Nobel peace prize in 2007.Some have speculated that Cern would also be a very worthy recipient of this gong."Cern has as one of its objectives to bring nations together through science," says Prof Virdee."It's certainly a remarkable human achievement to get so many people from so many different countries, cultures and creeds working together in the pursuit of fundamental knowledge. It's very uplifting."Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos</body>

      <title>Himalayas still uphill for climate report</title>
      <description>Data on Himalayan glaciers remains poor</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24396330</url>
      <date>1380882233</date>
      <body>Although the latest global update on climate change says the vast majority of glaciers worldwide have continued to shrink, scientists have admitted that the Himalayas remain an area where they still have very limited information.Glaciologists involved in the cryosphere chapter of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) first phase report, launched last week, said there was no good sample of Himalayan glaciers that could help them forecast their future behaviour."The Himalayas are one of the areas we really are data-poor," said Prof David Vaughan from Cambridge University, UK, and one of the two lead coordinating authors of the ice chapter in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)."We really need good samples of lots of glaciers and their measurements; we would like to have a larger number of benchmark glaciers," he told BBC News.The Himalayas received scant coverage in past IPCC reports.Until its Third Assessment Report in late 2001, the supreme authority on climate science called the Himalayan region a "white spot" because of the lack of information.Its Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 courted huge controversy when it mistakenly said that most of the Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035.After the IPCC put its hand up on this error, there was an expectation that AR5 would contain something more, particularly from the ground.But scientists involved in the latest IPCC report said there had been very little ground-truthing of the satellite imagery obtained for the Himalayas."Ground measurements are still very few, and, in addition, these few are usually limited to very small and not very representative glaciers," said Prof Georg Kaser, a University of Innsbruck, Austria, glaciologist and a lead author on AR5's cryosphere chapter."Field work on these glaciers is extremely difficult and also dangerous on an unacceptable scale. There is no way to overcome this, and this fact is also one of the reasons why we knew so little about these glaciers - giving thus also good reasons for [exaggerated] guesses."The Himalayas cover about one million square km, and there are more than 15,000 glaciers in the region according to several studies.The first-phase instalment of AR5 has significant detail on the Arctic, Greenland and the Antarctic.On the Greenland ice sheet, for instance, it said: "There is very high confidence that the Greenland ice sheet has lost ice during the last two decades."Combinations of satellite and airborne remote sensing together with field data indicate with high confidence that the ice loss has occurred in several sectors, and that large rates of mass loss have spread to wider regions than reported in AR4."But there is nothing like this on the Himalayas - the largest body of ice outside the northern and southern polar regions - and scientists say the main reason is the lack of studies on the ground.Even countries in the region have not been able to expand upon the few field studies they have initiated in limited pockets.India's Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology has been monitoring less than half-a-dozen glaciers within the Indian Himalayas."There are also strategic reasons behind the lack of ground work," says WIHG director Prof Anil Gupta, who was also a review editor on AR5's paleoclimate chapter."For instance, China and India share borders in the Himalayas and so because of the sensitivities on both the sides, it becomes difficult to reach these areas."WIHG has found that one of the reasons behind the recent catastrophic floods in Uttarakhand State of northern India was a breach of a glacial lake."The heavy precipitation led to the melting of the soft snow and even old ice in the Chorabari and companion glaciers that fed to the Chorabari Lake, which got breached due to excessive water intake from the glaciers," Prof Gupta explained."The mixing of glacial moraine, or debris, with glacial melt water mainly impacted the town of Shri Kedarnath and downstream towns of Gauriganga, Ramban, etc in the Kedarnath Valley."Prof Vaughan said that updates on the state of nearby glaciers were crucial for people living in such valleys in the Himalayas."If you live in a valley below one glacier, you really don't care what the global average [of glacial retreat] is; you just want to know what's happening to that particular glacier that's affecting your water security.According to the United Nations Environment Programme, there have been at least 35 events of glacial lake outbursts in Nepal, Pakistan, Bhutan and China during the last century.To minimise future risks, Prof Vaughan said scientists urgently needed more data on Himalayan glaciers."If they are going to start retreating then some of them will leave these kinds of glacial lakes that can then be quite dangerous if they burst out."We could actually predict which glaciers are likely to have that kind of behaviour in the future if only we can get on the ground and get some details."</body>

      <title>On Russia's controversial Arctic oil rig</title>
      <description>How safe is Russia's controversial oil platform?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24427153</url>
      <date>1381147258</date>
      <body>Remote and buffeted by icy waves, the Prirazlomnaya oil rig in the Arctic is the focus of a bitter dispute between Greenpeace and the Russian government - now an international court case.The journey to the rig starts in Arkhangelsk, one of Russia's historic northern ports. From there it is a two-and-a-half hour flight in an old Soviet propeller plane - an Antonov 26-100 - to the tiny settlement of Verandey, where the oil companies have built a small airstrip by the shore of the Arctic Ocean.From Verandey to the offshore oil platform is a half-hour helicopter ride, if the weather is good. But there was low cloud the first day we were there, so there were no helicopters and we spent the night in oil-workers' accommodation before trying again the next morning.When we made the flight the helicopter was an old Mi-8, but the safety equipment was good. We were all given survival suits for the journey, just as you would find in the North Sea.Soon we left the flat swampland behind and were out over the Pechora Sea.The Prirazlomnaya rig, when it comes into sight, is a sturdy structure set about 20m (66ft)-deep on the seabed. The visible part of the platform - the "topside" - sits on a massive concrete and steel structure. The weight of this box is what keeps it in position.Gazprom, the Russian state-owned company which operates the rig, says that this base is so heavy that it cannot be moved, even by thick ice. The company insists that drilling here is no different just because it is in the Arctic. It says there are many rigs - off Sakhalin Island in the far east for example - which have to cope with frozen seas.But environmental campaigners - and not only Greenpeace - insist that the Arctic is different. They say the nature here is unique. The polar bears, walruses, narwhals that live there have nowhere else to go. They warn that the Arctic Ocean only has two narrow entrances - one by Iceland and the other by Alaska. That means there is little mixing with other seas, so any oil spill would not disperse. Then there is the cold.Igor Chestin, chief executive of the environmental group WWF Russia, warns that because of the low temperatures an oil spill in the Arctic could be catastrophic."If you look at oil spills which happen in tropical waters, normally within a few years you don't find the oil anymore," he said, "because there are bacteria which actually absorb the oil and the oil disappears."But if you look at the northern environment, and for example the famous Exxon Valdez accident near Alaska, you still find the oil there. It's still poisoning the environment 24 years after the accident happened. It's still there. It didn't disappear - there are no micro-organisms which can absorb the oil."He says that an oil spill that might disperse in three years in warmer waters might take 100 years to disperse in the Arctic."Not a single oil company currently has the technology to deal with an oil spill under the ice. Some of them know how to collect oil from the surface of the water, or from the surface of the ice, which is like land. But under the ice? There are no technologies which can deal with that, and that means that the oil can spread over the place."In response Gazprom claim they have done everything they can to prevent a spill. The shallow waters mean the wellhead is actually inside the rig. They have a sophisticated cut-off system on the hoses which will offload the oil into tankers. It detects any movement by the tanker, if it is pulled away by ice for example. If there is too much movement it stops the flow of oil.Gazprom also insists that it could cope with a spill under the ice. It says two icebreakers are near the rig at all times, which could smash the pack ice and allow modern skimmers to clean up the oil.The workers on the Prirazlomnaya have been targeted by Greenpeace two years in a row. This year they were ready. The chief of the platform, Artur Akopov, showed us his defences - the fire hoses that his crew used to spray the activists who were trying to tie themselves onto the rig.It was used to deter the activists, and to make the side of the platform more slippery, and so more difficult to climb, he said.The campaigners had put his oil rig and the environment at risk, he claimed."By coming so close Greenpeace could have damaged the base of the platform. When they threw up their equipment they could easily have hit somebody. Or they might have ruptured one of the pressurised pipes and caused a diesel spill."That is something Greenpeace categorically deny. They used inflatable boats, and lightweight ropes.When the activists started climbing the platform, the Gazprom staff on the rig called their headquarters in Moscow. Artur Akopov said this was part of a pre-agreed response plan to any protest action. Within hours the FSB arrived. They are responsible for Russia's international security and borders, and are one of the successor agencies to the Soviet KGB.The FSB officers, who wore face masks, pulled the activists off the rig, pointed guns at them, and opened fire into the water, as can be seen on video released to the media by the FSB themselves.Given the changes in how Russia has dealt with activists in the last two years, perhaps Greenpeace should have expected a strong response.The Pussy Riot punk protest case last year put everyone on notice that long prison sentences are now a possibility.The 30 Greenpeace activists, six of them British, are now in jail in Murmansk on charges of "piracy as part of an organised group". The Netherlands - where the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise is registered - has challenged the arrests. It is using the Convention on the Law of the Sea to argue that the activists were illegally detained and should be released."Do you think they were pirates or protesters?" I asked Artur Akopov."That's for the court to decide" he said.</body>

      <title>Row over Spain's proposed solar tax</title>
      <description>Row in Spain over proposed toll on solar panel owners</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24272061</url>
      <date>1381100409</date>
      <body>"We will be the only country in the world charging for the use of the sun," says Jaume Serrasolses."Strange things are happening in Spain. This is one of them."Mr Serrasolses, the secretary of an association promoting the use of solar energy, SEBA, is referring to the government's proposal for a tax solely on those who generate their own electricity.They would pay a backup toll for the power from their solar panels, in addition to the access toll paid by everyone who consumes electricity from the conventional grid.Although the tolls vary, if you pay an access toll of 0.053 euros per kWh, you could face a backup toll of 0.068 euros per kWh.The new tax would extend the average time it would take for solar panels to pay for themselves from eight to 25 years, according to the solar lobby.The government says that with increasing "self-consumption", the income for conventional energy systems will decrease, but grid maintenance will cost the same."If I produce my own energy, but am connected to the grid, having the backup in case my production fails, I have to contribute to the cost of the entire system," says Energy Secretary Alberto Nadal.The government is hoping the energy reform will settle a debt of 26bn euros (£22bn; $35bn), which has built up over years as a result of regulating energy costs and prices.This is just the latest in a series of setbacks for the renewable energy sector.The government has gradually lowered a feed-in tariff - a scheme that paid people to produce their own "green electricity" - first reducing the period over which it was paid, then limiting it to already existing installations and finally an energy reform in July opened up the possibility of withdrawing it retroactively.At the same time it has not endorsed net metering, a policy allowing solar panel owners to send surplus energy to the grid and use it later. The idea was part of a previous proposal but was not included in the latest reform proposal.But while the government may have been heavily promoting solar energy six years ago, those who followed that lead may now pay dearly for their investment."The majority are people like your or my parents who at one time had savings and wanted to make an investment with a better return," says Piet Holtrop, a Dutch lawyer who is defending over 1,000 of them."Many of these people are going to lose their houses (that they used as collateral to buy solar panels). They are unable to pay back at the bank. They can't sell the installations, because the government has made them toxic assets," Mr Holtrop says.Though many people believe the government has succumbed to pressure from the big five energy companies, Mr Nadal insists that "solar energy is much more expensive than that mass-produced by large utilities".He adds that Spain is now paying for being at the forefront of solar energy development: "If we hadn't rushed into constructing large quantities of photovoltaic installations, we could have had them much better for [a] much lower price. It would have been much better introducing them step by step."The backup toll, still to be approved, has already paralysed the photovoltaic sector. "Nobody is going to make significant investment if it takes over 20 years to pay it off," says Jaume Serrasolses.However, the proposal has also prompted defiance.Ricard Jornet has fitted his beachside restaurant with 36 solar panels. Alongside other efficiency measures, they have cut his electricity bill by 40%.To avoid the backup toll, he plans to split the restaurant so that it uses two independent electricity systems, with only 30% connected to the grid. The rest will be self-sufficient, thanks to insulation and batteries storing the produced energy."I will save more money, because for the little part of the restaurant I will pay smaller access toll. I will also prove to the government this is not the way to do things."Civil disobedience is another option, despite hefty fines of up to 30m euros.Oriol, a chicken farmer, is willing to take the risk of undeclared self-consumption. "I believe they will warn me first. Then... we will have to invent another way to save the situation."The fines were originally designed for electricity companies and have to be approved by a cabinet council."The more people disobey, the more difficult it will be to fine them," says Jaume Serrasolses.Spain's energy regulator has sided with the opponents of the toll. It has found the proposal discriminatory, concluding that it makes self-consumption economically unviable and sacrifices middle and long-term economic efficiency for short-term economic sustainability. However, the regulator's word is non-binding.There are hopes that the European Commission will help, as its objective is to achieve 20% of energy production from renewable sources by 2020. The body is currently probing one of several complaints against Spain's energy policies.However, the Commission might have a dilemma."They are anxious to not jeopardise the plans for Spain's economic recovery," says Piet Holtrop."We are afraid the Commission is willing to sacrifice the EU legal framework for policy objectives."Other countries are carefully watching developments in Spain. The governments in Latvia, the Czech Republic, Italy and Greece seem to be pondering similar cutbacks."We want to make the Commission aware of the spillover effect," says Mr Holtrop.The backup toll may not end up being introduced, but the proposal has put many people off installing solar panels in the meantime, which means they are still getting their energy from the five big suppliers."I think they (the government) know this proposal does not make sense. They just want to gain time," says Ricard Jornet."[And] during all these months the energy oligopoly is making thousands of millions of euros."</body>

      <title>Hydrogen: The car fuel of the future?</title>
      <description>Could hydrogen power the cars of tomorrow?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24381812</url>
      <date>1380843391</date>
      <body>A small British firm is looking forward to a day in which we will take our cars to the garage and fill them with hydrogen.Acal Energy, based in Runcorn in Cheshire, says it has developed a chemistry that could make hydrogen fuel cells much cheaper and longer-lasting than current technologies.It wants to license its chemistry to the world's car-makers, opening the way for hydrogen vehicles to sell in large volumes in 10 or 20 years' time."We believe this is one of the breakthrough technologies," says Brendan Bilton, the company's chief commercial officer."We're pretty confident and excited... that this will start unlocking the barriers," he continues, "Allowing fuel cells to be in products for mass market applications."It is a bold dream but not a crazy one.The automotive industry is already far advanced with plans for a first generation of hydrogen cars.Hyundai, the South Korean manufacturer, has said it will soon start selling a hydrogen-powered version of its ix35 model.Meanwhile, the Japanese giant Toyota is expected to unveil its first nearly-production-ready foray into the territory at next month's Tokyo motor show.Other big names - including Daimler and Volkswagen - are thought to be on track to get hydrogen vehicles into showrooms by 2017.But few expect these first-generation hydrogen cars to sell in very large numbers.Acal Energy is pitching its technology as the enabler for a second generation of less costly, more durable vehicles which could - if all goes to plan - pose a serious challenge to the long domination of the internal combustion engine from about 2020 onwards.To begin with, consumers may take a bit of persuading.Hydrogen is widely seen as a dangerous fuel - an image underpinned by that grainy newsreel footage of the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg airship bursting into flames in the 1930s.But actually, experts do not seem daunted by this particular technical challenge.They point out that hydrogen is already used and managed on a routine basis in industrial processes.The main reason anyone bothers with it as a fuel for the future is because it is emission-free at the point of use.The hydrogen is combined with oxygen in a bit of kit called a fuel cell. This process generates electricity to power the engine in the vehicle.The waste products are heat and harmless water.Water is benign, unlike the global warming-inducing, carbon dioxide emissions that spew from even the most efficient petrol and diesel vehicles.The car industry has been developing fuel cells that use costly platinum as the catalyst for generating power from hydrogen for many years.Acal Energy claims the problem with this current technology is that it results in fuel cells that are either prohibitively expensive because of the high platinum content, or prone to degrade quickly.To get round these issues, the company has developed what Mr Bilton describes as a "liquid catalyst" composed of "a dissolved solution of metal salts".As well as being a lot cheaper than a platinum catalyst, the liquid doubles up as a coolant and a cleaning agent that extends the life of the fuel cell by taking away damaging by-products as it circulates through a "regenerator"."We have a solution that both increases durability and reduces cost," says Mr Bilton.The company has its offices in a science park that until a few years ago was the research and development centre for the British chemicals giant ICI, now shrunken in size and foreign-owned.Intriguingly, the ideas behind Acal Energy's patented "FlowCath" technology derive from techniques developed to clean clothes more efficiently.The founder of the company, Dr Andrew Creeth, now its chief technology officer, spent much of his career working as a scientist for the washing powder giant Unilever.Development of the product is taking place in an environment not unlike a gigantic school chemistry lab - full of bubbling chemicals, complicated equipment and clever looking people in white coats.The company has already raised £15m ($24m) to finance its work from a mixture of private investors and government sources.It is currently hoping to raise another £15m or so from a new funding round, with the outcome due to be announced soon.Eventually, Acal Energy aims to earn profits from the business model pioneered by the successful British micro-chip designer Arm Holdings.Arm's technology is embedded in most of the chips used in the world's smartphones and tablet computers.It receives a small royalty payment every time anyone upgrades their mobile device.Acal Energy dreams of equal success from licensing its technology to car manufacturers in decades to come.The big questions, though, are does the technology work and will it be the breakthrough that the company claims?Prof Nigel Brandon of Imperial College in London, a leading academic in hydrogen energy, is well qualified to comment."The core technology looks very exciting," he says."There are some components in their system they need to improve. I don't see any reason why they can't do that but they've still got to do it," Prof Brandon adds.It is guarded optimism that could equally be applied to the whole field of hydrogen fuel cell energy.The big advantages over battery-powered electric vehicles are hydrogen cars can be refuelled in a just a few minutes, they can run for 300 or 400 miles between refuelling and they have the environmental benefits of battery driven cars with the same range and convenience as those with petrol or diesel engines.But there are also significant snags.Among them is the need to create a hugely expensive new infrastructure of hydrogen filling stations to replace garages.Hydrogen enthusiasts often quote the example of the internet.Once the demand was proven, a global network of optical fibre cables to carry data traffic was rapidly built despite the cost.Major players in the car industry are betting - but not yet on a truly large scale - that hydrogen energy will follow the same pattern.</body>

      <title>Alzheimer's find is 'turning point'</title>
      <description>A chemical which can stop brain cell death in a neurodegenerative disease could hold the key for treating Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntingdon's diseases, scientists say.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24462699</url>
      <date>1381395409</date>
      <body>The discovery of the first chemical to prevent the death of brain tissue in a neurodegenerative disease has been hailed as the "turning point" in the fight against Alzheimer's disease.More work is needed to develop a drug that could be taken by patients.But scientists say a resulting medicine could treat Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's and other diseases.In tests on mice, the Medical Research Council showed all brain cell death from prion disease could be prevented.Prof Roger Morris, from King's College London, said: "This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer's disease."He told the BBC a cure for Alzheimer's was not imminent but: "I'm very excited, it's the first proof in any living animal that you can delay neurodegeneration."The world won't change tomorrow, but this is a landmark study."The research team at the Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit, based at the University of Leicester, focused on the natural defence mechanisms built into brain cells.When a virus hijacks a brain cell it leads to a build-up of viral proteins. Cells respond by shutting down nearly all protein production in order to halt the virus's spread.However, many neurodegenerative diseases involve the production of faulty or "misfolded" proteins. These activate the same defences, but with more severe consequences.The misfolded proteins linger and the brain cells shut down protein production for so long that they eventually starve themselves to death.This process, repeated in neurons throughout the brain, can destroy movement or memory or even kill, depending on the disease.This process is thought to take place in many forms of neurodegeneration, so safely disrupting it could treat a wide range of diseases.The researchers used a compound which prevented those defence mechanisms kicking in and in turn halted neurodegeneration.The study, published in Science Translational Medicine, showed mice with prion disease developed severe memory and movement problems. They died within 12 weeks.However, those given the compound showed no sign of brain tissue wasting away.Lead researcher Prof Giovanna Mallucci told the BBC news website: "They were absolutely fine, it was extraordinary."What's really exciting is a compound has completely prevented neurodegeneration and that's a first."This isn't the compound you would use in people, but it means we can do it and it's a start."She said the compound offered a "new pathway that may well give protective drugs" and the next step was for drug companies to develop a medicine for use in humans.Prof Mallucci's lab is also testing the compound on other forms of neurodegeneration in mice but the results have not yet been published.Side effects are an issue. The compound also acted on the pancreas, meaning the mice developed a mild form of diabetes and lost weight.Any human drug would need to act only on the brain. However, this gives scientists and drug companies a starting point.David Allsop, professor of neuroscience at Lancaster University described the results as "very dramatic and highly encouraging" but cautioned that more research was needed to see how the findings would apply to diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.Dr Eric Karran, the director of research at the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said: "Targeting a mechanism relevant to a number of neurodegenerative diseases could yield a single drug with wide-reaching benefits, but this compound is still at an early stage."It will be important for these findings to be repeated and tested in models of other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease."</body>

      <title>NHS 'must seek saving ideas abroad'</title>
      <description>The NHS in England has to look to India and Mexico for saving ideas - or face a large funding shortfall, its regulator says.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24464934</url>
      <date>1381366030</date>
      <body>The NHS in England has to look abroad for new ideas - or face a large funding shortfall by the start of the next decade, a health regulator has said.Monitor said the NHS was only likely to reach two-thirds of its £30bn saving target by 2021 if it kept on as it was.Most savings so far have come from keeping wages low and improving productivity.But the regulator said the NHS should be more radical by borrowing ideas from countries such as India and Mexico.Monitor's report cites Aravind Eye Care which runs a network of cataract clinics across India.The report said: "By streamlining the workflow of care to maximise the use of staff skills, Aravind is able to perform 60% of the number of NHS cataract surgeries but at one-sixth of the cost to the NHS and achieve better clinical outcomes."Another scheme highlighted was Medicall Home in Mexico which is a nurse telephone advice service that has had great success in reducing the need for consultations with local doctors."If the NHS were to introduce a similar service and it reduced 50% of first visits to general practice, where patients would otherwise have seen a doctor, we estimate it could free up GP time worth in the region of £0.6bn to £0.8bn, taking into account the cost of nurses to run the phone service," stated the report.Other schemes highlighted include one in Ghana for capturing patient information and images on a mobile phone and sending them "for interpretation by a doctor at a different location".Monitor said using fresh ideas such as these could help the NHS meet its ambitious savings targets.Over recent years the NHS has been working towards saving £15-20bn by 2015 - the so-called "Nicholson challenge".But it is now becoming accepted that the savings drive will need to be extended beyond that and hence a £30bn figure has been put forward for 2021.Monitor chief executive David Bennett said he agreed with that but claimed the combination of wage restraint, productivity improvements and reconfiguration of hospitals services was only likely to save around two-thirds of that and so fresh ideas were needed.He said that could either be achieved by getting new providers from abroad into the NHS to compete or by getting NHS trusts to adopt their ideas.He added: "We are not going to make the numbers add up if we don't have this sort of innovation."We must not rule out letting players outside the NHS from coming in and showing us how to do things differently."British Medical Association leader Dr Mark Porter questioned how easy it would be to adopt ideas from abroad."Doctors would need to see more detail as to how the changes proposed would work in reality," he said.But he added it was clear the continuing funding crisis meant doctors had to be given the "freedom" to innovate.Monitor, set up in 2004, describes itself as "the sector regulator for health services in England". It exercises a range of regulatory powers under different acts of parliament.</body>

      <title>Depression risk 'starts in the womb'</title>
      <description>Children whose mothers are depressed during pregnancy have a small increased risk of depression themselves, according to a UK study.</description>

      <date>1381372281</date>
      <body>Children whose mothers are depressed during pregnancy have a small increased risk of depression in adulthood, according to a UK study.Medical treatment during pregnancy could lower the risk of future mental health problems in the child, say researchers at Bristol University.The study followed the offspring of more than 8,000 mothers who had postnatal or antenatal depression.The risk is around 1.3 times higher than normal at age 18, it found.The study is published in JAMA Psychiatry. Lead researcher Dr Rebecca Pearson told the BBC: "Depression in pregnancy should be taken seriously and treated in pregnancy. It looks like there is a long-term risk to the child, although it is small."She said it was an association, not a causal link, and needed further investigation.Prof Carmine Pariante of King's College London's Institute of Psychiatry said the development of an individual's mental health did not start at birth but in the uterus."The message is clear - helping women who are depressed in pregnancy will not only alleviate their suffering but also the suffering of the next generation."Prof Celso Arango of Gregorio Maranon General University Hospital, Madrid, said stress hormones may affect the child's development in the womb."Women with depression would ideally be treated before getting pregnant, but if they are already pregnant when diagnosed with depression it is even more important that they are treated as it will impact on the mother and child."The researchers think different factors may be involved in antenatal and postnatal depression, with environmental factors such as social support having a bigger impact in postnatal depression.The data comes from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children - a long-term health research project, also known as Children of the 90s.More than 14,000 mothers enrolled during pregnancy in 1991 and 1992, and the health and development of their children has been followed in detail since then.</body>

      <title>Call for school body image lessons</title>
      <description>Training teachers to deliver classes in body image improves the self-esteem of teenage girls, a UK study shows.</description>

      <body>The self-esteem of teenage girls could be improved by training teachers to deliver classes in body image, a UK study shows.In the pilot study, 261 teenage girls at three secondary schools were given a course of six lessons on body image.This had significant effects on their body image and self-esteem compared with the regular curriculum, say psychologists at King's College London.As many as one in three teenagers say they are dissatisfied with their body.Poor body image has been associated with depression, eating disorders, overuse of cosmetic surgery, obesity and unhealthy weight loss behaviours.Dr Helen Sharpe and colleagues at the Institute of Psychiatry developed a course on positive body image for teenage girls.The six-part programme focused on ideals of beauty, unhealthy interactions with peers - such as "fat talking", or making negative comments about weight - and practical measures for boosting mood and self-esteem.The course was delivered by teachers in three state-funded girls' schools.Dr Sharpe told the BBC: "We have tested whether a series of lessons being delivered by teachers to students in school are helpful in improving body esteem - we found this was the case."She said the research, published in The British Journal of Psychiatry, showed promise in being able to tackle problems caused by low body esteem, such as eating disorders."We're hopeful that as we continue with this research we'll be able to make the programme even more effective and that it could then go on to be effective in reducing disordered eating - things like binge eating and unhelpful weight loss," said Dr Sharpe.Interventions delivered by teachers would have wide reach and be of minimal cost, said the researchers.Some schools were relying on programmes that were not evidence-based and could be harmful, they added.Last year, MPs recommended that all schoolchildren should take part in compulsory body image and self-esteem lessons.An inquiry by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Body Image heard evidence that more than half of the public had a negative body image.Girls as young as five now worried about how they looked, the MPs' report said, while cosmetic surgery rates had increased by nearly 20% since 2008.</body>

      <title>Madagascar bubonic plague warning</title>
      <description>Madagascar faces a bubonic plague epidemic unless it slows the spread of the disease, especially in its rat-infested prisons, aid groups warn.</description>

      <date>1381377616</date>
      <body>Madagascar faces a bubonic plague epidemic unless it slows the spread of the disease, experts have warned.The Red Cross and Pasteur Institute say inmates in the island's rat-infested jails are particularly at risk.The number of cases rises each October as hot humid weather attracts fleas, which transmit the disease from rats and other animals to humans.Madagascar had 256 plague cases and 60 deaths last year, the world's highest recorded number.Bubonic plague, known as the Black Death when it killed an estimated 25 million people in Europe during the Middle Ages, is now rare.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Geneva and the Pasteur Institute have worked with local health groups in Madagascar since February 2012 on a campaign to improve prison hygiene."If the plague gets into prisons there could be a sort of atomic explosion of plague within the town. The prison walls will never prevent the plague from getting out and invading the rest of the town," said the institute's Christophe Rogier.The ICRC said the 3,000 inmates of Antanimora, the main prison in the heart of the capital Antananarivo, live with a huge rat population which spreads infected fleas through food supplies, bedding and clothing.The ICRC's Evaristo Oliviera said this could affect not only inmates and staff, but others they come into contact with."A prison is not a sealed place, first of all the staff themselves who work in the prison are at risk, and they go home at the end of the day, already perhaps being a vector of the disease," he told the BBC."Also the rats themselves, they can go in and out of the jail and also propagate the disease."And the prisoners do have visitors who can be also infected, and the prisoners eventually go out as well so we have many many ins and outs for the disease to spread."The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says the eradication project undertaken by the ICRC is tricky because simply killing the rats is not enough.To prevent their infected fleas transferring to another host, possibly a human, the insects must be destroyed as well as the rodents, she says.Mr Oliviera said the disease could be treated with antibiotics if detected early, but a lack of facilities and traditional shame over the disease made this tricky in outlying parts of Madagascar.Experts say that Africa - especially Madagascar and the Democratic Republic of Congo - accounts for more than 90% of cases worldwide.However in August a 15-year-old herder died in Kyrgyzstan of bubonic plague - the first case in the country in 30 years - officials saidDuring the last 20 years, at least three countries experienced outbreaks of human plague after dormant periods of about 30-50 years, experts say.These areas were India in 1994 and 2002, Indonesia in 1997 and Algeria in 2003.According to the World Health Organization, the last significant outbreak of bubonic plague was in Peru in 2010 when 12 people were found to have been infected.</body>

      <title>UN sued over Haiti cholera epidemic</title>
      <description>The UN faces a claim for compensation by victims of a cholera epidemic in Haiti, which victims' lawyers say was caused by peacekeepers.</description>

      <body>Lawyers representing victims of a cholera epidemic in Haiti have filed a lawsuit against the United Nations at a court in New York.They say UN peacekeepers introduced cholera to Haiti in 2010. The disease killed more than 8,000 people and made hundreds of thousands sick.The lawyers are demanding compensation of $100,000 (£62,000) for every person who died and $50,000 for each of those who became ill.The UN says it has legal immunity.Lawyers filed the suit at the US District Court in New York. They said they were left with no other option after the UN had rejected previous claims for compensation."The UN refused to even consider them. We then felt we had no choice but to file in a national court," Brian Concannon, director of the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, which is bringing the case, told the BBC.BBC international development correspondent Mark Doyle says investigations have pointed strongly to leaking sewage at a camp for UN soldiers from Nepal, where cholera is endemic, as the origin of the outbreak in Haiti.No cases of the bacterial infection, which causes diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and muscle cramps, had been recorded in Haiti for a century until the outbreak in late 2010.Then cases mounted quickly in an area near the camp.Leading cholera expert Danielle Lantagne, who once worked for the UN, said in the past that the outbreak's "most likely source" was the UN camp.In February, a spokesman for UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the petition for compensation was "not receivable" under a 1947 convention which grants the UN immunity for its actions.Our correspondent says the UN's position is unlikely to change.</body>

      <body>NHS and care services patients need to become more demanding and fight for their rights, a new watchdog body says.Healthwatch England, which heads up a network of 152 local patient bodies, urged the public to become "savvy consumers" rather than "grateful patients".To help, the watchdog set out eight core rights for patients.It comes after polling indicated half of people who experienced poor care did not report it.The survey of more than 2,000 people found one in five had experienced poor care - but of those, 54% had not complained.Healthwatch England was created under the shake-up of the NHS earlier this year.It is envisaged that the organisation will act as a patients' champion, carrying out its own investigations and speaking out about issues of concern.This is its first report to Parliament, and it has used it to highlight the deference shown by patients.Healthwatch England chairwoman Anna Bradley said: "We all need to stop acting like grateful patients and care users and start to see ourselves as savvy consumers, insisting on our right to safe, dignified and high quality care."To help achieve that, the organisation has set out its list of rights:Ms Bradley added: "Consumer rights are second nature to us on the High Street, but by thinking this way we can ensure people have a voice at the heart of the health and social care system."Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb said he welcomed the initiative."Without real and meaningful input from patients, it is impossible for health and care services to improve and move forward in the future," he added.</body>

      <body>The brain has a critical window for language development between the ages of two and four, brain scans suggest.Environmental influences have their biggest impact before the age of four, as the brain's wiring develops to process new words, say UK and US scientists.The research in The Journal of Neuroscience suggests disorders causing language delay should be tackled early.It also explains why young children are good at learning two languages.The scientists, based at King's College London, and Brown University, Rhode Island, studied 108 children with normal brain development between the ages of one and six.They used brain scans to look at myelin - the insulation that develops from birth within the circuitry of the brain.To their surprise, they found the distribution of myelin is fixed from the age of four, suggesting the brain is most plastic in very early life.Any environmental influences on brain development will be strongest in infanthood, they predict.This explains why immersing children in a bilingual environment before the age of four gives them the best chance of becoming fluent in both languages, the research suggests.It also suggests that there is a critical time during development when environmental influence on cognitive skills may be greatest.Dr Jonathan O'Muircheartaigh, from King's College London, led the study.He told the BBC: "Since our work seems to indicate that brain circuits associated with language are more flexible before the age of four, early intervention for children with delayed language attainment should be initiated before this critical age."This may be relevant to many developmental disorders, such as autism, since delayed language is a common early trait."Early childhood is a time when language skills develop very rapidly.Babies have a vocabulary of up to 50 words at 12 months but by the age of six this has expanded to about 5,000 words.Language skills are localised in the frontal areas of the left-hand side of the brain.The researchers therefore expected more myelin to develop in the left-hand side of the brain, as the children learned more language.In fact, they found it remained constant, but had a stronger influence on language ability before the age of four, suggesting there is a crucial window for interventions in developmental disorders."This work is important as it is the first to investigate the relationship between brain structure and language across early childhood and demonstrate how this relationship changes with age," said Dr Sean Deoni from Brown University, a co-researcher on the study."This is important since language is commonly altered or delayed in many developmental disorders, such as autism."Commenting on the study, Prof Dorothy Bishop of the department of Developmental Neuropsychology at the University of Oxford said the research added important new information about early development of connections in brain regions important for cognitive functions."There is suggestive evidence of links with language development but it is too early to be confident about functional implications of the findings," she said."Ideally we would need a longitudinal study following children over time to track how structural brain changes relate to language function."The study was funded by the National Institutes for Mental Health (US) and the Wellcome Trust (UK).</body>

      <title>HMRC 'failed' on tobacco smuggling</title>
      <description>MPs warn that HM Revenue and Customs initiatives to fight tobacco smuggling are not working.</description>

      <date>1381394576</date>
      <body>MPs have warned that HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) initiatives to fight tobacco smuggling are not working.The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said the UK economy lost £1.9bn a year through tobacco smuggling, equal to 20% of all tax collected on cigarettes.Some tobacco firms oversupply other European countries and the surplus enters the UK tax-free, the PAC said.The HMRC says it has more than halved the size of the illicit market in cigarettes.But the PAC report said the HMRC was "in the dark" about how effective its enforcement strategy was.PAC chair Margaret Hodge said she was concerned that three out of five new HMRC initiatives to tackle smuggling had produced nothing by March 2013."The Department and Border Force have been painfully slow in taking forward new proposals to improve performance," she said.She added the two government agencies had failed to make a realistic assessment of what could be achieved and by when.Ms Hodge also said the HMRC had "failed to challenge properly those UK tobacco manufacturers who turn a blind eye to the avoidance of UK tax by supplying more of their products to European countries than the legitimate market in those countries could possibly require"."The tobacco then finds its way back into the UK market without tax being paid," she added. "The supply of some brands of hand-rolling tobacco to some countries in 2011 exceeded legitimate demand by 240%."HMRC must be more assertive with these manufacturers. So far it has not fined a single one of them," she said.An HMRC spokesman said the customs body had more than halved the size of the illicit cigarette market, highlighting the seizure of nearly 3.6bn cigarettes and more than 1,000 tonnes of rolling tobacco since 2011."Disrupting criminal businesses is at the heart of HMRC's strategy to clamp down on this illicit trade," he said."The tobacco smuggling gangs are constantly adapting to the huge downward pressure HMRC puts them under. This pressure has caused the long-term decline of this illegal trade."</body>

      <title>Plane noise 'link' to heart disease</title>
      <description>The risks of stroke, heart and circulatory disease are higher in areas which have a lot of aircraft noise, researchers have found.</description>

      <date>1381277391</date>
      <body>The risks of stroke, heart and circulatory disease are higher in areas with a lot of aircraft noise, researchers say.Their study of 3.6 million residents near Heathrow Airport suggested the risks were 10-20% higher in areas with the highest levels of aircraft noise.The team's findings are published in the British Medical Journal.They agreed with other experts that noise was not necessarily to blame and more work was needed.Their work suggests a higher risk for both hospital admissions and deaths from stroke, heart and circulatory disease for the 2% of the study - about 70,000 people - who lived where the aircraft noise was loudest.The lead author, Dr Anna Hansell, from Imperial College London, said: "The exact role that noise exposure may play in ill health is not well established."However, it is plausible that it might be contributing - for example, by raising blood pressure or by disturbing people's sleep.""There's a 'startle reaction' to loud noise - if you're suddenly exposed to it, the heart rate and blood pressure increase."And aircraft noise can be annoying for some people, which can also affect their blood pressure, leading to illness."The relative importance of daytime and night-time noise from aircraft also needs to be investigated further."The study used data about noise levels in 2001 from the Civil Aviation Authority, covering 12 London boroughs and nine districts outside of London where aircraft noise exceeds 50 decibels - about the volume of a normal conversation in a quiet room.The authors say fewer people are now affected by the highest levels of noise (above 63 decibels) - despite more planes being in the skies - because of changes in aircraft design and flight plans.The researchers - from Imperial and also King's College London - adjusted their work in an effort to eliminate other factors that might have a relationship with stroke and heart disease, such as deprivation, South Asian ethnicity and smoking-related illness.They stressed that the higher risk of illness related to aircraft noise remained much less significant than the risks from lifestyle factors - including smoking, a lack of exercise or poor diet.In an accompanying editorial, Prof Stephen Stansfeld, from Queen Mary University of London, said: "These results imply that the siting of airports and consequent exposure to aircraft noise may have direct effects on the health of the surrounding population."Planners need to take this into account when expanding airports in heavily populated areas or planning new airports."The study covered 12 London boroughs in the centre and west of the capital - and nine council districts beyond London, including Windsor and Maidenhead, Slough and Wokingham.Heathrow Airport's director of sustainability, Matt Gorman, said: "We are already taking significant steps to tackle the issue of noise."We are charging airlines more for noisier aircraft, offering insulation and double glazing to local residents and are working with noise campaigners to give people predictable periods of respite from noise."Together these measures have meant that the number of people affected by noise has fallen by 90% since the 1970s, despite the number of flights almost doubling."A government spokesman said: "The number of people affected by high levels of noise around Heathrow has been falling for years due to improvements in aviation technology, better planning of flight paths and other factors. We would expect to see this trend continue."A separate study, also published on Wednesday in the BMJ, demonstrates a higher rate of admission to hospital with cardiovascular problems for people living near 89 airports in the US.Prof Kevin McConway, from the Open University, said: "Both of these studies are thorough and well-conducted. But, even taken together, they don't prove that aircraft noise actually causes heart disease and strokes."A major difficulty in interpreting what these studies tell us is that they are based on data for geographical areas, not for individual people."Over the coming months, Public Health England will recruit experts to further examine the public health issues around exposure to noise.</body>

      <title>Mid Staffs guilty over patient death</title>
      <description>The Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust faces a large fine after it pleaded guilty to safety breaches over the death of a diabetic patient.</description>

      <date>1381335496</date>
      <body>The Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust is facing a large fine after it pleaded guilty to safety breaches over the death of a diabetic patient.Gillian Astbury, 66, died at Stafford Hospital in April 2007 after two nurses failed to give her insulin.Ann King was struck off and Jeannette Coulson was cautioned after a Nursing and Midwifery Council panel found them guilty of misconduct in July.The trust will be sentenced at Stafford Crown Court at a later date.It had pleaded guilty at Stafford Magistrates' Court to failing to properly manage and organise hospital services including its systems for record keeping and sharing patient information between staff members.Magistrates ruled their sentencing powers for the offence were insufficient because they could only impose a maximum fine of £20,000.They decided the trust should be sentenced at the Crown Court, where it will face an unlimited fine.Chairman of the bench Ian Jones told the court: "The defendant's actions fell well short of the expected standards over a substantial period of time."The bench have considered both the public interest arguments and the financial arguments put forward."The court heard that the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust was running an annual operating deficit of about £11m.It became the first foundation trust to go into administration in April.The NHS Litigation Authority, which provides indemnity cover for legal claims against NHS Trusts, said Mid Staffordshire's insurance would not cover a fine from the HSE.It said it would have to find the money from its own budget.Ms Astbury, from Hednesford, Staffordshire, died after going into a diabetic coma on 11 April 2007 while being treated for fractures to her arm and pelvis.In a statement released after the hearing, her full-time carer Ron Street said the prosecution afforded a "small measure of justice to Gillian."He said: "The financial fine of the trust is not the issue, as whatever the level of the fine it will only hinder the hospital which is otherwise trying to get back on its feet."My overwhelming concern is that the senior members of the trust board, who were responsible for implementing this system of unsafe work at the hospital whilst Gillian was in their care, have never been held to account."Today's acknowledgement of guilt by the trust does little by way of justice against those individuals who permitted such unsafe practices to continue for so long."The criminal prosecution was brought by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) three years after an inquest jury ruled that Ms Astbury's death was caused by low staffing levels and a failure to provide adequate nursing facilities.The inquest also found that the failure by nurses to administer insulin amounted to a gross failure to provide basic care.Peter Galsworthy, from the HSE, said Ms Astbury's death was "entirely preventable".He said: "The trust's failure to implement a robust and consistent process cost the life of a vulnerable patient in the trust's care....and it will now be for a Crown Court judge to determine sentence."The Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust said it "fully accepted the decision" to refer the case to the higher court.Chief Executive Maggie Oldham said: "Our thoughts remain with the friends and family of Gillian Astbury and we apologise for the dreadful care Ms Astbury received at Stafford Hospital in April 2007."Although of little consolation to Ms Astbury's family, we can assure them we have done everything we can to put those things right which went so very wrong in 2007 and that the standard of care now provided at the hospital has improved considerably over the last few years as has been recognised by many independent organisations and individuals."</body>

      <title>Hope for malaria vaccine by 2015</title>
      <description>UK drug maker GlaxoSmithKline will seek approval for the world's first malaria vaccine after trials showed that it had reduced cases in African children.</description>

      <date>1381206650</date>
      <body>British drug maker GlaxoSmithKline is seeking regulatory approval for the world's first malaria vaccine after trial data showed that it had cut the number of cases in African children.Experts say that they are optimistic about the possibility of the world's first vaccine after the trial results.Malaria, a mosquito-borne parasitic disease, kills hundreds of thousands of people worldwide every year.Scientists say an effective vaccine is key to attempts to eradicate it.The vaccine known as RTS,S was found to have almost halved the number of malaria cases in young children in the trial and to have reduced by about 25% the number of malaria cases in infants.GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is developing RTS,S with the non-profit Path Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI), supported by funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation."Many millions of malaria cases fill the wards of our hospitals," said Halidou Tinto, a lead investigator on the RTS,S trial from Burkina Faso."Progress is being made with bed nets and other measures, but we need more tools to battle this terrible disease."The malaria trial was Africa's largest-ever clinical trial involving almost 15,500 children in seven countries.The findings were presented at a medical meeting in Durban, South Africa."Based on these data, GSK now intends to submit, in 2014, a regulatory application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA)," GSK said in a statement.The company has been developing the vaccine for three decades.The statement said that the hope now is that the Geneva-based World Health Organization (WHO) may recommend the use of the RTS,S vaccine from as early as 2015 if EMA drugs regulators back its licence application.Testing showed that 18 months after vaccination, children aged five to 17 months had a 46% reduction in the risk of clinical malaria compared to unvaccinated contemporaries.But in infants aged six to 12 weeks at the time of vaccination, there was only a 27% reduction in risk.A spokeswoman for GSK told the AFP news agency that the company would file its application to the EMA under a process aimed at facilitating new drugs for poorer countries.UK politician Lynne Featherstone, International Development Minister, said: "Malaria is not just one of the world's biggest killers of children, it also burdens health systems, hinders children's development and puts a brake on economic growth. An effective malaria vaccine would have an enormous impact on the developing world."We welcome the scientific progress made by this research and look forward to seeing the full results in due course."</body>

      <title>Euro MPs tighten anti-tobacco laws</title>
      <description>The European Parliament votes to tighten tobacco rules to curb smoking among young people, but avoids restricting e-cigarettes.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24439474</url>
      <date>1381239856</date>
      <body>Euro MPs have voted to tighten tobacco regulations aimed at putting young people off smoking, but some measures do not go as far as originally planned.They rejected a European Commission proposal to treat electronic cigarettes as medicinal products - a move that would have restricted sales.They backed a ban on cigarette flavourings - but with a five-year delay in the case of menthol.Slim cigarettes will not be banned. EU ministers must now consider the plans.Among other measures, MEPs voted on Tuesday to put health warnings on 65% of each cigarette pack, as opposed to the proposed 75%.Linda McAvan, the Labour MEP steering the legislation, said 65% was still "a long way towards plain packaging".The current requirement for health warnings is for 30% minimum coverage on one side and 40% on the other.Packs of 10 cigarettes, considered popular among younger smokers, will also be banned.Fourteen EU states already have 20 as the minimum, four stipulate a minimum of 19, and in the UK and Italy the minimum is 10.Smaller than normal packs of roll-your-own tobacco will still be allowed under the new rules.It was the European Parliament's first reading of a draft tobacco directive which could become law in 2014. It would then take two more years to become law in each of the 28 EU member states.There has been intense lobbying of MEPs by the tobacco industry and health campaigners.The Commission says almost 700,000 Europeans die from smoking-related illnesses each year - equal to the population of Frankfurt or Palermo. The costs for healthcare in the EU are estimated to be at least 25.3bn euros (£20.6bn; $33.4bn) annually.Conservative and Liberal MEPs welcomed the amendments made to the original proposal from Labour's Linda McAvan.Speaking to the BBC, Ms McAvan said she was disappointed that slim cigarettes were not banned.But cigarette packaging made to look like lipstick or perfume containers - attractive to girls - will disappear, she noted.There will now be further negotiations with the Council - the grouping of relevant EU ministers. MEPs may manage to avoid a second vote and fast-track the legislation so that it is adopted before the May 2014 European elections.The proposals also include a ban on words like "light", "mild" and "low tar", deemed to be misleading, and a ban on oral tobacco - called snus - although Sweden would retain its exemption.EU Health Commissioner Tonio Borg called the vote "positive". "I am confident that the revised Directive on Tobacco Products can still be adopted within the mandate of the current Parliament," he said.But Carl Schlyter MEP, health spokesman for the Greens, called it "a shameful day for the European Parliament, as a centre-right majority, led by the EPP group, has done the bidding of the tobacco industry and voted for weaker rules".Angela Harbutt of the pro-tobacco organisation Forest criticised the legislation, saying "prohibition doesn't work and products that are banned will almost certainly be available on the unregulated black market."Law-abiding consumers will be at a serious disadvantage and it won't help children because criminal gangs don't care who they sell to," she said.The UK has already said e-cigarettes will be licensed as medicine from 2016.Sales of the tobacco-free devices have boomed worldwide since bans on smoking in public places were introduced.But campaigners say their growing popularity is dangerous.They argue that e-cigarettes undermine years of anti-smoking efforts and could be especially damaging to children and non-smokers.The devices are designed to replicate smoking behaviour without the use of tobacco. They turn nicotine and other chemicals into a vapour that is inhaled.Manufacturers of e-cigarettes say the products have the potential to save millions of lives.Anti-smoking campaigners say young people especially are being tricked into taking up smoking.Prof Martin McKee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine says tobacco firms have simply extended their advertising techniques to e-cigarettes.Commissioner Borg, presenting the proposals, said tobacco products "should look and taste like tobacco products".In 2009‐10, sales of tobacco products generated nearly £9bn ($14.6bn; 11bn euros) in taxes for the UK government, about 2% of all receipts from taxation, a government report said.</body>

      <body>"Ancient humans" used toothpicks nearly 1.8 million years ago, a study of their teeth has revealed.A team studied hominid jaws from the Dmanisi Republic of Georgia - the earliest evidence of primitive humans outside Africa.They also found evidence of gum disease caused by repeated use of what must have been a basic toothpick.Writing in PNAS, the team says its findings help to explain the diversity found in hominid teeth.The researchers used a new forensic approach to look at variations on the teeth of hominids thought by some to be early European ancestors.Teeth can shed light on what the individuals ate and how old they may have been, but until now it was not clear why there was so much diversity in the Georgian hominid mandibles, or jaws.Ani Margvelashvili, lead author of the study at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, said that scientists dealing with fossil hominid mandibles should pay close attention to tooth wear and the fossil individual's age."Progressive tooth wear triggers bone remodelling processes that substantially modify the shape of the jaw during an individual's lifetime. These effects are typically underestimated when attributing fossil hominid jaws to different species," she told BBC News."The individual who was using a toothpick was young, as his or her teeth were not worn down. We also discovered a damaged area between the tooth area and the gum. There was a small cylinder-shaped lesion - in this area, if you place a toothpick it goes through."The researchers analysed four mandibles from one of the biggest collections of well-preserved early human remnants known anywhere in the world.The Dmanisi site has been valued as an important place to look at how hominids migrated from Africa."It's not very often you have one site with four mandibles. It has allowed us to see special features that have not been seen before," explained David Lordkipanidze of the Georgian National Museum.This included horizontal scratches on a lesion, visible on the root surface of one of the teeth."Scientists often describe groups with new characters as different species. Here we show in one group you can see many characteristics. It shows once more how complicated the story of human evolution is," Prof Lordkipanidze, co-author of the work, told BBC News.It is still unclear what species the Dmanisi hominids were. Experts once believed it was Homo erectus who first ventured out of Africa.But the Dmanisi hominids were not typical of the tall-standing and big-brained H. erectus. Instead, the Dmanisi individuals were short, long-armed, small-brained and thin browed. The fossils are therefore now sometimes referred to as Homo georgicus.Louise Humphrey from the Natural History Museum, London, said there had been a longstanding interest in the causes and implications of the high degree of variation in their mandibles and crania."This paper demonstrates that remodelling of the mandible associated with heavy tooth wear and continuous tooth eruption could contribute to that variation."Peter Ungar from the University of Arkansas, US, said the study could provide a new way of looking at fossils."Tooth pick markings are not uncommon in fossil hominids from this time period, but this clinical, forensic approach is new and potentially useful."Analyses of tooth movements due to wear have been more-or-less limited to anatomically modern humans, and this paper introduces the approach to paleoanthropology," Prof Ungar added.</body>

      <title>Microscopic 'bacterial zoos' made</title>
      <description>A "bacterial zoo" with microscopic cages has been built out of jelly by US researchers.</description>

      <body>A "bacterial zoo" with microscopic cages built out of jelly has been constructed by US scientists.Their findings, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, could transform understanding of how bacteria behave in communities.The bugs have different properties, which can make infections hard to treat, when they form colonies.UK researchers said bacterial communities were poorly understood and the technology could lead to progress.Big groups of bacteria can acquire antibiotic resistance where lone bacteria would be vulnerable. The nature of a community can affect how serious an infection becomes in open wounds or in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis.Scientists have been growing bacteria in Petri dishes in the laboratory for more than a century.But they do not replicate all the conditions inside the body and they cannot be used to manually build colonies of bacteria, one bacterium at a time.A team of researchers at the University of Texas have used 3D printing to build colonies.They mixed bacteria with a special form of gelatin and let it set so the bacteria were suspended like cocktail fruit in jelly.They then fired a laser at the gelatin-bacteria mix.The structure of the gelatin was altered at the point the laser beam was focused. The targeted gelatin proteins hooked up to each other so that when the rest of the gelatin was washed away it left the "cage".It allowed the researchers to build cages around individual, or small groups of bacteria in whatever shape they chose. By building up a number of cages, they could eventually build a "zoo", with every bacterium exactly where the researchers wanted it.The walls of the cage were able to keep the bacteria in place, but allow nutrients and signals to pass between cages.Prof Jason Shear, from the University of Texas, said experiments had shown that one species of bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, could become more antibiotic resistant when growing with another Pseudomonas aeruginosa.He told the BBC that the new technology could start to tackle questions about bacterial communities: "If a cluster develops antibiotic resistance, how large does it have to be, how many cells, what density is needed, is a low oxygen environment key?"We're starting to see that it really does matter how cells arrange themselves, it affects how antibiotic resistant a colony is, so it may ultimately inform therapies."Prof Ross Fitzgerald, from the Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh, said: "I think it is safe to say we know very little about bacterial communities."There are millions of bacteria in the gut, but we don't know much about how they function or relate to each other and infectious diseases are often caused by more than one pathogen, co-infection is more common that we'd thought in the past."I think this technology does provide an opportunity to simulate better in the laboratory various bacterial communities that can be present in an infection."</body>

      <title>Does reality TV help the NHS?</title>
      <description>Fly-on-the wall TV programmes may not be showing us the real National Health Service, warns Dr Johnny Marshall, of the NHS Confederation.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-23687320</url>
      <date>1376622383</date>
      <body>Reality TV finds its way into all areas of our lives - including our hospitals. In this week's Scrubbing Up column, Dr Johnny Marshall, of the NHS Confederation, asks if the picture it reflects is distorting our idea of how the NHS works.There has been an increasing range of reality shows focusing on NHS services in recent years: One Born Every Minute, 24 Hours in AandE, Keeping Britain Alive, and Junior Doctors, to name just a few.These programmes provide amazing insights into the tireless work of NHS staff and the joys and heartaches of patients and their families.They show a health service that many of us as professionals are proud to work in and are determined to improve despite the increasing pressures on it, a service that is a source of great pride.But as more NHS reality shows appear on our screens, do they really give us a representative view of everything that the health service can and does do?In particular, is there too much fixation on the hospital model, the wonder services and miracle drugs breaking new barriers, and not enough on the care outside hospitals that provides just as essential a purpose?And does this bias the public's view of what we think the "right" kind of healthcare looks like, and inhibit our acceptance of change?The NHS is a complex system, and most of us would agree that many modern treatments are unrecognisable from the original service set up in 1948.Yet the very success of improving health outcomes for the postwar big killers is resulting in a new challenge - people living longer but developing more long-term diseases in older age.To meet these challenges we need to move the emphasis away from hospitals and towards community services.I fear that reality shows, as great as they are, may inadvertently reinforce the public view that hospitals, regardless of their standards, are best, without considering the alternatives.The reality is that hospitals are only one part of the modern NHS story.Many core health services may not have the TV wow factor of pioneering treatment carried out by our big teaching hospitals, or be as thrilling as the trauma care that saves lives in the most horrific of situations.But many community-based services are life-saving - such as falls services, which have been shown to reduce death rates by as much as by 50%.And although they are not glamorous they do save lives and, importantly, allow people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. After all, there is no place like home.Services such as these are a critical part of ensuring that people receive the right care.They relieve pressure on hospitals so those who do need treatment can be seen more quickly.And they reduce the likelihood of people having to stay in hospital because the support they need to be cared for at home or in the community is not there.We have seen how the pressures grow on our AandE departments when these other services are not available.Like any other industry, if the NHS is to retain its core purpose and principle - to meet the needs of everyone and remain free at the point of delivery - and in a safe affordable and sustainable way, it has to move with the times. And we need to let it do so.We have seen many improvements across a wide range of areas, with people spending less time in hospital, so it makes sense to have fewer hospital beds and more support in the community.Similarly, by concentrating the skill and expertise needed to deliver round-the-clock specialist care for patients, we are reducing the number of places it is allocated.By improving stroke services in London, care is now located at eight sites rather than 30 sites, with hundreds of lives - and money - saved each year.These changes may seem daunting, and I have no doubt the NHS needs to do more to engage the public in debate.Often we have not explained the benefits of change well enough.Instead, we have tended to engage with communities after we have come up with a preferred solution, and so have found ourselves in long, drawn-out battles over proposals deemed to be without proper foundation or evidence.So what, you might ask, does reality TV have to do with this?TV shows are there to entertain us, and we should not knock the opportunity to improve our knowledge and insight of various aspects of medicine.But TV also provides a useful mirror that reflects society - our prejudices, fears and hopes.And if our hope is to care for everyone in the right way and in the right place, TV needs to start reflecting that.The future I describe is already a reality in many parts of the NHS, but not evenly distributed.So how about a reality series looking at the amazing work that goes on in the community?After all, that is where life really happens. Is reality TV a help or hindrance to the NHS?</body>

      <title>App aims to improve death records</title>
      <description>How mobile phones are helping register deaths</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24164824</url>
      <date>1379723133</date>
      <body>Two thirds of deaths worldwide go completely unrecorded, making it impossible to know if public health money is being spent in the right places. But could a mobile phone app be the answer?Birth and death are perhaps the most significant moments of any human life - worth writing down for posterity.But in many countries around the world, the systems set up to collect vital data about citizens have such low coverage that many deaths slip through the net.Not knowing who has died, and what they have died of, makes it impossible to build an accurate picture of a nation's health.Now technology - in the form of a specialist mobile phone app - could make all the difference.Using a technique known as "verbal autopsy", field workers visit relatives to ask them about the circumstances of a family death.By collecting the information digitally from currently hard-to-reach places, it has the potential to revolutionise our understanding of global health.In Malawi, any death that occurs outside a medical facility is not recorded.Dr Carina King, a fellow at University College London, is overseeing the implementation of the mobile phone autopsies in the Malawian district of Mchinji."We found everyone surprisingly open, and I think they find the phone quite an interesting thing when we go for interviews," she told the BBC.Verbal autopsies have been in use for about 20 years but the information was traditionally recorded on a paper questionnaire.These often lengthy documents were supposed to be analysed by two doctors, who would use the answers to deduce the likely cause of death.However the sheer scale of the task was often too great, meaning that many of the questionnaires ending up languishing in dusty rooms, completely unread."The mobile phone has been very good and means we don't have lots of paper forms," says Dr King."We have very quick access to the data and we can analyse it quickly to get the causes of death."The phone software, known as MIVA, presents a series of questions that a trained field worker uses to find out information from the family.Each question has a range of possible answers and the software intelligently skips to the next relevant question depending on the response.Most important of all is that it is designed to quickly compute the most likely cause of death.The result is stored in the phone and can be sent to a central database either by text message or internet upload.Dr Jon Bird of City University, London, who was part of the team involved in creating the software, says mobile phones provide a particularly convenient way of collecting data."Mobile phones are probably one the most widespread technologies in the world. They're cheap, they're robust and everyone knows how to use one," he told the BBC."The everyday nature of mobile phones also makes them really valuable because the people that are being interviewed don't find them intrusive."In Malawi, mobile phone autopsies are currently being used to record the cause of death in children.The project is called MaiMwana, meaning mother and child in the local Chichewa language, and it focuses on children who died before their fifth birthday.The under-five mortality rate in Malawi is 71 per 1,000 live births according to 2012 figures from the World Bank - compared to just five per 1,000 live births in the UK.Lazaro Cypriano lives in the village of Mzangawa in Mchinji district, central Malawi with his wife Magdalena and their toddler.The couple lost their first two children.Their second child died about a year ago, after a series of hospital visits due to fever. It is this death that will be the subject of the verbal autopsy.Outside urban areas, one of the main problems for collecting data is finding out when a death has occurred.To get around this, field reporters from the local community take on the responsibility of alerting the MaiMwana team of people who have died in their area.This is how Lazaro's family was identified, and the visit now affords him his first opportunity to narrate what happened to his son and have that information recorded.The interviewer asks the couple standard questions and matches their answers to the choices provided in the application's template.It's a highly sensitive and skilled job - and one which field interviewer Nicholas Mbwana can see is made easier by using a mobile phone."We go to the households, ask about the causes of death - what really happened - and we also record the GPS in order to trace the household in future," he told the BBC.Dr King says the system is key to the success of the project."GPS gives us the location of every household in the district so we can actually plot out on a map where people are dying of what, which means that you could design more sophisticated programs for targeting specific interventions."Mobile phone autopsies are being used on a limited scale at present. But the long term aim is to roll out the technique much more widely."The beauty of the system is that it's standardised and can be translated into any language you want," says Dr Bird."It's important when you're collecting data on a large scale that everyone is answering the same question, so that you know that the results are directly comparable from town to town and country to country."The World Health Organization (WHO) is already supporting the initiative and is working with institutions from the UK to Sweden to develop the technology further.The data is currently being collected in a range of databases that can be accessed by researchers interested in public health.As the project grows, researchers from the University of Umea in Sweden will co-ordinate the growing number of translations and the distribution of the technology around the world.The government in Malawi is already keen to see the results of the project."It is important for us as a ministry to know what is killing Malawians out there so that we can plan ahead and put appropriate interventions in place to prevent that - and also to put out health messages," says Dr Charles Mwansambo, Malawi's Health Secretary.The Ministry of Health has so far only been using information collected from medical facilities, which the health secretary concedes is biased data."We need comprehensive data from the hospitals and the community to plan well. We find ourselves planning for the small community that comes to hospital, not realising there is a bigger community out there that we need to budget for," he adds.Dr Mwansambo also acknowledges that a cultural practice of burying health documents with the dead makes it difficult to collect important information about deaths."When somebody dies people want to forget everything about them - those memories that will remind them of their loved ones. So unfortunately they bury the health passport along with their clothes and other possessions and we lose vital information in the process," he explains.The health passports are documents issued to parents, which record the birth weight of the baby and its gain over time, as well as which immunizations were administered and when.An elder at Mzangawa village, Kangkwamba Piri, is already talking to members of his community to drop that cultural practice."We've been doing this for a long time but it is wrong. What needs to be done is not to bury the documents and that's what we're encouraging people to do," he says.For now, it is likely that millions of deaths will still go unnoticed by official figures. But verbal autopsies recorded on mobile phones are making small but significant inroads into solving the problem.And for and his wife Magdalena, the chance to give information about what killed their child to an official is important.Magdalena says: "What I have learnt from this interview will help me take care of my third baby so he can be healthy and live long."</body>

      <title>Alzheimer's breakthrough: Cure or hype?</title>
      <description>How significant are reports of a turning point in Alzheimer's?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24478942</url>
      <date>1381417427</date>
      <body>If you regularly walk past a newspaper stand, then "Alzheimer's cure" or "Major Alzheimer's breakthrough" headlines will be a familiar sight. And here we are again.UK researchers have, for the first time, used a chemical to prevent the death of brain tissue in a neurodegenerative disease.The Times went with Cure for Alzheimer's "within reach" on its front page, the Independent had Scientists hail historic breakthrough in war against Alzheimer's, and my BBC News website article used the headline Alzheimer's find is "turning point".One major difference this time is that sensible, cautious scientists are suggesting the latest discovery could be one for the history books.Nearly every report contains this quote from Prof Roger Morris, at King's College London: "This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer's disease."So what is it about the latest study that generates a rare level of excitement? And is a cure really on the cards?The prime source of excitement is that a chemical has stopped the death of brain cells, in a living brain, that would have otherwise died due to a neurodegenerative disease.This is a first and a significant one. When I interviewed Prof Morris on Wednesday night, he used the word "landmark" repeatedly.In the Medical Research Council study, the mice had prion disease, similar to the human form of mad cow disease. Within eight weeks, their brains deteriorated so badly that memory and movement were noticeably affected. By the 12th week, the mice were dead.But when the same infected animals were given a "drug-like compound", they survived the 12 weeks with no sign of the brain dying. The chemical also caused side-effects including weight loss and diabetes.The second tier of excitement comes from the potential implications.The chemical helps the brain cope with producing broken proteins. In Parkinson's the alpha-synuclein protein goes wrong, in Alzheimer's it's amyloid and tau, in Huntington's it's the Huntingtin protein.The brain's response to all of these diseases is to shut down protein production, but this eventually kills brain cells. The chemical helps brain cells ignore the broken proteins, keep functioning and stay alive.In the past, research on neurodegenerative diseases has focused on what is unique to that condition. This approach looks at what is common to all of them and if it really does work, then it raises the prospect of a single drug to cure or prevent nearly all forms of neurodegeneration. Another reason for excitement.Lead researcher Prof Giovanna Mallucci said: "If it stops brain degeneration in its tracks, it will halt disease in people who have already got it. And if we can detect early disease, it will prevent a lot of degeneration."The hope is to arrest the process of brain cell death, and that's what's so exciting."It's worth emphasising the precise findings of the study - a toxic chemical, which the researchers will not even call a drug, halts the death of brain cells in mice with prion disease.Clearly this is not a cure, but it points the way to one. It gives drugs companies and scientists something to work with.That process will take time, probably more than a decade, with no guarantee of success at the end.And the recent history of medical research is littered with examples of drugs that looked promising in mice, but were a bitter disappointment when tested in people.This chemical works in a mouse brain of 75 million neurons. A more complex human brain built from 85 billion neurons is a far different challenge.Dr Simon Ridley, the head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, told the BBC patients would be facing a long wait."I'm afraid it's far longer than any of us would like," he said."I think there are many people who'd be desperate for any news of new treatments, which they would like to take today."I think at this stage we could be looking at a decade before we'll know whether this will be effective."This study is certainly exciting scientifically. But it might take until 2023 to see whether it truly deserves its place in the history books.</body>

      <title>Do you really need to drink eight cups of water a day?</title>
      <description>Is there any scientific basis for drinking two litres of water a day?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24464774</url>
      <date>1381393552</date>
      <body>Drinking eight cups or two litres of water a day is longstanding advice. But is there any scientific basis for it, asks Dr Chris van Tulleken.You know those ads that remind us that even a small drop in hydration levels can massively affect performance so you need to keep hydrated with whatever brand of isotonic super drink they're selling?They seem pretty scientific don't they? Man in white coat, athlete with electrodes attached and so on. And it's not a hard sell because drinking feels right - you're hot and sweating so surely replacing that fluid must be beneficial.Well earlier this year sports scientists in Australia did an extraordinary experiment that had never been done before (British Journal of Sports Medicine, September 2013, Current hydration guidelines are erroneous: dehydration does not impair exercise performance in the heat, Wall BA).This group wanted to find out what happened to performance after dehydration. So they took a group of cyclists and exercised them until they lost 3% of their total body weight in sweat.Then their performance was assessed after rehydration with either 1) nothing, 2) enough water to bring them back to 2% dehydration or 3) after full rehydration.So far nothing unusual, but the difference between this and almost every other study that's ever been done on hydration was that the cyclists were blind to how much water they got. The fluid was given intravenously without them knowing the volume.This is vital because we all, and especially athletes, have such an intimate psychological relationship with water consumption.Remarkably, there was no performance difference between those that were fully rehydrated and those that got nothing. This study was part of a growing movement to "drink to thirst" which hopes to persuade athletes not to over hydrate with the potentially fatal consequence of diluting your sodium level, causing hyponatraemia.Perhaps the result shouldn't be so surprising. Humans evolved doing intense exercise in extreme heat and dryness. We are able to tolerate losses in water relatively well whereas even slight over hydration can be far more dangerous. In simple terms, being too watery is as bad for you as being too concentrated.But what about the rest of us who aren't cycling around the desert in Western Australia?There is a very well accepted idea that we should drink about eight cups of water per day (two to three litres) in addition to our food and other drinks.We are awash with positive messages about the healing properties of water and how it will improve everything from our brains to our bowels. And we know that without it we will die in days.It's a short leap of logic to think that if a lack of water is bad for for you then hydration must be good - purifying, cleansing water washing through your organs must be beneficial, detoxifying. It surely improves your skin, helps you think, reduces your risk of kidney stones and turns your urine a lovely light, straw/champagne colour rather than the fetid orange syrup you produce at the end of a long day where you haven't had time to drink.So I've looked through the literature and I found a review article saying all of this and more. It was written by a group of respected physicians from American and French hospitals and it clearly supported the widely held belief that you should drink two to three litres of water a day.It said that people with a high urine output have a lower rate of kidney stone disease, that the flushing action of the water may reduce the risk of a urinary tract infection (especially in women after sex). Perhaps most importantly, they referenced a surprising study which showed that paradoxically an increased intake of water increased the risk of bladder cancer. But only tap water. And there's the clue.A footnote at the end of the article explained that what you thought was a scientific article in a scientific journal is in fact a supplement, sponsored by a major mineral water manufacturer. All of the authors received honoraria from this company, which also provided medical writing assistance. So this isn't research, it's marketing.And this is one of the reasons we're even discussing this - because increasingly drinking water doesn't just come out of our taps for free. It's sold to us by the same clever people that sell us yoghurts with bacteria in them that probably don't do us much good, something I look at separately in the television series I've been making. And these companies pretty consistently recommend two to three litres of water per day.So where did that number come from and is there any reason to think it correct?Well the grain of truth is this - people in temperate climates who are not doing sustained physical exercise do need around six to eight cups per day but that can be contained in food, alcohol or caffeinated beverages.Yes, beer and coffee do not dehydrate you to any noticeable extent (there's a nice paper where some medical students got to drink quite a lot of beer and had their urine studied - British Medical Journal (Clin Res Ed), December 1982, Acute biochemical responses to moderate beer drinking, Gill GV).There is no evidence that adding the eight cups of water to everything else you drink will do you any good and it could do you harm (American Journal of Physiological - Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology, November 2002, Drink at least eight glasses of water a day. Really? Is there scientific evidence for "8x8"? Valtin H).But the great thing is that just like a top-level athlete you don't need to worry about exactly what that total daily requirement is because your body will sort it all out for you.If you drink too much you pee it out. If you drink too little you get thirsty and pee less. It's all exquisitely well-controlled in the same way that your intake of oxygen is well-controlled.Saying that you should drink more water than your body asks for is like saying that you should consciously breathe more often than you feel like because if a little oxygen is good for you then more must be better.Like most things in life there's a Goldilocks amount - not too little and not too much. With this in mind, next week I'll deal with the health benefits of porridge and how to avoid being eaten by bears.Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on FacebookTrust Me I'm a Doctor is broadcast on 10 October on BBC Two at 20:00 BST, or catch up with iPlayer</body>

      <title>Is altruism self-interest in disguise?</title>
      <description>Does it matter why we help others?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24457645</url>
      <date>1381360309</date>
      <body>Is altruism simply self-interest in disguise? And can a mathematical equation hope to answer the question?In 1968, an academic almost unknown in the UK walked into University College London and presented its staff with an equation so remarkable, that they offered him an honorary position and the keys to his own office.His name was George Price, and his equation addressed a problem that has vexed scientists since Charles Darwin published On The Origin of Species more than a century earlier. If we are selfish creatures, engaged in a battle for survival, why do we display altruism? Why do we show kindness to others even at a cost to ourselves?Price's equation explained how altruism could thrive, even amongst groups of selfish people.It built on the work of a number of other scientists, arguably beginning with JBS Haldane, a British biologist who developed a theory in the early 1950s. When asked if he would sacrifice his own life to save that of another, he said that he would, but only under certain conditions. "I would lay down my life for two brothers, or eight cousins."Haldane's reasoning was a simplistic explanation of a theory that has come to dominate evolutionary biology - that of "kin selection".Since he would share 50% of each brother's genetic makeup, and 12.5% of each cousin's, his genes would survive even if he were to die.It took until the early 1960s for another scientist, William Donald Hamilton, to popularise the theory. He wrote a simple equation to explain that an organism would demonstrate self-sacrificing behaviour if it would enhance the reproductive chances of those it was closely related to.In 1967 Price arrived in London from the United States, where he had been a scientist and journalist, but with no background in the field of evolutionary biology.He discovered Hamilton's theory in a public library and thought he could improve upon it. Working in seclusion, he rewrote the equation in a simpler but more wide-reaching way. It explained the relationship between different generations of a population, and could be used to show how the prevalence of particular traits would change over time.Although it was a fairly simple statement, it had never been expressed in clear mathematical terms, and the staff at the University College London recognised his insight as wildly original.A debate about the scientific roots of altruism still rages to this day, but kin selection remains a hugely influential theory, and Price's contribution is held in high regard by many."It underpins a lot of modern evolutionary biology research," says Andy Gardner, an evolutionary biologist at Oxford University, who uses the Price Equation in much of his work.Oren Harman, who wrote Price's biography in 2010, says the view is shared by plenty of people in the field."Although there are those who fail to see the precise use of the equation, others think of it as the most simple and brilliant description of the dynamics of natural selection."But Price began to find the implications of his work very difficult to deal with, according to Harman. If altruism was simply an attempt to ensure the survival of one's own genes, could it be considered altruism at all?Lee Dugatkin, professor of Biology at the University of Louisville, thinks it was this thought that triggered a major change in Price. "That was what got him going," he says. "He was so depressed when he found out that Hamilton was right."In the summer of 1970, Price became a devout Christian and embarked on a radical project - giving himself over to the service of others."He was going to go out to try and show that human beings are the only species that can beat out their own nature. And he was going to do that by becoming a pure selfless altruist," says Harman.Price began giving money to homeless people, and invited many of them to live with him in his flat near Oxford Circus. His increasingly erratic behaviour left him penniless. He left his flat and eventually moved into a squat in Kentish Town.It is not universally agreed that Price's equation triggered his downfall - he was undoubtedly suffering from some form of mental illness as well. And in the winter of 1975, Price took his own life.For Harman, the two are inextricably linked. "I think the fact that George killed himself due to his interpretation of the equation really focuses the problem to the utmost degree."Price's story is laced with tragedy, but need his scientific work imply a dark, depressing view of human nature?Samir Okasha, professor of the philosophy of science at Bristol University, thinks not. "The idea that what evolutionary theory shows is that altruism is self-interest in disguise is, to my mind, a questionable thing to say."Behaviour in some animal species is indeed genetically determined, he says, but with humans "that certainly isn't the case". He argues that culture sets us apart from animals in that respect, and points to the huge variance in social norms in different countries, and over short periods of time."We have seen rather dramatic change over, say, a 300-year period, which cannot be explained by genetics," he says.Harman also disagrees with Price's interpretation of his own work. "It is not a necessary logical conclusion. It was his own conclusion, the conclusion of a troubled mind, but it's what led him to a terrible realisation that there is no true kindness in the world."If we want to understand behaviour, biology is part of it - it has to be by definition. But that's never an entire and complete explanation for the complexity and grandeur of the human condition."Gardner thinks it is always possible to think of people as attempting to protect and reproduce their own genetic material. "But that's not necessarily always selfish," he says. "There's room for altruism in that logic."Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <body>The average Briton gets six-and-a-half hours' sleep a night, according to the Sleep Council. Michael Mosley took part in an unusual experiment to see if this is enough.It has been known for some time that the amount of sleep people get has, on average, declined over the years.This has happened for a whole range of reasons, not least because we live in a culture where people are encouraged to think of sleep as a luxury - something you can easily cut back on. After all, that's what caffeine is for - to jolt you back into life. But while the average amount of sleep we are getting has fallen, rates of obesity and diabetes have soared. Could the two be connected?We wanted to see what the effect would be of increasing average sleep by just one hour. So we asked seven volunteers, who normally sleep anywhere between six and nine hours, to be studied at the University of Surrey's Sleep Research Centre.The volunteers were randomly allocated to two groups. One group was asked to sleep for six-and-a-half hours a night, the other got seven-and-a-half hours. After a week the researchers took blood tests and the volunteers were asked to switch sleep patterns. The group that had been sleeping six-and-a-half hours got an extra hour, the other group slept an hour less.While we were waiting to see what effect this would have, I went to the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford to learn more about what actually happens when we sleep.In the Sleep Centre, they fitted me up with a portable electro-encephalograph, a device that measures brain wave activity. Then, feeling slightly ridiculous, I went home and had my seven-and-a-half hours of sleep.The following day I went to discuss what had happened inside my head during the night with Dr Katharina Wulff.The first thing she pointed out was that I had very rapidly fallen into a state of deep sleep. Deep sleep sounds restful, but during it our brains are actually working hard. One of the main things the brain is doing is moving memories from short-term storage into long-term storage, allowing us more short-term memory space for the next day. If you don't get adequate deep sleep then these memories will be lost.You might think: "I'll cut back during the week and then make up for it at the weekend." Unfortunately it doesn't work like that, because memories need to be consolidated within 24 hours of being formed.Since deep sleep is so important for consolidating memories it is a good idea if you are revising or perhaps taking an exam to make sure that you're getting a reasonable night's sleep. In one study, people who failed to do so did 40% worse than their contemporaries.Deep sleep only lasts for a few hours. My electrode results showed that during the night my brain went through multiple phases of another kind of activity, called REM sleep."This is the phase when you are usually paralysed - so you can't move," Wulff explained. But the eye muscles are not paralysed, and that's why it's called rapid eye movement sleep."During REM sleep an extraordinary thing happens. One of the stress-related chemicals in the brain, noradrenalin, is switched off. It's the only time, day or night, this happens. It allows us to remain calm while our brains reprocess all the experiences of the day, helping us come to terms with particularly emotional events.We get more REM sleep in the last half of the night. Which means that if you are woken unexpectedly, your brain may not have dealt with all your emotions - which could leave you stressed and anxious. Drinking alcohol late at night is not a good idea as it reduces your REM sleep while it's being processed in your body.Back at the University of Surrey our sleep volunteers had finished their second week of the experiment. What we wanted to see was the effect switching from six-and-a-half hours to seven-and-a-half hours, or vice versa, would have on our volunteers.Computer tests revealed that most of them struggled with mental agility tasks when they had less sleep, but the most interesting results came from the blood tests that were run.Dr Simon Archer and his team at Surrey University were particularly interested in looking at the genes that were switched on or off in our volunteers by changes in the amount that we had made them sleep."We found that overall there were around 500 genes that were affected," Archer explained. "Some which were going up, and some which were going down."What they discovered is that when the volunteers cut back from seven-and-a-half to six-and-a-half hours' sleep a night, genes that are associated with processes like inflammation, immune response and response to stress became more active. The team also saw increases in the activity of genes associated with diabetes and risk of cancer. The reverse happened when the volunteers added an hour of sleep.So the clear message from this experiment was that if you are getting less than seven hours' sleep a night and can alter your sleep habits, even just a little bit, it could make you healthier. "Have a lie-in, it will do you good" - that's the kind of health message that doesn't come along very often.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on FacebookTrust Me I'm a Doctor is broadcast on 10 October on BBC Two at 20:00 BST, or catch up with iPlayer</body>

      <title>What's behind the idea of banning 10-packs of cigarettes?</title>
      <description>Why are packs of 10 cigarettes being banned?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24441618</url>
      <date>1381251231</date>
      <body>Euro MPs have voted to ban the sale of packs of 10 cigarettes as part of a general tightening of the law. Why?Public health campaigners are now focusing some of their effort on trying to reduce the number of young people taking up smoking.In the UK, cigarettes are commonly sold in shops in either packs of 10 or 20. But in much of the rest of the EU the smaller pack size is banned.Fourteen EU states already have 20 as the minimum, four stipulate a minimum of 19, and in the UK and Italy the minimum is 10. Now, if the draft directive passes its final stages 10-packs will be illegal across the EU.The health campaigners describe packets of 10 as "kiddy packs" because they argue they are more affordable out of pocket money. Official figures estimate that 4% of children in England between the ages of 11-15 years old are smoking at least once a week."The thing we know about the pricing of cigarettes is that if the price is kept high through taxation that that works as a measure to help smokers to quit and also as a deterrent to young people," says Amanda Sandford research manager at Action on Smoking and Health (ASH)."If the minimum size of pack people can buy is 20 they are going to have to fork out at least £6 and £8 for a premium brand."The Republic of Ireland changed the law to make the minimum pack size 20 in 2007. Research in the run-up to the ban had suggested three-quarters of young people who smoked bought 10-packs.The number of smokers in the 10-17-year-old age group fell from 21.2% in 1998 to 18.6% in 2002, 15.3% in 2006 and 12% in 2010.But the 10-pack ban was just one of a catalogue of anti-smoking measures including a ban on in-store display and advertising, restrictions on self-service vending machines. Enhanced warnings on packets and higher prices came later.Campaign group Forest, which describes itself as "the voice and friend of the smoker", says around two million people in the UK buy their cigarettes in packs of 10, because that's what they can afford, or they want to cut down. It argues that forcing people to buy bigger packets of 20 won't help reduce smoking.But campaigners argue that tobacco displays have used 10-packs prominently to make cigarettes seem cheaper, thereby drawing in younger smokers. A number of brands in the UK also sell 14-packs which again have been attacked by campaigners."Newsagents were stopped from selling single cigarettes many years ago by law because they are accessible to children," says Sandford. "A 10-pack is within the pocket money range."There is an argument that someone cutting down might be helped by the availability of smaller packs, but Sandford argues that smaller packs also provide an easier route for a lapsing person to return to smoking.Reporting by Branwen Jeffreys and Finlo Rohrer.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Is 'addiction' an excuse to overeat?</title>
      <description>Is it helpful to label 'food addiction' an illness?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24402163</url>
      <date>1381109365</date>
      <body>"Food addiction" is becoming a popular term to explain overeating. But in this Scrubbing Up, Professor John Blundell from the Institute of Psychological Sciences at the University of Leeds warns the term is being used far too freely.Some have likened food addiction to drug addiction, and then used this term to associate it with overeating, and as a clinical explanation for the obesity epidemic, implicating millions of people.The use of the term food addiction is a step towards medicalisation and implies that normal human social behaviour is pathological.Forms of eating therefore become an illness. This attitude is not helpful and has huge implications for the way in which people view their own behaviour and their lives.The concept of food addiction comes from a combination of experimental data, anecdotal observations, scientific claims, personal opinions, deductions and beliefs.It is an over-simplification of a very complex set of behaviours.The existing evidence fails to define the precise characteristics of the actual foods concerned or the eating environment that underlies the assumed addiction risk.This is in contrast to drug addiction, where the molecule is identified and its pharmacological effect on the brain is characterised.Animal studies have shown changes to specific brain regions in those given a sugary diet - and human brain scans show activation of reward systems in the same part of the brain when sweet tastes are consumed.Therefore, it is not surprising that reward centres are activated when sweet foods are consumed, as we know that the reward circuits in the brain have been established through evolution as signalling systems that control our appetite.Many stimuli influence these areas of the brain and, in addition, there is an intrinsic drive to consume carbohydrate-rich foods to satisfy a basic metabolic need of the brain.Sweetness is a major signal for such foods but the science has not yet assessed this fully and much more work is needed before we could say that food is addictive.Attributing food addiction as the single cause underlying the development of obesity, despite the existence of numerous other very plausible explanations, is unhelpful, particularly for those trying to live more healthy lives.I am concerned that many people may potentially latch on to the concept of food addiction as an excuse to explain their overeating - the premise that it's "not my fault" and therefore, "I can't help it".This removes the personal responsibility they should feel and could act on - and they infer that their eating is a form of disease.Food addiction may offer an appealing explanation for some people but the concept could seriously hinder an individual's capacity for personal control.Binge eating disorder does exist - but it is a rare clinical condition affecting fewer than 3% of obese people.Sufferers have a strong compulsion to eat, which persists alongside the sense of a loss of control.Addiction-like food behaviour may be a component of the severe and compulsive form of binge eating disorder.But this condition does not explain the huge rise in obesity we have seen across the population.Binge eating is not a key cause of obesity and, therefore, in the context of mass public health, is not a major concern.What we need is a calm and composed analysis of what the words food addiction really mean so that people can make informed deductions about the causes of their own behaviour.If you are concerned that you may have an eating disorder and would like to speak with someone about it, you could contact the charity beat on 08456341414.</body>

      <title>Face blindness: Seeing but not seeing</title>
      <description>What is it like to live with face blindness?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24385650</url>
      <date>1381047931</date>
      <body>Imagine that suddenly you cannot recognise your mother, your partner, your child. You can see them but your brain cannot process the information - you don't know whether they are smiling, or understand their emotions.That is what happened to David Bromley, after he suffered a brain injury that left him with face blindness.David has prosopagnosia. People with this condition can see the eyes, the nose, and the mouth, what is known as the context - but they cannot see them as a whole. They do not recognise gestures or emotions."I can even recognise my wife if I walk into the house and know that she is there," says David."But if I'm in the street and she passes by and I don't know that she is going to be there, I wouldn't recognise her."David, who lives in Essex, had unknowingly been living with eye damage since birth - the arteries and veins were mixed up. This eventually caused a partial loss of sight and damage in the brain which caused the prosopagnosia.Perhaps the most difficult aspect of this condition is that people do not notice right away that something is wrong with them.He remembers when he realised there was a problem."I went to a reunion where I saw friends that I hadn't seen for 30 years. We were pretty close but we went our separate ways."On the way home, he told his brother-in-law: "'Fran and Mickey haven't changed a bit, they are exactly the same!'. And then I said 'hold on, were they wearing tank tops?'"What David was seeing was his memory of their friends back then. "My brain was telling me that there they were and what they looked like, but that wasn't the reality".After that, he discovered he was face blind.There are two main forms of prosopagnosia; developmental - where people fail to develop face processing abilities which is thought to affect around 2% of the population, and acquired, which develops after some form of brain injury and is much rarer.Dr Ashok Jansari, a cognitive neuropsychology expert from the University of East London said: "Acquired prosopagnosia is extremely rare because the type of brain damage is very specific,."It can be caused by damage to the back of the brain on the right-hand side in an area known generally as the right occipito-temporal region."David said: "I don't know what's worse - not being able to ever recognise people or at 56 years old - as it happened to me - suddenly not being able to recognise anybody".He added that the worst part is the social embarrassment."We were on holiday in Cuba and I'd been snorkelling in the sea. I was talking with this guy from Denmark, when this woman swam up and said 'buenos dias' and I went 'hello, pleased to meet you', thinking it was his wife, but it was actually my wife and I hadn't recognised her."David can see people perfectly well - but 10 or 15 minutes later he cannot recognise them.He now tells clients: "If I ignore you, I'm not being rude, it is just that I can't recognise you."Sandra, from London, who only wants to give her first name, is also afraid of social embarrassment.She had encephalitis - inflammation of the brain - 14 years ago, which left her with face blindness.Even though her prosopagnosia is mild - she can recognise people she knew before her illness - she would rather not let people know because she does not want anyone to think she has some sort of incapacity."Life with prosopagnosia is very shameful," she says.She is teacher and at work almost nobody knows that she is face blind."If I see someone every day, I can recognise them. But if one of the children says hi to me on the street, I would know it is a student from the school, but I wouldn't know who."I don't say anything to the children, I just work every day to learn their faces."But she says: "Perhaps the reason why I don't mention it is because I don't want them to think that I cannot do my job, because that's not true. I don't want to feel ashamed or that people think that there is something wrong with me."Dr Jansari understands the feelings and fears of David and Sandra.He knows of cases in which people have lost their jobs because of the condition - including a teacher who had difficulty recognising pupils, causing problems when parents came to pick up their children at the end of the day,Even though prosopagnosia is not recognised as a disability, Dr Jansari thinks it should be treated as such in some cases.This condition has no cure. "In the case of acquired prosopagnosia, once a part of the brain is damaged it is not going to 'grow' back, so it is impossible to fix the problem," he said."With developmental prosopagnosia, we don't know what causes it, but hypothetically in the future if they find that there is a genetic cause, that could be corrected - but that would be a very long way off."Even though people develop strategies to cope - because people change their appearance, they are not foolproof.Dr Jansari says: "Once David thought that a photograph he saw was of George Michael but it was of me, from a time when I used to have a goatee beard and a gold earring!"</body>

      <title>Awake under the knife</title>
      <description>Can you be conscious but feel no pain under the knife?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24357476</url>
      <date>1380930754</date>
      <body>Having a general anaesthetic is a routine part of many operations. But what happens if you are still conscious after you close your eyes?You are in the operating theatre. Anaesthetic has been administered and the countdown to unconsciousness begins.For most people, the next thing they will remember is being roused from a deep sleep.But in a small minority of cases, complete unconsciousness never comes.Being awake during surgery and not being able to do anything about it is every patient's worst nightmare.But according to one of the country's leading anaesthetists, it may not be as simple as saying that someone is either asleep or awake.Prof Jaideep Pandit, consultant anaesthetist at the Oxford University Hospitals, believes there is an alternative "third state" of consciousness somewhere between sleeping and waking that patients under general anaesthetic can and do experience."I call it dysanaesthesia," he explains. "A type of awareness where the patient is aware of the surgery but is neither conscious nor unconscious."Despite being used around the world on a daily basis, no-one is exactly sure how a general anaesthetic acts upon the body.Anaesthesia is a complicated business requiring many years of training and a proper understanding of which drugs to give, and how much.However in general, a patient can be expected to receive an anaesthetic to make them unconscious and a painkiller to numb the pain.A specialist doctor will then monitor a whole host of measurements throughout the operation to make sure that the patient really is out for the count.Even so, in an estimated 1 in 15,000 surgeries patients experience what is known as accidental awareness where they remember aspects of their surgery after waking. Around a third of those will feel pain.The question whether someone is conscious or not is mind-bogglingly complex.But Professor Pandit is investigating something that goes one step further - a twilight state that lies between conscious and unconscious states - and one that his experiments show happens much more frequently than accidental awareness.He has been able to show this through the use of something known as the Isolated Forearm Technique.Before the advent of carefully calibrated monitoring equipment, anaesthetists were able to use this technique during surgery to check whether someone was fully unconscious.The method uses a tourniquet to prevent any muscle relaxants from paralysing the forearm. This means that if the patient becomes conscious during surgery, they can move their arm to alert the surgeon.Professor Pandit has used the technique to show some fascinating aspects to human awareness.In repeated tests, one third of patients who are seemingly unconscious are able to squeeze the experimenter's fingers on command using their non-paralysed forearm. But none of them will move spontaneously to show that they are awake or in pain during surgery."To all extents and purposes, these patients are unconscious," says Prof Pandit. "But they are clearly in a state where they can respond to some stimuli like verbal commands but not to others like the surgery, possibly because they are not distressed by it."According to Prof Pandit, this suggests there is a third level of consciousness.But analysing the concept remains extremely difficult."Mainly when patients come round they will have no recall of the event or if they do they do it's just vague memories. They're unable to remember anything with clarity," he told the BBC.One way doctors frequently explain general anaesthesia to patients is to compare it to being asleep. But that is technically inaccurate says Dr Emory Brown, a professor of anaesthesia at Harvard Medical School."What we need to do to safely and humanely operate on you - to perform a procedure which is indeed, very invasive and certainly traumatic - is to put you in a state which is a coma that we can readily reverse," he told the BBC.This coma-like condition potentially protects the patient from pain and memory of the surgery. But it also helps the surgeons to operate by keeping the patient still and maintaining bodily functions at a stable level.However, what's happening in the brain as it slips from conscious into unconsciousness is still uncertain.In 2011, a research team at Manchester University were able to watch for the first time the effects on a human brain as it lost consciousness under anaesthetic.Using a novel method of brain imaging, they were able to construct real-time 3D images of the brain - rather than the 2D slices of standard brain scans.It enabled them to see how electrical activity in the brain changed as the patients went under.Interestingly, activity in the brain appeared to hot up as the patient became unconscious. This suggests that rather than switching off, the brain works hard to dampen down or inhibit consciousness while they are under the influence of anaesthetic.But scientists are still a long way off from understanding the impact on the brain as unconsciousness occurs."We are still unable at this time to define what human consciousness is, so trying to find a box of tricks that's going to monitor its absence is difficult," says Dr Kevin Fong, a consultant in anaesthesia at University College London Hospitals."But awareness during anaesthesia is something we've learnt to guard against through layers and layers of monitoring. We check surrogates of awareness such as heart rate, blood pressure and rates of respiration, and also constantly monitor the exact concentration of drugs in the blood."Indeed having memory of your surgery is one of the most important complications that both anaesthetists and patients wish to avoid.Although a national survey this year found the risk of waking up under the knife was extremely low, the effects for patients who do experience it can be acutely traumatic.For Prof Pandit, the ultimate aim of understanding human unconsciousness is to prevent such episodes from occurring."The risk of experiencing pain or distress during accidental awareness is very low at around 1 in 45,000," he explains. "But when it does happen it can have a very bad effect on the individual.""So it's not just the numbers that are driving us to research dysanaesthesia, but also the impact."</body>

      <body>A two-year-old girl born with a condition which means her brain forgets to tell her to breathe is about to leave hospital for the first time.Maisie Harris from Gillingham, Kent has been at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London since being transferred from Medway Maritime at three months old.She has congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), also known as Ondine's Curse.A new, portable ventilator has enabled Maisie to go home.The machine knows when she is able to take her own breaths and when she is likely to have a CCHS episode and require support.It has batteries and a carry case, so Maisie, who is three on 23 October, will be able to go on outings with her family and go to school when she is older.Staff on Great Ormond Street's Miffy Ward held a party for her on Friday, before she leaves hospital on Monday."We cannot wait to bring Maisie home and enjoy being a normal family," said her mother Rachel Bridger, 23."It's felt as though we have been in hospital for a lifetime."Everyone here has become like a second family to us - they know Maisie inside out."She knows her own mind but she is a really happy little girl - she's hardly ever upset."I don't think it will take her long to get used to playing with her toys at home and sleeping in her own bed for the first time."Maisie, who featured in BBC2's Great Ormond Street series last year, also has malacia of the airways, so her airways are floppy like the top of a balloon and do not hold their shape properly.Consultant Colin Wallis said: "We have been working on ways to allow a greater number of long-term ventilated children to go home."The family home is the best place for a young child to grow and develop, and Maisie will now be able to go out and about with her family, make new friends and experience everything the outside world has to offer."Dr Wallis treated Ms Bridger when she was younger. She also has CCHS, although her condition is less complex.She and Maisie's father Andrew Harris, 26, have been trained on how to use her ventilator and will be supported by a team of local carers.</body>

      <title>More energy price rises expected</title>
      <description>Consumer groups predict that the UK's other major energy suppliers will raise prices after SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24475868</url>
      <date>1381419415</date>
      <body>Consumer groups are predicting that the UK's other major energy suppliers will raise prices after SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills.SSE said its average annual dual fuel energy bill would rise by £106 to £1,380 on 15 November.One industry expert described the move as "the final nail in the coffin for affordable energy", but SSE said that many costs were beyond its control.The decision prompted fevered political debate over who to blame for the rise.Citizens Advice is expecting an "avalanche" of increases but has called on the other energy firms to freeze prices."This price rise will be a blow for stretched budgets," said the charity's chief executive Gillian Guy."I hope other energy firms show an understanding of their customers' financial situation by not raising their prices this winter."Many households are facing a daily battle try to make their frozen incomes cover mounting energy, food and travel costs. Further increases will push people into poverty."SSE said that 8.2% was an average rise. Customers in the North of England and central Scotland would see the smallest increase, of 7%, in their dual fuel price. Customers in the South East of England would see the biggest, up 9.7%.It added that the rise reflected higher costs of buying wholesale energy and paying to deliver it to customers' homes, plus government levies.The move has amplified political debate about the issue of energy bills.Labour leader Ed Miliband, who pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election, described SSE's price rise as a "scandal". He accused the government of "letting energy companies get away with this".But Prime Minister David Cameron branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas.SSE's price rises will affect about 4.4 million domestic electricity customers and 2.9 million domestic gas customers.One of those customers is Gary Waywell, from Somerset, who has been a SSE customer for eight years.He said he was surprised by the size of the price rise and angry at the timing just before winter."I can hardly go to my boss and say, 'would you mind giving me an extra £16 a week for the winter. I don't think he is going to smile at that," he said.SSE's Will Morris said he understood customers' frustration."We're sorry we have to do this," he said."We've done as much as we could to keep prices down, but the reality is that buying wholesale energy in global markets, delivering it to customers' homes, and government-imposed levies collected through bills - endorsed by all the major parties - all cost more than they did last year."SSE, made up of Southern Electric, Swalec and Scottish Hydro, said that for a typical dual-fuel customer, wholesale energy prices had gone up 4%, paying to use delivery networks was 10% more expensive, and government levies were 13% higher.Up to 11% of a customer's bill goes on government programmes to save energy, reduce emissions and tackle climate change, according to regulator Ofgem. SSE said it wanted this to be included in general taxation, rather than added to bills.However, Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: "Half of an average energy bill is made up of the wholesale cost of energy. This far outweighs the proportion of a bill that goes to help vulnerable households with their bills and to cut energy waste."SSE's announcement comes about a year after the last set of gas and electricity price rises.Between August and December 2012, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%.Ann Robinson, from price comparison website Uswitch, which could benefit from consumers swapping suppliers, said: "This is a crippling blow for consumers, who are still reeling from last winter's price hike. Adding to an already sky-high energy bill will leave consumers buckling under the pressure. It's the final nail in the coffin for affordable energy."Of course the danger now is that the other big six suppliers will follow suit. This raises the spectre of yet more households forced to cut back on their heating."The latest calculations from the regulator found that the average profit margin made by an energy supplier on an average £1,315 bill is £65.SSE, formerly Scottish and Southern Energy, said it expected its annual profit margin to average about 5% over a three-to-five-year period, which it believed was "a fair amount".It said its profit margin was 4.2% in the 2012-13 financial year and was expected to fall short of the 5% target again this year."We know we will come in for a great deal of criticism for this decision and politicians will no doubt be lining up to condemn us," said SSE's Mr Morris."But over many years, policymakers themselves have failed to highlight adequately the cost to consumers of the policies they have pursued in government."They can't expect to have power stations replaced with new technologies, the network to be upgraded and nationwide energy efficiency schemes all to be funded for free."And as an energy provider, we are in the unenviable position of having to pass this cost on to consumers through energy bills."The BBC understands that the government is prepared to look at easing green taxes on smaller energy companies. These costs include paying for measures to save energy, reduce emissions and tackle climate change, and also include the cost of social programmes to help vulnerable customers.At present, companies with 250,000 customers are liable to pay the green levy.This threshold could be changed in order to encourage smaller energy companies to enter the market and challenge the big six. Only three smaller energy firms are operating in the UK at the moment.</body>

      <body>US Republicans have offered President Barack Obama a short-term debt limit increase to stave off default.House Speaker John Boehner said they would do so in exchange for wider negotiations with the White House to end a government shutdown that took effect on 1 October.Republicans will meet Mr Obama later on Thursday.Officials have warned the US will risk default on 17 October if the nation's borrowing limit is not increased.Mr Boehner said on Thursday: "What we want to do is to offer the president today the ability to move a temporary increase in the debt ceiling in agreement to go to conference on the budget for his willingness to sit down and discuss with us a way forward to reopen the government."A spokesman for Mr Boehner told reporters that the deal on the table ahead of Thursday afternoon's meeting was a "clean" increase of the debt limit, with no additional policies attached.But it would only last six weeks - until November 22.On Wednesday, Mr Obama met House Democrats at the White House and told them he would prefer a longer-term increase of one year to the nation's $16.69 trillion (£10.47 trillion) debt ceiling.But the president said he was willing to accept a short-term rise in the borrowing cap to "give Boehner some time to deal with the Tea Party wing of his party", Representative Peter Welch told the Associated Press news agency after the meeting.Earlier, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told a congressional panel the US could not prioritise between its payment obligations once borrowing was exhausted.Mr Lew warned lawmakers the government could miss pension and healthcare payments for the elderly as well as military salaries.And a missing payment on US debt would trigger a potentially more profound financial crisis, he warned."This system was not designed to be turned off selectively," Mr Lew told a Senate hearing. "It would be chaos."</body>

      <title>Royal Mail sale: Small bids favoured</title>
      <description>Investors who applied for £750 worth of Royal Mail shares will receive their full allocation, the BBC has learned.</description>

      <body>Small investors will be favoured in the privatisation of the Royal Mail, at the expense of those seeking a large allocation, the BBC has learned.Anyone who subscribed for the minimum entitlement of £750 will receive 100% of their application, according to BBC business editor Robert Peston.But those who have applied for £10,000 worth of shares or more, will not receive any, he said.Demand for Royal Mail shares far outstripped the supply.Robert Peston said: "A government source said to me that ministers wanted to reward the Mrs Migginses, but not the big professional investors."Royal Mail's shares will be priced at 330p, which is at the top end of what the government was hoping for and values the entire Royal Mail at £3.3bn.Shares were initially priced between 260p and 330p, but strong demand led the government to revise the figures upwards on Friday last week.There were more than 700,000 individual applications for shares, which far outstripped the value of shares available.Retail investors could apply for up to £10,000 worth of Royal Mail shares online, but could bid for a much bigger allocation if they applied through a stock broker.But the government has decided to favour more modest investors and any applications seeking more than £10,000 worth of shares will receive none.The applications indicate that individual investors had about £4bn to spend on Royal Mail shares, which is much more than the £517m worth of shares on offer.Applications for shares from professional investors also far outstripped the amount allocated to them.Our business editor says that combined, individual and professional investors may have had £15bn available to invest.He also said that individual investors could be allotted as much as 33% of the total shares on offer, up from the original amount of 30%, while professional investors could expect their share to be reduced slightly to 67%.The government will sell 52.2% of the company, the maximum it was prepared to sell at this stage, he adds.That puts the value for the Treasury of the privatisation at £1.7bn.Full trading in Royal Mail shares begins next Tuesday on the London Stock Exchange.However, investors have been able to speculate on the value of Royal Mail ahead of the official start of trading on what is known as the grey market.Financial bookmaker IG Index says that, as of Thursday morning, orders placed by its clients indicate Royal Mail shares could be worth between 405p and 425p each.However, that is just an indication and the market may react differently next week.Under the terms of the share sale, a 10% stake in the business has been reserved for Royal Mail employees.Members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) are voting on whether to strike over the government's privatisation plan.The ballot closes on 16 October and strike action could begin as early as 23 October.Royal Mail says the fundraising will provide it with the money needed to modernise and compete in a competitive parcels market.Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna criticised the government on Monday for "short-changing" taxpayers.In particular, Labour says the privatisation may be undervaluing Royal Mail's property, some of which is in prime locations.However, on Wednesday, Business Secretary Vince Cable told a parliamentary committee: "We're confident that it's priced in the right place".</body>

      <title>BT in mobile network deal with EE</title>

      <body>Telecoms giant BT has signed a deal with mobile phone operator EE to use its network to provide mobile services.The deal paves the way for a return to the consumer mobile phone market for BT, which disposed of its BT Cellnet network in 2001.It will also allow it to offer mobile services alongside its existing offer of landline, internet and TV - the so-called "quad-play" market.EE operates the Orange and T-Mobile brands in the UK.EE, formerly called Everything Everywhere, is a joint venture between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom.It runs the UK's biggest mobile network, including 4G services, which it pioneered in the UK in 2012.BT said the deal was a "multi-year agreement, subject to final contract". It gave no details of how much the deal was worth or exactly how long it would last.Up to now, BT has been providing corporate mobile services thanks to a tie-up with Vodafone, but that agreement has come to an end after Vodafone bought Cable and Wireless Worldwide.In August, BT expanded its TV offer by launching its own UK sports channels.</body>

      <title>Ofcom price hike alarms mobile firms</title>
      <description>Mobile networks left "disappointed" as Ofcom proposes quadrupled licence fees, leading to concerns the cost may be passed on to consumers.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24475802</url>
      <date>1381406086</date>
      <body>Mobile network operators may have to pay more than four times the current amount to use the radio spectrum, under new proposals from Ofcom.The regulator said the new licensing fees reflected market value based on other European countries.Operators told the BBC the increase was "excessive". Vodafone said it was "disappointed".Some analysts have raised concerns the increased costs might be passed on to the public."The size of these figures may come as bad news to the mobile networks, but more worryingly could sound alarm bells for consumers," said Adam Kirby, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com."The proposed new costs reflect a huge leap in the amount networks will have to pay the regulator for using the spectrum - our concern is that it will be consumers who are left to foot the bill."However, the good news for concerned consumers is that no increases have been confirmed as yet - Ofcom are now consulting on the fees. It remains to be seen how much these costs will actually rise, and if the networks can fight back and keep a lid on these increases."An Ofcom spokesman told the BBC that while it had no control over how much operators charged customers, it did not expect the rise to have an impact on bills.In an advisory note, financial services firm JP Morgan said it expected the competitiveness of the mobile market would stop costs being passed down.However, operators contacted by the BBC expressed concern that the rise had been higher than they had budgeted for.The affected companies - Vodafone, O2, EE and Three - each told the BBC that they would respond to Ofcom's announcement in due course.EE said it would aim to stress that "there must be a balance between licence fees and the critical 4G network investment consumers and businesses are demanding to drive growth and jobs for the UK economy".Vodafone criticised Ofcom, saying: "We are disappointed that Ofcom is proposing a 430% increase in the fees we pay for our existing spectrum at a time when we are investing more than ever in vital national digital infrastructure."The regulator should be encouraging such private sector investment in infrastructure and new services like 4G, which will benefit consumers, businesses and the wider British economy for many years to come."Prices for the 900Mhz and 1800Mhz spectrum bands were set when it was used for 2G services several years ago. Ofcom has since "liberated" the spectrum - the term given when a certain band is freed up for different purposes.In this case, it meant that operators could use the bands for higher-speed services such as 4G.In 2010, the government instructed Ofcom to revisit the cost of the licences for 900Mhz and 1800Mhz which - in comparison with other equivalent services across the EU - were considered to be very cheap.The new prices will see Vodafone and O2's individual fees rise from £15.6m to £83.1m. EE will pay £107.1m, up from £24.9m, and Three will go from £8.3m to £35.7m.The increase comes at a time when operators are facing a drop in income via calls made while customers are overseas. The European Union is pressing hard for far lower roaming costs in a bid to reduce so-called "bill shock".A source at one of the affected operators said he expected operators would now engage in a tug of war with Ofcom to see the proposed amounts lowered.In response, the regulator said: "It's a consultation - we welcome the views of our stakeholders. Nothing's final at this stage."They've been expecting this for some time and we've based our proposed annual license fees on market value."Ofcom also dismissed the suggestion that the price hike is in response to a lower-than-expected return from the recent auction of 4G spectrum, which took place earlier in the year.That sale raised £2.3bn - less than the £3.5bn expected by the Office for Budget Responsibility.The shortfall is being investigated by the National Audit Office, which expects to publish its findings early next year.Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC.</body>

      <title>UK interest rates held at 0.5%</title>
      <description>The Bank of England decides to keep interest rates at a record 0.5% low and makes no change to its monetary stimulus.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24471495</url>
      <date>1381404300</date>
      <body>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has again voted to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5%.It has kept the key borrowing rate at that level since March 2009.The MPC also said it would make no change to the £375bn of monetary stimulus it is providing through its quantitative easing (QE) programme.Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said that before interest rates can rise, the unemployment rate needs to fall below 7%.That stipulation is part of Mr Carney's policy of giving forward guidance.The idea is to create more certainty for businesses and individuals about the course of interest rates, which may encourage borrowing and investment.He has forecast that it will take about three years for unemployment to reach his target.However, there has been speculation that rates may start to go up sooner, given recent indications of healthier prospects for the UK economy.On Wednesday, the International Monetary Fund lifted its UK growth projection for this year from 0.9% to 1.4%."The bar for any more QE now looks to be very high," said Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight."It will likely only occur if the economy loses substantial momentum over the coming months, or if there is major financial turmoil and a sharp upward move in market interest rates when the US Federal Reserve finally starts to taper."Our central scenario is that neither of these events will happen, but neither can be ruled out."David Tinsley of BNP Paribas said the decision came as no surprise."Overall, UK monetary policy settings for now are on auto-pilot, barring the US debt ceiling debate getting very messy," he said."Even on an optimistic basis, the UK labour market is not going to deliver an unemployment rate at 7% for six to 12 months at the very earliest, while inflationary pressures are under control."And the Bank has made fairly clear that while it is monitoring house price developments, it is not about to adjust monetary policy in response to those."So for now, forward guidance is delivering the sort of boring certainty the new governor was after."</body>

      <title>Fresh glitches hit Boeing Dreamliner</title>
      <description>Japan Airlines says it has turned around two of its Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft during flights due to technical problems.</description>

      <date>1381393413</date>
      <body>Japan Airlines (JAL) says it has turned around two of its Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft during flights due to technical problems.On one plane one of the two anti-ice systems, which prevent ice building up around the engine, failed.Meanwhile, an electrical glitch made six toilets unusable on another flight.These are the latest technical issues to hit the Dreamliner, which saw the entire fleet being grounded earlier this year following battery problems.The anti-icing system failed on a Tokyo-bound flight that took off from San Diego.A spokesperson for JAL told the BBC that a similar issue had forced a Tokyo-to-Singapore flight to be turned back in June this year.Meanwhile, an electrical system failure connected to the lavatories affected a flight from Moscow to Tokyo.The failure resulted in six of the seven toilets on the plane not being able to flush.The airline said that it was looking into the problems.The 787 Dreamliner has suffered a series of technical and safety problems in recent months.In January, its entire fleet was temporarily grounded. That move was prompted after a fire broke out on one of JAL's Dreamliners, and an All Nippon Airways (ANA) flight was forced to make an emergency landing because of a battery fault and a fire in one of the electrical compartments.Though the planes have since been allowed back into the air, other issues have emerged.In July, a fire broke out on a 787 jet operated by Ethiopian Airlines while it was parked at Heathrow airport. It was traced to the upper rear part of the plane where a locator transmitter is located.Then in August, ANA said it had found damage to the battery wiring on two 787 locator transmitters during checks. US carrier United Airlines also found a pinched wire during an inspection of one of its six 787s.The issues have hurt Boeing.Earlier this week, JAL announced a $9.5bn (£5.9bn) plane deal with rival Airbus. It is the first time that it has agreed to buy Airbus planes, having preferred Boeing for many decades.Analysts have hinted that issues with the Dreamliner may have played a role in JAL's decision.However, despite the issues the Dreamliner is still considered to be one of the most advanced planes in the industry and continues to remain popular.Boeing has received orders for more than 950 jets since its launch.</body>

      <title>Building firms set up blacklist fund</title>
      <description>Some of the biggest firms in the construction industry are to compensate thousands of workers who were blacklisted from working on building sites.</description>

      <body>Some of the biggest firms in the construction industry are to compensate workers who were blacklisted from working on building sites.Trade unions say thousands of people on the list were denied work for years.The eight companies have apologised for their involvement with an organisation that kept the list but have not admitted liability.The blacklist was uncovered following a raid by the Information Commissioner's Office in 2009.It found that dozens of construction firms had been checking potential employees against a blacklist which contained details of about 3,200 workers.The list was held by a company called The Consulting Association (TCA).While most on it were members of unions, some had simply raised health and safety concerns on sites.In a statement, the companies - Balfour Beatty, Carillion, Costain, Kier, Laing O'Rourke, Sir Robert McAlpine, Skanska UK and Vinci - said they all apologised "for their involvement with TCA and the impact that its database may have had on any individual construction worker"."At this time we are not able to share any further information on the proposed scheme," they added.While the construction firms have not admitted liability for any involvement in blacklisting, they are asking unions to work with them to establish a compensation scheme.They added that they would support the introduction of a code of conduct "to ensure nothing like this can happen within the industry again".Justin Bowden, national officer for the GMB union, said the next step for the companies was to "clean up and pay up"."The victims and their families will either be fairly compensated including the offer of jobs or GMB will ensure justice for its members through the High Court," he said.The union also called for a new code of practice for the construction industry covering how it employs people.Another union, Unite, described the proposals as "encouraging", but said unions and employers needed to "thrash out the details".Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said: "It must be a priority to get blacklisted workers back into work. Unite is calling on contractors to employ and where relevant, support the up-skilling of blacklisted workers."Many of these workers have spent years out of work as a result of being blacklisted. Employers have a moral duty to give them back the jobs that were wrongly taken away from them."</body>

      <body>The Royal Household generated more than £11.6m in income in 2012-13, up from £7.5m in 2007-08, the National Audit Office has reported.But 39% of occupied Royal palaces were in worse condition than had been aimed for, the report said.The report was prepared for the Public Accounts Committee, which will look at Royal finances on Monday.The Sovereign Grant, which funds the Queen's spending as Head of State, will rise in 2014 from £36.1m to £37.9m.The report said that the household had used its reserves to fund official activities in recent years and as of 31 March, the Sovereign Grant Reserve stood at £1m.The report asked whether that amount is "adequate to meet unexpected costs".It said that Royal Household income had increased due to the commercial letting of properties and by using its facilities for commercial events - measures that had previously been recommended by the Public Accounts Committee.And the report said that between 1991-92 and 2011-12, the Household reduced spending by 55% in response to decreases in funding.It said the net expenditure in 2011-12 was £32.9m, compared to an equivalent of £72.6m in 1991-92.The way the Royal Family is funded was changed on 1 April 2012, in the first major overhaul of how it is financed for 250 years.Previously, the Civil List - which dated back to 1760 - met the official expenses of the Royal Household and separate grants were paid to cover things such as travel and maintenance of palaces.That was replaced by the Sovereign Grant, which is a single payment given to the monarch based on 15% of the Crown Estate's revenue from two years previously.This funding arrangement will last seven years before it is reviewed.The Crown Estate has a property portfolio which includes, among other things, Regent Street in central London, Windsor Great Park and much of the UK coastline.Also under the changed funding structure, the Civil List reserve was transferred into the Sovereign Grant Reserve.</body>

      <title>BAE warns on US government shutdown</title>
      <description>UK aerospace company BAE Systems has said its US operations could be hit if the government shutdown in Washington turns out to be protracted.</description>

      <body>UK aerospace company BAE Systems has said its US operations could be hit if the government shutdown in Washington turns out to be protracted.BAE said its financial performance had not been materially affected since the budget dispute began on 1 October.However, 1,200 of its intelligence, security and support staff have been told not to report for work.The crisis began after Republicans who control the House of Representatives refused to approve a budget.At the same time, the Republicans have refused to approve an increase in the US debt limit unless it is accompanied by significant spending cuts and other policy concessions.Republican leaders have called on President Barack Obama to open negotiations over ending the impasses.However, Mr Obama has accused them of using "extortion" by calling for his healthcare reform law to be delayed or stripped of funding.BAE is also facing longer-term difficulties in the US, where it derives 40% of its revenues, because of plans to reduce the country's defence budget by $487bn (£320bn) over the next decade.At the same time, its deal to supply Saudi Arabia with 72 Typhoon jet fighters has hit trouble, following disagreements over the final contract price.In its latest interim management statement, BAE said its earnings could be hit by 6p to 7p a share if it failed to conclude negotiations on the Saudi deal by the end of 2013.However, the firm added that it expected a "satisfactory conclusion" to the talks, allowing it to deliver "double-digit growth in underlying earnings per share".The company has been under pressure to develop an alternative growth strategy following the collapse of its planned merger with European defence company EADS in 2012.</body>

      <body>The owners of Glasgow Prestwick have suggested they may give away the airport for nothing.The Scottish government announced on Tuesday it was negotiating to buy the unprofitable airport from New Zealand owners Infratil.But in a statement on its website, the company said it did not expect any transaction "to give rise to material proceeds".Prestwick was put up for sale last March after heavy annual losses.Several investors expressed interest but no offers were made.Infratil has also been trying to sell its other UK airport, Manston Kent.The airport operator said: "In March 2012 Infratil announced its intention to sell its two UK airports, Glasgow Prestwick Airport and Manston Kent Airport."On 15 May 2013, Infratil announced that it had written down the value of both airports to £11m."Infratil does not now expect any transaction completed for Glasgow Prestwick Airport or Manston Kent Airport to give rise to material proceeds."The Scottish government hopes to conclude detailed negotiations with the company by 20 November.Infratil has agreed to ensure the airport is kept fully open and operational during the negotiation process.On Wednesday, Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon argued that Prestwick Airport could be profitable if the right approach was taken.Ms Sturgeon said she believed that "over time" Prestwick could go "back to profit".She told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "We are embarking on commercial negotiations with the current owners of the airport so things like purchase price for the airport will require to be resolved in terms of the negotiation."The minister defended the government's decision to step in to buy the airport, saying it was the "only realistic alternative to closure".She explained that, once the airport was in public ownership, there would be a detailed business case made which would include levels of investment and a timescale on turning around its fortunes.Ms Sturgeon added: "With the right financial investment, with the right commercial management, the right marketing over a period of time, Prestwick can be brought back into profit."The Scottish government's bid to buy Prestwick comes just months after struggling Cardiff Airport was sold to the Welsh government for £52m.Although publicly owned, Cardiff Airport is being managed by an "arm's length" body rather than by the government, and "on a commercial basis".</body>

However, the shares then fell back and were unchanged in lunchtime trade.Rival energy firm Centrica - which owns British Gas - rose 0.8%, with all the main energy firms expected to increase their prices over the coming weeks.As expected, the Bank of England announced no changes to interest rates or quantitative easing following the latest meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee.On the currency markets, the pound fell 0.1% against the dollar to $1.5940, and slipped 0.1% against the euro to 1.1781 euros.</body>

      <description>China overtakes the US to become the biggest importer of oil in the world, US government data shows.</description>

      <body>China has knocked the US from its top spot as the world's biggest net importer of oil, US government data shows.The country's fast growing economy, as well as the rise in car sales, has led to its new status, according to September's data.Oil consumption in China outstripped production by 6.3m barrels a day, said the Energy Information Administration (EIA).In the US, the figure was 6.1m.China's own oil supply has been outstripped by its economic boom, and its oil fields have been damaged by flooding during the past few months.The country had to import to make up the shortfall, said the EIA.It predicts the trend will continue into 2014.The US uses 18.6m barrels of oil per day compared to China's 10.9m, despite having a population a third the size of China's.But the US is increasingly able to support itself after the growth of its domestic hydraulic fracturing, or fracking - a new technique of drilling for gas and oil from shale rock.It has attracted controversy from environmental campaigners who are concerned about the large quantities of water used and the potential danger of carcinogenic chemicals. The campaigners say the chemicals could escape and contaminate groundwater.Jason Gammel, Head of European oil and Gas Research at Macquarie, said he expected the trend to last for the next five years.He said he expected America to produce 20 to 22m barrels of oil per day by 2022.Mr Gammel said: "The US has moved very quickly to utilise fracking and horizontal drilling activities."But he said such an approach would be difficult for China to mimic, as the US was already well prepared to take advantage of the new techniques, for example with its large oil field services</body>

      <body>US President Barack Obama has officially nominated Federal Reserve vice-chair Janet Yellen to be the next head of the US central bank.He called her one of the nation's foremost economists and policy makers.Ms Yellen said if confirmed by the Senate she would do her utmost "to promote maximum employment, stable prices and a stable financial system".She said more needed to be done to strengthen the US economy although progress had been made recently.The president praised Ms Yellen's ability to build consensus and listen to competing views.He added that she was "committed to increasing employment and understands the human costs when Americans can't find a job".If the nomination is confirmed by the US Senate, Ms Yellen, 67, would replace Ben Bernanke, who has held the post for eight years.She has been his deputy for the past two years, and would become the first woman to head the Federal Reserve.She has taught at Harvard University and the London School of Economics, as well as holding a series of senior administrative positions in the US.Ms Yellen, like Mr Bernanke, is seen as a "dove", meaning she prefers to prioritise boosting employment by keeping rates low rather than worrying about inflation.Her nomination had been widely expected since former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers withdrew his candidature last month amid opposition from liberal Democrats.As Democrats control the 100-seat Senate, Ms Yellen's appointment would only need six Republican votes to overcome potential any procedural hurdles.Some conservatives are scrutinising her views on monetary policy and her support for previous federal stimulus efforts.On Wednesday, the second-most powerful Republican in the Senate questioned whether she was the right choice."Ms Yellen subscribes to the liberal school of thought that the best way to handle our nation's fiscal challenges is to throw more money at them," John Cornyn of Texas, the party's whip in the Senate, said in a statement."This stimulus obsession is the reason the nation finds itself in the fiscal calamity it does today, and the last thing we need is a leader at the helm of the Federal Reserve who is intent on more quantitative easing that harms our economy."Senator Bob Corker, a leading Republican on the banking committee, said in a statement: "I voted against Vice-Chairman Yellen's original nomination to the Fed in 2010 because of her dovish views on monetary policy.""We will closely examine her record since that time, but I am not aware of anything that demonstrates her views have changed."But Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said Ms Yellen would win Senate confirmation "by a wide margin".The chairman of the US Senate banking committee, Tim Johnson, said she had "a depth of experience that is second to none"."I have no doubt she will be an excellent Federal Reserve chairman," he added.The BBC's chief business correspondent, Linda Yueh, says the transition from Mr Bernanke to Ms Yellen is likely to be "seamless" and will not have much impact, because the two already work so closely together."I don't think there's going to be a radical change," she said on Radio 4's Today programme, adding that the changeover was unlikely to alter the timing of the Fed's withdrawal of economic stimulus.Ms Yellen's most recent academic post was at the University of California, Berkeley. A former colleague there, Laura Tyson, professor of business and economics, told the BBC Ms Yellen's nomination was "terrific news"."We have an outstanding candidate who is a wonderful match of skills and experience and temperament and reputation around the world at a time when monetary policy is extremely important," she said."Continuity is important and Janet is an outstanding candidate."A former member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve, Prof Randy Kroszner, told the BBC that Ms Yellen was "battle tested" and would be driven by the data in deciding when to reduce support to the markets.</body>

      <title>HMRC 'failed' on tobacco smuggling</title>
      <description>MPs warn that HM Revenue and Customs initiatives to fight tobacco smuggling are not working.</description>

      <date>1381394576</date>
      <body>MPs have warned that HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) initiatives to fight tobacco smuggling are not working.The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said the UK economy lost £1.9bn a year through tobacco smuggling, equal to 20% of all tax collected on cigarettes.Some tobacco firms oversupply other European countries and the surplus enters the UK tax-free, the PAC said.The HMRC says it has more than halved the size of the illicit market in cigarettes.But the PAC report said the HMRC was "in the dark" about how effective its enforcement strategy was.PAC chair Margaret Hodge said she was concerned that three out of five new HMRC initiatives to tackle smuggling had produced nothing by March 2013."The Department and Border Force have been painfully slow in taking forward new proposals to improve performance," she said.She added the two government agencies had failed to make a realistic assessment of what could be achieved and by when.Ms Hodge also said the HMRC had "failed to challenge properly those UK tobacco manufacturers who turn a blind eye to the avoidance of UK tax by supplying more of their products to European countries than the legitimate market in those countries could possibly require"."The tobacco then finds its way back into the UK market without tax being paid," she added. "The supply of some brands of hand-rolling tobacco to some countries in 2011 exceeded legitimate demand by 240%."HMRC must be more assertive with these manufacturers. So far it has not fined a single one of them," she said.An HMRC spokesman said the customs body had more than halved the size of the illicit cigarette market, highlighting the seizure of nearly 3.6bn cigarettes and more than 1,000 tonnes of rolling tobacco since 2011."Disrupting criminal businesses is at the heart of HMRC's strategy to clamp down on this illicit trade," he said."The tobacco smuggling gangs are constantly adapting to the huge downward pressure HMRC puts them under. This pressure has caused the long-term decline of this illegal trade."</body>

      <title>Ford car wrests control of steering</title>
      <description>Ford is testing a car that takes control of the steering wheel away from the driver if it believes they are failing to take the action necessary to avoid a crash.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24464480</url>
      <date>1381330900</date>
      <body>A car that takes control of the steering wheel when it detects the risk of a collision is being tested at a research facility in Germany.Ford said the Obstacle Avoidance system first warned the driver of danger and then took charge if they did not react.The firm said the equipment had been fitted to one of its vehicles as part of a project involving other carmakers and suppliers.One analyst said it was a staging post on the route to "driverless cars".The system scans up to 200m (650ft) ahead by using three radars, a number of ultrasonic sensors and a camera, which are all installed in the vehicle.An additional built-in display shows a warning sign and sounds a chime. Then, if necessary, it applies the brakes, scans for a gap in the road ahead, and steers to avoid a crash."You're driving down the road and a pedestrian or something comes out from either side of your vehicle from your peripheral vision where you don't have a good look at it," said Barb Samardzich, vice-president of product development at Ford's European division."Obstacle Avoidance can sense that the pedestrian or that object is coming across the front of your vehicle. If it doesn't sense you responding accordingly in your vehicle by braking or manoeuvring, it will take over."The firm showed off the tech at a facility in Lommel, Belgium, earlier this week.The new technology builds on safety features already offered by Ford.Last year it introduced Lane Keeping Alert, a feature that vibrates the wheel - but does not take control - if it detects the driver is drifting out of a lane without using an indicator.Ford's existing Active City Stop facility also aims to reduce the severity of collisions by applying the brakes if it detects an object in front of the vehicle. But it works only if the object is static or travelling less than 30km/h (19mph) faster than the car.By contrast, the company said the new tech was being tested at speeds of over 60 km/h (38mph).Other manufacturers involved in the project at Aachen include BMW, Fiat, Daimler, Volvo and Volkswagen. They will share data from the tests to develop systems of their own.Volvo - which is owned by China's Geely - has already introduced its own pedestrian and cyclist alert system, which sounds an alarm and applies the brakes. The firm told the BBC in March that it was now adapting the system so it would soon be able to recognise animals.There may be resistance from some to the idea of a car taking control from its driver.But Ford points out that fewer than one-third of all drivers involved in rear-end collisions had attempted to steer clear of the accident, according to data collected by Germany's Federal Statistical Office.With that in mind, one independent analyst said it should not be too hard for manufacturers to convince motorists of the innovation's benefit."The logic behind the technology is impeccable - anything that can avoid a potentially dangerous situation that can cause injury or death sounds like a good piece of equipment," said Tim Urquhart, senior analyst at consultants IHS Automotive."Obviously it will come at a price. But there will be less resistance to a piece of technology like this than there will be to the concept of totally driverless cars."But autonomous vehicles are already being tested by Google, Daimler and others, and taking steering control in an emergency situation is obviously a pretty significant step along the road."Ford said more tests were needed and it was not yet ready to announce a launch date for its Obstacle Avoidance system.</body>

      <title>Dyson balks at EU 'dust-free' tests</title>
      <description>Dyson is mounting a legal challenge against the EU's labelling policy for vacuum cleaners, saying it gives a misleading impression of the firm's products.</description>

      <date>1381301499</date>
      <body>British manufacturer Dyson is mounting a legal challenge against the EU's labelling policy for vacuum cleaners, saying it gives a misleading impression of the firm's products.Sir James Dyson, the firm's founder, said the EU's energy efficiency ratings were based on dust-free lab conditions, favouring "old-fashioned technology".Dyson said home performance was "very different to that in the laboratory".The firm has pioneered the bagless vacuum cleaner since 1991.From September 2014, all vacuum cleaners sold in the EU will be rated according to their performance and energy efficiency, on a scale from A to G.The EU says the measure is part of efforts to meet its goal of cutting carbon emissions and saving energy.It wants consumers to take the environment into consideration when they are buying household appliances.Dyson said it had launched a judicial review at the European General Court in Luxembourg, because it felt the rating system would mislead people looking to buy a new vacuum cleaner."The regulations stipulate that vacuums should be tested in laboratory conditions: empty and with no dust," said the firm."This does not simulate real-life conditions and is not representative of the view of testing and standards bodies across Europe."Dyson said its bagless design meant that its cleaners did not clog with dust and therefore wasted less energy.It also said the EU's tests did not take into account the cost, "on both the pocket and the planet", of replacement bags and filters for older types of vacuum cleaner."Dyson fully supports the ambition to make the environmental impact of a machine easier to understand," said a spokesman for the firm."However, we are challenging aspects of the label because it will mislead consumers - notably the fact that the machines are tested in lab conditions free of dust, and the fact that environmentally damaging and costly consumables are not considered."</body>

      <body>Commemorative coins marking the christening of Prince George will be priced at between £13 and £50,000, the Royal Mint has announced.Twenty-two of the most expensive coins will be struck containing a kilogramme of fine gold each. A range of coins at different prices is being struck.It is the first time that a royal christening has been marked with coins.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son will be christened on 23 October, just over three months after his birth.The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, will perform the christening at the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace.The prince, who was born on 22 July at St Mary's Hospital in London, is third in line to the throne.The coins are starting to be struck on Tuesday at the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf.They feature a lily font from the Tower of London, which has links with royal christenings.The inscription is flanked by two harp-playing cherubs. The motto at the foot of the coin is the traditional "Dieu et mon droit" or "God and my right", which is the motto of Prince George's great grandmother, the Queen.The prince has already had coins minted in his honour. The Royal Mint gave away 2,013 silver pennies to babies born on the same day as the duke and duchess's son.</body>

      <title>Santander to join Help to Buy scheme</title>
      <description>Santander is the latest bank to say it will sign up to the government's Help to Buy scheme.</description>

      <body>Santander has become the latest bank to say it will sign up to the government's Help to Buy scheme.That means that of the biggest banks, only Barclays and Nationwide Building Society have yet to say they will join.The government's initiative is designed to allow those who can afford only small deposits to buy a home.A Santander spokesman said the bank was looking to offer loans up to 95% of the value of homes under the scheme, but was still working on the details.Other lenders have already unveiled the cost of mortgages they plan to offer.RBS, NatWest and Halifax will start taking applications this week, with HSBC, Virgin Money, Lloyds, TSB and Aldermore joining later. That means lenders representing about 40% of the UK mortgage market have committed to the scheme.RBS and NatWest are offering a two-year, fixed-rate mortgage starting at 4.99% for those with a 5% deposit, with no fee.RBS, which owns NatWest, said it had already filled all of its mortgage appointments across its branch network for the rest of the week. And it said its new online Help to Buy pages were being viewed 40 times per minute.Halifax will be taking applications by the end of the week at a rate of 5.19% with a £995 fee for those with the same deposit.Prime Minister David Cameron said he was happy with the interest being shown so far."I am very content that we are going to get a good range of products in the market and that is going to help people who want to get on to the housing ladder, who want to own their own home, who can afford mortgage payments but can't currently get mortgages," he said."Those are the people we want to help."Comparisons on the interest rates are difficult, as there are so few 95% mortgages on the market at present.The most competitive, widely available two-year fixed rate mortgage before Help to Buy, for those offering a 5% deposit, has an interest rate of 5.95%, according to financial information service Moneyfacts.For those able to offer a 10% deposit, the cheapest mortgage deal was 3.54%, with a fee of £1,675, Moneyfacts said.The first phase of the Help to Buy scheme in England started in April, when buyers of newly built homes were eligible for a 20% equity loan from the government on top of their 5% deposit.Similar schemes are operating in Scotland and Wales.Under the second phase, buyers across the UK only need to provide a small deposit, with the government offering a guarantee of 15% of the loan to the lender - for a fee - to encourage the bank or building society to offer the loan.That fee charged to the lender is up to 0.9% of the original loan level. This is a one-off fee dealt with entirely by the lender, which guarantees 15% of the mortgage for seven years.Borrowers who apply will face checks to make sure that they can afford the mortgage payments. The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), which represents lenders, said affordability checks would be as "rigorous" as they were with any borrower.The scheme will be available for first-time buyers and home movers borrowing to buy new and old homes valued at no more than £600,000. It is expected to continue for three years.It means a buyer looking to purchase a home costing £200,000 would have to put down a deposit of around £10,000.Demands have been much higher than this for many first-time buyers since the start of the financial crisis, usually about 20% of the value of a home.</body>

      <title>Equitable payment deadline extended</title>
      <description>A deadline for savers who lost money in the Equitable Life scandal to claim compensation has been extended to the middle of 2015.</description>

      <body>A deadline for savers who lost money in the Equitable Life scandal to claim compensation has been extended to the middle of 2015.The planned cut-off of March 2014 was criticised as "arbitrary" in a report by a committee of MPs in October.The insurance company came close to collapse in 2000, in one of the UK's biggest financial scandals.The Treasury said that up to 400,000 savers who lost money had still not received compensation payments.A national advertising campaign to encourage eligible policyholders to come forward will be launched in the next few weeks.After years of official inquiries into the scandal, the government agreed to a compensation system in 2010, with the first payments being made by June 2011.But the report by the Commons Public Accounts Committee, published in October, said that one in five policyholders might not be traced before the March 2014 deadline.It criticised the lack of publicity to reduce the number of people who might miss out, and suggested not enough preparatory work had been done ahead of the compensation scheme starting. Only £168m was paid out by March 2012, rather than the expected £500m.Now the government has decided to extend the deadline to try to locate thousands of savers whose addresses are unrecorded."We have made strong progress, but we want to maximise the number of people who will eventually receive payments, which is why we are extending the Equitable Life payment scheme to mid-2015," said Sajid Javid, Financial Secretary to the Treasury.Paul Weir, spokesman for the Equitable Members' Action group (Emag), said: "We are delighted that the Treasury has listened."It is vital that the Treasury complete the task of tracing those who are entitled to compensation and we will be working with them to assist that process."</body>

      <title>Power to raise rail fares curbed</title>

      <date>1381315063</date>
      <body>The rail industry's power to increase fares in England is to be curbed as part of a government drive to overhaul the rail fare system.Until now, some regulated fares could potentially have gone up by 9.1% next January.They will now be capped at 6.1%.But campaigners say it is not enough, and point out that commuters will still have to pay an above- inflation increase next year.Regulated fares are those which the government controls, and include season tickets, "anytime" single tickets around major cities, and off-peak inter-city return tickets.They will go up in 2014 by an average of 4.1%, a number calculated using an average of inflation - as measured by the retail prices index (RPI) for July - plus 1%.Train companies can add up to 5% on top of the average rise, although fares that go up by more than the average must be balanced by others that rise by less or fall.The government plans to limit that extra increase to 2% in the future. But the provision for the average regulated ticket price to go up by 1% more than inflation remains.The move is part of the government's Fares and Ticketing review being published by the Transport Secretary, Patrick McLoughlin.Mr McLoughlin told the BBC he thought rail users would get "quite a lot of benefit" from the cap.He said: "Commuters will benefit from knowing there is a strict limit on the amount rail companies can put up the cost. People had been seeing 10% rises."Those commuters who wanted to see more capacity on trains welcomed the government's investment into stations such as London Bridge, he said.Mr McLoughlin added: "If we didn't take action, people would complain that we are not taking action. We are taking action, we are investing in the railways, we are trying to keep the price down as much as we can."He said he was "always looking" at how to reduce the pressure on the passenger.The government will also detail a pilot scheme that could see all long-distance rail tickets sold on a single-leg basis, not as returns.It says this could allow passengers to more easily "mix and match" different ticket types when planning a return journey.Other plans to be revealed by the Transport Secretary include:Mary Creagh, the shadow transport secretary, said the new cap on fares would be "cold comfort for commuters"."It has taken 18 months, delivers fare increases of up to 6% and is too little too late," she said."This announcement doesn't go as far as Labour's plans which would prevent train companies from increasing fares beyond one per cent above inflation."</body>

      <title>Debt limit brinkmanship 'dangerous'</title>
      <description>US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew says leaving a deal over the debt ceiling to the last minute could be "very dangerous".</description>

      <date>1381418314</date>
      <body>US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has warned that pushing talks over the debt ceiling to the last minute could be "very dangerous".He said that the US government could suddenly run out of money some time after 17 October, which would have "serious" repercussions.He also warned that the Treasury's payment systems were not designed to work without funds for payment.According to Mr Lew that would make it difficult to prioritise payments.The current debt limit of $16.699 trillion was reached in May.Since then the US Treasury has been using what are called extraordinary measures to keep paying the bills, but those measures run out on 17 October.In his testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, Mr Lew said that the Treasury had big bills to pay soon after that date, including to hospitals and doctors under the Medicare scheme, to Social Security recipients, veterans and members of the armed forces.Mr Lew underlined that, every week, the Treasury also has to refinance $100bn worth of debt in the form of US government bonds known as treasuries.The US also has to pay interest on its huge debt burden.An inability to pay that interest, or pay back debt if required, would put the US into default.That would potentially have a "catastrophic" impact, according to Mr Lew, who cited a recent Treasury report.Effects of a default would include a sharp fall in the dollar, a significant jump in US interest rates and negative effects on the global economy.As well as disagreeing over the debt ceiling, US politicians have also been unable to approve funding for current federal spending.As a result there has been a partial shutdown of government activities over the past 10 days.Thousands of government workers have been told to stay at home.On Thursday, URS Corp, which builds and operates industrial projects, said it had temporarily laid off about 3,000 employees due to the government shutdown.Mr Lew said that a two-week shutdown could cut growth in the fourth quarter of the year by a quarter of a percentage point.A report from the US Labor Department released on Thursday said that the number of Americans applying for benefits jumped by 66,000 last week, taking the seasonally adjusted total to 374,000.But that total does not reflect federal workers laid off due to the shutdown.They can apply for benefits but their number is added up separately and reported a week later.Half of last week's rise was accounted for by California which processed a big backlog of claims.A quarter of the applicants were from workers affected by the shutdown, such as private contractors working for the government.It is thought Republicans are considering agreeing to an increase in the debt ceiling, but only enough to provide a temporary reprieve, while politicians negotiate a broader deal.Meanwhile, President Barack Obama was preparing to meet senior Republicans at the White House on Thursday in the hope of finding a way out of the budget deadlock.Mr Obama invited all of the Republicans in the House of Representatives, but their leader, John Boehner, decided instead to send about 20 members.White House press secretary Jay Carney, however, complained that hardline Tea Party Republicans were not attending the discussion.On Wednesday, Mr Obama met House Democrats at the White House and told them he would prefer a long-term increase to the nation's debt ceiling.But the president said he was willing to accept a short-term rise in the borrowing cap to "give Boehner some time to deal with the Tea Party wing of his party", Representative Peter Welch told the Associated Press news agency after the meeting.News that senior Republicans will visit the White House helped to lift US stocks on Thursday. But analysts remain cautious."It would be a minor sign of hope there may be some more positive news coming in the next couple of days, hard to make much more out of that," said Fred Dickson, chief market strategist at D.A. Davidson and Co."The markets right now are betting somebody will blink between now and October 17," he said.</body>

      <date>1381312190</date>
      <body>UK industrial production fell unexpectedly in August, showing its biggest decline for nearly a year, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Industrial output decreased by 1.1% month-on-month, surprising analysts, who had expected a 0.4% rise.The news had an impact on the pound, which dropped 0.7% against the dollar.The biggest factor in the decline was a big fall in manufacturing output, which was 1.2% down on July levels.It was the biggest overall drop in output since September 2012.At the same time, the ONS published figures showing that the UK trade deficit was largely unchanged in August.The gap between imports and exports for the month was estimated at £3.3bn, compared with £3.4bn in July.The decrease in UK manufacturing output was led by companies making pharmaceutical products, electronics, food and beverages.But other sectors also contributed to the surprise fall in overall output, with the oil and gas industry also underperforming.Private-sector surveys of production have been less downbeat. Last week, the Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for September indicated that UK manufacturing had grown for the sixth consecutive month.Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturers' organisation EEF, described the latest ONS figures as "a mixed bag of data which breaks the run of consistently upbeat indicators in recent months".She added: "Whilst August unwound some of the gains in June and July, the declines were particularly concentrated in a few sectors, namely food, pharmaceuticals and electronics."However, the trade news was a little more positive, with exports edging higher, thanks to gains in markets outside Europe."Despite this monthly setback on production, manufacturing should make a positive contribution to third-quarter GDP growth and other business surveys seem to align behind a continuation of this trend through the final months of the year."However, Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency brokers World First, said the figures were "a further sign that the UK's economic revival cannot be guaranteed"."While the IMF may have sung the UK's praises [on Tuesday], today's number shows that the broad-based recovery that so many have been hailing has significant tasks attached," he said."The divergence between the recent, multi-year highs on PMIs and the official data is worrying and a little difficult to explain. Could businesses be overly exuberant without cause?"</body>

      <title>IMF cuts global growth forecast</title>

      <date>1381259442</date>
      <body>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has trimmed its forecast for global economic growth at the same time as lifting its UK growth projection.It now expects global growth of 2.9% this year, a cut of 0.3% from July's estimate. In 2014 it expects global growth of 3.6%, down 0.2%.It cited weakness in emerging economies for the cut.The forecast for UK growth this year received a significant upgrade to 1.4%, up from July's estimate of 0.9%.And for next year the IMF expects UK growth of 1.9%, up from July's projection of 1.5%.The IMF's upgrades for its outlook on the UK are larger than those it made for any other country in its World Economic Outlook - its twice-yearly assessment of the global economy.It credited recent data indicating higher consumer and business confidence, for the increase.However, it warned that it would still take years for the UK economy to recover fully from the 2008 financial crisis. It suggested that the government could help boost growth by bringing forward planned public infrastructure spending, such as building new homes.The UK Treasury said the IMF upgrade showed the government's economic strategy was working."But risks to the global economy remain high, and the recovery cannot be taken for granted. That is why the government will not let up in implementing its economic plan," a spokesman added.Despite the improvement in growth in advanced economies such as the UK and US, the IMF warned that a slower pace of expansion in emerging economies such as Brazil, China and India, was holding back global expansion.It expects growth in Russia, China, India and Mexico to be slower than it forecast in July.In part, it says this is due to expectations of a change in policy by US central bank the Federal Reserve. Simply the expectation that the US could trim back its efforts to stimulate the US economy has already had an impact on interest rates in emerging economies, the IMF said.It said an increasing belief that China's growth rate would slow would also hit global growth.The IMF expects the US to drive global growth.But it warns that the political standoff over raising the US government's borrowing limit, if it results in the US defaulting on its debt payments, "could seriously damage the global economy".It expects growth of 1.6% in the US this year and 2.6% next year, down 0.1% and 0.2% from its July forecast.In the US capital on Tuesday, Republicans in Congress and Democratic President Barack Obama remained at an impasse over a shutdown of the US government and legislation to increase the US borrowing limit.At a news conference, Mr Obama stressed that failing to raise America's so-called 'debt ceiling' would undermine the world's confidence in the United States and might permanently increase borrowing costs.Mr Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, leader of opposition Republicans who have demanded major policy concessions from the Democrats in exchange for approving a government budget and allowing debt limit increase, spoke on the telephone on Tuesday but failed to reach a resolution.Mr Boehner's office criticised the president for what it described as his unwillingness to negotiate, while the White House said Mr Obama was happy to negotiate with the Republicans but only after the US government was reopened and the borrowing limit raised.The impasse continued as the US sold one-month bonds at its highest interest rate in five years on Tuesday as investor fears rose over whether the government would reach a deal to avert a default on its debt payments.In the euro area, the IMF says business confidence indicators suggest activity is close to stabilising in peripheral economies, such as Italy and Spain, and already recovering in core economies such as Germany.Overall, it predicts growth will fall 0.4% this year, an improvement of 0.1% on its July prediction, and grow 1% next year."In short, the recovery from the crisis continues, albeit too slowly," said Olivier Blanchard, economic counsellor at the IMF."The architecture of the financial system is evolving, and its future shape is still unclear. These issues will continue to shape the evolution of the world economy for many years to come,"</body>

      <title>My Business Asia: Touring Taiwan</title>
      <description>The BBC's Cindy Sui talks to Yen Tseng about his student exchange programme bringing Chinese travellers and students to experience his take on Taiwan.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24427027</url>
      <date>1381276427</date>
      <body>What makes an entrepreneur? The BBC's Cindy Sui hears from Yen Tseng, a Taiwanese Canadian who, with his elder brother, founded a travel business called iBeengo. It takes tourists off the beaten track and helps them experience Taiwan the local way.Yen Tseng got the idea to start a travel business about a year ago because he loved to travel. He was born in Taiwan and attended middle school there, but went to Canada for his early, secondary and university education. By the age of 25, he had travelled to 25 countries.But starting this business in Taiwan wasn't an easy decision for him and his brother Ronnie, 30. Both are highly educated and their family had expectations of them. "The biggest risk is still the fact that we didn't take the nine-to-five job and we didn't take a stable salary."Initially, Yen and his brother wanted to help people take the pain out of travelling - so with a loan of one million New Taiwan dollars ($34,000; £21,000) from their parents, they created iBeengo in September 2012. It allows travellers to pick and choose the itinerary they want and create custom-made tours.Most of their clients are Chinese independent student travellers curious about Taiwan who see visiting the island as a lifelong dream. Many are women because they like to get out there and explore, but also want the safety of being in a tour with a local guide, Yen says.What makes iBeengo's tours different from those of big travel agencies is that they allow travellers to sleep in if they want, skip parts of the tour and rejoin the group later, take their time at each location, and request locations off the itinerary."People don't actually like bus tours. Bus tours are like food on a flight, there's no choice. What we do is buffet style; you come here, pick out what you want, and go at the pace you like," said Yen.Some of the places iBeengo takes tourists to are popular scenic attractions, and they also offer free walking tours for interested tourists.Wearing their eye-catching bright green iBeengo t-shirts, Yen, his brother, and college-student volunteers point out locally known trivia, such as the stall that sells the best Taiwanese fried chicken patty at a night market, the locations where popular Taiwanese films were shot, or the childhood hangout of a Taiwanese pop singer.In its first year, iBeengo has taken 400 tourists around Taiwan. Yen says they try to keep their average tour size to fewer than 15 people and aim for an ideal ratio of one tour guide to five tourists, much less than the traditional ratio of one guide to 30 travellers.What makes starting up a business relatively low cost for Yen is that he and Ronnie hooked up with a start-up incubator which rents office space to young companies cheaply. They pay only NT$3,000 per person per month.Advertising in person also helps them cut costs. They fly to China to drop off brochures at universities and advertise on Chinese websites to reach out to their target customers - young Chinese people.IBeengo for the moment is mainly a travel exchange programme for students, but the brothers are hoping to raise the US$200,000 (£125,000) to register their company as a fully functioning tourism business for all.In the future the brothers plan to operate tours around Japan and further afield. But for now, they are enjoying helping tourists from mainland China - Taiwan's former rivals during the war decades ago - get to know the island and see not only its scenic beauty but unique character."Just the fact that our customers are going home and telling their friends about us and their friends are coming to us asking us to organise tours for them, that gives us a lot of satisfaction," Yen said.</body>

      <title>Turning around the world's oldest travel firm</title>
      <description>A profile of Harriet Green, the boss of Thomas Cook, and how she is trying to turnaround the fortunes of Thomas Cook.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24328944</url>
      <date>1381152216</date>
      <body>It is safe to say that Harriet Green, the boss of Thomas Cook, is not lacking in confidence - or the desire to take on a big challenge.Ms Green was appointed chief executive of the UK-based travel company in July 2012, after she cold-called the chairman and told him she was the right person to lead the troubled group's recovery.At that time Thomas Cook, the world's oldest travel business, was struggling with losses caused by a general fall in tourism numbers as a result of the global recession, and unrest in the Middle East hitting its package holidays to Egypt and Tunisia. The company was also saddled with debts of more than £1bn.Ms Green, 51, was convincing enough to be given the job, despite having no previous experience of working in a travel company.She says her strength of purpose can be traced back to coping with the death of her father when she was 14."You know I lost a parent in my early teens, and for a child that is the worst that can happen," she says. "And if you can cope with that, pretty much everything else - except a very similar situation of loss - is unlikely to derail you."Staff engagementMs Green, who was previously boss of electronic components distributor Premier Farnell for six years, says her first job at Thomas Cook was to boost staff confidence, and get them on side."You need to be really working on the psychology of the business, building belief, beginning to rebuild a culture, giving people a self, a sense of renewed self-esteem," she says.Ms Green emailed all 35,000 employees, asking them to share with her "everything you think and feel about what we need to do in this company".More than 8,000 workers replied, sharing "chapter and verse" with her.And while Ms Green continued to formulate her detailed plan for the turnaround, she says she was aware that she had to calm her own go-getting, no-nonsense attitude."Thomas Cook was quite unwell and so... I moderated my style and approach," she says."I was much less edgy, much less aggressive. I was still very focused on time and the issues, but [at the same time] creating this environment where people could believe."However, Ms Green did show early steel when she replaced most of the previous Thomas Cook board.Ms Green said the core turnaround focus was then very simple - "managing our cash better and reducing cost".In March of this year, she unveiled her strategy. The company intends to save £350m by 2015, largely through cutting the number of its physical stores, and focusing instead on internet sales. At the same time, non-core parts of the business will be sold.More than 2,500 jobs are going, and 199 shops out of 1,069 in the UK are shutting.Transport union TSSA, which represents many Thomas Cook staff, was angry at the job losses, but says they were the result of "the over expansion and bad decisions" of Thomas Cook's previous regime.In May the company completed a £1.6bn capital refinancing, which helped to halve its net debt. Then in August it announced that its nine-month losses had fallen to £470m from £667m a year earlier.Meanwhile, on Monday, 7 October the company announced the sale of two businesses in Egypt and Lebanon. The two units in question - Thomas Cook Egypt and Thomas Cook Lebanon - offer outbound travel to Egyptian and Lebanese customers.The markets have so far welcomed Ms Green's efforts, and Thomas Cook's share price has soared. In May of last year, before she joined, the shares were trading at 21 pence each. They finished last month at 153.13p.TSSA is also hopeful that the company is now moving in the right direction.Manuel Cortes, its general secretary, says: "We believe that Thomas Cook staff are its biggest asset and that the company is now back on track. We are confident that it can once again be a successful company and a great British brand."Ms Green herself says she should be judged after five years in the job.As Ms Green continues her work at Thomas Cook, she says successful chief executives have a wide range of skills, which she terms "a rich DNA toolkit".While she highlights traits such as resilience, agility, and ability to lead speedy change, she says the most important factor is the need to be good with people, something she sees in herself.Ms Green says: "It is my experience that [chief executives] that really enjoy people - either love to develop them, or coach them or support them, or engage with their work - are much more successful than those who really are great on strategy, love the numbers, but don't really love the people aspect."I think there is an authenticity that comes through, and if you don't love the people that you work with, that begins to show. So I think it's hard to be a successful [chief executive] if you don't really like working, developing [and] supporting other people."Ms Green adds that the DNA needed to make a good chief executive is "not gender specific". However, she does agree that more needs to be done to see more female bosses of large companies."There are gender issues associated with why there are so few of us female [chief executives], but I think that's a different issue about role-modelling, education, the media that we can all help with," she says.Regarding the future of Thomas Cook, which traces its history back to 1841, Ms Green has eyes on East Asia."Thomas Cook is not yet in the East, which I think is an amazing opportunity," she says. "Helping Chinese and Korean customers to explore Europe would be amazing."Yet despite the big plans for Thomas Cook's future, Ms Green says she won't stay forever."I generally think [chief executives] spend far too long in the same business," she says. "I think you should... make the business great, stay around a little while to enjoy that, and then probably move on to the next thing."</body>

      <title>The drink of kings makes a comeback</title>
      <description>Mead, the stuff of kings and Renaissance fairs, is growing in popularity again in the US, as the BBC's Kim Gittleson reports.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24184527</url>
      <date>1380755618</date>
      <body>Long relegated to the dusty corners of history, mead - the drink of kings and Vikings - is making a comeback in the US.But what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe."Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour.When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel."If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works," he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge."We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day," explains Mr Alexander.It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead."It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages," he gushes.After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business.His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US.It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China.Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead.Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade."We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years," she says."I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once."Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree.Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead "is becoming more and more available - similar to cider".Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry.But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments."I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is," says Mr Alexander."You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience."The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers who were just looking for something good to pair with food. But mead has since changed."People don't realise that just because it has honey in it, [mead] doesn't need to be sweet," says Ms Rowe, citing the proliferation of not only dry meads but also meads flavoured with fruits, herbs, and spicy peppers.Yet hampering efforts towards building mead awareness is also the name mead itself.Technically, mead is classified as wine by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which regulates alcohol sales and labelling in the US.This means that mead has to be labelled as "honey wine", which doesn't help combat people's perception of the drink as being as cloyingly sweet."How do people recognise it as mead if you can't say the word?" says Ms Rowe.Ironically, the alcoholic beverage that most credit with the resurgence of the mead business is beer.The craft brewing movement, which was recently singled out in a report by the Atlanta Federal Reserve as a source of job growth, inspired many home brewers to expand their repertoire."I was a home brewer, and at first I liked mead because I had never had it," says Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit, Michigan."Every home brewer has the same dream of, 'Hey what if I could sell this? Wouldn't that be great?'" he says.After he spent months making batch after batch of mead, perfecting his recipe, he realised that mead was "kind of an untouched category", and that no-one, at least back in 2008, was really doing it commercially.So when he and his wife, Kerri, were both laid off of their jobs in Detroit's car industry during the recession, they decided to take the plunge.Now, B Nektar is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, US meadery, shipping 1,100 cases a week across the country.But for Mr Dahlhofer and his fellow mead enthusiasts, that's just the beginning."If you look at craft beer 25 years ago, they had 1% of the total beer market, and now they have 8%," says Maine Mead's Mr Alexander."So we've got a long way to go, but I feel like it's got the opportunity because of the diversity of the beverage."You've got a canvas with very few limits."</body>

      <title>Debt-free Norwich have 'rosy future'</title>
      <description>Norwich City chairman Alan Bowkett says the club can now manage its own destiny after becoming free of external debt.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24466994</url>
      <date>1381383804</date>
      <body>Norwich City chairman Alan Bowkett says the club now has the freedom to manage its own destiny after becoming free of external debt.The club had loans amounting to £23m four years ago, but now only owes interest-free money to directors."I'd postulate there are few clubs in the Premier League who can say that," Bowkett told BBC Sport."We're on a sound financial footing. In my view we have our best team for 20 years. The future is looking rosy."He added: "In terms of the football club going forward it gives us complete freedom to manage our own destiny."Following relegation to League One in 2009, the Canaries were in a desperate financial position, struggling to meet the payments on the £23m worth of debt.But the arrival of Bowkett as chairman and David McNally as chief executive, coupled with back-to-back promotions to the Premier League and restructuring of the club's loans, has seen a stark turnaround in fortunes.City finished the 2012-13 financial year with £900,000 of external debt, £700,000 of which was tied up in preferred shares, while the remaining £200,000 was paid off weeks after the accounting period."Four years ago when we were looking at lots of debt and League One football, we put in a plan to turn the business around and I'm happy to report we're on track," said McNally."To do it in four years, some would have perhaps seen as far-fetched back in 2009."They were difficult days. We are now institutionally debt free. We can now generate as much cash as possible and put that into the football team. Comparing then and now is like night and day."Norwich's after-tax profit for 2012-13 was just £500,000, down from £13.5m in the previous 12 months, but the club has moved its financial year from May to June, meaning the newest accounts cover a 13-month period.Meanwhile, there was £19.7m of player investment in the last financial year, up from £10.4m, and increase in spending made possible by successfully retaining their Premier League place for a third successive season, and the £49.03m received for television rights.The latter figure will rise to somewhere between £62m and £64m for this season, with an extra £1.25m for every position above 20th the club finishes."As long as we're alive, we have to stay in the Premier League," said McNally."It's a message I need to get across to all of my colleagues here at the football club. The board knows it, but everybody who works here needs to be focused on that."It's why the finances have improved so quickly and it's integral to our future plans."Despite their healthy financial position, proposals to expand Carrow Road have been deferred.The Canaries regularly sell out their 27,000-capacity stadium and had considered rebuilding the City Stand to increase that to 32,000.However, that would require a 20-year, £30m mortgage and losing up to 6,000 seats for an entire season, so the project has now become a long-term idea."It's on the agenda, but the first thing we want to invest in is the software - staff and academy - to secure our position in the Premier League," Bowkett added.</body>

      <title>Hot Spot 'dropped for Ashes series'</title>
      <description>Hot Spot will not be used in the Ashes series down under, according to the inventor of the infrared camera technology.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/24465269</url>
      <date>1381392333</date>
      <body>Hot Spot will not be used in this winter's Ashes series in Australia, says the inventor of the infrared camera technology used to detect edges.Host broadcaster Channel Nine chose to drop the controversial system after concerns over its cost and reliability."It's their decision and that's what has been communicated to us," Warren Brennan told the Sydney Morning Herald. The International Cricket Council said it was a matter for Channel Nine and Cricket Australia to resolve.The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) is aware of the reports and is considering its response. The governing body was not contacted in advance of the decision.England coach Andy Flower and captain Alastair Cook have consistently backed the use of technology in the decision review system (DRS) and expressed a desire to improve it, rather than dispense of any of its components.The absence of Hot Spot means television umpires will be restricted to using Eagle Eye ball-tracking software, audio from stump microphones, and slow-motion replays when England or Australia review an umpire's decision during the Ashes, which begins on 21 November in Brisbane.Hot Spot was devised in 2007 by BBG Sports and works using heat sensors and infrared cameras to determine what the ball has made contact with.But it came under scrutiny during England's 3-0 Ashes victory over the summer when several faint edges appeared to go undetected, with Brennan claiming that the protective tape on players' bats was diminishing the effectiveness of his system.The host broadcaster and the governing body finance the cost of using Hot Spot, which is almost £6,000 per day according to Cricinfo.Brennan told BBC Sport that Australia television had decided not to pay for the system after an increase in television rights costs.He said: "Unfortunately, with Channel Nine paying double the amount in rights fees to Cricket Australia for their new broadcast agreement, then there was always going to be less funds available in the kitty for development of technology."Instead, BBG approached Cricket Australia to request that they also contribute to Hot Spot costs - in addition to Channel Nine's input. Unfortunately, Cricket Australia refused to engage with BBG in any shape or form apart from an initial phone call saying that this was a Channel Nine and ICC matter."This disappointed BBG greatly as the cricket boards in England, New Zealand and South Africa all contribute to Hot Spot costs in addition to the local broadcasters."BBG completely accepts and understands Channel Nine's decision in regard to this matter. Conversely BBG finds it difficult to understand Cricket Australia's stance on the matter."Brennan added that his company are continuing to develop the product.He said: "The critical point in regard to this matter from BBG's perspective is to continue to undertake research and development to improve the Hot Spot product."What I learned out of the UK this year is that the system needs to be improved continually."There's new technology coming out all the time. And as we can see from everyday instances - from our mobile phones - things improve dramatically month by month, year by year."A Cricket Australia spokesman was quoted as saying: "We don't think it's appropriate to comment on discussions between Nine and one of its partners."</body>

      <title>US eyes World Cup hosting chance</title>
      <description>The US Soccer Federation says it would like to host the World Cup again, but is not seeking compensation over the controversy surrounding the 2022 event.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24464440</url>
      <date>1381322410</date>
      <body>The United States Soccer Federation (USSF) says it would be interested in hosting the World Cup football tournament again.The country last held the event in 1994, in front of sell-out crowds. Since then, the team reached the World Cup quarter-finals in 2002.The US, a regular qualifier for the tournament, recently went through to the 2014 competition in Brazil.It was one of the losing bidders for the 2022 World Cup.The others were South Korea, Japan and Australia."We would be interested in hosting it again - the next one that would be available is 2026," said Sunil Gulati, president of the USSF and a member of Fifa's executive committee.But following the furore surrounding the way in which the 2018 and 2022 World Cups were awarded, he admitted that "the bidding process needs to improve".Mr Gulati said the US would not be following Australia in seeking compensation over any move by Fifa to move that 2022 event - to be held in Qatar - to the winter.Australian FA chairman Frank Lowy has said Fifa should provide "just and fair" compensation to losing bidders if the World Cup is moved from the summer."We have not discussed it," Mr Gulati said at the Leaders in Football conference in London."It was a difficult decision, a controversial decision [by Fifa], " he added.He said one of the weaknesses of the US bid might have been that it had hosted the event as recently as 1994, but a strength was that it had all necessary stadiums already in place to host a World Cup.The Australian football association, the FFA, spent A$43m (£25m) on its dual bid to host either the 2018 or 2022 World Cups, with most of the cash provided by the government.But Fifa has indicated there is little chance of Australia being awarded compensation.On any proposed 2022 move to winter, Mr Gulati said it would "be nonsense to rush" a decision.Turning to the US again, he said that should the World Cup be moved to January or February, then Fifa would have to engage in discussions with American TV broadcasters.In the first two months of the year, the NFL American Football season comes to a climax, providing a ratings winner for the US networks.Mr Gulati said there would need to be "a thoroughly vetted study" looking at all existing commercial contracts around the 2022 event, including those between Fifa and US broadcasters.And he said there was no chance of Fifa asking the NFL to move its season to fit in with the football World Cup.</body>

      <title>The UK housing market - in graphics</title>
      <description>Figures show the story of the UK housing market</description>

      <body>The UK's housing boom ended in 2008 as the banking crisis and credit crunch bit.In the subsequent years, sales and prices fell in most areas, leaving some people in negative equity. Many potential buyers found they were unable to get on to the ladder as risk-averse banks rationed their lending.But 2013 has seen hints of a revival in the housing market, driven in part by signs of the return of first-time buyers.Transactions have risen but the number of homes for sale has failed to match demand in many areas, pushing up prices.Annual increases are now at a level not seen for at least three years.This is an average across the UK, and might not reflect the fact that prices and activity are growing in some major cities - most notably London - but are still falling in some areas.Increasing prices create a fresh headache for first-time buyers trying to raise the deposit for a home, even though mortgage rates remain at record low levels.But some fundamental issues remain for the UK housing market that will affect the chances of people being able to buy or sell in the longer term.Firstly, the UK remains rather obsessed with the idea of borrowing to own a home compared with the rest of Europe.Ownership levels, for mortgaged properties, are higher than most of the EU with the exception mainly of Scandinavian countries.Yet there is widespread agreement that there are not enough homes being built to match this demand.The number of new homes being built and finished fell then stalled during the financial crisis. Only now do builders say it is starting to pick up again, helped in part by government schemes aimed at kick-starting the market.But the pace of building means the housing stock is not keeping up with population growth.Looking to the future, properties are going to have fewer people living in them, partly owing to the fact we are living for longer - creating even more of a squeeze for young people hoping to buy a home of their own.</body>

      <title>What happens in a US debt default?</title>
      <description>What happens if the US stops paying its bills?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24453400</url>
      <date>1381418348</date>
      <body>If US politicians cannot agree to raise the borrowing limit, the US could default on its debt by the end of October.The US Treasury has issued a dire warning of the possible consequences."There might be a financial crisis and recession that could echo the events of 2008 or worse," it said in a recent report.But how can the world's largest economy stop paying its bills?Here's what happens when the tap is turned off.At its most basic level, a default is when a person or an entity cannot repay a debt on time. For instance, when a person can't make a payment on a mortgage or a car loan.When a country does this, it's known as a sovereign default. This is when the country cannot repay its debt, which typically takes the form of bonds.So if the US were to default, it would essentially stop paying the money it owed US Treasury bond holders.A quick refresher: the US government spends more money than it collects in taxes. So to make up the shortfall it raises funds by asking investors to buy US Treasury bonds. Investors, such as the Chinese government and pension funds, do this because these bonds are seen as a safe place to invest money.No one really knows exactly what would happen, but the likelihood is that markets around the world would plunge and global interest rates would rise.This is because if the US government could not repay the money it owed bondholders, the value of the bonds would decrease and the yield - the amount an investor would pay to hold less-safe debt - would rise.This would prompt interest rates around the world, which are often tied to those of US Treasuries, to spike.US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has warned that if a deal to increase the nation's borrowing isn't reached, the Treasury will exhaust the current extraordinary measures being used to pay the nation's bills by 17 October. These bills include not just the interest on bonds but things like Social Security and veteran benefits.Mr Lew has insisted no one really knows what will happen if and when the money runs out.The US Treasury will still be taking in revenue in the form of tax receipts, so it could pay some bills, but possibly not all of them.The most obvious option - to prioritise payments to bondholders so that the US would not be in default - has been ruled out by the Obama administration, and might technically be illegal, according to a study by Columbia Law professors.Ideally, though, the Treasury would use the money from tax receipts - which would still be flowing into its coffers after the debt ceiling is breached - to pay only the interest it owes on bonds that have already been issued.Strangely, no one really knows exactly how it works.Each day, the US Treasury receives a little over two million bills from various federal agencies.According to analysts at Credit Suisse, there are three main offices that pay those bills: the Department of Defense Disbursing Offices, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service and the Financial Management Service.Technically, the payment systems can be turned on - to make payments - or off - but not much else.If prioritisation were possible, the US Treasury would probably turn off the tap at the Department of Defense Disbursing Offices and the Financial Management Service. That would leave the Bureau of Fiscal Service, known colloquially as the Fedwire, which pays money to bondholders.There are quite a few coming up in the next month; the biggest ones are due on 1 November.After 17 October, the US government will only have around 68% of the funds it needs to pay its bills for the next month, according to a report by the Bipartisan Policy Center.This means that technically, the government could continue to pay some bills.However, daily revenue intake can fluctuate wildly, making it difficult to plan.Not really.There are three examples in US history that come close to default, with the most recent occurring in 1979.Then, the US Treasury inadvertently defaulted on $122m due to what it said was a word processing error.Though the error was quickly fixed, and even though $122m was a tiny fraction of the $800bn in debt that the Treasury had at the time, a study found that the mini-default raised the cost of borrowing by 0.6%, or $6bn a year.The other two instances, in 1933 and in 1790, both involve defaults akin to the current situation in Greece, when creditors were forced to take less money than what they were owed. Some economists have defined this as a default, but it's murky territory.</body>

      <description>Should France follow the UK on Sunday trading?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24458571</url>
      <date>1381401662</date>
      <body>Almost twenty years ago, a bitter war was fought over the future of Britain's Sundays - and today France is mired in a similar battle. But how has shopping on a Sunday re-shaped British society and do the French really have anything to fear?In November 1993, protesters from across much of the UK (although not Scotland) were confident they could keep big shops closed on Sundays.Outside Parliament they raised placards reading "Don't give in to supermarket greed" and "No government can change the laws of God".Things always appeared very different across the Channel. The French had always seemed to grasp the notion of work-life balance - in British imagination at least, reserving their weekends for red wine and serene lunches.Not everybody in the UK shared that desire for a day of rest, however. "About 50 years ago Sundays were completely dead," says Joe Moran, a cultural historian.Once, pubs had to close between 3-7pm on a Sunday, and theatres and cinemas were closed altogether. Those rules were steadily relaxed in the years that intervened, but by the early 90s most shops were still banned from trading on Sundays.Michael Schluter, founder of the Keep Sunday Special campaign, wanted to keep it that way, and lobbied MPs to support his movement. In December 1993, a vote in the House of Commons saw Schluter's vision defeated by just 18 votes. The following year all restrictions were removed from small shops, and those "over 280 square meters" in size were allowed to trade for six hours each Sunday.Today you only need to stand in a DIY superstore in a desolate retail park on a Sunday morning to see how things have changed. Customers gather in the store in the half-hour "browsing time" before the tills open, glancing over expectantly, ready to pounce. Their day is built around a visit to a big shop."It's fairly obvious that Sunday is a huge trading day in this country in spite of the fact that it's limited to six hours," says Richard Perks of market research firm Mintel.The British Retail Consortium says it is second only to Saturday for footfall and total sales - and is the biggest day in terms of hourly sales, as customers try to squeeze their shopping into the six hour window.While the UK has opened its shops on Sunday since 1994, the French have managed to keep most of theirs closed.It's easy to conjure up a vision of a stereotypical French Sunday and imagine families hiking through the Fontainebleau forest, cycling to the Bois de Boulogne park, or rounding off their poulet roti with a freshly baked tarte aux fraises.But now 20 years after the British battle was settled, a similar quarrel is bubbling in France, where different groups of workers take to the streets of Paris to argue both sides of the case. Its tangled web of regulations has been dubbed a "millefeuille" by the press - after the intricate, multi-layered, French pastry of the same name.Shops in designated tourist zones can open, as can garden centres and small owner-operated shops. Those selling food are permitted half a day's trading. For the most part, though, major retailers are forced to close all day, which has angered many business leaders, and some of their workers too.Castorama and Leroy Merlin - two major French DIY chains - have chosen to defy the ban, opening their doors to shoppers on the day of rest, and their employees have backed them. They have held "Yes Weekend" demonstrations to argue for their right to work.In the UK, there seems to be a particular link between Sunday leisure and home improvement.On a typical British Sunday, streams of family cars wait patiently for a space beneath IKEA's blue and yellow facade, trundling out hours later with open boots tied down by rope.It isn't just shopping that has turned Sundays upside down. The proliferation of televised sport has also contributed to a steady erosion of the distinction between the first and second days of the weekend. Schluter is convinced that the UK has lost something along the way, however.Besides small shops that have suffered from increased competition, family ties have been damaged too, he says. "There's a psychological shift which is hard to pin down or measure… towards an attitude that is less about the value of people and relationships and more about material goods."But the example of the British reforms is an inspiration to some French campaigners. Jerome Dubus of MEDEF, a consortium of French business leaders, says that reforms are overdue. "We are one of the last countries that haven't allowed Sunday work, we are behind as usual. I was a student in England 30 years ago. On Sundays everything was closed, there was nothing going on, we didn't know what to do, and the English were attached to it. But now it has changed a lot."Of course, the unions disagree. Christophe Le Comte, of Force Ouvriere, says that the move is just another example of employers trying to exploit their staff. "They are increasing the length of the working day, they are pushing back the age of retirement," he says. Le Comte bemoans the lack of employment protection in the UK and says Sunday trading had "disastrous consequences" for small businesses in the UK.Some change looks likely. The French government has now commissioned a review into the regulations, but whether it will endorse wholesale reform or add more layers to the pastry is difficult to know.Anne-Elisabeth Moutet, a French columnist for the British Daily Telegraph, thinks the unions are projecting a romantic notion of life in the country that is essentially a fiction."They describe a kind of idealised France of the 1950s in which everybody has got 2.3 children, and a dog, and a little house, and the children organise Sunday lunch for all members of the family."But half the households in large cities are single person households… so what they're describing is something that doesn't exist anymore."Trish Deseine, a food writer in Paris, has a very different outlook, and the city she describes will still sound appealing to the UK's Keep Sunday Special campaigners, who are still campaigning."If you walk by Montparnasse, you will see big family reunions in the restaurants," she says. "There is a definite distinction between Sunday and the rest of the week. There is a sense of occasion. It is quieter and more family oriented. I really hope it stays this way."She does not think the restrictions can last forever, but seems determined that change should at least be delayed."Eventually France will have to come around. The French are dragging their heels into a modern way of life, but I think it is a good thing that we are standing against it."Should France follow the UK and allow shops to open on Sundays?

      <title>How useful are MBAs to a new company?</title>
      <description>How important is it that a start-up entrepreneur has an MBA?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24335894</url>
      <date>1381359725</date>
      <body>For many would-be entrepreneurs, getting a Master of Business Administration (MBA) qualification is seen as essential.Yet with the most prestigious MBA courses in the US costing more than $100,000 (£62,000) in tuition fees alone, they don't come come cheaply.But does the celebrated qualification, and its teaching of a wide range of business skills, give its holders a big advantage when they set up their first firms?Or would people be better off if they instead simply went straight to setting up in business and learning on the job?Eoin Bara, owner of Dublin-based design agency V7, was pleased to be able to call on the assistance of someone with an MBA.Back in 2012, the company was facing a problem - it was growing too fast.With big clients including Intel and Goldman Sachs, V7 went from two to 12 employees in six months.Mr Bara says he didn't know how to manage this growth.So he decided to ask an MBA-qualified management consultant to come in and take an objective look at the company, and guide them on what they needed to do next.The MBA was able to show where the company was making losses, how they could make better use of their time, and how to plan for the future."We got more clarity on the day-to-day, which allowed us to focus on the future," says Mr Bara. "We didn't use to focus on the future at all."While author and journalist Philip Delves Broughton acknowledges the benefits of an MBA, he also thinks the cost can be a serious impediment.Mr Broughton wrote the book Ahead of the Curve, which outlines his experience on the MBA programme at Harvard Business School."One of the worst things you can do as an entrepreneur, starting young and getting going, is saddle yourself with a load of debt," he says."That's a disaster, because it really hobbles you," he adds, referring to tuition fees of more than $55,000 (£34,000) per year for his two-year programme at Harvard.The high cost of an MBA was a major reason why American tech entrepreneur Brendan Mulligan dropped out of his course at Northwestern University in Illinois.Mr Mulligan is the co-founder of Cluster, a mobile phone app which enables people to share photo albums.He calculates that he was spending $150 (£90) per hour on the MBA, and does not think it was worth it. He left roughly halfway through the course having spent around $45,000 (£28,000)."I just didn't get much of a return to investment on that money compared to other ways I've spent money supporting myself being an entrepreneur," explains Mr Mulligan, who is now based in San Francisco.He suggests budding tech entrepreneurs actually get experience in their field by joining or doing an internship at a small start-up first, rather than sign up for an MBA course.By contrast, London-based business investor Reshma Sohoni is firmly in the pro-MBA camp.Ms Sohoni, co-founder of technology start-up investment fund Seedcamp, says that if a new business is to do well, having someone on board with an MBA is crucial."Any organisation that's really gotten anywhere has MBA talent," says Ms Sohoni, who has an MBA herself.Ms Sohoni finds that from her experience, people with MBAs have a better sense of how to make a business more commercial, and have a much better understanding of running a business in general.It is something that some other entrepreneurs with MBAs agree with, including Andrew Carroll, who co-founded the e-receipts company Paperless Receipts.Having completed his MBA at the Cass Business School in London, Mr Carroll, 34, says he has a good understanding of a broad range of business concepts."I wouldn't be able to do what I'm doing now without having it, because it gives you a lot of knowledge about everything," he says."So I can now sit happily in a meeting with a hedge fund manager or with a marketing director or a finance director. I may not know everything they talk about but I'll know most of it."For entrepreneur Tobias van Amstel, 29, experience is more than important than having an MBA.The Dutchman is based in London, where he co-founded Signkick, an online booking platform for advertising on billboards."I would advise everybody just to get started and fail at your first company and learn as much as you can and then start your second company," he says."That was actually the best education I could think of to start Signkick," he says of his first business, a hotel booking website."The things I learnt there were so much more valuable than what any education could have taught me."But despite much encouragement for young people with ideas to just start their own enterprises, American entrepreneur and seed investor Alex Hoye, 44, is sceptical.He spent several years working at Disney and McKinsey before doing an MBA at Harvard in the early 1990s, and is now based in London."I think there's a huge value to not learning everything the hard way," he suggests.Mr Hoye believes prior experience is hugely important for entrepreneurs, and this can be gained either through work or through an MBA programme."I'm against the popular notion that one should just get out and do it," he says. "I disagree. I think you can learn a lot of the hard knocks by working with pros, or getting an MBA."He thinks the practice of going over case studies during an MBA is especially helpful in recognising patterns and successful business practices.But despite these useful skills, Mr Hoye does question the high cost."To be honest, there's a very good chance I would give it a miss if I were 26 now," he says.</body>

      <title>Life in Hungary's 'debtors' village'</title>
      <description>Hungarians helped to start new lives</description>

      <body>"The only luxury we allow ourselves," says Janos Ofella, 54, as he studies the special offers in the supermarket advertisement, "is coffee."Not counting basics such as cooking oil, flour and sugar, his family of five spends 43 euros ($58; £36) a week on food.That is rather typical in a country where 1.5 million people out of a population of 10 million could not afford to properly warm their homes last winter.But what is unusual about Janos and his family is that they have a new home, paid for by the state, when their mortgage payments to the bank on their old home became unaffordable.Already 43 families have already moved into this purpose-built village 30km (19 miles) south of Budapest.Each family was selected by the Hungarian Maltese Charity Service, on the basis of criteria that included having children and being sufficiently ambitious to find work.The village is a unique and controversial social experiment, but Janos, who is physically handicapped, has only praise for the initiative."My wife found work quickly, my children settled in to the school. There is already a good community here," he says.He and his family ran heavily into debt in their old home in Tokod, in western Hungary - just one of more than a million households who fell foul of mortgages denominated in foreign currencies when the economic crisis struck in 2008.Interest rates in Hungarian forints had been traditionally high, and in the first years of the new millennium as money flooded the world markets, parent banks abroad encouraged their subsidiaries in Hungary to make available cheap loans, denominated in Swiss francs in particular.Back in 2007 there were 150 forints to the Swiss franc, but today there are 250 to the Swiss franc, and more than one in five can no longer keep up with their monthly payments.Hungarian households now owe about 10bn euros to the banks, with companies and local councils owing another 8bn euros.Janos and his family pay about half the rent they would expect to for a house of this size. The Maltese charity also gives advice on finding work and retraining.If a family can afford a car, Budapest is only half an hour away on the motorway. In the window of the charity office, there is even an advertisement for construction workers.Nevertheless, the initiative has been savaged by opposition parties and all but the staunchly pro-government media, as a "debtors' ghetto".There is no shop, post office, creche or school, and gas was not provided following fears the families would not be able to pay their bills.Apart from the school bus, few other buses connect the estate with the town of Ocsa, 6km away. Much criticism has also been directed at the social stigma those living in the estate might feel, lumped together in one place for all the world to see.Because of such negative media attention, few inhabitants are willing to be interviewed. Partly in consequence, there is little demand, for the time being, for the 37 homes that are still empty.The government, though, is proud of its project, and defends it fiercely."You have to see the housing estate in the context of a wide raft of measures designed to help those in trouble with foreign currency mortgages," says Erika Asztalos, Deputy State Secretary at the Ministry for Human Resources."It was devised to keep families together who had either lost their homes, or were in danger of that happening."Other measures already taken by the Fidesz government include a moratorium on evictions, and the artificial fixing of the exchange rates in 2011 to allow those who could pay off their debts with a single lump sum - usually borrowed from relatives - to do so.Some 160,000 people took advantage of that scheme.A state property-handling agency has also been established, to buy property from people who would otherwise have been evicted and their property auctioned by the banks.The former owners are then allowed to continue living there, paying a low rent. The agency has already bought or is in the process of buying 11,400 homes.Some debtors have also taken the banks to court for misleading them in the first place over foreign-currency loans, or for quietly changing the terms without consulting with the customers.This week in the southern town of Pecs, Gyorgy Lehmann, a lawyer who is playing a prominent role in the "battle with the banks" won a landmark case.The government has given the banks until the end of October to come up with a proposal to resolve the problem once and for all."The banks have been very, very slow to come to terms with the problem, and the strong regulatory tradition established in the UK and the US after 2008 has not yet been established in Hungary,' says Peter Rona a member of the supervisory board of the Hungarian National Bank."What I think the banks are now fearful of is that you are starting to see a series of court decisions which will create a particular trend that is highly inimical to their interests."Their ability to foreclose real estate - on the property that was used as collateral - is also being increasingly constrained, in part by court decisions," he says.As a result, believes Mr Rona, the banks are interested in reaching a deal with the government.The dispute is over how the burden should be distributed between the debtors, the banks, and the state.Back in his new home, Janos says he has no regrets."Of course, we had fears before we came, but none of them have been realised. The whole family are glad we came here, to start a new life."</body>

      <title>Profile: Janet Yellen</title>
      <description>The woman with a cool head set to lead the Federal Reserve</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24263548</url>
      <date>1381315095</date>
      <body>Workers in the US retire on average at the age of 61.At 67, it would seem that Janet Yellen is just getting started.The expected new head of the US Federal Reserve has been second in command to the current governor, Ben Bernanke, for the last three years.Now after a protracted appointment process, Ms Yellen looks set to take on arguably the biggest job in the world economy.So who is the woman who would be the first female to take charge of the US central bank?Janet Yellen was born in 1946 in Brooklyn, New York. Her father was a family doctor and her mother taught at a local junior school.She was a star pupil at high school and won a place to study maths at Brown University, but quickly changed to economics, a subject she saw as more practically useful.While studying for a doctorate at Yale she was mentored by James Tobin, a Nobel prize winner famous for his ideas on taxation.Her first job was at Harvard in 1971 where she was an assistant professor, going on to teach Larry Summers. He was initially favoured by the White House to head the Federal Reserve, until opposition from liberal Democrats forced him to withdraw his name from consideration in September.Ms Yellen's first job at the Fed brought her not only experience of working at the world's most influential central bank, it also introduced her to her future husband, the economist George Akerlof, in 1977.The romance went into fast forward and within a year the couple were married, had both resigned from the Fed and had taken up teaching roles at the London School of Economics.Lord Desai, emeritus professor of economics at LSE, remembers the couple making quite an impact on both students and lecturers."George Akerlof is a complete genius - an economist who is always thinking out of the box. He's the closest person to Woody Allen that I know."Janet was a very serious person and a very good economist. But I think at the time people underrated her as she was 'just' George Akerlof's wife."Work life and domestic life started to merge for the couple and they started to collaborate on academic research."Not only did our personalities mesh perfectly, but we have also always been in all but perfect agreement about macroeconomics," Mr Akerlof wrote in a biographical note after winning the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2001.The couple returned to the US in the early 1980s, both taking academic jobs in San Francisco.Together they conducted research on subjects ranging from out-of-wedlock childbearing to the economic reunification of Germany.Ms Yellen's big break came in 1994 when she was appointed as a member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve.She held the position until 1997 when she was appointed by President Bill Clinton to become chair of his Council of Economic Advisers.Her burgeoning career restricted her time at home with her son Robert, resulting in her husband eventually taking leave from his job to "perform household duties" as he put it. (Robert later followed in his parents' footsteps and is now an assistant professor in economics at the University of Warwick in the UK.)Ms Yellen took on the role as the Fed's eyes and ears on the west coast when she became head of the San Francisco branch of the central bank in 2004.The minutes from Federal Reserve meetings show that she did consider the possibility of a property market bubble as early as 2005, but along with the rest of the Fed committee failed to predict the scale of the financial crisis that started in 2007."She was one of the people that did raise alarm bells, but I think like many others who saw the problems coming she did not anticipate the magnitude of the difficulties," according to Joseph Stiglitz, the economist who shared the 2001 Nobel Prize with Mr Akerlof, and who knows Ms Yellen well."That was a very different attitude from many in the mainstream who saw absolutely no problem right up until the crisis," Mr Stiglitz told the BBC.Her position at the San Francisco Fed gave her greater exposure to the mechanics of decision making at the Federal Reserve and in 2009 she became a voting member of the interest rate setting committee, the Federal Open Markets Committee.By 2010 she had become a respected international emissary for the Fed, representing US economic policy at meetings across the world.Her hard work was rewarded when she was appointed vice-chair of the board of governors at the Fed replacing Donald Kohn, who went on to join the Bank of England.Much is likely to be made of her being the first woman to lead the Fed, arguably the second most important job in the US after the president.Prof Andrew Rose from the Haas School of Business taught with Ms Yellen at the University of California, Berkeley.He says he hopes the fact that she has broken a "glass ceiling" does not detract from her personal achievement in getting the president's nomination."She is the most qualified person in the world for this job. The fact that she's a woman is an additional plus but it's her suitability as the next Fed chairman that I think people should concentrate on."It could be that in a few years the two most important positions in the country are filled by women," says Mr Rose.So what's Janet Yellen like when she's not worrying about quantitative easing and unemployment statistics?"She's a shy person, but she can also be extremely funny. She likes a glass of wine and is an extremely good cook - her speciality is lamb chops," says Prof Rose.And for someone taking on such a huge role as Fed chairman, she has shown that she doesn't panic during a crisis situation."We were in the same room during the huge 1989 earthquake which hit San Francisco," Prof Rose recalls."We thought the building was going to collapse and I was convinced we were going to die. But Janet just stayed remarkably calm during the whole thing."</body>

      <description>Ofsted inspectors have strongly criticised the standards of education and training in England's prisons.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24460085</url>
      <date>1381407494</date>
      <body>Ofsted inspectors have strongly criticised standards of education and training in England's prisons.The watchdog says it is unacceptable that not one prison has been rated "outstanding" for education in the past four years and only one in three is rated "good".At Wormwood Scrubs jail in London, Ofsted chiefs said if the figures related to schools there would be a "national outcry".Ministers say reforms are under way.In a speech at the prison, Matthew Coffey, national director of further education and skills at Ofsted, said the aim of training and education in jail should be to make people less likely to go back to crime when they got out."This year's annual lecture aims to focus on how we can reduce the high re-offending rates that are nearly 50% for adult prisoners and 72% for juveniles," he said."The aim is to reduce the number of re-offenders by focusing on rehabilitation in prisons through better employer engagement and better teaching and training."Levels of education among prisoners are generally much lower than in the population as a whole.Some studies suggest half of men in UK jails and nearly three-quarters of female prisoners have no qualifications at all, while about half have literacy skills below that of most eleven-year-olds. Many have been expelled from school.Mr Coffey said: "Far too many prisoners leave prison without employability skills, meaning they are less likely to find a job. Research shows that being in employment is one of the key factors that can reduce the risk of re-offending by between 30% and 50%. However, examples of good training provision in prisons were all too scarce."Clearly, reducing the number of those re-offending is in everyone's interests. Every prisoner costs the taxpayer the same as sending a child to Eton, around £34,000 per year. We must now focus on improvement of prisoners' vocational and employability skills to ensure we support them on their journey out of prison and into employment to break the cycle of re-offending."He added that there were "outstanding examples" of prisons working with employers, education providers and other bodies to help prisoners develop vocational skills, but that those examples, were "all too scarce".Education in prisons in England and Wales is provided by private bodies which bid for contracts.Prisons Minister Jeremy Wright said: "Re-offending rates have been too high for too long and we are introducing significant reforms to the way offenders are rehabilitated and managed in the community."We are committed to improving education in prison and are working with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Skills Funding Agency to develop prisoner learning."In most countries in the European Union, only about one in four adult prisoners takes part in education, according to a report for the EU published earlier this year, out of 640,000 inmates.In England and Wales, the proportion is higher, with an estimated 42% receiving some kind of prison education, which has to be provided by law.The EU report said prisons were all too often "environments for negative learning" when they could be offering people a second chance.According to the University and College Union, which represents many prison teachers and trainers, the "constant re-tendering" for education contracts brings problems, including a high turnover of staff and instability.They say because providers are paid by results, some teachers feel under pressure to limit courses to certain offenders and those in for longer terms.</body>

      <title>Free school head teacher, 27, quits</title>
      <description>A 27-year-old head teacher whose appointment to a new central London free school was criticised has quit the post, the school says.</description>

      <body>A head teacher whose appointment to a new free school was criticised has quit her post weeks after starting.Pimlico Primary, which opened in September, said Annaliese Briggs, 27, had left the job to "pursue other opportunities in primary education".Miss Briggs was appointed in April as the head while still studying for her postgraduate certificate in education.Labour councillors in Westminster said governors may be regretting appointing someone with "no teaching experience".The primary school opened at the site of Pimlico Academy in Lupus Street, central London, with 60 pupils and aims to have 420 pupils by 2019.Pimlico Primary is sponsored by Future Academies, a charity founded by Lord Nash and his wife Caroline.A statement from Pimlico Primary said: "Having successfully set up Pimlico Primary, Annaliese Briggs has decided to leave Future Academies to pursue other opportunities in primary education."A new principal of Pimlico Primary has been appointed. Coming from within the group, our new principal is already known to the pupils and families of Pimlico Primary, and brings over 10 years' experience in both early years and leadership."We are delighted that Annaliese will continue to support Pimlico Primary as it grows by becoming a governor."Miss Briggs is completing a school-centred initial teacher training (SCITT) course in Wandsworth and will qualify with a postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE).She previously said she has classroom experience from teaching primary school children in supplementary schools and had been chosen to lead the school for her curriculum expertise.Reacting to the news that Miss Briggs has stepped down, leader of the Labour group at Westminster Council Councillor Paul Dimoldenberg said: "Being the head of an inner-London school is a tough job which can sometimes be very stressful."By appointing someone with no teaching experience or experience in running a school, the Pimlico academy governors might now consider that this is a decision they now regret."I hope that Ms Briggs' commitment to education is undiminished and wish her well in her future career."The Department for Education said it was a matter for the school.</body>

      <description>Training teachers to deliver classes in body image improves the self-esteem of teenage girls, a UK study shows.</description>

      <body>The self-esteem of teenage girls could be improved by training teachers to deliver classes in body image, a UK study shows.In the pilot study, 261 teenage girls at three secondary schools were given a course of six lessons on body image.This had significant effects on their body image and self-esteem compared with the regular curriculum, say psychologists at King's College London.As many as one in three teenagers say they are dissatisfied with their body.Poor body image has been associated with depression, eating disorders, overuse of cosmetic surgery, obesity and unhealthy weight loss behaviours.Dr Helen Sharpe and colleagues at the Institute of Psychiatry developed a course on positive body image for teenage girls.The six-part programme focused on ideals of beauty, unhealthy interactions with peers - such as "fat talking", or making negative comments about weight - and practical measures for boosting mood and self-esteem.The course was delivered by teachers in three state-funded girls' schools.Dr Sharpe told the BBC: "We have tested whether a series of lessons being delivered by teachers to students in school are helpful in improving body esteem - we found this was the case."She said the research, published in The British Journal of Psychiatry, showed promise in being able to tackle problems caused by low body esteem, such as eating disorders."We're hopeful that as we continue with this research we'll be able to make the programme even more effective and that it could then go on to be effective in reducing disordered eating - things like binge eating and unhelpful weight loss," said Dr Sharpe.Interventions delivered by teachers would have wide reach and be of minimal cost, said the researchers.Some schools were relying on programmes that were not evidence-based and could be harmful, they added.Last year, MPs recommended that all schoolchildren should take part in compulsory body image and self-esteem lessons.An inquiry by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Body Image heard evidence that more than half of the public had a negative body image.Girls as young as five now worried about how they looked, the MPs' report said, while cosmetic surgery rates had increased by nearly 20% since 2008.</body>

      <title>Pupils 'not fed enough at school'</title>
      <description>Some children are not being given enough food at a county's schools leading them to snack and lose concentration in lessons, an assembly member warns.</description>

      <body>Some pupils are not being given enough food at Powys primary schools causing them to snack and lose concentration in lessons, an assembly member has warned.Montgomeryshire AM Russell George said parents and governors had told him 11-year-olds were being given the same portion sizes as four-year-olds.He claimed second helpings had also been banned and he intended to raise the issue with Powys council's leader.The authority said its meals met Welsh government requirements.Mr George said the issue was brought to his attention by a number of people across the county who he said felt the "extreme" school meals policy was leading to more snacking and bad dietary choices.He said the policy dictated that all primary school children received the same portion of food, regardless of age.And he said he had been told that second helpings of lunch had been stopped as the council tried to reduce waste."Parents are telling me that their children are coming home hungry, which then causes them to snack before their evening meal, all of which isn't lending itself to children leading healthy lifestyles," said the Conservative AM."Children of 10 and 11 years of age are clearly going to require different levels of nutrition to those of four and five-year-olds... this isn't rocket science."One chair of governors at a primary school in the county claimed more parents were switching their children to packed lunches because they no longer felt the school meals were offering value for money.He said he became concerned after noticing his own 10-year-old son was coming home from school hungry and that a number of other parents had raised the issue with him."I then raised it at a governor's meeting and was told that catering staff had been told that as of the start of this term additional food was not to be given," he said."I have spoken to the principal catering officer at the council and he said the rationale behind this was that he felt some schools were over-producing food."Also I think the thought is that by giving children seconds they're not going to have the balanced meal they should be getting."But what follows from that is that if you get wastage down to zero you have pupils going hungry as the portion sizes are the same for four to 11-year-olds."He said teachers were concerned that it was leading to poorer concentration from some pupils."The council's saying that all the pupils should get the same portion sizes as everyone pays the same but I think it's leading to some parents feeling that they are no longer getting value for money and are giving their children packed lunches instead," he added.A spokesperson for Powys council said dishes on school menus met the requirements of the Welsh government's Appetite for Life scheme, which aims to improve the nutritional standards of food and drink served in schools across Wales."As part of this scheme, there are recommended guidelines regarding the size of the portions. These portions have been analysed to ensure they meet the nutritional standards set out in the scheme," the spokesperson said."When planning school meals, the number of pupils who have school meals is always taken into consideration to ensure that school cooks do not over produce food and remain within their budgets."However, there will always be cases where food is left on the servery as pupils can choose whether they want a particular food on a school menu."If there is food left over, we have now advised school cooks to give out second helpings if there are pupils who want it."But we cannot overproduce food so that second helpings can be provided as this has a cost implication and also second portions are not taken into consideration when the menus are nutritionally analysed."A Welsh government spokesperson said: "We would never want to see children having school meals going hungry."We've given primary schools guidance on portion sizes which cater for changing nutritional requirements as children get older. So a child in year six would have a larger portion than a child in reception."</body>

      <title>University regulation 'inadequate'</title>
      <description>A lack of regulation of England's universities means students are at risk of attending failing institutions, the Higher Education Commission says.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24447151</url>
      <date>1381281659</date>
      <body>A lack of regulation of England's universities means students are at risk of attending failing institutions, the Higher Education Commission (HEC) says.The HEC says current checks are not adequate for a sector that has a new funding system in the wake of higher tuition fees introduced last year.It says the situation could threaten the UK's higher education reputation.The government says a "robust but proportionate" regulatory system is needed.The HEC - an independent body made up of leaders from the education sector, business and the three main political parties - conducted its research over an eight-month period and concludes that current regulation is too "piecemeal".The commission says that the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce), which distributes the teaching grant to universities, was previously able to attach regulatory conditions to the grant.But now that the teaching grant has been reduced and is being replaced with increased student tuition fees since 2012, the ability to regulate universities through Hefce has been reduced in turn.Its report - Regulating Higher Education - says all degree providers in England should be "captured" by proper regulation.It says: "It [higher education] is a valuable part of our national infrastructure and we must therefore ensure that students investing thousands of pounds in their futures are receiving top quality provision, and that the institutions they are attending are financially viable."The HEC study expresses particular concern about newly established higher education providers, saying "more providers are entering the market... and online providers gaining traction"."Regulation as it sits is not adequately prepared for the diversity of these current and future developments."New market entrants are not facing the scrutiny they should, takeovers and complex corporate structures are being used to evade fundamental protections for students, and institutions are facing more pressure than ever to recruit students and crucially, therefore, bring in funding."The report continues: "In this new, reformed higher education landscape, the chances of an institution failing are increased. An institution failing would damage both students and the highly-valued brand of UK higher education."The HEC calls on the government for urgent legislation to tackle the problems.It suggests an overarching regulatory body - the Council for Higher Education (CHE) - should be created, incorporating the current body Hefce, the Office for Fair Access (Offa), the Student Loans Company and a new body called the Office for Competition and Institutional Diversity.The commission also calls for better information about the various degree providers now operating in the UK and says all of these should be subject to a new regulatory framework, with kitemarks for those meeting approved standards.It also proposes an insurance scheme, paid into by every institution, to safeguard students should an institution or course fail.Professor of government at Hull University and HEC inquiry co-chairman Lord Norton of Louth said: "Regulation is fundamental to the health and success of our HE sector and will make or break the effectiveness of the institutions that have made the UK a world leader in higher education."In the context of current reforms, the absence of legislation to provide a coherent regulatory architecture for the rapidly changing and increasingly dynamic sector is creating major headaches for its players."It is a situation crying out for urgent rectification by government, a refrain that was a constant throughout the course of the inquiry from those who gave evidence."Fellow co-chairman and former vice chancellor of Lincoln University Prof Roger King said: "Our proposals seek to build upon the existing regulatory strengths displayed by the sector and to ensure that more external and formalised external regulatory arrangements work with these."Above all, however, we need to urgently address the outstanding requirement for a more systematic and less piecemeal approach to the external regulation of the sector. This can only be achieved by early legislation by government."A spokeswoman for the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills said: "It is essential that there is a robust but proportionate regulatory system in place to protect students and the reputation of the wider sector."At the same time though a balance must be struck to protect institutional autonomy and academic freedom. These elements are key to the success of our university system."When the time comes for legislation we want to get it absolutely right."Prof Les Ebdon, director of Offa, said: "I believe that fair access is too important to be rolled up within the wider concerns of a multi-focused regulatory body."An independent director, with a sole focus on access, can challenge institutions to set themselves stretching widening participation targets and ensure that fair access remains high on the agenda, both for institutions and policy-makers."</body>

      <title>Oxford challenges tuition fee limit</title>
      <description>Oxford University's vice-chancellor questions the long-term sustainability of the £9,000 fixed upper limit for tuition fees.</description>

      <date>1381255629</date>
      <body>Oxford University's vice-chancellor has questioned the long-term sustainability of the £9,000 fixed upper limit for tuition fees.Andrew Hamilton told a university gathering the real cost of an Oxford undergraduate course was £16,000.He asked how a "market" in higher education could operate if everything "regardless of content and quality, is the same price".The university faced an annual funding gap of £70m, said Prof Hamilton.He argued that different types of institutions should be able to charge different levels of fees."Given the great diversity of the institutions in our higher education system, the notion of different universities charging significantly different amounts, doesn't feel inherently unnatural."It is the current situation that seems out of kilter. What matters surely is that an institution's charges are clearly aligned with what it offers and that they are demonstrably not a barrier to student access."A university spokesman said that the speech was not proposing that students would have to pay fees of £16,000 per year to bridge the shortfall.But Prof Hamilton suggested a "system of tuition charges more closely related to the true cost", with the "strongest guarantees" of support for poorer students.Prof Hamilton argued that there needed to be a more sustainable funding model for universities where £9,000 did not cover their costs.He had heard that some universities were "doing very nicely thank you" with fees of £9,000."That may or may not be the case for them, but one thing I am quite sure about is that it doesn't add up for Oxford, where the new regime of increased tuition charges for students, but greatly reduced government spending on teaching, have done little to change the basic financial equation."Along with ideas such as increasing philanthropic donations, he floated the idea of raising funds through issuing bonds to investors.The raising of tuition fees to £9,000 was a highly controversial measure, prompting violent protests and occupations, in the biggest upsurge of student activism for decades.Academics at the University of Oxford passed a symbolic motion of no confidence in Universities Minister David Willetts and his higher education funding reforms.But with the funding changes in place, the speech on Tuesday by Prof Hamilton shows there are still far-reaching financial questions for such leading institutions.How can they compete on an international stage with better-funded rivals?Harvard University's financial figures, released last month, showed the US university has an endowment that has grown to $32.7bn (£20.3bn).A fundraising drive by Harvard, launched last month, aims to raise an additional $6.5bn (£4bn).Last year, Oxford hailed the donation of £75m as "the largest such benefaction for undergraduate financial support in European university history".Responding to the speech, Sally Hunt, general secretary of the UCU lecturers' union said: "Prof Hamilton should perhaps be applauded for going after one of the rawest nerves in politics to try and get higher education funding back in the spotlight - something we fear no party will be keen to do this side of the general election."However, higher university fees are not what this country needs."Prof Hamilton is correct to say our universities need more funding - we invest just 1.4% of GDP on higher education, compared to an international average of 1.7%."However, he is wrong to argue that students should pick up tab when we already have the most expensive fees in Europe."</body>

      <body>The brain has a critical window for language development between the ages of two and four, brain scans suggest.Environmental influences have their biggest impact before the age of four, as the brain's wiring develops to process new words, say UK and US scientists.The research in The Journal of Neuroscience suggests disorders causing language delay should be tackled early.It also explains why young children are good at learning two languages.The scientists, based at King's College London, and Brown University, Rhode Island, studied 108 children with normal brain development between the ages of one and six.They used brain scans to look at myelin - the insulation that develops from birth within the circuitry of the brain.To their surprise, they found the distribution of myelin is fixed from the age of four, suggesting the brain is most plastic in very early life.Any environmental influences on brain development will be strongest in infanthood, they predict.This explains why immersing children in a bilingual environment before the age of four gives them the best chance of becoming fluent in both languages, the research suggests.It also suggests that there is a critical time during development when environmental influence on cognitive skills may be greatest.Dr Jonathan O'Muircheartaigh, from King's College London, led the study.He told the BBC: "Since our work seems to indicate that brain circuits associated with language are more flexible before the age of four, early intervention for children with delayed language attainment should be initiated before this critical age."This may be relevant to many developmental disorders, such as autism, since delayed language is a common early trait."Early childhood is a time when language skills develop very rapidly.Babies have a vocabulary of up to 50 words at 12 months but by the age of six this has expanded to about 5,000 words.Language skills are localised in the frontal areas of the left-hand side of the brain.The researchers therefore expected more myelin to develop in the left-hand side of the brain, as the children learned more language.In fact, they found it remained constant, but had a stronger influence on language ability before the age of four, suggesting there is a crucial window for interventions in developmental disorders."This work is important as it is the first to investigate the relationship between brain structure and language across early childhood and demonstrate how this relationship changes with age," said Dr Sean Deoni from Brown University, a co-researcher on the study."This is important since language is commonly altered or delayed in many developmental disorders, such as autism."Commenting on the study, Prof Dorothy Bishop of the department of Developmental Neuropsychology at the University of Oxford said the research added important new information about early development of connections in brain regions important for cognitive functions."There is suggestive evidence of links with language development but it is too early to be confident about functional implications of the findings," she said."Ideally we would need a longitudinal study following children over time to track how structural brain changes relate to language function."The study was funded by the National Institutes for Mental Health (US) and the Wellcome Trust (UK).</body>

      <title>Baby Peter mother 'can be released'</title>
      <description>The Parole Board says it has directed the release of the mother of Baby Peter, Tracey Connelly.</description>

      <date>1381303393</date>
      <body>The mother of Baby Peter, Tracey Connelly, should be released from jail, the Parole Board has said.She was jailed indefinitely, with a recommended minimum term of five years, in May 2009, for causing or allowing her son's death in north London.A Parole Board panel recommended her release from prison following a second review of her case.The board said arrangements and the date of the release were a matter for Justice Secretary Chris Grayling.A spokesman for Mr Grayling said the Parole Board's decision was final.A statement from the board said: "We can confirm that a three-member panel of the board has directed the release of Tracey Connelly."Tracey Connelly first became eligible for parole in August 2012 and at that time a Parole Board panel made no recommendation to release."Peter died on 3 August 2007 at home in Haringey after months of abuse.He had more than 50 injuries, despite being on the at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers, police and health professionals over eight months.Connelly was jailed with her boyfriend Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen, who were convicted at trial of the same offence.Barker was jailed for life with a minimum of 10 years for raping a two-year-old girl and given a 12-year term to run concurrently for his "major role" in Peter's death.Owen was jailed indefinitely with a minimum three-year term but later won an appeal to lower it to a fixed six-year term.He was freed in August 2011 but was then recalled to prison in April this year.When making its decision, the Parole Board will take into account the nature of the offence, the prisoner's offending history, the prisoner's progress in prison and any statements made on behalf of the victim.Reports from psychologists, probation officers and prison officers are also taken into account.Connelly will remain on licence for the rest of her life and if she breaches any of the conditions, she would most likely be recalled to custody.Conditions can include curfews, restrictions on movements and frequent meetings with an offender manager, said a Ministry of Justice spokesman.</body>

      <title>England lags on young adult literacy</title>
      <description>Young adults in England and Northern Ireland have performed poorly in international tests of literacy and numeracy.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24433320</url>
      <date>1381339350</date>
      <body>Young adults in England have scored among the lowest results in the industrialised world in international literacy and numeracy tests.A major study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows how England's 16 to 24-year-olds are falling behind their Asian and European counterparts.England is 22nd for literacy and 21st for numeracy out of 24 countries.The OECD's Andreas Schleicher warned of a shrinking pool of skilled workers.Unlike other developed countries, the study also showed that young people in England are no better at these tests than older people, in the 55 to 65 age range.When this is weighted with other factors, such as the socio-economic background of people taking the test, it shows that England is the only country in the survey where results are going backwards - with the older cohort better than the younger.The study shows that there are 8.5 million adults in England and Northern Ireland with the numeracy levels of a 10-year-old."This shocking report shows England has some of the least literate and numerate young adults in the developed world," said Skills Minister Matthew Hancock."These are Labour's children, educated under a Labour government and force-fed a diet of dumbing down and low expectations."Ministers in England have announced a new maths qualification for 16 to 18 year olds as part of a drive to improve numeracy and its requirement that maths should be studied until the age 18 for those who do not have a good GCSE in the subject.The newly-appointed shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt defended Labour's record."Labour drove up standards in maths and English across our schools, evident in the huge improvements we saw in GCSE results between 1997 and 2010."He said a future Labour government would "ensure all young people study maths and English to 18" and would not allow "unqualified teachers to teach in our classrooms on a permanent basis".Young adults in Northern Ireland performed better in the OECD tests than in England, but they were also in the bottom half of these rankings.The highest-performing countries among this younger age group were Japan, Finland and the Netherlands. The country with the lowest numeracy skills was the United States, plummeting from once being one of the strongest education systems.This landmark study from the OECD set out to measure the level of skills within the adult population - testing actual ability in literacy, numeracy and digital skills, rather than looking at qualifications.It involved 166,000 adults taking tests in 24 education systems, representing populations of 724 million people. From the UK, adults in England and Northern Ireland participated.The study looked at the level of skills across the adult population, between the ages of 16 and 65. England and Northern Ireland are below average for both literacy and numeracy, in league tables headed by Japan and Finland.But for most industrialised countries the younger population are much better at such tests than the older generations.Mr Schleicher pointed to the examples of Finland and South Korea where there had been huge progress in recent decades.A statement from the Finnish embassy highlighted that this was about a long term commitment to improving schools."This demonstrates that there is a longer trend in the Finnish education success, it is not just something that has happened in recent years."However, for England, when the results are separated from Northern Ireland, there was a different and unusual pattern, with almost no advance in test results between the 55 to 65-year-olds and those aged 16 to 24.This younger group will have many more qualifications, but the test results show that these younger people have no greater ability than those approaching retirement who left schools with much lower qualifications in the 1960s and 1970s.The grandchildren are not any better at these core skills than their grandparents.Mr Schleicher says it might suggest evidence of grade inflation and it shows that better qualifications do not necessarily mean better skills."When you look at this snapshot you do have to conclude that these young people are not any better skilled when it comes to those foundation skills than people in the older generation," he said.He warned of the serious economic implications of a failure to provide a skilled workforce.The influential OECD expert showed how there was an increasing demand in the jobs market for those with higher skills - and a static or falling jobs market for those with lower skills.England and Northern Ireland have particularly high levels of adults with the lowest skill level in literacy and numeracy.The economic and social rewards for having high skills are particularly strong in England and Northern Ireland, says the research, with significant advantages in health, job opportunities and income.The global economic race is strongly linked to educational performance and the OECD report shows how the UK's share of the highest skilled workers is falling.An even sharper decline is faced by the United States, an education superpower of a previous generation. Last year the OECD warned that the US was almost the only developed country facing educational "downward mobility", where the younger population is less well educated than the older generation.This latest study shows that the US once had 42% of the world's highest-skilled adults but this had now fallen to 28%.Mr Schleicher set out the scale of the difference in ability, saying that many secondary school pupils in Japan were ahead of graduates in England.Neil Carberry, the CBI's director for employment and skills, said the UK's economic future depended on improving the skills of the workforce."This survey simply emphasises that the UK cannot afford to stand still on skills."Ian Brinkley, director at the Work Foundation think tank, said the study showed the UK faced a "relative decline in the economy's skills base"."We face a major generational challenge."</body>

      <title>BBC plans to help get UK coding</title>
      <description>The BBC will launch an initiative in 2015 to get coding more widespread in schools and homes.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24446046</url>
      <date>1381233705</date>
      <body>The BBC's director general, Tony Hall, has announced plans to "bring coding into every home, business and school in the UK".It comes 30 years on from a BBC push to make computing mainstream by putting BBC Micro computers in the majority of schools.In a speech to staff, Mr Hall said that the initiative would launch in 2015."We want to inspire a new generation to get creative with coding, programming and digital technology," he said.Government and technology experts are becoming increasingly worried that vital computing skills are no longer being taught in schools.Meanwhile interest in higher-education IT and computing courses is falling, giving rise to fears about a massive skills gap.This term a new computer science curriculum has been introduced to schools in England, and Education Minister Michael Gove has made it clear that he wants to see coding taught as a priority.Ralph Rivera, director of future media at the BBC, said: "The BBC has played a hugely important role in inspiring a generation of digital and technology leaders in the past, and now it's time to reignite that creativity.""We want to transform the nation's ability and attitude towards coding," he added.Details of the programme were limited, but the BBC said that it would partner with government, educators and technology companies."From working with children and young people, to stimulating a national conversation about digital creativity, the BBC will help audiences embrace technology and get creative," the corporation said in a blog post.A range of tools would be made available to give people "the skills to solve problems, tell stories and build new business in the digital world", it added.Experts appearing in a video to accompany the speech, agreed that action was needed.Martha Lane Fox, charged with getting more people online via her organisation Go on UK, said: "We are going to need a million more people who can work in the technology sector over the next 10 years. We don't have them. We've got to help to encourage people to go into that sector."Meanwhile, Eben Upton - founder of the Raspberry Pi budget computer project - said he looked forward to seeing how the scheme developed."A generation of UK developers got their start thanks to the original BBC Computer Literacy Project and the BBC Micro," he said."This initiative represents a welcome return to computing education from the organisation that was responsible for my interest in the subject."However, the comparison of the project to the BBC Micro raises potential controversy.The broadcaster's decision to partner with Acorn Computers three decades ago angered Sir Clive Sinclair as he prepared to launch a rival machine, the ZX Spectrum."They are marvellous at making programmes and so on, but by God they should not be making computers, any more than they should be making BBC cars or BBC toothpaste," he told Practical Computing magazine in 1982."They were able to get away with making computers because none of us had sufficient power or pull with the government to put over just what a damaging action that was. They had the unmitigated gall to think that they could set a standard - the BBC language. It is just sheer arrogance on their part."However, Apps for Good - an organisation which has helped students research, design and make software for three years - was not concerned by the new scheme."The BBC is entering a market where there's a number of players, but players who already work quite collaboratively," said Debbie Forster, the organisation's chief operating officer."Because there is such a big issue at stake and it is so important to so many different organisations what we are finding is that partnerships are formed more easily and more positively."Obviously the devil is in the detail in making it work - it always is - but it's a fascinating space and we look forward to hearing more and would be delighted for the BBC to join forces with everyone who is in here doing something."Learning Tree International - a firm which makes money from running programming training courses - was also unworried about the idea of the BBC becoming a competitor."From the point of view of getting people more inspired about IT and into that world, as such, it can only be a positive thing," said the firm's marketing director Christian Trounce.</body>

      <title>Too many pupils 'failures at seven'</title>
      <description>Children who fall behind at school before the age of seven are likely to stay behind, says a report from Save the Children</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24434515</url>
      <date>1381194837</date>
      <body>Children who fall behind at school before the age of seven are likely to stay behind, a charity has warned.Save the Children analysed 2012 data on the performance of pupils at schools in England.It shows the poorest pupils are less likely to have made good progress than their better-off peers.The charity's chief executive, Justin Forsyth, said: "Many children starting school this term already have the odds stacked against them."In his foreword to the report, he writes "Seven is too young to write off a child," but he adds that without good reading skills "all other subjects are a closed book".The report cites official figures that suggest that by the age of seven the future gap in GCSE results between rich and poor children has already been established.In 2012, about 13% of seven-year-olds, or 76,000 pupils, were not at the expected reading level.Underlying this figure is the achievement gap between children on free school meals and their classmates. Almost a quarter (24%) of children eligible for free meals did not reach the expected level, compared with only 10% of children from better-off families.A different set of figures from the 2012 National Pupil Database shows that fewer than a sixth of pupils who had fallen behind at the age of seven caught up to meet the benchmark of five GCSEs graded A* to C at the age of 16.This suggests that 84% of children who fail to meet expected standards in reading and mathematics at seven are likely to continue to struggle throughout their school careers.The authors recognise "steady and welcome progress" over the past five years on the number of seven-year-olds who can read and write to the expected level.Their analysis has found that even continuing to make this rate of progress between now and 2020 could still leave almost half a million children having fallen behind in their reading by the age of seven.They add that continued progress may be difficult to achieve so even these figures may be optimistic without "bold policy change".Calculations based on lower rates of progress suggest that between 520,000 and 810,000 children could have fallen behind by 2020.A Department for Education spokeswoman said: "It is utterly unacceptable that so many disadvantaged children leave primary school without a firm grounding in the basics of reading, writing and maths and that is why we are urgently reforming primary education and giving specific support to disadvantaged pupils."This included the pupil premium paid to schools to support poorer pupils, the phonics test and the "rigorous new primary curriculum" which would mean that "many thousands of children will now receive the extra support they need to catch up with their peers."Save the Children is launching a programme called Born to Read, aiming to help about 23,000 children in England to read over the next four years.</body>

      <title>Reeves promoted in Labour reshuffle</title>
      <description>Tristram Hunt is to replace Stephen Twigg as shadow education secretary and Rachel Reeves replaces Liam Byrne as shadow work and pensions secretary.</description>

      <body>Rachel Reeves will replace Liam Byrne as shadow work and pensions secretary, as Labour leader Ed Miliband reshuffles his top team.In other changes, shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy has been moved from his post to the international development brief.Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg is replaced by TV historian Tristram Hunt.But Andy Burnham will keep his current position as shadow health secretary.The two new members of the shadow cabinet, Tristram Hunt and Chris Leslie, as well as Ms Reeves, all entered the Commons at the 2010 general election - although Mr Leslie had a previous stint as an MP from 1997 to 2005.BBC News Channel chief political correspondent Norman Smith said senior Labour figures were keen to promote the message that their reshuffle was designed to bring in new talent.They note that nearly a third of the shadow cabinet are now from the 2010 intake, and more than 40% are women.Ex-shadow cabinet members Mr Twigg and Mr Byrne take on more junior roles as shadow minister for political and constitutional reform and shadow minister for higher education.Mr Twigg, Mr Byrne and Mr Murphy all served as ministers under former PM Tony Blair, and their demotion is fuelling speculation of a "purge of the Blairites", Norman Smith added.But aides to Mr Miliband have denied trying to remove any faction of the party, he said.In other changes Mary Creagh leaves the environment, food and rural affairs brief to become shadow transport secretary.Previous incumbent Maria Eagle had been a strong defender of HS2, the proposed high-speed rail link.Her departure from that role is likely to be seen as adding to the likelihood of a Labour rethink on support for the scheme.In a blog post, Mr Murphy pledged to apply "just as much commitment and energy" to his new brief on international development as his previous defence job, and also said he would now play a "bigger role" in the campaign to persuade people in Scotland to vote against independence in the forthcoming referendum.Vernon Coaker moves from his job as shadow Northern Ireland secretary to shadow defence secretary, replacing Mr Murphy.In other moves, Emma Reynolds replaces Jack Dromey as shadow housing minister.Ivan Lewis takes over the Northern Ireland brief from Mr Coaker, having previously been shadow international development secretary.Gloria de Piero becomes shadow minister for women and equalities - a shadow cabinet post that was previously held by Yvette Cooper, who continues in her main role as shadow home secretary.</body>

      <title>Threat to close Muslim free school</title>
      <description>A Muslim free school in Derby is warned to "urgently" improve "unacceptable" standards or face closure.</description>

      <date>1381249780</date>
      <body>A Muslim free school in Derby will be closed unless "unacceptable" teaching standards improve and discrimination against female staff and pupils stops.In a letter to the chair of the Al-Madinah Education Trust, Education Minister Lord Nash laid out 17 issues.These included forcing female teachers to cover their hair and failing to carry out background checks on staff.The interim principal said its pupils were treated equally. The school's trust said it was seeking legal advice.Dr Stuart Wilson, the acting head teacher, said there were areas the school needed to address and it was co-operating with Ofsted.When asked if staff and children are treated equally at the school, Dr Wilson replied: "Yes, they are treated equally and fairly."The Al-Madinah School Education Trust said in a statement on the school's website that "the letter had come out of the blue" and while it intended to co-operate fully with the Department for Education, it would also be speaking to the school's solicitors.Lord Nash's letter stated if urgent steps were not taken by 15 October, funding will be pulled.The school was closed for a week on the first the day of an Ofsted inspection on 1 October citing "health and safety issues".Ofsted released its statement to "clarify media reports" about why the school had closed.In it, HM Inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw said: "Inspectors discovered that staff records showing whether they were cleared to supervise children were either missing or incomplete."The school remained closed until yesterday [Monday] when inspectors made a return visit to satisfy themselves that the necessary safeguarding arrangements were in place and that there were sufficient numbers of adults with the necessary clearance for the school to function safely."A full Ofsted report is expected soon, he added.Addressing chair Shazia Parveen, Lord Nash wrote: "The trust has manifestly breached the conditions of its funding agreement by:"I will not tolerate breaches of the commitments you gave when entering into the funding agreement," he added.He has urged the school's trust to take five "urgent steps" by 15 October, including providing written confirmation that "you have ceased any practices and procedures that have as their reason, cause or effect that women and girls are treated less favourably than men and boys".The school has been given a deadline of 22 October for nine further action points and must provide a plan setting out a clear management structure by the start of November.</body>

      <title>Scouts announce promise for atheists</title>
      <description>The Scout Association in the UK announces an alternative version of their membership promise for young people who do not believe in God.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24434510</url>
      <date>1381228981</date>
      <body>The Scout Association in the UK has announced an alternative version of its membership promise for young people who do not believe in God.From January, instead of vowing "to do my duty to God", scouts will be able to promise to "uphold our scout values".The new promise will exist alongside the core scout promise, which has remained unchanged for 106 years.The Church of England, the Church of Scotland and other faiths have welcomed the move.The step follows a 10-month consultation."I am confident that our relationship with the scouting movement will continue to flourish," said the Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham, the Right Reverend Paul Butler, who leads the Church's work with young people."In enabling people of all faiths and none to affirm their beliefs, scouting has demonstrated that it is both possible and I would argue preferable, to affirm the importance of spiritual life."The Right Reverend Lorna Hood, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, also welcomed the move."I am extremely happy that the Scout Movement has taken this very sensible and inclusive step while ensuring that faith and belief remain a vital element of their ethos," she said.This is the first time the scout movement has introduced a promise for new members who are atheists - although alternatives to the core promise have existed for nearly 50 years for Hindus, Muslims and Buddhists.Hindus and Buddhists are currently permitted to refer to "my Dharma" in the scout promise, while Muslims can refer to Allah.Wayne Bulpitt, the association's UK chief commissioner, said the move signified its "determination to become truly inclusive and relevant to all sections of society".Mr Bulpitt added the additional alternative promise would not alter the association's commitment to exploring faith and religion as a core element of its programme.He said he was delighted the move had been achieved with the support of key faith groups as well as the British Humanist Association (BHA).Andrew Copson, the BHA's chief executive, said the move could only strengthen scouting: "Scouting is an enormously significant youth organisation and in some parts of the country offers the only activities young people have."Their initiative sends out a strong signal that the vast majority of young people who do not see themselves as belonging to any religion have values that are worthy of respect and should be explicitly welcomed and catered for in any activity that seeks to be genuinely inclusive."The association's total UK membership has increased from 444,936 in 2005 to 536,787 this year and includes 77,472 girlsLast month the Guides dropped reference to God from their joining promise, following a consultation that found the movement needed to do more to include the non-religious and those of other faiths.A ban on atheist scout leaders will also be lifted.The Scout Association confirmed to the BBC that it would rewrite its equal opportunities policy which currently states: "The avowed absence of religious belief is a bar to appointment to a leadership position."</body>

      <description>Classroom support staff say they are increasingly being asked to stand in for fully qualified teachers, claims a union.</description>

      <body>Classroom support staff say they are increasingly being asked to stand in for fully qualified teachers, a union is claiming.A third (32%) of support staff in UK state schools polled by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) said they took classes for absent teachers.Over a fifth (22%) said they took more classes in 2012-13 than in 2011-12.A Department for Education (DfE) spokeswoman said: "The rules are clear - they should not be teaching."The DfE said teaching assistants and other classroom support staff played a vital role in the classroom, short of teaching whole classes of children."The government's recent review of school efficiency showed that, when properly trained and deployed, teaching assistants play an important role in helping to improve learning," the spokeswoman said."It is for school leaders to use the expertise of all staff to ensure any disruption to pupils is minimal and that taxpayers get value for money."The ATL polled more than 1,400 of its members working as support staff in state schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.A spokeswoman for the union said the rules allow classroom assistants to teach small groups of children under the supervision of a qualified teacher, but they should not teach whole classes or prepare teaching material.Higher level teaching assistants may contribute to lesson planning and deliver lessons to whole classes to assist an assigned teacher, while cover supervisors are employed to supervise classes while pupils complete work set by a teacher.A quarter (25.4%) of the teaching assistants and learning support workers surveyed and almost half (49.1%) of higher level teaching assistants said they were asked to cover lessons.Of the 400 who said they stood in for the regular class teacher, 60% said they did the same work as fully qualified teachers, claims the union, while a third (31%) of these staff said they had been used to take classes for three or more consecutive days.The union quotes a higher level teaching assistant at a secondary school in England: "I prepare, teach and mark at least four lessons for two year-7, bottom-set classes, and a year-8 set for at least three hours a week. It is teaching on the cheap."A cover supervisor said: "I have even been asked to give copies of lessons I have prepared to members of teaching staff."A primary school teaching assistant added: "It is unfair that many teaching assistants are teaching classes in the absence of a teacher, and doing the same job as a teacher for much less money."ATL general secretary Dr Mary Bousted said: "Schools are selling children short by using teaching assistants to teach classes when the regular teacher is unavailable."We are totally opposed to this exploitation of support staff who are being used as a cheap option to teachers."It is grossly unfair on them and on the children and their parents who rightly expect their children to be taught by qualified teachers."</body>

      <title>Stones and apples thrown at university reformer</title>
      <description>The tough struggle to modernise Kurdistan's education system</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23977422</url>
      <date>1380669333</date>
      <body>Prof Dlawer Ala'Aldeen had tomatoes, stones and apples thrown at him. He faced countless demonstrations.The reason for this hostility, facing the microbiologist from the University of Nottingham, was his controversial attempt to reform the university system in his birthplace of Kurdistan.Prof Ala'Aldeen was the architect of plans to improve the quality and to internationalise higher education in Iraqi Kurdistan.He says he was up against "deeply entrenched interests, people, institutions and long stagnant cultures".The region, autonomous for two decades in the wake of the Gulf War, had inherited a post-Saddam university system that Prof Ala'Aldeen has described as "grossly outdated" and designed for a closed, centralised country.In 2009 Prof Ala'Aldeen was given a secondment away from his job as professor of clinical microbiology at Nottingham University in the UK.He stepped from academic life in the English midlands into the role of Kurdistan's higher education minister, a post he held until last year.Prime Minister Barham Salih, a good friend, chose him for his knowledge of the higher education system and the series of critical articles on education and governance he had written in the years up to his appointment.Barham Salih's election manifesto had included significant support for higher education and training to support Kurdistan's large population of under 20 year olds.There were already plans for more scholarships to send talented students to study overseas.Within a week of being appointed, Prof Ala'Aldeen had written up a radical vision document and it was quickly endorsed by the cabinet.Higher education in Kurdistan was suffering a major crisis of quality, capacity and infrastructure.There was a consensus in support of reform and it helped that Prof Ala'Aldeen had been very critical of the government in the past.The reforms, which planned to improve the quality and accreditation of university teachers, brought considerable opposition from student and teacher organisations as well as businesses linked with the burgeoning market in private universities.Several new private universities were threatened with closure, much to the anger of their staff and prospective students who had paid fees for their courses."Many teachers had been licensed prematurely. There were 11 private universities when I started with 18 more waiting to be opened. These mushrooming private colleges were relying on the same pool of resources as the public universities which lacked staff and facilities," Prof Ala'Aldeen says.The problem of staffing was particularly acute in medicine, pharmacy and dentistry and in postgraduate studies.But Prof Ala'Aldeen faced protests and opposition.He was accused of trying to transplant the UK system onto Kurdistan, something he vehemently denies since he was educated and worked in his home region, before coming to study in the UK."I knew the system from the inside and studied what had happened in similar countries. I wanted to apply international principles of quality, but tailor-made to Kurdish traditions," he says.He responded by redoubling his efforts to communicate the purpose of the reforms, which also included curriculum development, moving beyond a single teacher delivering a lecture to a class, the introduction of an electronic admissions system and reforming the teaching of PhDs.In the end, the government closed three private universities as well as five health-related colleges, three pharmacy colleges and two dentistry ones."If we had allowed the system to keep evolving as it was it would have taken at least a generation to fix it - a generation would have been wasted. We knew we had to act fast. It was a risky policy, but it would have been far riskier to do nothing," he says.The speed of his action was criticised as were aspects of the efforts to improve teaching standards, such as student feedback being used to measure teacher performance and pay. There was also opposition to teachers being asked to engage in professional development once a week.Prof Brendan O'Leary, director of the programme in ethnic conflict at the University of Pennsylvania, says that a longer process might have worked better.But he says it was against a background when unprecedented changes were happening in Kurdish society as the region opened up to foreign investment."The Kurdistan region is going through a difficult and fast-paced transformation."Ideally a long and rich discussion is needed to agree new institutional conditions to enable higher education to flourish in a region emerging from decades of destruction, war, genocide, internal fighting, academic isolation and lack of resources."University and institutional reforms are more likely to succeed if all the stakeholders have clear ideas on what to do, when, and at what pace. One should not be surprised if people with vested interests fear reforms," said Prof O'Leary.Thomas Hill, assistant professor at New York University Center for Global Affairs, adds: "I do not believe there is consensus even now that the reforms the former minister wanted to implement would have been in the best interest of the Kurdistan region."There are many, many people with very conservative views within the higher education sector in the Kurdistan region and many did not and do not like the progressive path the former minister was plotting."There were areas in which vested interests remained unmoved. Prof Ala'Aldeen could not increase the independence of universities.The government continues to choose university leaders and universities have been totally dependent on government funding.Prof Ala'Aldeen put together draft legislation on institutional autonomy, but says the challenge to the status quo was too great to push it through.He is in close touch with the current government and is pleased that the reforms to improve quality have been maintained, despite the fact that there is still not consensus in favour of them, and says the scholarship programme is already making a difference."Almost 3,000 students have studied abroad, the majority in the UK. Half of these are or will be back by the end of this year. They will provide leadership and bring a breath of fresh air. They will link their institutions to the outside world and break Kurdistan's academic isolation."Although Kurdistan has its own particular circumstances, Prof Ala'Aldeen says that the problems facing the university system are not unique - and that the model for modernisation could be applied elsewhere in the Middle East."The problems are generic and the solutions can be implemented anywhere in the world."Commentators on Kurdistan's politics agree. Prof O'Leary says: "The Kurdistan region, Iraq and several other states in the Middle East are going through dramatic changes, and in some cases, deeply regrettable authoritarian restorations."Most institutions are highly politicised in these societies. If the Kurdistan region can successfully reform its education system, including higher education, it can provide a model for the wider Middle East."</body>

      <title>Harvard plans to boldly go with 'Spocs'</title>
      <description>Harvard develops the next big thing for online learning. Is this the real deal?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24166247</url>
      <date>1380062273</date>
      <body>Keep up, keep up. If you've only just caught on to the concept of online university courses called Moocs, then you're in danger of falling behind again.Harvard, one of the world's most influential universities, is moving on to Spocs - which stands for small private online courses. Nothing to do with Star Trek and sombre Vulcans, but plenty to do with ambitions "to boldly go".And could these be the real deal? The academic chairing Harvard's online experiments says we are already "post-Mooc".Moocs - massive open online courses - have been something of a hurricane in universities, making a lot of noise and promising to rip everything up.Pioneered by some of the most prestigious US universities, they have been re-packaging course units into online lessons and making them available to anyone with an internet connection.But it's still not clear whether this is a passing storm or something that will fundamentally change how higher education is delivered.Last week the UK joined the fray, with more than 20 universities launching an online platform called FutureLearn, which will challenge the dominant players on the east and west US coasts.The biggest success for online courses and their greatest problem are the same - the huge numbers attracted.It demonstrates the scale of the unmet demand for higher education, but at the same time it's not clear how tens of thousands of students on a course could ever satisfactorily be taught, assessed and accredited. Most of these signs-up will sign off without completing courses.At Harvard, more people have signed up for Moocs in a single year than have attended the university in its entire 377-year history. That's a great success story in opening up education, but what do you do with all those hungry minds?Enter the Spoc. And the clue is in the "small, private" part of the name. These courses are still free and delivered through the internet, but access is restricted to much smaller numbers, tens or hundreds, rather than tens of thousands.It means a selection process for applicants and the capacity for a more customised experience. Looking further down the track, it wouldn't be difficult to imagine fees and course credits.Harvard and University of California, Berkeley, part of the edX online alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are among the universities beginning to experiment with this more refined model.Next week a popular and highly topical course in US national security strategy will begin at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Alongside the campus students in Cambridge, Massachusetts, there will be a parallel Spoc version with a limit of about 500 online students.Students wanting to get into this online classroom have to submit a written assignment about the US government's response to the conflict in Syria, along with details of their academic credentials.Even though this online course won't have a formal academic credit at the end, it's going to require eight hours of work a week and a capacity to tackle questions about "Iran's nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria's civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information".These Spoc students might include Harvard students who couldn't get into the campus course, alongside those who might be studying from home or at work.Harvard isn't abandoning Moocs, but rather like Russian dolls sitting inside each other, a single course might now be delivered to a large open Mooc audience, to a much smaller number of Spoc students and then down to an even smaller number enrolled at the bricks-and-mortar campus.It's taking the limited and expensive resource of a Harvard course and amplifying it for widening rings of audiences.Prof Robert Lue chairs the committee of academics that runs Harvard's online experiments, under the banner of HarvardX.He describes the current online learning experiments as a "remarkable moment of possibility".And he sees the move towards more flexible and refined formats such as Spocs as an "almost inevitable evolution"."The Mooc represents just the first version of what we can do with online education," says Prof Lue. And this first version has now been overtaken. "We're already in a post-Mooc era.""What has become very clear is that the engagement you get from a very large group with a wide-ranging set of priorities can be radically different from what you get from a more focused group," says Prof Lue.It also paves the way to tackling one of the biggest problems for Moocs. How can they provide formally-recognised qualifications?The smaller class size will allow "much more rigorous assessment and greater validation of identity and that will be more closely tied to what kind of certification might be possible," he says."It's safe to say that in the quite near term there will be announcements of experiments in this area."There are voices of caution about over-hyped expectations for online learning.A report published last week by the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggested there remained many uncertainties over Moocs.The lack of a clear business model was described as a "burning issue".The edX project is in the fortunate position of being given $60m by Harvard and MIT, but few universities have the resources to give away so much expensively-produced content and staff time.Prof Lue suggests that the really tough questions raised by Moocs are not only about online learning but about what it means for the rest of the traditional campus."What is it that a student gets out of being on campus and being in the classroom?"If students on campus prefer learning online, what does it mean for the funding model for universities? What happens if a recorded online lecture is preferable to a mediocre live talk? How do universities show their "added value"?Prof Lue argues that the significance of Spocs is that online learning is now moving beyond trying to replicate classroom courses and is trying to produce something that is more flexible and more effective.Universities that ignore such developments, or think that Moocs can just be showreels for conventional courses, are putting themselves at risk, he suggests."The really big questions for university are about what students get from the classroom, what works, what could be done better.""Institutions that sit back and watch, they may be in trouble. One can imagine a large institution where there isn't much difference between online and classroom - and then you'd be silly not to realise there's a problem."</body>

      <title>UK enters online university race</title>
      <description>The UK's biggest online university project is being launched, with a partnership of more than 20 universities offering free courses.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24109190</url>

      <body>The UK's biggest online university project has been launched, with more than 20 universities offering free courses.Students will be able to follow courses on mobile phones as well as computers.The UK's project, called FutureLearn, sees UK universities entering the global market in so-called Moocs - massive open online courses.It could "revolutionise conventional models of formal education", says universities minister David Willetts.Mr Willetts, speaking at the British Library, said that the expansion of access to higher education was no longer necessarily about "bricks and mortar".He said that the FutureLearn partnership would help to serve the unmet demand for university courses, particularly overseas.The launch of FutureLearn sees 21 UK universities, plus Trinity College Dublin and Monash University in Australia, offering courses that are taught and assessed on the internet.The UK universities include Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham, Warwick, Bristol, Reading, Southampton and the Open University, which has headed the project.The British Library, British Museum and British Council will make material available to students.There are 20 short courses announced, with eight starting this year.In this experimental phase, students taking these courses will carry out multiple choice questions, without any formal qualifications.But universities are hoping that many people will be attracted by the chance to follow university-level courses without any travel or cost and at a time that suits them.It will also provide taster courses for youngsters considering their university options.When the University of Edinburgh offered Moocs through a US network it had more than 300,000 students signing up. The University of London international programme had more than 200,000 registrations.FutureLearn will see the UK taking a much bigger step into the rapidly expanding online university market - with claims that higher education is now facing its own online revolution.They are anticipating that each Mooc course will attract 20,000 students.Universities also see the project as a way of recruiting students to degree courses. Martin Bean, vice chancellor of the Open University, described it as a "digital storefront".But Mr Bean says he expects some universities to begin thinking about how to offer formal credits for Moocs.Reading University is going to offer a Mooc course about basic computer programming."Offering free taster courses online is a no-brainer," says David Bell, the university's vice-chancellor."Universities shouldn't be afraid to open up teaching and research, either in the UK or beyond. Learning never stops and as the economy's demand for higher skills rises, universities should be in the vanguard when it comes to providing new opportunities."Making courses accessible online, on mobiles and tablets means that people can fit their studying around their lives, rather than their lives around study."Southampton University is offering a course in web science, Leicester University's course looks at England at the time of Richard III and the University of Warwick has a psychology course.FutureLearn's chief executive Simon Nelson says it will offer a "fresh approach" with all its courses designed to work across all kinds of online platforms, so that a student could begin a course on a laptop at home and then continue on a mobile phone while commuting.He also promises a less isolated experience for students learning at home. He says that it can be a "solitary experience", but that FutureLearn will try to create a supportive online community, with "very strong social architecture".This will allow students to discuss their courses and ask questions, using social networking-style comment pages alongside the lesson content.This consortium will also draw upon the experience in distance learning of the Open University."Time and again we have seen the disruptive impact the internet can have on industries - driving innovation and enhancing the customer experience. I have no doubt Moocs will do the same for education," says Mr Bean.There were also suggestions from the Department for Education last week that Moocs could be used for vocational courses for students in further education colleges and sixth forms in England.Moocs have already had a major impact in the US, launching last year and spearheaded by alliances of top institutions, including Harvard, MIT and Stanford.Coursera, set up by Stanford academics in California and backed by venture capital, has signed up more than four million students in its first 18 months for courses provided by more than 80 universities.These projects have revealed a high level of demand for courses, but also exposed the difficulty in retaining students, with very high levels of drop-out rates.It has sparked a debate about the cost of higher education and what students are paying for when so much information and so many high-quality university materials are available online.These US online courses have begun to develop ways of giving students formal credits, such as students paying to take invigilated exams.Among the Mooc pioneers has been the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which set up the edX online platform with Harvard.On Tuesday, MIT announced a series of new online courses which will have an identity verification system using webcams and with plans for certification for courses.But there have also been questions asked about the long-term financial viability of online university courses.Last week, William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, challenged whether many universities could afford to invest in the type of free online courses offered by wealthy institutions such as Harvard and MIT.He suggested that online courses might work better as part of a "blended" course, where students spend some time together in the classroom as well as studying online.Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said that online universities represented an overdue technological advance."The models of higher education that marched triumphantly across the globe in the second half of the 20th Century require radical and urgent transformation. My fear is that the nature of change is incremental and the pace of change too slow."The establishment of FutureLearn represents an important step in realising this change and seizing the opportunities technology offers in creating a broader, deeper and more exciting education system."Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: "I encourage all our institutions to explore the opportunities offered by new modes of technology, such as Moocs. This will keep the UK ahead in the global race to deliver education in worldwide markets."</body>

      <title>Gordon Brown's Syrian refugee school plan</title>
      <description>Syria's refugee crisis is also threatening to become a long-term education disaster.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24034422</url>

      <body>Syria's refugee crisis is threatening to become a long-term education disaster. There will soon be 500,000 refugee children in Lebanon, with few having access to school. But Gordon Brown, former UK prime minister and UN special envoy for global education, says that lessons could be in place in weeks."A few days ago, global education campaigner Malala Yousafzai was able to speak over Skype to Zahra and Om Kolhtoum Katou, teenage Syrian twins exiled in Baalbeck in East Lebanon.As they talked, the three girls realised that they shared something in common. All three are victims of violence that threatened to destroy their youth and their future, and all three cannot do what most other girls and boys do every morning: leave the home in which they grew up and go to school.Now there is a plan that could help the biggest single group of Syrian child refugees - 300,000 of those exiled to Lebanon - which could see them in school and being fed within weeks.It has been prepared by Kevin Watkins of the Overseas Development Institute for the charity, A World at School, which campaigns to get an education for the millions of children without access to school.But this plan can only be put into practice - and this seems unlikely today - if the international community, which is financing just 2% of schooling needs in humanitarian crises, offers an additional $500m (£319m).The plan involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double or even triple shift system; hiring Syrian refugees as teachers in Arabic in community colleges; providing school meals to tackle hunger as we tackle illiteracy.This strategy is also rooted in the realistic presumption that the plight of the Syrian children is more than a short-term emergency: their exile could last years. It has the active support of the Lebanese government, but it is an open question as to whether the world community will put up the funds.Children are always the most neglected and forgotten victims of conflict. Already deprived of food and shelter, boys and girls are also denied their right to education, condemned to forfeit a childhood that, once lost, can never be re-run or re-lived.The one million Syrian children, who make up half of that country's refugees, are simply the most recent victims of this monumental gap in our global system. They are among 28 million children worldwide now being denied their right to schooling in conflict zones and under broken-down regimes.Soon small, unstable Lebanon will have absorbed 500,000 Syrian boys and girls. Already in just a few months, the refugees have grown in number to an astonishing 25% of Lebanon's child population.But today, and for the foreseeable future, there are school places for only a small fraction of them - just 30,000. If they suffer the typical exile of children in conflict they could spend 10 years in camps and without schooling.The traumas engulfing Syrian children underscores an enduring global failure. One hundred years ago, through support for the Red Cross, the world decided it would meet people's basic health needs, even in theatres of war.Forty years ago Médecins Sans Frontières established that healthcare should be available across the most dangerous and violent of war zones.Today, the concept of "Education Without Borders" still remains an unfamiliar idea, a concept yet to be built into our system of humanitarian relief.Yet the cost of inaction for young people deprived of an education, destroyed by anger, restlessness, and desperation and sentenced to tents and camps often for years, will haunt us for generations.Because these millions of young unemployed will become the adult unemployable, and many will graduate not into jobs but into violence.On 23 September in New York, organisations that have for years fought valiantly to deliver education in emergencies will build on pioneering work by UNICEF, UNHCR, UN Refugees and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) to bring to life the Education Without Borders initiative for Lebanon's Syrian refugees.In New York, young people from conflict zones around the world, joined by Malala and backed up by a petition presented to the UN Secretary General, will lead an appeal for funds.It will show that while we cannot do everything we can do something, that hope can survive even amid horror and that good can yet triumph over the worst evils, even in the most troubled and desperate parts of the world."</body>

      <title>Zombie apocalypse: The future of universities?</title>
      <description>A US university is going to create an online course based on the TV drama the Walking Dead.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23931078</url>
      <date>1378381975</date>
      <body>Can zombies be the stuff of serious academic study? And could they be shuffling towards a new type of future for higher education?In what is being claimed as the biggest ever experiment in "edutainment", a US television company is forming a partnership with a top-ranking Californian university to produce online courses linked to a hit TV show.This blurring of the digital boundaries between academic study and the entertainment industry will see a course being launched next month based on the post-apocalypse drama series the Walking Dead.Television shows might have spin-off video games or merchandising, but this drama about surviving disaster and social collapse is now going to have its own university course.Academics from the University of California, Irvine, who are setting up the online courses, say these will be academically rigorous and tackle serious scientific issues, related to events in the show.A physicist will look at the "science behind decay"; the public health department will use the series to study questions such as "What can we learn from past epidemics?" and maths lecturers will show how "post-calculus maths can be used to model population and epidemic dynamics".Showbiz lessonsThe show is made by AMC, which also produced cult series such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Killing, and AMC vice-president Theresa Beyer says this showbiz-academic partnership will create a "legitimate educational experience".She says AMC will be the "first entertainment group to make the foray into the online education arena" and wants the course to "drive a deep, sustained connection with the show".The TV series has an audience of 10 million and student numbers for the online course are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands. If this experiment proves successful, the online platform provider, Instructure, suggests there could be further TV show and university hybrids.It's not difficult to imagine an advertising course being built around a series such as Mad Men, suggests Josh Coates, Instructure's chief executive.This partnership also marks another development in the rapidly-expanding world of MOOCs - the massive open online courses - an acronym sufficiently established to have made it into the Oxford online dictionary last week.Millions of students have signed up for online courses in the past year, suggesting the scale of demand for higher education.And millions of students have failed to complete those courses suggesting the scale of the challenge of online learning.Dumbing down?This eight-module course will begin in mid-October and will be accessible without charge to anyone with an internet connection.There will be online tests and discussion groups, but students taking the course will not get any formal qualifications or credits towards a degree, so it's going to be for students who want to follow the course in their own time.But isn't there a risk of dumbing down? The University of California, Irvine, has Nobel prize-winning researchers, it contributes $4.3bn (£2.77bn; 3.3bn euro) to the local economy, does it want to have zombies on its prospectus?"When we entered this partnership it was really important to make each of the modules as academically strong as they would be in our classes at UC Irvine," says Melissa Loble, associate dean of distance learning at the university."The lessons will be academically rigorous and rich and still have connections to the show."Joanne Christopherson, social science lecturer, says that it's taking another step forward from how universities already use contemporary media examples."In all of my classes I have to bring in current issues to keep it interesting. Not just because they're young adults coming out of high school, but because it's important to make these classic theories relevant to them. What we're doing is using this series as an example through the whole course."Apocalypse studiesJosh Coates, head of Instructure, which provides the Canvas online platform, says it will present science and social science issues, using the hook of a TV show."This is real curriculum about infectious diseases, public health, nutrition, psychology and sociology. The fact that the context is this fictional world of an apocalypse is incidental.""This is very topical. We have terrorist attacks, we have Katrina, Fukushima, all these things happen in our world today, which create small vignettes of a local apocalypse. This is an opportunity to educate people about the science of these disasters."Mr Coates says a significant part of this experiment will be to see if it can crack one of the biggest weaknesses of MOOCs, the high drop-out rate. Will the pulling power of television keep people switched on to learning?"Can we get more students through because it's linked to a TV show they really like?" he says.He describes the link between the university and the TV industry as the "cross-pollination" that comes with the internet."The internet tears down walls of tradition and the isolation of different areas of research and interest," he says.Personal learningFor the university, it's a shop window putting their brand in front of a global audience. It also allows them to refine the process of putting courses online."The first MOOCs had great videos and great quizzes, but didn't help students really interact with one another," says Melissa Loble."The next step for MOOCs is to figure how to make them personal without it being overwhelming for the institution trying to deliver that."These are the type of practical questions that come with the huge numbers of online students.Dr Christopherson says that scale of the demand for MOOCs has been a "wake-up call" for universities.But it remains a challenge to provide an online structure that can allow so many students to follow a course without feeling anonymous and disconnected.William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, says there also remains a longer term question about the funding model for MOOCs.And he suggests that universities which have begun to invest in them might become wary at the extent of the drop-out rate.They might work better as part of a "blended" course, where there is a taught, classroom element as well as online study, he says.Spoiler alertAlan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, also has reservations about the value of TV-related online courses.Without formal assessment and personal content, he says it remains to be seen how this delivers more than a good television documentary."The student must be able to sift the evidence."For genuine learning, personal contact really matters," he says.Prof Smithers says such links with a popular TV show might work as a way of attracting students, but the academic element needs to outweigh the entertainment.But don't expect the march of the MOOCs to stop any time soon. And Mr Coates says he wants people to look back at the Walking Dead course as a watershed when education and entertainment connected.With the online course available globally and when different series are being shown at different stages in different countries, this could also be the first university course that has to come with its own spoiler alert.</body>

      <body>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most likely place to have studied.The Times Higher Education magazine ranked the universities attended by chief executive officers of Fortune Global 500 companies.There are four US universities in the top 10, with three from France, two from Japan and one from South Korea.The highest ranked UK university is Oxford in 21st place.This league table, described as the Alma Mater Index, shows which universities around the world taught the bosses of some of the world's biggest companies.One in 20 had a degree from a single institution, Harvard.This included Margaret C Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Jeffrey R Immelt of General Electric and Vittorio Colao of Vodafone.This academic powerhouse regularly appears at the top of university league tables, including the rich list, with an endowment worth $31bn (£20bn' 23.5bn euro).But the top 10 for producing business leaders does not contain all the usual names that appear at the top of university rankings.Oxford and Cambridge are absent, but the University of Pennsylvania in the US and Keio University in Japan are included, along with three French universities, headed by the Ecole Polytechnique.It means that in this top 10 cradles of global CEOs, there are two institutions from Paris, two from the Boston area and two from Tokyo.Across the top 100, universities from the US dominate, followed by universities in China, Japan, France and Germany. There are more CEOs who went to university in Asia than in Europe.In terms of national comparisons, UK universities produced the sixth highest number of global chief executives, with Oxford in 21st place and Cambridge in 45th place.But even though Harvard might have taught the biggest number of bosses from the top 500 companies, it was not attended by any of the heads of the biggest 10 companies, who were from a more diverse range of universities.Royal Dutch Shell is headed by a graduate of Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Wal-Mart is headed by a student of Georgia Tech and Exxon Mobil has a chief executive from the University of Texas, Austin.Three of the leaders of these biggest companies went to university in China and the head of Volkswagen went to university in Stuttgart.</body>

      <title>The scientists who escaped the Nazis</title>
      <description>A first-hand memory of the scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23261289</url>
      <date>1374016582</date>
      <body>When Gustav Born's family were advised in early 1933 that it was time to leave Nazi-controlled Germany, it was from a good authority.The advice was from Albert Einstein, who told his friend and fellow scientist Max Born to "leave immediately" with his family while they were still able to travel.They packed their bags and headed across the border, first to Italy and then to England, where they arrived as part of what must have been the best-qualified refugee trail in history.Gustav Born was 11 at the time, living in Gottingen, Lower Saxony, where his father, Max, was director of one of the world's leading centres for physics research.The Borns were Jewish, and when Hitler took power, Max Born and his Jewish colleagues were prevented from working at the university. This pioneering, elite group of theoretical scientists were turned into asylum seekers.Gustav now lives in London, a few days short of his 92nd birthday, and he looks back with great clarity on the remarkable flight of these German academics. The conversation is like opening a 1930s Mitteleuropa time capsule.He is now one of the last living links to these academic refugees, who between them went on to win 16 Nobel prizes - his father received the award for his work in quantum mechanics.Did these scientists realise the extent of the threat from the Nazis?"Yes, I think my father probably did. Among his Jewish colleagues, some did, but some didn't believe for some time. But the scale of what the Nazis were doing became apparent in the first three to six months."Gustav remembers that the ugly mood of anti-Semitism had even reached the playground, with some children not allowed to play with him.There were also positive examples of human nature, such as the academics who stood by their Jewish colleagues. The Nobel prize winner Max von Laue showed great support, says Gustav.The physicist Max Planck went to see Hitler in person to challenge the exclusion of Jewish scientists, but Hitler "foamed at the mouth and wouldn't let him talk any more".It was still tough to leave. Max Born had to give up running an institute, his wife was heartbroken at the prospect of emigrating."They hated to be uprooted in this crude and dangerous way."When the Borns left, they were not under any illusions that this would be a temporary departure. "Nazification" was happening rapidly and there were political murders."My parents were pretty sure this was a one-way journey."While the Borns were watching the swastikas appearing in Gottingen, a much more tweedily humanitarian response was being marshalled by university staff in Britain.The economist William Beveridge had set up the Academic Assistance Council, with the aim of rescuing Jewish and politically vulnerable academics.It was an organisation that would help 1,500 academics escape Germany and continue their research work in safety in Britain.It was quickly backed by academics whose names now read like a row of text books - J B S Haldane, John Maynard Keynes, Ernest Rutherford, G M Trevelyan and the poet A E Housman.Albert Einstein supported this high-brow escape committee with a highly-charged speech in the Albert Hall in London in October 1933.He set out an epic defence of Western liberal values of "tolerance and justice" against the "temptations of hatred and oppression", at a time of deepening extremism and economic and political turmoil."It is in times of economic distress such as we experience everywhere today, one sees very clearly the strength of the moral forces that live in a people."He told his audience that it was "the liberty of the individual that has brought us every advance of knowledge and invention - liberty without which life to a self-respecting man is not worth living".The council launched its "rescue operation", arranging for academics to come to Britain and providing practical support in the form of grants, accommodation and most importantly jobs.This was a remarkably talented group being cast aside by the Nazis. As well as the trawl of Nobel prizes, there were 18 future knighthoods and over 100 fellows of the Royal Society or British Academy.According to the Association of Jewish Refugees there were about 70,000 Jewish refugees who came to Britain before the outbreak of war in 1939.Max Born and his family went first to Cambridge and then to Edinburgh University. He paid his way by writing a science text book that became a school standard.There were others who moved on to the United States. Mathematician Richard Courant went to New York where one of the foremost centres for applied maths, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is named after him.Losing such intellectual powerhouses was a self-inflicted wound for the Nazi war effort.In the race to develop atomic weapons, German refugees played a key role in making sure that it was the United States that won.Even though Max Born refused on moral grounds to work on atomic weapons research, Robert Oppenheimer, the US-born "father of the atomic bomb", had been Born's PhD student at Gottingen.There were signs at one stage that the Nazis might have realised their mistake.In 1934, Max Born and his family were visited in Cambridge by Werner Heisenberg, another Nobel prize winner and old colleague who had continued working at Gottingen.Heisenberg brought a message from the Nazi government inviting Max Born to return to continue his scientific work in Germany. The invitation left Born "beside himself with fury", his son recalls.But Max Born and his wife did eventually go back to Germany, after the war was over and after he had retired. He died there in 1970 and is buried in the same cemetery in Gottingen as Max Planck and Max von Laue.Gustav, who became a professor of pharmacology at King's College London, says that his parents were committed to trying to rebuild Germany in a way that would prevent the return of such political extremism.What lessons should be learned from all this?Gustav Born remains a strong supporter of the campaign to rescue academics, which is now marking its 80th year.It has become the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara) and its current chair, Anne Lonsdale, says that after 80 years the organisation "would love to be out of a job", but the problems in Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq and Syria mean that academics still need help in places where "civil society no longer functions".There is an "urgent need for scholars from across the Middle East to get to exile in a place of safety", she said.The stories of refugees from the Nazis, with grainy photos of faces with lines like old railway maps of Europe, might seem like something from a lost world.But Gustav Born says that Cara's ongoing work shows that it is as relevant as ever. It is also a reminder not to make hasty judgements about refugees and what they might be able to achieve.His descriptions of that academic world of the 1930s are also a last glimpse of a highly cultured society. His father, remembered for his science research, played Bach on the piano every day. These were internationalists, their ideas and research moving across national and political boundaries.Such a world proved fragile in the face of the Nazis. And Gustav Born says people can too often overlook that Germany had still been a young country in the 1930s, little more than 60 years old, and that it hadn't built the institutions able to resist its own "militaristic and nationalistic" tendencies.He is very much aware that he is now one of the few remaining people who can talk first-hand about such a legacy."I'm sad that it almost ends with me."I want them not to forget that things like this, the suppression of a country by a gang of murderous crooks and the victimisation of people of good nature and good intention, it could happen again."</body>

      <title>Education is a 'security issue', says UN</title>
      <description>Unesco chief says even though pledge for education for all will be missed, huge progress has been achieved.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23197565</url>

      <body>The tinderbox mix of high youth unemployment, lack of education and the threat of extremism is turning access to school into a "security issue", says Irina Bokova, director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation.The volatile prospect of millions of uneducated, illiterate youngsters in developing countries, under pressure from the financial downturn, has brought an unprecedented political significance to the campaign to give every child a primary school education, she says.Ms Bokova was speaking ahead of a speech later this week at the United Nations from Malala Yousafzai, who will call for all children to have the right to go to school.The Pakistani schoolgirl, who will make her speech in New York on her 16th birthday, defied the bullets of the Taliban in defence of her right to an education.But behind the optimism of Malala's campaign and the creation of an annual "Malala Day" is a much more complex global story, with failure as well as success.In 2000, in the warm glow of a new millennium, world leaders pledged that universal primary education would be achieved by 2015. No child would miss out on the basics of schooling.After an initial surge, progress stalled and achieving the target in the next 18 months now seems unlikely."By 2015, it's impossible," says Ms Bokova, the Paris-based head of Unesco.But she says that rather than being a cause of pessimism, the pursuit of the target has brought "huge progress". There were 108 million children out of school when the pledge was made; the most recent figures suggest this has fallen to 57 million."If the right strategies are in place, and you put your head where your heart is, then things can be improved. In Afghanistan in 2000 only 4% of girls were in school, now there are more than 70%."Ms Bokova says that another positive outcome has been a much stronger recognition of the importance of measuring the quality of education, rather than simply counting heads going into a classroom.Among the more sobering discoveries has been that many pupils have spent years in school but remained functionally illiterate.So in the autumn, Unesco is planning to produce a new set of global metrics to measure what's actually being learned in primary classrooms around the world. "It will give a global understanding of what quality education means," says Ms Bokova.It remains unclear whether there will be more targets after 2015, but anything that emerges will be more about quality of education, rather than simply volume of places.Ms Bokova says the financial crisis delivered a major blow to achieving the goal of universal primary education. Donor countries pulled the plug and left an "alarming gap" in funding.In sub-Saharan Africa there remains a shortage of 1.7 million teachers.But despite this gloom, she says that the financial crisis has given education a "paradoxical" political importance.Youth unemployment is a major threat in many countries and education and training are seen as vital investments."Education is now becoming in some cases a security issue," she says, with examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq and across the Middle East, where there is huge pressure to provide education to promote stability and democracy and to avoid extremism."The same is true of big emerging powers. In Brazil, the government recognises that the education system is one of the biggest challenges as it moves forward to a competitive economy and an inclusive society."The social tensions of deepening inequality and a lack of social mobility are also shaped by decisions about education systems, she says.Economic and political stability are now inextricably linked to improving education, says the Bulgarian-born Unesco director general."Education is becoming the key issue now in discussions about overcoming the economic crisis."But how are we going to make this happen? Budgets and international aid are shrinking."We try to convince countries that if they want to invest in coming out of the crisis, then invest in education."Another barrier to getting all children to school is a lack of fair access, particularly for girls.Ms Bokova says it's not acceptable for countries to hide behind ideas of "cultural differences" or "tradition" as a reason for discriminating against girls.Malala Yousafzai has become a powerful emblem."One event can spark a huge reaction and understanding and I think it was the case with Malala," she says."It was a stunning example of courage and a desire to learn."And she says that getting more girls into school is the single most important goal."It's not just a human right, it's what is needed to have normal societies. If a girl goes to school, she is less likely to have an early marriage, she will have healthier children, she'll find it easier to earn an income, she's less likely to be subjected to violence, less likely to have an early pregnancy."There are so many advantages, healthier communities, less violence, more economic growth. It has such an incredible multiplying effect."This is the best thing that could happen to humanity."The pledge for education for all has also highlighted where the problem is most acute.A meeting organised by the UN in April brought together eight countries - Bangladesh, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen - which between them have about half the children in the world who are missing out on school.It was an unprecedented attempt to systematically work out what has been going wrong.A minister from the DR Congo said that about 60% of those missing out on school did so because of the cost of school fees with the other 40% blamed on armed conflict.In Ethiopia the problem was identified as being focused on rural communities and lack of access for girls. In South Sudan it was a lack of trained teachers and a low level of school participation among girls.In Nigeria, which has the most children out of school, the difficulty was not necessarily about money, but was caused by low participation among girls in some areas and problems with "infrastructure" about providing teachers. Weaknesses in state authorities delivering the plans of the national government were also blamed.The country has also seen brutal attacks on schools. Secondary schools in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe were ordered to close this week after a massacre in which suspected Islamist extremists killed 22 students.Ms Bokova says that there is now a willingness among such countries to recognise what needs to be changed.Despite the failure to make the 2015 deadline, she says the attempt has shown the international community what can be achieved. Countries such as India and Ethiopia have taken substantial steps forward.This has disproved the feeling that "education is too complex, too costly and it takes too long to show results".But there is no escaping the harsh truth that millions of children, born a decade after the world promised universal primary education, still won't have even the most basic access to school.It's been possible to launch hundreds of satellites and put a spacecraft on Mars, but not to put children into classrooms a few hours south of Heathrow."In many cases we have failed, but it shouldn't discourage us. We're winning the argument."</body>

      <body>Fewer children across the UK are reading in their own time and one in five is embarrassed to be caught with a book, a survey suggests.Just over a quarter of 35,000 children from 188 schools told the National Literacy Trust that they read outside of school.About the same number said they did not think their parents cared if they read.The trust says a similar survey in 2005 found one in three children read in their own time.The survey for the trust involved children filling in online questionnaires last winter.Half of those taking part said they enjoyed reading either "very much" or "quite a lot" and a high proportion (four out of five) agreed with the statement "the more I read, the better I become".Nearly two in five agreed reading was "cool", but about one in three said they only read when they had to.Report author Christina Clark, from the Literacy Trust, said young people who enjoyed reading very much were four times as likely to read above the level expected for their age compared with those who did not enjoy reading at all.Those who read outside of class every day were five times as likely to read above the expected level compared with those who never did.And children who do not think "reading is cool" were four times more likely to be below-average readers, the report says.National Literacy Trust director Jonathan Douglas said: "Our research not only reveals that children are reading less and developing more negative attitudes towards reading, but also that there is a clear correlation between this and their performance in reading tests."The study, of children aged from eight to 16, found that the proportion who read e-books outside of school had doubled since 2010 to 12%.Reading is most popular among eight to 11-year-olds, the survey suggests, although teenagers are more likely to read for longer.The charity released the research to coincide with a new campaign to find the UK's "literacy heroes".It is asking the public to name people who might have inspired a love of books or helped to improve reading skills.Anyone from a parent, teacher or young person who has overcome a personal literacy problem to a favourite author or celebrity can be nominated, the Literacy Trust said.The campaign is being supported by the Duchess of Cornwall, who said: "I firmly believe in the importance of igniting a passion for reading in the next generation."In a world where the written word competes with so many other calls on our attention, we need more literacy heroes to keep inspiring young people to find the pleasure and power of reading for themselves."</body>

      <title>Muslim school reopens after closure</title>
      <description>A Muslim free school in Derby reopens after a temporary closure over "health and safety" concerns.</description>

      <date>1381142999</date>
      <body>A Muslim free school in Derby has reopened almost a week after it was closed during an Ofsted inspection.The Al-Madinah School shut last Tuesday, citing "health and safety concerns", after one day of inspections.Sources said the school had been rated inadequate in all areas by Ofsted, but a final report has not yet been filed.The school has insisted it was closed on undisclosed health and safety grounds and not due to the inspection.Sources said Ofsted found incomplete records of child protection checks being done for all staff.There have been reports that female teachers at the school were forced to wear hijabs even if they were not Muslim.It was also claimed girls were made to sit at the back of the classroom and boys at the front.Free schools - which can be opened by anyone - are state funded but not overseen by the local authority.National Union of Teachers (NUT) spokesman Nick Raine said: "It is a publicly-funded school - if there are health and safety concerns that were serious enough to close the school then what were they and have they been an issue for some time? "Over the weekend Labour politicians asked Education Secretary Michael Gove to clarify matters urgently "to reassure the public".The Department for Education said it was already investigating allegations against the school.Several parents with children at the school told BBC News that they were happy with the school."I would rather it close and they sort it out and now she can back to school and the health and safety is going to be fine," one mother said.The Al-Madinah school, which opened in September 2012, claimed to be the first free school in England with a Muslim ethos, catering for all reception, primary and secondary pupils.But concerns over the application of strict Islamic practices led to a scheduled full inspection being brought forward.A statement on the school website said: "Unsurprisingly, there has been a number of rumours circulating."While unfortunate, my decision to close the school related to a short-term health and safety issue that has now been completely resolved and will not reoccur."</body>

      <title>School maths results 'disappointing'</title>
      <description>"Disappointing" standards in maths among 14 to 16-year-olds in Wales must be tackled, says an education watchdog.</description>

      <body>"Disappointing" standards in maths among 14 to 16-year-olds in Wales must be tackled, says an education watchdog.Estyn's report said maths was the lowest performing core subject at key stage four - when pupils work towards GCSEs - and the lowest in the UK.Last year the proportion of students in Wales achieving C grade and above at GCSE lagged well behind England.The Welsh government said the report had highlighted both successes and areas that could be improved.Estyn said schools must work hard to raise standards.Chief inspector Ann Keane said some employers were having to invest in numeracy skills training for school and college leavers."Many Welsh employers are concerned at the lack of mathematical skills demonstrated by employees," she said.The Estyn report by inspectors said there was a lack of support for the professional development of mathematics teachers.The findings and recommendations were drawn from visits to 18 secondary schools around Wales.The report recommended more support, advice and professional development opportunities should be provided for schools.It highlighted best practice at some schools such as Bishop Gore Comprehensive School in Swansea where it said 20% of pupils gained A* or A grades in GCSE maths in 2012.But the report found there was an 11 percentage point gap between England and Wales in the number of students getting a C grade and above last year.Its author Rob Davies told BBC Radio Wales: "Inspectors are noting that schools are setting their sights too low and and focusing too much on just doing enough to reach grade C and not stretching pupils enough."He pointed to various factors affecting results in Wales."I think there are question marks over whether key stage three [age 11-14] is preparing pupils suitably in Wales," he said."The inspectors have noted that pupils lack confidence in key aspects such as number work and algebra skills."They are the foundations of mathematics and they give pupils the skills to solve problems."Mr Davies said the weaker results were a combination of low expectations, poor teaching in some cases and the current set up of the GCSE, which allows schools not to enter pupils for higher grade material which Mr Davies said too many schools in Wales were doing.He also said too many weaker students were being entered early for the exam, and that there needed to be more consistency across Wales about networking between schools and sharing good practice.Last year the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) published a survey saying there was a "disconnect" between what employers needed and the basic skills of young job seekers.In July, the Welsh government revealed plans to introduce at least four new GCSE exams from September 2015, including two in numeracy and mathematics.It followed a qualifications review in Wales for pupils aged between 14 and 19 also affecting English language and Welsh exams.A Welsh government spokesperson said: "This report shows where we have been successful in developing mathematics in our schools at key stage four, and where we need to sharpen our performance."We welcome its findings and want to congratulate the schools highlighted in the report for their diligence and commitment to improving standards."We have clear evidence that, at an operational level, the best results in mathematics teaching at key stage four are achieved where schools and regional consortia work together, and where teachers have opportunities to share best practice and benefit from appropriate professional development and regular network opportunities."</body>

      <title>'Over half of schools failing in RE'</title>
      <description>More than half of schools in England are failing pupils on religious education, says watchdog Ofsted.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24399813</url>
      <date>1381051158</date>
      <body>More than half of England's schools are failing pupils on religious education, the schools watchdog Ofsted has said.Its report accuses schools and the government of failing to focus effectively on the subject.It adds that six in 10 schools are not "realising the subject's full potential" in an increasingly globalised and multicultural century.The Religious Education Council for England and Wales called the findings disappointing but not surprising.The report highlights low standards, weak teaching, weak examination provision and confusion about the purpose of RE.In particular, it says the recent introduction of the English Baccalaureate measure for pupils who achieve grade C or above in English, mathematics, science, a language and either history or geography, ignores RE and has further marginalised the subject.The report echoes comments by the Education Secretary Michael Gove. In July he told religious leaders RE had "suffered" because of government changes.He said he had thought that because schools have a statutory duty to provide RE lessons the subject was protected.Ofsted's report, Religious Education: realising the potential, says the subject "plays a key role in promoting social cohesion and the virtues of respect and empathy, which are important in our diverse society" but it finds "many pupils leave school with scant subject knowledge and understanding".It adds: "Moreover RE teaching often fails to challenge and extend pupils' ability to explore fundamental questions about human life, religion and belief."Inspectors visited a sample of 185 schools, both primary and secondary, between September 2009 and July 2012.They found achievement and teaching in RE was less than good in six out of 10 primary schools, and in fewer than half of secondary schools and that not enough had been done to improve provision since a previous report in 2010.Teaching in primary schools was "not good enough because of weaknesses in teachers understanding of the subject", they found.Standards were higher for GCSE and sixth form students but even at GCSE level teaching often "failed to secure the core aim of the examination specifications, that is to enable pupils to adopt an enquiring, critical and reflective approach to the study of religion."The authors urge the Department for Education (DfE) to consider whether the quality and quantity of statutory RE provision should be decided locally by schools and local authorities - or specified by central government.They want the DfE to work with professional RE teaching associations to "clarify the aims and purposes of RE" and to improve teacher training.Schools should ensure that teaching deepens "pupils' understanding of the nature, diversity and impact of religion and belief in the contemporary world," they urge.John Keast, chairman of the Religious Education Council for England and Wales said they had been warning "for some time about the poor state of religious education in many schools".He said they would publish their own report and RE curriculum later in October."It is now vital that the DfE works with the Religious Education Council on putting things right. We can do better than this."Stephen Evans of the National Secular Society said the recommendations did not go far enough."With the freedom to determine their own syllabus for RE, many schools with a religious character abuse the subject and use it for missionising."Young people would be better served by a new national curriculum subject for all pupils that covers a variety of religious, non-religious and secular philosophies and world views."Meanwhile, Gail Larkin from the National Association of Head Teachers said consecutive governments were responsible for schools placing less emphasis on the subject.She said: "Some of the major policy changes that we've had, the impact has been to convey the message that RE is of less value than other subjects."So, as a head teacher... we are concentrating more - as we've been told to do by consecutive governments - on core subjects and subjects that can be measured.""Unfortunately", she added, "I think RE has fallen off the radar".</body>

      <title>'Students face living-cost crisis'</title>
      <description>Students in England face a cost-of living-crisis as loans and grants fail to keep pace with rents and bills, suggest figures from the National Union of Students.</description>

      <body>Students in England face a cost-of-living crisis as loans and grants fail to keep pace with rents and bills, claims the National Union of Students.The gap between income and expenditure for a typical student amounts to more than £7,600 according to NUS analysis.The union compared the cost of living and studying for the 39-week 2013-14 academic year with typical income from government grants and loans.The government said it was targeting support at those who needed it most.Rent, bills and other outgoings continue to rise year after year above the rate of inflation but grants and loan rates were frozen this year and will only rise by 1% next year, says the union.It estimates that a student living outside London will pay an average of £21,440 in tuition fees, books, equipment, rent, travel and other living expenses.Against this, they have a potential income of £13,747 composed of their tuition fee loan plus maintenance loans and the grants available to those on average and low incomes.This leaves a shortfall of £7,693.In London, higher rents mean students typically spend £23,187 says the union - but they are also eligible for a higher maintenance loan of £6,090 though this still leaves them with a shortfall of £7,654, says the union.The union adds that some students from less well-off families who are eligible for grants are facing an additional squeeze as the level at which they can claim maximum support has remained at a household income of £25,000 since 2008.NUS president Toni Pearce said: "Those who do not have the rare luxury of resorting to the 'bank of mum and dad' are increasingly being driven to work full-time alongside study where jobs can be found, or worse still, into the arms of predatory pay day lenders just to make ends meet."We need a financial support system that ensures students get what the support they need, when they need it."A spokeswoman for the Department for Business Innovation and Skills said the government's student finance package was designed to target support at students from the poorest households."This year, students from the lowest income households can access over £7,100 of living-cost support, of which over £3,350 does not have to be repaid."The government also provides additional, non-repayable support to students in specific circumstances, such as students with children and disabled students."Scholarships and bursaries are also available from most universities, and students in hardship can apply for additional support through the Access to Learning Fund."</body>

      <title>Gay adoption 'confusion' for couples</title>
      <description>A gay couple say they had to go to England to adopt because of confusion over the law in Northern Ireland.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-24416338</url>
      <date>1381123696</date>
      <body>A gay couple have said they went to England to adopt because of confusion over the law in Northern Ireland.The Court of Appeal ruled that legislation which prevented gay, lesbian and unmarried couples from adopting children in NI was unlawful.It was the only part of the UK where the policy existed.However, Stormont's health minister plans to go to the Supreme Court to try to overturn that decision and get the ban reinstated.John Davis and Jason Scorer, who live in County Antrim, had hoped to adopt children from Northern Ireland, but with uncertainty over the legal position they were advised to consider other options."We were very lucky that our original social worker in Northern Ireland had done a lot of homework before she came, to say that we could not move things any further forward," said John, who has lived in Northern Ireland for 20 years."The problem is a lot of people may not be aware there is another option."They contacted adoption and fostering charity PACT (Parents and Children Together).It helped the couple, who are in a civil partnership, go through the process in England with the aim of giving children from there a home in Northern Ireland."There are children waiting in the system (in Northern Ireland) to find families but, unfortunately, we were not allowed to go down that route," said Jason."And that is to the hardship of the children who are here."They adopted two boys at the start of the summer and they started primary school last month."They are getting loved, they are getting looked after and they are getting cared for," said John.They say they know of other gay couples from Northern Ireland who are now considering going through the adoption process elsewhere in the UK, because the issue is still being debated in the courts.The Department of Health at Stormont confirmed that Health Minister Edwin Poots has now applied to the Supreme Court for leave to appeal against the Court of Appeal's decision that the ban was discriminatory.And he insisted the issue was about stability not sexuality."Unlike other parts of the UK... we have a strong list of adoptive parents who want to take on adopted children," said Mr Poots."I think we should be cautious about changing the system which actually provides the stability those children need."It is not a human right to adopt a child for either a mixed-sex couple or a same-sex couple."Gay and lesbian groups, as well as organisations like BAAF (British Association for Adoption and Fostering), have criticised the minister's decision to continue fighting the issue in the courts.But he said surveys had shown support for his position."What I look at it is where the Northern Ireland public are on these issues and what is in the best interests of the children," he said."There is a lot of public opposition to it."In Belfast, there were people with strong views on both sides of the argument.Those against gay couples having the right to adopt argued that children needed both male and female role models and some claimed it was against their religious beliefs.However, many said that the only important thing was providing a stable home for a child, irrespective of whether the couple were married or their sexuality."You could argue all day about the gay thing - whether it is right that someone who is gay should be gay," says John Davis."But I believe it goes back to the loving, caring environment and stability that you can give these children, that they have not had up to this point."</body>

      <title>Murdered Keanu 'failed' by agencies</title>
      <description>A serious case review into the murder of two-year-old Keanu Williams finds police, social services and health workers "failed" to prevent his death.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-24365700</url>
      <date>1380809518</date>
      <body>There were "a number of significant missed opportunities" to save a two-year-old boy from being beaten to death by his mother, a report has found.Rebecca Shuttleworth is serving a life sentence for murdering Keanu Williams.The toddler was found with 37 injuries including a fractured skull and torn abdomen, in Ward End, Birmingham.A serious case review said social care workers, the police and health professionals had "collectively failed to prevent Keanu's death".Shuttleworth, 25, was spoken to in prison by members of the serious case review team, telling them she was "surprised" social workers allowed her to keep custody of Keanu.The report states: "She expressed some surprise that Keanu had not been removed from her care when born."As Rebecca Shuttleworth is intending to appeal her sentence, although it is unclear if that is possible, she was not able to talk more about services which might have prevented Keanu's death."The report found different agencies had "become confused" as their strategy discussions had focused on the medical and forensic aspect of his injuries, the report said.It concluded that although Keanu's death on 9 January 2011 could not have been predicted, the agencies involved could have seen that he was "likely to suffer significant harm".The toddler should have been subject to a child protection plan "on at least two occasions" to address issues of neglect and physical harm, the report said.Jane Held, from the Birmingham Safeguarding Children Board, said Keanu died because there were "failings across every agency"."No-one walked in his shoes, staff were distracted by his mother's needs and by taking what she had told them at face value," she said.Ms Held said there had been "double-figure sackings" since Keanu's death, but added: "It is unfortunately an appalling situation."We are unequivocally sorry about the fact that unacceptable failures in 2011 and from the start of Keanu's life meant that we did not prevent his death and we failed to protect him, and that is something that I think all the board feel incredibly distressed about."Shuttleworth, of Cottingham Road, Manchester, was convicted of murder and four counts of child cruelty after a five-month trial. She was ordered to serve at least 18 years.Keanu was born in Torbay, Devon, and the report also found Torbay's Children's Services should have been aware of the risks even before his birth.It states: "There was enough information available to raise concerns that the unborn child was likely to be at risk of suffering significant harm."The authority also later received two anonymous reports of concerns about Rebecca Shuttleworth's care of Keanu which should have led to a reassessment of his safety.It concluded: "If a child protection plan had been in place, there would have been more robust arrangements to safeguard and promote Keanu's interests."Torbay Council's director of children's services, Richard Williams, said: "This is an extremely sad case and I would like to reassure everyone that we take the recommendations in this review very seriously and have acted upon them all."The serious case review makes eight recommendations:The report was told there has been an "end-to-end" review of the child protection system since Keanu's death, as it became clear there had been poor performance and a general lack of compliance with child protection procedures.In a comment that echoes those made after the death of starved four-year-old Daniel Pelka, the report says that Keanu had become "invisible".The serious case review into the death of Keanu Williams is the twenty-third to be published in Birmingham since the Local Safeguarding Board's inception in 2006.Peter Hay, from Birmingham City Council said admitted that its track record over recent years was "poor" and said the council was "unequivocally sorry"."Keanu's death is another tragic reminder of the consequences of failing children's services," he said.Edward Timpson, the government minister for children and families, said he has issued the council with a "final warning"."There is no quick fix, however I have been very clear with Birmingham that unless I see rapid improvement further action will follow," he added.Ofsted will return to Birmingham in autumn to determine what progress has been made, the minister said.The National Children's Bureau said it was "particularly worrying" that the review found that no conversations were held with Keanu to find out what he was feeling.Dr Hilary Emery, from the children's charity, said no child at risk should ever be "only seen and not heard"."We urgently need to review how best to support children within the child protection system - especially the very young ones - to ensure their voices are listened to at every opportunity," he said.West Midlands Police said their officers need to "challenge social workers and doctors" in future.Assistant Chief Constable Sharon Rowe said: "Of course it's a collective failure and we paid a key role in that."Ultimate accountability rests with Keanu's mother who was convicted of his murder - let's not forget that."Fay Baillie, director of nursing for NHS England in Birmingham, Solihull and the Black Country said: "I don't think children in Birmingham will ever be completely safe."We are always going to have deceptive mothers and families, however we can aim to make it as safe as possible by working together and improving education."</body>

      <title>From drug smuggler to going straight</title>
      <description>How ex-prisoner Frank went from drug smuggling to a 'stable life'</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24460089</url>
      <date>1381408161</date>
      <body>As Ofsted inspectors deliver a critical verdict of the education prisoners receive in England's jails, one ex-inmate describes how he finally learnt a vital lesson.Expelled from school at 12, Frank Harris says it was the thought of how he would be remembered by his own children that helped him see education as a way to change his life.The 53-year-old Londoner says he was in and out of prisons for more than 30 years before he found his "way out" through education and wants other people involved in crime to see it is not too late for them either."I wasn't getting any younger. I was thinking, 'What will my four kids do if I dropped down [dead]?'"If they said I was in and out of prison - that I wasted my time on earth. Now they can say I made mistakes, but I tried to do something different. That pushes me on."I'm still enjoying my education and still have something to give back."Frank is in the second year of a degree in criminology and criminal justice. He counsels and mentors others who have been involved in crime and has worked with the police on tackling gang culture.But in 2004 he was facing his longest prison stretch ever - four years for smuggling cocaine from Amsterdam - after what he says was a "lifetime of crime"."I knew I'd be coming out, that I needed to do something, to make a change instead of hanging around with people," he said."I found I enjoyed learning. I had been interested before in lots of things but never had the kind of environment for it to be cool to learn."In prison, he did basic skills lessons before getting A-grades in GCSE English and maths."People saying well done, that inspired me to say I enjoyed doing this education and it was positive. I saw I could change my life, learning and achieving things. I saw education as a way out and that it could be the key to set me free."After leaving jail, Frank says he was very tempted to go back to his old way of life but instead decided to stay in touch with a charity that had supported him inside - the Prisoners' Education Trust - and the St Giles Trust."Normally, I was getting picked up by one of my friends [when I got out of jail], and before I got back to London, I would be stoned and wouldn't get home for two days."The crucial thing this time was there was link. This group had offices you can get in touch with when you get out."Frank says he was on the verge of getting involved with crime again when, he says: "Something told me, 'Don't take the left path, take a right,' and instead, I went down to the offices."He went on take a qualification in counselling to help homeless and vulnerable people and to work for the charity Turning Point.He now counsels others, he says, "to try to stop them taking my path".Like many people in Britain's jails, Frank did badly at school. He had no academic qualifications before studying in prison in his 40s.Expelled at 12, he says he was "delinquent" for 18 months, before being sent to a reform "boarding school", where he says there was no proper teaching."The classroom was a work room and the teachers - who were really PE teachers - used to say, 'Finish that English off, then you can finish making your chair.'"Boys would be banging about while others were doing written work."Frank says things then went further downhill."I'd come home every two weeks - my family would not know me, I had no friends. I'd go around by myself and began breaking in to cars, doing rubbish stuff because I was lonely, bored."Shortly after that, Frank says, he began to get custodial sentences for theft and fraud and "that was it for 30 years".He says he was never involved with violent or sexual crimes, but witnessed violence."People were getting shot in a car next to me; people getting stabbed, but I never picked up a knife in anger. I was smoking crack but I always felt I was on the outside looking in; like I was not meant to be there."Now I know that reason was to say to young men and women, 'You don't have to go that way - it's such a waste.' I'm here to tell that story."If you find yourself on the that road, if you are in prison, there's a way out and it's education."Now I'm a proper father, a proper son, a proper grandfather. I'm stable and I have a family that's stable."</body>

      <body>Corruption in education is a serious blight that undermines the quality and availability of schools and universities around the world, according to an international report.Anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International have published a global survey showing that about one in six students has had to pay a bribe for education services.In parts of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia this might be requiring parents to pay a fee for a school place that should be free.In Eastern Europe, it might be paying to gain an advantage in university admissions.The Berlin-based campaign group is best known for its annual "global corruption barometer", which measures levels of dishonest payments in more than 100 countries, based on more than 114,000 household interviews.This year's survey also asked questions about people's first-hand experiences and perceptions of dishonesty in education.In some countries these perceptions are distinctively negative. The report says that almost three-quarters of people in Cameroon and Russia see their education systems as "corrupt or highly corrupt".The findings show a huge range of malpractice.In Pakistan, there are warnings of thousands of "shadow schools" without any real students, but drawing public funding to pay for "ghost teachers"."Leakages" in the funding of schools in Kenya had the equivalent value of losing more than 11 million text books, says the report. A study of 180 schools in Tanzania showed that more than a third of intended funds had failed to reach the school.In Greece there are warnings about nepotism in jobs and promotions in higher education.In Vietnam there is a problem with bribery for places in the most sought-after schools.The report quotes figures from the United Nations showing 110 countries where fees are levied, despite in theory having free education enshrined in law. The report describes "myriad pretexts" to impose charges on parents.So why should education be so vulnerable to corruption?Parents want the best for their children, says the report, and they can be exploited by unscrupulous officials controlling access to places.It also involves a great deal of public money filtering down from central government to local school authorities. In Nigeria, the report says, $21m (£13m) intended for schools was lost in two years.But it's not only a problem for the developing world or those providing the basics of schooling.The massive expansion in demand for university education has created rich opportunities for illicit charges.Students need degree-level qualifications more than ever and are under great pressure to get university places and to leave with good grades, opening up fertile territory for corruption and cheating.Eastern European and former Soviet states are highlighted as having had particular difficulties.In Georgia, there have been reforms to stop corruption in university admissions. This hadn't simply been "cash-filled envelopes", but included a complex system of having to buy tutoring, Transparency International found.There could also be more practical types of illicit charges, with suggestions that in Romania access to university accommodation depended on bribery.The demand for qualifications has also generated its own industry in fake universities.In the United States, the report estimates, there are about a thousand "degree mills" in operation, selling bogus qualifications.This isn't only harmless self-delusion, says the report, as these bought qualifications are used to gain graduate jobs, including in one case working in a nuclear power plant.It also highlights the case of Colby Nolan, a student who ostensibly gained an MBA degree in 2004, until his owner revealed that the graduate was a six-year-old cat. He had gained the equivalent of an upper second class degree.The growth of higher education as a globalised, multi-billion dollar business has also spawned a parallel opportunity for fraud, says Philip Altbach, director of the Center for International Higher Education in the Lynch School of Education at Boston College.He has described the "spectre of corruption haunting" the move towards a more internationalised higher education system.And he has called for more co-ordinated international efforts to set standards and share information.The Transparency International study says that corruption has a corrosive effect on education, raising the cost and lowering the quality."Many people wouldn't realise the extent of corruption in education, right through from the financing of education through to academic corruption," says report editor, Gareth Sweeney."In some countries it's such a serious problem that it could undermine the credibility of their education systems."There is some good news as the report highlights efforts to tackle bribery.In Chile, anti-corruption lessons have been introduced to the school curriculum and in Bangladesh there is an "integrity pledge" taken by officials.The proliferation of mobile phones in Africa is being used to allow people to expose concerns about bribery in schools.Legal advice centres have also been developed in a number of countries to help community groups make legal challenges against school corruption.There are also international efforts to improve the monitoring and tracking of education funds.But corruption is still there leaching away education budgets. It's a particularly bleak problem when there are still tens of millions of children without any access to school."Corruption is an obstacle to a fundamental human right to education," says Mr Sweeney.While there are campaigners calling for education for all, such as Malala Yousafzai in Pakistan, this report also warns of the barriers being created for the poorest communities by demands for corrupt payments.Teachers take bribes to offset poor wages or irregular payments and that in turn raises questions about the lack of funding coming from higher up the chain.Mr Sweeney says that there should be a way of measuring good governance in any future global education targets."Even when formal school fees are abolished, many households are still being forced to pay informal fees. How is a family supposed to be able to afford these costs, when they cannot afford their daily meals?," says Pauline Rose, director of Unesco's Global Monitoring Report, which tracks progress towards primary education for all."Until these hidden costs are eradicated, we will not be able to call education free, and universal primary education will continue to remain a distant goal for the poorest."</body>

      <title>University boss: Head teacher, mayor or chief executive?</title>
      <description>What does a university vice-chancellor do?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24462298</url>
      <date>1381370654</date>
      <body>Sir David Bell is vice-chancellor of the University of Reading. So what does he do all day?Does it make him a high-powered head teacher, responsible for the university's academic prowess?Or does it make him chief executive of a multi-million pound enterprise, plotting its future business strategy?Sitting in his office at the beginning of a new academic year, it's a reminder of how many big decisions are lying ahead of the UK's university leaders.On the most practical level, he says, it's like running a small town, with its own housing, doctors, libraries, nursery, shops, bars, sports facilities, hundreds of acres of parkland and campus security.There is an ambassadorial role of seeing and being seen.But it's easy to overlook how much universities have grown in terms of local economic significance. It's a long way from being an academic cottage industry.The vice-chancellor in many university towns is now the biggest local employer, apart from the NHS.There are 4,000 people directly employed by Reading University and many more depend on its spending power. The university and its staff and students are worth an estimated £1.78m every single day to the local economy.Universities like Reading were often set up with money from local big businesses - and now they've become the local big spenders themselves.Reading University is a member of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), as well as belonging to academic groups.Even after students finish their courses, the impact continues, with an estimated 19,000 of the university's graduates continuing to live and work in the area.There is an international dimension, as the UK's universities look to expand overseas, not least because of the need for a reliable source of extra income.Reading already has an outpost in South Africa and is planning to open a campus in Malaysia. They decided not to go ahead with plans for China.Sir David, a former Ofsted chief inspector, says the university needs to make plans to offset the volatility of relying on undergraduate student numbers.The word that Sir David uses to describe his responsibilities is "stewardship".The university is heading towards the 100th anniversary of its charter and as the current captain of the ship he wants to make sure it continues safely into the future.He says he "feels the weight" of this legacy and has the words of a previous vice-chancellor on his office wall: "Universities are living things - they feel, think and do.""There's a danger in being purely a chief executive. At the heart, it's about teaching and research," he says.He says he spends as much time as he can with the academics.In terms of running the organisation, there is the weekly equivalent of a cabinet meeting of senior staff."You sometimes feel vulnerable, you're carrying financial risks. These are big decisions about opening campuses overseas. But you have to make the best decisions at the time with the information available."There is also a responsibility for 17,000 young lives.He says he has been meeting and greeting new arrivals at the university. Watching parents saying goodbye to their children has brought home to him the importance of this moment."This is a big deal. We've got to look after them. It's often their first experience away from home."The funding of universities is increasingly dependent on attracting undergraduates and their tuition fees. And the unpredictability is a problem for long-term planning."I can't imagine there's a vice-chancellor in the land who isn't thinking about it."It raises questions about how mainstream, provincial universities, with a tradition of doing a bit of everything, can make themselves distinctive. Not just compared with other UK universities but also international rivals.The emergence of online university courses - so-called Moocs - makes the powerhouses of US universities only a mouse click away.The uncertainty over undergraduate numbers has given universities an incentive to find other sources of income, such as shifting towards graduate courses and executive training.The Henley Business School, a slice of the City on the Reading campus, has its own mock trading rooms.Postgraduates are now 45% of the students on Reading's campus.But how should a modern university present itself? Is it meant to be clad in ivy or silicon?On a warm autumn afternoon, the Reading campus looks like something from an American college movie, with youngsters practising American football on leafy sports fields.It's a long way from roll-up cigarettes and Oxfam overcoats.There has been a surge of new university buildings to attract young students. In Reading they've put £400m into new accommodation.Sir David says universities have had to respond to "changing patterns of affluence and what young people expect"."I don't take too precious a view of that."But if universities spend too much, they can be accused of being cash rich.When earlier this year the university bought a unique Samuel Beckett manuscript to add to its archive there was some carping about the price tag of £962,500. A US university would have told everyone it cost twice as much and put it all over the website to show they were serious players.Sir David says that despite the upheavals in funding and technology and the push towards a more competitive system he expects more to stay the same than will change."We're in turbulent times," he says, but remains confident that the university will still be recognisable in two decades."There is something powerful in having great seats of learning."</body>

      <title>The state school sixth formers twinned with Eton</title>
      <description>State and public school sixth formers twinned</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24289105</url>
      <date>1381016264</date>
      <body>From a busy junction at Stratford High Street in East London, there is a great view of a symbol of one of the UK's most glittering recent successes - the Olympic Park - and the modern station created to go with it.And close by is an unusual school which is striving to bring together the old and the new traditions of England - much like the spectacular opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics.The London Academy of Excellence is a government-funded sixth-form serving the East End of the capital which is trying to bridge the gap between private and state schools.It opened its doors as London basked in the glow of the Olympics last year.In an unusual partnership, pupils there share lessons, sport and teachers with a local community school and several independent fee-paying schools including Eton, Brighton College and Highgate.It is easy to miss the London Academy of Excellence. Its modern building looks like any other shiny office block, perched on the edge of a busy road.It is as far from the green playing fields and quads of Eton and Brighton College as you could imagine - but pupils at these and the other schools involved are sharing more than lessons and aspirations.Through a buddy system, they are getting to know each other during visits and getting a window on each other's lives.Yousef, 17, was one of the first group of sixth-formers to join the academy."I was attracted by the links with Eton and the other schools," he said."This has built a bridge between us and independent schools. It's taught us a lot. It's illustrated that we have far more in common than difference."I get to visit Eton House boys with tailcoats. That was a bit of an experience, out of the ordinary, but behind that we saw a lot of similarities between us."Do the teenagers feel envious when they see the very different surroundings of pupils at the other schools?Curtis, 17, says no."One buddy took us on a tour and I studied a lesson of history with them. There was a similar-sized classroom, a similar way of teaching and talking. I felt at home there," he said."I did not feel envious. I am not that kind of individual. But who would not want to study at Eton?"Some of the sixth-formers say they feel lucky, because they do not have to pay for their education."We have this free. They are paying vast amounts to go to a college similar to ours", says Clinton.Ellie says the students at the other schools seemed really pleased to meet them."They were just as interested in us as we were in them. My buddy was asking so many questions about what we do."Most of their education takes place in the bright modern, business-like surroundings of their academy, in a converted office block.Their "uniform" is a "smart, professional dress code".The walls are white, the furniture bright. Big bold canvases with faces of famous intellectuals, scientists, artists and writers decorate the walls, dotted with their words of inspiration.In front of one of them is the academy's headmaster Robert Wilne, an energetic man, who bubbles over with enthusiasm for his pupils' success, their futures - and the aims of this experimental school."There are many schools doing interesting partnerships," he said."But this is a third way for independent schools, aside from giving bursaries or sponsoring academies."It is an experiment. I would love another city to look at it."It's a genuine, deep-seated partnership between eight schools that are woven in to the DNA of this academy."It's not window dressing or surface gloss."It is an experiment praised by the head of England's schools inspectorate Sir Michael Wilshaw, who in the summer accused many independent schools of living in "splendid isolation" from the state sector.He drew criticism from some in the private school sector this week too, for saying some schools' links with state schools were small, like crumbs from their tables.Some responded angrily, saying that their schools saved taxpayers money by educating children outside of the state sector.Both Labour and coalition governments have called for more links between private and state sector schools.All the academy's funding is from the government, says Mr Wilne and there is no direct funding from private schools.But there is support "in kind" and through links. Some of the governors are from the independent schools in the partnership."We draw on their various expertise and resources," says the headmaster."So if I want a scheme of work [curriculum plan] for maths, I go to to Highgate and ask for that. The head of economics at Brighton College is de facto head of economics here."They have been down and given feedback and mentoring support."Mr Wilne hopes the school will help social mobility."Education is the fuel of social mobility, education changes lives," he says."This 360 degree education we are offering here should fuel that mobility. Students will get the grades that will unlock doors to top universities and they are taking up extra-curricular activities and sports."They are interested in meeting others and they are not going to be daunted by meeting Etonians in the future."Sport, it seems, has also proved to be a good ice-breaker between students at the various schools."We enjoy visiting them as much as the sport," says Yousef.Curtis says he is enjoying trying out new sports."There is so much sport available. We do rowing. In my secondary school, we did rowing on a rowing machine, now we get to go on the water."With the first full exam season under its belt, the academy is now into its second year. The pioneer year looks to be a hard act to follow, having achieved 70% of their AS-levels at grades of A or B.Three students, including Ellie, spent part of the summer in the USA on a summer school after being encouraged to apply."I always wanted to go to university but did not aspire to the top ones," she said.The students say the school has widened their horizons, with encouragement to do so often coming in the shape of one of the many emails pumped out by their headmaster telling them of various opportunities."I get worried if I don't get an email from the head," one teenager says.They are getting help with their university applications and personal statements from one of the visiting teachers from the private sector.Student Harmanpreet says: "Our old head was always saying it's not about where you come from but where you are going."We know we are from a deprived area but LAE has shown us where we want to go."</body>

      <title>Freshers' fun? Not for the cleaners</title>
      <description>Fun for students but not the university cleaners</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24275092</url>
      <date>1380759129</date>
      <body>Students are returning for the new university term. There will be parties, long beery nights and bleary late mornings. It's the binge-fest of freshers' week.But for cleaners at one London university, it is the "worst week of the year" when there is "double work".The students and the cleaners share the university campus; they both work here, but to very different timetables. The cleaners are on the way to work before some of the students will be on the way home.University cleaners start work from 04:00, travelling through the dark streets on buses from the edges of the capital.Mostly Spanish speakers from South and Central America, many will have begun their journey more than an hour earlier.While the new term means freshers' parties for students, there's a different kind of freshening going on for the cleaners.They will have cleaned the toilets, emptied the bins, swept the floor, wiped the desks, while the students and their teachers will have been asleep. It's a double life for this university.As the first students begin to come through the doors in the morning, holding on to their textbooks and takeaway coffees, the cleaners have already finished their shifts.But they haven't finished working. Many will have multiple jobs, a few hours at a time, criss-crossing London by bus because the Tube fares are too expensive and they're not paid for the travelling in between.One university cleaner, who wants to remain anonymous, describes his daily timetable and gives his perspective on university life.He leaves his home at 03:00 for the first of three cleaning jobs. He works shifts from 04:00 - 06:00 and then 06:00 - 16:30 in central London and then finishes with a two-hour shift in south London, between 17:30 and 19:30.Then he goes home to his three children and gets ready to start work again the next morning.He works five days a week, but he says he has colleagues who work like this six or seven days a week."Sometimes I don't want to wake up. But I can't afford to miss a single day."It's dirty. People leave their rubbish on the floor. You think they would appreciate you, but you get into the lift and they turn away from you."That affects me. When you're trying to clean the toilets, people get cross. There's a lack of respect - it's very hard."Is it because we're cleaners? Because we're foreigners and we don't speak the language?"It's easy for families to break up, he says. Children without parents around can get into trouble. With no spare cash, people have to borrow and quickly get into high-interest borrowing. Long hours are worked to pay high London rents.And before making any assumptions about who gets caught up in this cycle, he says he works alongside cleaners who in their own countries had been a lawyer, a psychologist and a teacher. He is a graduate himself, before coming to the UK more than a decade ago.What's the worst part of cleaning?He says it's the toilets. And he can't understand how people can leave the bathrooms in such a bad way.Just as crushing is the sense of not being valued, particularly in an educational institution, where students debate ideas of equality, labour rights and social justice."I thought people would behave well, they would have courtesy, good manners."Instead, he says, even when he has been taking out a bin from below someone's desk they've refused to acknowledge him.These might be corridors of learning. But someone still has to clean them.Not speaking much English, competing at the most precarious end of the temporary labour market, cleaners are vulnerable to being exploited. It's part of the reason that he doesn't want to be identified.A previous contractor owed the cleaners money for three months, he says.They can't take their concerns to the university, because they work for an international outsourcing company. And there have been long-running campaigns over pay and conditions.But without being part of the university staff, the cleaners still share the same buildings, a parallel set of footsteps in the libraries, the lecture halls, the classrooms, unseen during the hours before dawn.He says they see the photos of families on the desks each day, they prepare the rooms. Without any sign of self-pity, he says: "Some of these tables are cleaned with tears."It's a tale of two cities invisible to one another.</body>

      <title>Angry Birds fires into the classroom</title>
      <description>Do video games have a place in the classroom?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24228473</url>

      <body>From Angry Birds to Minecraft, computer games are invading the classroom. But this is not going on behind the teacher's back anymore: it is part of the lesson plan.The average young person will have spent 10,000 hours gaming by the time they are 21 years old, research suggests.This has been mainly for entertainment, providing light relief from the maths textbooks and science experiments taking place in classrooms. But gaming is taking up more time of a child's life.For a child in the US with perfect attendance, 10,080 hours will be spent in school from fifth grade (age 10) to high school graduation, according to game designer Jane McGonigal.In the UK, computer games offering "stealth learning" have been used by many schools. But the big developers have generally, so far at least, not been keen to get involved.Angry Birds creator Rovio has brought Angry Birds Playground, a schools initiative devised with the University of Helsinki in Finland, into the kindergarten classroom of children, aimed at six-year-olds.With the initiative already in use in Finland, Rovio has now entered into an agreement with schools in China."With small children, the Finnish approach to education is very much play-orientated," says Sanna Lukander, vice president of book publishing at Rovio Entertainment."These characters and their world seemed to inspire children. You can't not think about how you might motivate children to do more than play."Finland is rated as having the best education system in the developed world.And it is not just the same edition of Angry Birds re-packaged: it is using the now-famous characters in new education-based games and a "full 360-degree approach to learning" involving books, teachers and digital devices.But what is it that children can learn from computer games which can really help with the hard learning needed in the classroom?"Games have a larger effect on learning than traditional materials in particular areas, like language acquisition, science, mathematics and social studies," says games scholar Professor Constance Steinkuehler, a former White House analyst."It's not just making the game, it's then about going back and assessing it - is it having the impact and educating in the way you hoped?"If you're talking about games in the classroom, games aren't the only vehicle for learning. You have a teacher, you have peer interaction and a structure of activities, that all plays a role, whether it's productive or whether it's rubbish."It's just like giving a textbook - you can have a fabulous one you can do great stuff with or not."And Rovio is keen to point out that it is not just the games having an impact in the classroom."Angry Birds Playground is not an educational game, it's an educational environment," says Ms Lukander."We couldn't put Angry Birds stickers on learning and just export it. It's a lot of careful RandD and research. It's been in the works for two and a half years."What this means is more than just using a slingshot to launch birds at pigs.Rovio has already worked with the publishers Penguin, National Geographic, Nasa, the National Geographic and others on educational books. It is not even branding itself as a games company but as a media company,But it is not the only media company in educational games.At the more avant garde end of games aimed at educating children, there are shooting games attempting to make chewing vegetables seem cool right through to combating sexually transmitted infections with a choice of superhero characters like Willy the Kid.Yes, really.More widely, Minecraft, the virtual world game, is being used in classrooms in all sorts of innovative ways."Minecraft is one of the most important games for learning right now," says Prof Steinkuehler."What kids are doing with Minecraft is mind-blowing. It's just amazing."In a classroom at Reykjavik University in Iceland, just like many others, Minecraft is used as a 3D graphical interface to help young people understand the basics of telling a computer what to do.According to MinecraftEdu, which is working with around 1,000 schools, the game is being used in every subject area across all school age groups, providing digital building blocks of what a lesson can demonstrate and teach.But interestingly, Minecraft is blocked by a number of school firewalls.And there are those who think games in the classroom do more harm than good."Gaming in the classroom might be frivolous at worst or entertaining at best," says teacher and author Dr Gary Stager.Current systems of education, Dr Stager argues, are seen as "unpleasant, tortuous and create a league table of winners and losers". But games in the classroom are not the way to fix it."The games developed for education tend to be a lot less fun, interesting and merely test prior knowledge," he says."Worst of all, they're coercive. Adults are taking something kids love - games - and using them in a coercive fashion to deliver curriculum."But the technology companies working with children see the move towards gaming and technology as inevitable. LeapFrog's LeapPad2 tablet device was one of the best-selling toys last year."Children already live in a multi-screen environment," says Sally Plumridge, LeapFrog's international marketing director."The whole world they work in is much more interactive. Bringing gaming into their lives really allows them to develop those cognitive skills.""There's still a need to learn in a traditional way; however, the way that traditional learning extends into new technologies just gives a different dimension to education and a more practical dimension."Children develop in role play and looking what their parents do. From a very early age, they see their parents with tablets and phones."Their instincts in that world of what to do and when to do it are much more enhanced than our own. We're learning it and they're growing up with it."Perhaps that is why so many parents look to their children for help when their phone stops working - they've spent 10,000 hours on these devices before they turn 21.</body>

      <title>More energy price rises expected</title>
      <description>Consumer groups predict that the UK's other major energy suppliers will raise prices after SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24475868</url>
      <date>1381419415</date>
      <body>Consumer groups are predicting that the UK's other major energy suppliers will raise prices after SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills.SSE said its average annual dual fuel energy bill would rise by £106 to £1,380 on 15 November.One industry expert described the move as "the final nail in the coffin for affordable energy", but SSE said that many costs were beyond its control.The decision prompted fevered political debate over who to blame for the rise.Citizens Advice is expecting an "avalanche" of increases but has called on the other energy firms to freeze prices."This price rise will be a blow for stretched budgets," said the charity's chief executive Gillian Guy."I hope other energy firms show an understanding of their customers' financial situation by not raising their prices this winter."Many households are facing a daily battle try to make their frozen incomes cover mounting energy, food and travel costs. Further increases will push people into poverty."SSE said that 8.2% was an average rise. Customers in the North of England and central Scotland would see the smallest increase, of 7%, in their dual fuel price. Customers in the South East of England would see the biggest, up 9.7%.It added that the rise reflected higher costs of buying wholesale energy and paying to deliver it to customers' homes, plus government levies.The move has amplified political debate about the issue of energy bills.Labour leader Ed Miliband, who pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election, described SSE's price rise as a "scandal". He accused the government of "letting energy companies get away with this".But Prime Minister David Cameron branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas.SSE's price rises will affect about 4.4 million domestic electricity customers and 2.9 million domestic gas customers.One of those customers is Gary Waywell, from Somerset, who has been a SSE customer for eight years.He said he was surprised by the size of the price rise and angry at the timing just before winter."I can hardly go to my boss and say, 'would you mind giving me an extra £16 a week for the winter. I don't think he is going to smile at that," he said.SSE's Will Morris said he understood customers' frustration."We're sorry we have to do this," he said."We've done as much as we could to keep prices down, but the reality is that buying wholesale energy in global markets, delivering it to customers' homes, and government-imposed levies collected through bills - endorsed by all the major parties - all cost more than they did last year."SSE, made up of Southern Electric, Swalec and Scottish Hydro, said that for a typical dual-fuel customer, wholesale energy prices had gone up 4%, paying to use delivery networks was 10% more expensive, and government levies were 13% higher.Up to 11% of a customer's bill goes on government programmes to save energy, reduce emissions and tackle climate change, according to regulator Ofgem. SSE said it wanted this to be included in general taxation, rather than added to bills.However, Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: "Half of an average energy bill is made up of the wholesale cost of energy. This far outweighs the proportion of a bill that goes to help vulnerable households with their bills and to cut energy waste."SSE's announcement comes about a year after the last set of gas and electricity price rises.Between August and December 2012, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%.Ann Robinson, from price comparison website Uswitch, which could benefit from consumers swapping suppliers, said: "This is a crippling blow for consumers, who are still reeling from last winter's price hike. Adding to an already sky-high energy bill will leave consumers buckling under the pressure. It's the final nail in the coffin for affordable energy."Of course the danger now is that the other big six suppliers will follow suit. This raises the spectre of yet more households forced to cut back on their heating."The latest calculations from the regulator found that the average profit margin made by an energy supplier on an average £1,315 bill is £65.SSE, formerly Scottish and Southern Energy, said it expected its annual profit margin to average about 5% over a three-to-five-year period, which it believed was "a fair amount".It said its profit margin was 4.2% in the 2012-13 financial year and was expected to fall short of the 5% target again this year."We know we will come in for a great deal of criticism for this decision and politicians will no doubt be lining up to condemn us," said SSE's Mr Morris."But over many years, policymakers themselves have failed to highlight adequately the cost to consumers of the policies they have pursued in government."They can't expect to have power stations replaced with new technologies, the network to be upgraded and nationwide energy efficiency schemes all to be funded for free."And as an energy provider, we are in the unenviable position of having to pass this cost on to consumers through energy bills."The BBC understands that the government is prepared to look at easing green taxes on smaller energy companies. These costs include paying for measures to save energy, reduce emissions and tackle climate change, and also include the cost of social programmes to help vulnerable customers.At present, companies with 250,000 customers are liable to pay the green levy.This threshold could be changed in order to encourage smaller energy companies to enter the market and challenge the big six.

      <title>Royal Mail sale: Small bids favoured</title>
      <description>Investors who applied for £750 worth of Royal Mail shares will receive their full allocation, the BBC has learned.</description>

      <body>Small investors will be favoured in the privatisation of the Royal Mail, at the expense of those seeking a large allocation, the BBC has learned.Anyone who subscribed for the minimum entitlement of £750 will receive 100% of their application, according to BBC business editor Robert Peston.But those who have applied for £10,000 worth of shares or more, will not receive any, he said.Demand for Royal Mail shares far outstripped the supply.Robert Peston said: "A government source said to me that ministers wanted to reward the Mrs Migginses, but not the big professional investors."Royal Mail's shares will be priced at 330p, which is at the top end of what the government was hoping for and values the entire Royal Mail at £3.3bn.Shares were initially priced between 260p and 330p, but strong demand led the government to revise the figures upwards on Friday last week.There were more than 700,000 individual applications for shares, which far outstripped the value of shares available.Retail investors could apply for up to £10,000 worth of Royal Mail shares online, but could bid for a much bigger allocation if they applied through a stock broker.But the government has decided to favour more modest investors and any applications seeking more than £10,000 worth of shares will receive none.The applications indicate that individual investors had about £4bn to spend on Royal Mail shares, which is much more than the £517m worth of shares on offer.Applications for shares from professional investors also far outstripped the amount allocated to them.Our business editor says that combined, individual and professional investors may have had £15bn available to invest.He also said that individual investors could be allotted as much as 33% of the total shares on offer, up from the original amount of 30%, while professional investors could expect their share to be reduced slightly to 67%.The government will sell 52.2% of the company, the maximum it was prepared to sell at this stage, he adds.That puts the value for the Treasury of the privatisation at £1.7bn.Full trading in Royal Mail shares begins next Tuesday on the London Stock Exchange.However, investors have been able to speculate on the value of Royal Mail ahead of the official start of trading on what is known as the grey market.Financial bookmaker IG Index says that, as of Thursday morning, orders placed by its clients indicate Royal Mail shares could be worth between 405p and 425p each.However, that is just an indication and the market may react differently next week.Under the terms of the share sale, a 10% stake in the business has been reserved for Royal Mail employees.Members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) are voting on whether to strike over the government's privatisation plan.The ballot closes on 16 October and strike action could begin as early as 23 October.Royal Mail says the fundraising will provide it with the money needed to modernise and compete in a competitive parcels market.Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna criticised the government on Monday for "short-changing" taxpayers.In particular, Labour says the privatisation may be undervaluing Royal Mail's property, some of which is in prime locations.However, on Wednesday, Business Secretary Vince Cable told a parliamentary committee: "We're confident that it's priced in the right place".</body>

      <title>Taylor to serve jail term in UK</title>
      <description>Liberian ex-President Charles Taylor is to serve his 50-year war crimes sentence in the UK, Justice Minister Jeremy Wright confirms.</description>

      <date>1381404403</date>
      <body>Ex-Liberian President Charles Taylor is to serve his 50-year war crimes sentence in the UK, Justice Minister Jeremy Wright has confirmed.Finland, Rwanda and Sweden were other possibilities following the rejection of his appeal last month by a UN-backed special court in The Hague.It ruled that his convictions had been proved beyond doubt.He was sentenced in May 2012 for aiding rebels who committed atrocities in Sierra Leone during its civil war.Because of fears his trial could spark renewed conflict in West Africa, it was moved from Sierra Leone to The Hague, and the UK at the time offered to jail him if convicted.Mr Wright made the announcement in a written statement to Parliament, saying it followed a request from the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL)."Taylor will now be transferred to a prison in the UK to serve that sentence," he said, adding that international justice was central to British foreign policy."The United Kingdom's offer to enforce any sentence imposed on former President Taylor by the SCSL was crucial to ensuring that he could be transferred to The Hague to stand trial for his crimes," Mr Wright said.The SCSL found Taylor, 65, guilty of 11 crimes including terrorism, rape, murder and the use of child soldiers by rebel groups in neighbouring Sierra Leone during the 1991-2002 conflict in which some 50,000 people died.He was found to have supplied weapons to the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels in exchange for a constant flow of so-called blood diamonds.The rebels were notorious for hacking off the limbs of civilians to terrorise the population.Taylor has always insisted he is innocent and his only contact with the rebels was to urge them to stop fighting.He is the first former head of state convicted by an international war crimes court since World War II.UK forces intervened in Sierra Leone in 2000, sending 800 paratroopers to protect Freetown as rebel forces were closing in on the capital. They evacuated British citizens and helped secure the airport for beleaguered UN peacekeepers.The British forces pushed back the rebels, allowing the UN peacekeeping force to operate effectively. British forces then stayed on for another two years to re-train the Sierra Leone army.An act of parliament was passed in 2007 to allow for Taylor to serve his sentence in the UK at the cost of the government."The conviction of Charles Taylor is a landmark moment for international justice," Mr Wright said."It clearly demonstrates that those who commit atrocities will be held to account and that no matter their position they will not enjoy impunity."It is not the first time the UK has imprisoned foreign nationals convicted of war crimes.Four men convicted of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia served time in British high-security prisons. One former Bosnian-Serb general was stabbed at Wakefield prison in apparent retaliation for the massacre of Muslims in the UN safe haven of Srebrenica in 1995.The UK also offered to jail the former President of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic, had he been convicted at his trial in The Hague on charges of war crimes and genocide. But he died in 2006 while on trial.</body>

      <title>Illegal migrants face new crackdown</title>
      <description>Illegal immigrants will find it harder to set up home in the UK under planned new laws, says Home Secretary Theresa May.</description>

      <date>1381413464</date>
      <body>Illegal immigrants will find it harder to set up home in the UK under planned laws, says Home Secretary Theresa May.The Immigration Bill would force private landlords to quiz tenants about their immigration status and restrict access to bank accounts for people in the country without permission.It also aims to streamline the appeals process in immigration cases.Labour said the bill did nothing about bigger problems like the "shambolic" state of UK border controls.The bill, which is expected to become law in spring 2014, subject to approval by MPs, will include measures to allow the UK to "deport foreign criminals first and hear their appeal later" when there is "no risk of serious irreversible harm".BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani says this could lead to an increase in air fare costs for the Home Office, if it has to fly back migrants who are successful in their appeal.A requirement is also included for temporary migrants, such as overseas students, to make a contribution to the National Health Service to prevent so-called "health tourism".Other new measures in the bill include:Immigration minister Mark Harper said: "The Immigration Bill will stop migrants using public services to which they are not entitled, reduce the pull factors which encourage people to come to the UK and make it easier to remove people who should not be here."We will continue to welcome the brightest and best migrants who want to contribute to our economy and society and play by the rules. But the law must be on the side of people who respect it, not those who break it."Mrs May said the measures were about "making it harder for people who are here illegally to stay here".She said it was a "point of principle" that people who used public services should be expected to contribute to them, but she would not comment on the cost to the country of "health tourism".She denied claims that forcing private landlords to check the immigration status of prospective tenants would be unworkable, saying they would just be "required to ask some simple questions" in the same way that employers have to do when interviewing workers.But an organisation representing private and public sector landlords said the measures would "make it much harder for non-British people to access housing even when they have a legal right to live in the UK".Gavin Smart, director of policy and practice at the Chartered Institute of Housing, said: "Checking immigration status is complicated so landlords may shy away from letting to anyone who appears not to be British."Don Flynn, director of Migrants' Rights Network, criticised moves to restrict access to the NHS, saying: "There are very small numbers of migrants who come here with pre-existing health conditions and find themselves registering with the health service."I simply do not believe there is any significant evidence that something like the NHS is a pull factor."The British Medical Association (BMA) is also critical of the plans.Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chairman of the BMA's GPs committee, told BBC Radio 5live there is already a system in place for hospitals to recover the cost of treating patients who are ineligible for NHS care."Clearly that could be improved, but introducing a system for general practice could be a bureaucratic nightmare," he said."The reality is people don't come to the UK to use the NHS, they're more likely to come to work in the NHS."Labour said there was nothing in the bill to tackle problems at the UK's "increasingly shambolic" border controls or to deal with "long delays in getting electronic checks in place, or the UKBA (UK Border Agency) bureaucratic failings that have prevented foreign criminals being deported".Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: "It doesn't seem to address some of the serious issues around border control and some of the problems about exploitation of immigration in the labour market, particularly low-skill immigration, which has caused concerns about jobs and wages."Campaign group the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants welcomed what it claimed was a "climb down" by the Home Office, which had not included in the bill proposals to introduce immigration checks by GPs.It said the new proposals would deter students from wanting to study in the UK but would have "no impact whatsoever on 'illegal' immigration - the declared intention of this bill".UKIP said "pressganging landlords, doctors and private citizens under the threat of sanctions to carry out the work of border agencies is simply wrong" and the government needed to treat the cause of immigration problems rather than the symptoms.And Bill Walker, of the Institute of Directors, warned that some of the government's rhetoric was starting to make the UK "look unwelcoming and hostile to the people on whom our export markets depend".The Conservatives say they want to reduce net migration from non-EU countries - the difference between the number of people emigrating and arriving in the UK - to less than 100,000 a year.But the latest Office for National Statistics figures show net migration rose to 176,000 in the year ending December 2012 - up from 153,000 people in the year to September 2012 - appearing to buck the recent downward trend.There are no official estimates of the number of illegal immigrants in the UK. A 2009 study by the London School of Economics produced an estimate of 618,000 but the Migration Watch pressure group said this under-estimated the number of people who had overstayed their visas and the true figure was more like 1.1 million.</body>

      <title>Snowden leaks damaging, says Clegg</title>
      <description>Leaked intelligence material published by the Guardian has damaged the UK, but it is legitimate to debate the security services' work, says Nick Clegg.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24476047</url>
      <date>1381410210</date>
      <body>The publication of sensitive information about UK intelligence programmes has been damaging, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has said.Mr Clegg said stories in the Guardian about GCHQ "would have been of immense interest to people who want harm".There was however a legitimate debate to be had about the use of mass surveillance programmes, he added.His comments came after the Guardian vowed to publish more leaks from US ex-intelligence worker Edward Snowden.Speaking on his weekly LBC radio phone-in, Mr Clegg said he had "no doubt" that some of the information published by the newspaper "would have been of immense interest to people who want harm".But he added that the development by the agencies of powerful new communications surveillance techniques raised wider issues of concern.He said: "I think there is a totally legitimate debate to be had - and my experience speaking to people in the intelligence agencies is they recognise this - about the use of these new, incredibly powerful technologies."We have regulations that were designed for an age which is quite different now."Both terrorists and states and security agencies now conduct this battle online in a way that was unimaginable just a few years ago."What that means for privacy and proportionality, that is a totally legitimate area of debate. How you hold the secret parts of any state to account is an incredibly important issue.Mr Clegg backed the security services' calls for a measure of secrecy, which he said was necessary to keep Britain safe.But, he said, "you can only really make secrecy legitimate in the eyes of the public if there is proper form of accountability".His comments came after the director general of MI5, Andrew Parker, warned in a speech that the disclosure of the "reach and limits" of GCHQ's capabilities was a "gift" to terrorists.Mr Parker dismissed suggestions that the agencies were trawling through people's private lives for anything that looked interesting as "utter nonsense".Responding to Mr Parker's criticism, the Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger insisted his newspaper was right to publish the information leaked by US security contractor Edward Snowden.And he said that more would follow as the leaked documents were "slowly and responsibly" worked through.Speaking on a visit to York, Prime Minister David Cameron said that when newspapers get hold of vast amount of information that has been "effectively stolen", they have to "think about their responsibilities and are they helping to keep our country safe".He continued: "To be fair to the Guardian, when I sent the Cabinet Secretary [Sir Jeremy Heywood] to tell them about how dangerous it was to hold this information, they agreed to have a whole lot of it destroyed."They have understood it on some occasions but they need to show understanding about this issue because it does go to our ability to fight terrorism."Meanwhile, Mr Snowden's father Lon arrived in Russia on Thursday to visit his son.Edward Snowden was granted asylum in Russia in August after weeks spent in a transit zone at Moscow airport when the US revoked his travel documents.Lon Snowden said he felt "extreme gratitude that my son is safe and secure and he's free".In the US, Edward Snowden faces charges of theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified intelligence.</body>

      <title>Alzheimer's find is 'turning point'</title>
      <description>A chemical which can stop brain cell death in a neurodegenerative disease could hold the key for treating Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntingdon's diseases, scientists say.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24462699</url>
      <date>1381395409</date>
      <body>The discovery of the first chemical to prevent the death of brain tissue in a neurodegenerative disease has been hailed as the "turning point" in the fight against Alzheimer's disease.More work is needed to develop a drug that could be taken by patients.But scientists say a resulting medicine could treat Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's and other diseases.In tests on mice, the Medical Research Council showed all brain cell death from prion disease could be prevented.Prof Roger Morris, from King's College London, said: "This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer's disease."He told the BBC a cure for Alzheimer's was not imminent but: "I'm very excited, it's the first proof in any living animal that you can delay neurodegeneration."The world won't change tomorrow, but this is a landmark study."The research team at the Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit, based at the University of Leicester, focused on the natural defence mechanisms built into brain cells.When a virus hijacks a brain cell it leads to a build-up of viral proteins. Cells respond by shutting down nearly all protein production in order to halt the virus's spread.However, many neurodegenerative diseases involve the production of faulty or "misfolded" proteins. These activate the same defences, but with more severe consequences.The misfolded proteins linger and the brain cells shut down protein production for so long that they eventually starve themselves to death.This process, repeated in neurons throughout the brain, can destroy movement or memory or even kill, depending on the disease.This process is thought to take place in many forms of neurodegeneration, so safely disrupting it could treat a wide range of diseases.The researchers used a compound which prevented those defence mechanisms kicking in and in turn halted neurodegeneration.The study, published in Science Translational Medicine, showed mice with prion disease developed severe memory and movement problems. They died within 12 weeks.However, those given the compound showed no sign of brain tissue wasting away.Lead researcher Prof Giovanna Mallucci told the BBC news website: "They were absolutely fine, it was extraordinary."What's really exciting is a compound has completely prevented neurodegeneration and that's a first."This isn't the compound you would use in people, but it means we can do it and it's a start."She said the compound offered a "new pathway that may well give protective drugs" and the next step was for drug companies to develop a medicine for use in humans.Prof Mallucci's lab is also testing the compound on other forms of neurodegeneration in mice but the results have not yet been published.Side effects are an issue. The compound also acted on the pancreas, meaning the mice developed a mild form of diabetes and lost weight.Any human drug would need to act only on the brain. However, this gives scientists and drug companies a starting point.David Allsop, professor of neuroscience at Lancaster University described the results as "very dramatic and highly encouraging" but cautioned that more research was needed to see how the findings would apply to diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.Dr Eric Karran, the director of research at the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said: "Targeting a mechanism relevant to a number of neurodegenerative diseases could yield a single drug with wide-reaching benefits, but this compound is still at an early stage."It will be important for these findings to be repeated and tested in models of other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease."</body>

      <title>Royal Household sees income rise</title>

      <body>The Royal Household generated more than £11.6m in income in 2012-13, up from £7.5m in 2007-08, the National Audit Office has reported.But 39% of occupied Royal palaces were in worse condition than had been aimed for, the report said.The report was prepared for the Public Accounts Committee, which will look at Royal finances on Monday.The Sovereign Grant, which funds the Queen's spending as Head of State, will rise in 2014 from £36.1m to £37.9m.The report said that the household had used its reserves to fund official activities in recent years and as of 31 March, the Sovereign Grant Reserve stood at £1m.The report asked whether that amount is "adequate to meet unexpected costs".It said that Royal Household income had increased due to the commercial letting of properties and by using its facilities for commercial events - measures that had previously been recommended by the Public Accounts Committee.And the report said that between 1991-92 and 2011-12, the Household reduced spending by 55% in response to decreases in funding.It said the net expenditure in 2011-12 was £32.9m, compared to an equivalent of £72.6m in 1991-92.The way the Royal Family is funded was changed on 1 April 2012, in the first major overhaul of how it is financed for 250 years.Previously, the Civil List - which dated back to 1760 - met the official expenses of the Royal Household and separate grants were paid to cover things such as travel and maintenance of palaces.That was replaced by the Sovereign Grant, which is a single payment given to the monarch based on 15% of the Crown Estate's revenue from two years previously.This funding arrangement will last seven years before it is reviewed.The Crown Estate has a property portfolio which includes, among other things, Regent Street in central London, Windsor Great Park and much of the UK coastline.Also under the changed funding structure, the Civil List reserve was transferred into the Sovereign Grant Reserve.</body>

      <title>UK troops praised for Afghan role</title>
      <description>An Army commander has paid tribute to British troops as the deployment of the last major British force sent to Helmand in southern Afghanistan begins.</description>

      <date>1381421046</date>
      <body>An army commander has paid tribute to British troops, as the deployment of the last major British force to Helmand in southern Afghanistan begins.Speaking at a handover ceremony at Camp Bastion, commander Brig James Woodham praised soldiers from 1st Mechanized Brigade for "a job well done".The 7th Armoured Brigade, the Desert Rats have now begun their mission.They will be responsible for packing away forces' equipment ahead of the final British pullout next year.Troops are not expected to be involved in regular fighting as Afghan forces will now take the lead.But some will remain in the country for nine months, rather than the usual six.Around 100 soldiers from both incoming and outgoing brigades gathered to take part in the handover to the Germany-based Desert Rats.After the blue flag of the Desert Rats was raised to the sound of bagpipes, incoming commander Brig Woodham said he was determined to build on 1st Mechanized Brigade's investment and bring the campaign to a successful conclusion."I congratulate the 1st Mechanized Brigade on a job well done and I wish them a safe and swift trip back to their families."For the Desert Rats - we've got a job to do," he said.Outgoing commander Brig Rupert Jones also praised his troops and said Afghan forces had "exceeded all expectations" while leading for the first time in a summer fighting season.He said he was confident Afghan forces were capable of taking control as UK troops stepped back.He also defended the role that Nato-led International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) has played in Afghanistan.It follows comments made by President Hamid Karzai in a BBC interview which criticised the Nato exercise in Afghanistan for causing "a lot of suffering" and making "no gains".Brig Jones said: "What I hear from local Afghan commanders and governance leaders is that they recognise the job that Isaf have done here for them - that the situation has been transformed - but importantly that they are now ready to take forward the mantle."Operation Herrick 19, the latest deployment, runs until June 2014.A large part of the force is made up of engineers as attention turns to bringing back equipment and disposing of what cannot be returned.Afghan forces will take the lead on all operations, but British troops have enough army and infantry for combat.All combat operations in the country are expected to be over by the end of next year, leaving Afghan forces fully in control.The UK presence in Afghanistan will be almost halved by the end of this year to 5,200.British troops are now placed at five bases - down from a peak of more than 130 - and rarely go on patrol.Six thousand soldiers and 300 armoured vehicles took part in a final training exercise, named Pashtun Dawn, ahead of the deployment.The exercise was the largest on Salisbury Plain for 10 years.Major Chris Hunter, a former bomb disposal officer for the British Army, told the BBC that Afghan forces should now be prepared to lead operations."It's down to leadership. They're certainly trained, they're certainly equipped to carry out the role," he added.</body>

      <title>Questions raised over indy oil fund</title>
      <description>Scottish ministers were warned by their own economic advisers that plans for an oil fund under independence may require tax rises or spending cuts.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-24469684</url>
      <date>1381413910</date>
      <body>Scottish ministers were warned by their own economic advisers that plans for an oil fund under independence may require tax rises or spending cuts.The advice, written for the government last year and published under freedom of information laws, has been seen by the BBC and the Daily Mail newspaper.Pro-Union campaigners claimed the pubic was being deceived.But the Scottish government said the private advice had since been overtaken by events.It warned that, if Scotland became independent, it would have to raise taxes, cut services or borrow to create the oil fund.But it also said Scotland could have paid off its debts 30 years ago if it had been independent and had had oil revenues.The advice calculated the tax surpluses of the 1980s could have been set aside to create a Norwegian-style oil fund which would have been worth £117bn by 2011.The emergence of the paper led to stormy exchanges during first minister's questions at the Scottish Parliament, where Labour and the Conservatives accused the SNP government of trying to hide information detrimental to its case for independence, ahead of the referendum on 18 September next year.Labour leader Johann Lamont asked the first minister: "When was he going to tell us his choice to raise taxes or cut public spending? The answer is, never. Honesty is not something this government deals in."When Ms Lamont was asked to withdraw the remark by Holyrood's presiding officer, she continued: "I accept the advice of the presiding offer, but I have to say I do not know what word you use to describe a government that says one thing in private and something different in public."The fact of the matter is, Scotland is on pause and we will not be given the full facts with this government ahead of a referendum."But Mr Salmond said the contents of the private advice had come before recommendations published last week by the Scottish government's fiscal commission working group set out a scenario where, under independence, money could be put into two separate oil funds without spending and taxation changes.One fund would help stabilise finances as revenue fluctuates, while the other would be a long term investment fund, similar to the one operated by Norway.The first minister said: "We've got a fiscal commission report which sets out clear criteria, how we can marshal Scotland's resources and make sure that asset is used for the benefit of this generation and for future generations."Nobody would seriously argue that the UK has handled oil well as a resource over the last 40 years. Nobody would seriously dispute that Norway - the country across the North Sea - has handled that resource much better.""The fiscal commission have put forward a proposal which allows Scotland to get towards the fortunate position of Norway, as opposed to making the unremitting bungles of Westminster and successive United Kingdom chancellors."However, Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said she ran both the private advice and the fiscal commission report through "university cheating software".She went on: "And what did I find? Whole sections cut and pasted - entire paragraphs on Scotland's projected net fiscal debt, on the country's debt interest payments and on notional borrowing costs."All the good stuff made the grade. All the bad stuff hit the bin.Ms Davidson added: "It seems when the government reached any section in here - and there were plenty - that said that an oil fund would mean higher taxes, more borrowing or lower public spending, they simply hit delete."Earlier, on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Alistair Darling, who is former chancellor and head of pro-Union Better Together, said: "If you were to set up an oil fund you would have to borrow money to save it so that seems to be complete nonsense."The problem we have here is yet again we are being told one thing in public when the SNP knows something else is the case in private."Finance Secretary John Swinney told the same programme that if debt in an independent Scotland was reducing it would be prudent to invest in an oil fund.He added: "People will have mortgages, which is debt, it is an obligation to pay back, at the same time many people will also be saving - if they have the money to put aside for their future - and that is exactly what we are trying to do as a country."</body>

      <title>UK interest rates held at 0.5%</title>
      <description>The Bank of England decides to keep interest rates at a record 0.5% low and makes no change to its monetary stimulus.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24471495</url>
      <date>1381404300</date>
      <body>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has again voted to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5%.It has kept the key borrowing rate at that level since March 2009.The MPC also said it would make no change to the £375bn of monetary stimulus it is providing through its quantitative easing (QE) programme.Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said that before interest rates can rise, the unemployment rate needs to fall below 7%.That stipulation is part of Mr Carney's policy of giving forward guidance.The idea is to create more certainty for businesses and individuals about the course of interest rates, which may encourage borrowing and investment.He has forecast that it will take about three years for unemployment to reach his target.However, there has been speculation that rates may start to go up sooner, given recent indications of healthier prospects for the UK economy.On Wednesday, the International Monetary Fund lifted its UK growth projection for this year from 0.9% to 1.4%."The bar for any more QE now looks to be very high," said Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight."It will likely only occur if the economy loses substantial momentum over the coming months, or if there is major financial turmoil and a sharp upward move in market interest rates when the US Federal Reserve finally starts to taper."Our central scenario is that neither of these events will happen, but neither can be ruled out."David Tinsley of BNP Paribas said the decision came as no surprise."Overall, UK monetary policy settings for now are on auto-pilot, barring the US debt ceiling debate getting very messy," he said."Even on an optimistic basis, the UK labour market is not going to deliver an unemployment rate at 7% for six to 12 months at the very earliest, while inflationary pressures are under control."And the Bank has made fairly clear that while it is monitoring house price developments, it is not about to adjust monetary policy in response to those."So for now, forward guidance is delivering the sort of boring certainty the new governor was after."</body>

      <body>A head teacher whose appointment to a new free school was criticised has quit her post weeks after starting.Pimlico Primary, which opened in September, said Annaliese Briggs, 27, had left the job to "pursue other opportunities in primary education".Miss Briggs was appointed in April as the head while still studying for her postgraduate certificate in education.Labour councillors in Westminster said governors may be regretting appointing someone with "no teaching experience".The primary school opened at the site of Pimlico Academy in Lupus Street, central London, with 60 pupils and aims to have 420 pupils by 2019.Pimlico Primary is sponsored by Future Academies, a charity founded by Lord Nash and his wife Caroline.A statement from Pimlico Primary said: "Having successfully set up Pimlico Primary, Annaliese Briggs has decided to leave Future Academies to pursue other opportunities in primary education."A new principal of Pimlico Primary has been appointed. Coming from within the group, our new principal is already known to the pupils and families of Pimlico Primary, and brings over 10 years' experience in both early years and leadership."We are delighted that Annaliese will continue to support Pimlico Primary as it grows by becoming a governor."Miss Briggs is completing a school-centred initial teacher training (SCITT) course in Wandsworth and will qualify with a postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE).She previously said she has classroom experience from teaching primary school children in supplementary schools and had been chosen to lead the school for her curriculum expertise.Reacting to the news that Miss Briggs has stepped down, leader of the Labour group at Westminster Council Councillor Paul Dimoldenberg said: "Being the head of an inner-London school is a tough job which can sometimes be very stressful."By appointing someone with no teaching experience or experience in running a school, the Pimlico academy governors might now consider that this is a decision they now regret."I hope that Ms Briggs' commitment to education is undiminished and wish her well in her future career."The Department for Education said it was a matter for the school.</body>

      <title>Ofcom price hike alarms mobile firms</title>
      <description>Mobile networks left "disappointed" as Ofcom proposes quadrupled licence fees, leading to concerns the cost may be passed on to consumers.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24475802</url>
      <date>1381406086</date>
      <body>Mobile network operators may have to pay more than four times the current amount to use the radio spectrum, under new proposals from Ofcom.The regulator said the new licensing fees reflected market value based on other European countries.Operators told the BBC the increase was "excessive". Vodafone said it was "disappointed".Some analysts have raised concerns the increased costs might be passed on to the public."The size of these figures may come as bad news to the mobile networks, but more worryingly could sound alarm bells for consumers," said Adam Kirby, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com."The proposed new costs reflect a huge leap in the amount networks will have to pay the regulator for using the spectrum - our concern is that it will be consumers who are left to foot the bill."However, the good news for concerned consumers is that no increases have been confirmed as yet - Ofcom are now consulting on the fees. It remains to be seen how much these costs will actually rise, and if the networks can fight back and keep a lid on these increases."An Ofcom spokesman told the BBC that while it had no control over how much operators charged customers, it did not expect the rise to have an impact on bills.In an advisory note, financial services firm JP Morgan said it expected the competitiveness of the mobile market would stop costs being passed down.However, operators contacted by the BBC expressed concern that the rise had been higher than they had budgeted for.The affected companies - Vodafone, O2, EE and Three - each told the BBC that they would respond to Ofcom's announcement in due course.EE said it would aim to stress that "there must be a balance between licence fees and the critical 4G network investment consumers and businesses are demanding to drive growth and jobs for the UK economy".Vodafone criticised Ofcom, saying: "We are disappointed that Ofcom is proposing a 430% increase in the fees we pay for our existing spectrum at a time when we are investing more than ever in vital national digital infrastructure."The regulator should be encouraging such private sector investment in infrastructure and new services like 4G, which will benefit consumers, businesses and the wider British economy for many years to come."Prices for the 900Mhz and 1800Mhz spectrum bands were set when it was used for 2G services several years ago. Ofcom has since "liberated" the spectrum - the term given when a certain band is freed up for different purposes.In this case, it meant that operators could use the bands for higher-speed services such as 4G.In 2010, the government instructed Ofcom to revisit the cost of the licences for 900Mhz and 1800Mhz which - in comparison with other equivalent services across the EU - were considered to be very cheap.The new prices will see Vodafone and O2's individual fees rise from £15.6m to £83.1m. EE will pay £107.1m, up from £24.9m, and Three will go from £8.3m to £35.7m.The increase comes at a time when operators are facing a drop in income via calls made while customers are overseas. The European Union is pressing hard for far lower roaming costs in a bid to reduce so-called "bill shock".A source at one of the affected operators said he expected operators would now engage in a tug of war with Ofcom to see the proposed amounts lowered.In response, the regulator said: "It's a consultation - we welcome the views of our stakeholders. Nothing's final at this stage."They've been expecting this for some time and we've based our proposed annual license fees on market value."Ofcom also dismissed the suggestion that the price hike is in response to a lower-than-expected return from the recent auction of 4G spectrum, which took place earlier in the year.That sale raised £2.3bn - less than the £3.5bn expected by the Office for Budget Responsibility.The shortfall is being investigated by the National Audit Office, which expects to publish its findings early next year.Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC.</body>

      <body>Police are considering what action to take against a Cambridge cyclist who dodged a level crossing barrier, coming within seconds of being hit by a train.British Transport Police (BTP) confirmed they spoke to a 26-year-old woman from the city on Wednesday.She was filmed cycling through the closed barrier at Waterbeach on 12 September.The woman came forward voluntarily, and BTP said they were deciding what further action to take.She was filmed passing the closed barrier and ignoring warning signals and lights.Rail bosses described it as "one of the closest near misses we've seen".Hundreds of thousands of people have watched footage of the woman cycling up to the tracks before slamming on her brakes, and edging backwards as the train speeds past.The driver of the train needed to apply the emergency brake when he saw her, operator Greater Anglia said.Moments later the woman was seen mopping her brow before cycling off in the direction she had come from.More than 100 trains travel through the Waterbeach crossing each day, at speeds of up to 75mph (120km/h).Since 1 January, there have been 70 reported incidents at level crossings in Cambridgeshire, a BTP spokesman said.However, he added that incidents such as this one were "extremely rare".</body>

      <body>Telecoms giant BT has signed a deal with mobile phone operator EE to use its network to provide mobile services.The deal paves the way for a return to the consumer mobile phone market for BT, which disposed of its BT Cellnet network in 2001.It will also allow it to offer mobile services alongside its existing offer of landline, internet and TV - the so-called "quad-play" market.EE operates the Orange and T-Mobile brands in the UK.EE, formerly called Everything Everywhere, is a joint venture between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom.It runs the UK's biggest mobile network, including 4G services, which it pioneered in the UK in 2012.BT said the deal was a "multi-year agreement, subject to final contract". It gave no details of how much the deal was worth or exactly how long it would last.Up to now, BT has been providing corporate mobile services thanks to a tie-up with Vodafone, but that agreement has come to an end after Vodafone bought Cable and Wireless Worldwide.In August, BT expanded its TV offer by launching its own UK sports channels.</body>

      <title>Mine owners file for administration</title>
      <description>The owners of Wales' largest drift are filing for administration, it is confirmed, but the owners say the 220 jobs are not under threat.</description>

      <body>The owners of Wales' largest mine are filing for administration, it has been confirmed.The future of the Unity Mine, a drift mine near Neath, has been uncertain in recent months after management said they only had work for 66 of 220 staff.Richard Nugent, director with Unity Mine Limited, said the company had been "forced into the process of filing for administration".He added the workforce would be maintained until further notice."Unfortunately the Unity Group of Companies have been forced into the process of filing for administration whilst discussions continue about the future direction of the mine," he said."Fundraising negotiations are continuing with various parties and the current workforce will be maintained until further notice."Neath MP Peter Hain said the situation was "deeply worrying, especially for the workforce and their families".He added that he understood that discussions are taking place "imminently", with management at the mine "hopeful" that funding can be found to save the site."I am disappointed that recent discussions on grant aid did not succeed and I hope that these can be resurrected," he said.Mr Hain added outstanding planning and licensing problems had to be resolved as they were putting off investors."Unity remains a vital and exciting project and everyone must do everything to ensure it can both be saved and can move forward because not only 250 existing jobs are at stake but potentially many more too," he said.In recent months, workers at Unity Mine were told there was not enough work for everyone.Staff offered to share shifts between all of the workers which meant they got on average a quarter of their previous pay.It was seen as a way that could safeguard the pit's future.At the time The National Union of Miners (NUM) said it was not an ideal solution but it would provide a "breathing space".But bosses at the mine were unable to remedy the situation and have filed for administration.Gwenda Thomas, the assembly member for Neath, described the announcement that the mine had gone into administration as "extremely regrettable"."I sincerely hope that the administrators can find new owners for the mine, and preserve the miners' jobs and the future of the apprentices," she said.Welsh government officials are continuing to hold with the mine's management.Meanwhile, Tyrone O'Sullivan, chairman of Tower Colliery in the Cynon Valley, said: "It's difficult for me to comment further because a number of ex-Tower employees are working there and we are a rival company."But it's a tragedy that in a country that burned 61 million tonnes of coal last year that we are allowing mines to close."In September 2012 the BBC reported 94% of all Welsh coal came from opencast sites, the remainder from drift mines.The vast majority work was at two pits in the Neath Valley at Unity and Aberpergwm which is currently closed.Unity Mine opened in 2007 with reserves of up to 90 million tonnes of coal.It is a drift mine, which means that miners can walk into it from the surface rather than having to be transported down to the coal seams via a lift in a shaft.</body>

      <title>Lake killing 'cold-blooded murder'</title>
      <description>Police describe the killing of 46-year-old Kevin Kearney in north Belfast as a "callous and cold-blooded murder".</description>

      <date>1381419746</date>
      <body>Police have described the killing of a man in north Belfast as a "callous and cold-blooded murder".Kevin Kearney's body was found in a lake in Alexandra Park on Wednesday afternoon. He had been shot.Mr Kearney was 46 and a father of four, and lived at Dunmore Avenue close to the park, which is off the Antrim Road.The Irish News reported that it received a statement from a dissident republican group calling itself "the IRA" that claimed it killed Mr Kearney.In July 2012, a new paramilitary group styling itself "the IRA" is believed to have been formed from an amalgamation of previously disparate dissident republican organisations.BBC NI Home Affairs Correspondent Vincent Kearney said: "CCTV cameras at the home of the father of four suggest he may have felt under threat, and local sources said he may have been involved in low level drug dealing."Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Det Ch Insp Justyn Galloway said that Mr Kearney "was known to the police"."Kevin was known to us for previous offending, but what I want to make clear is regardless of Kevin's lifestyle, regardless of his previous offending, there is no justification whatsoever for someone to shoot him dead as they did."Mr Kearney left his daughter off at school on Tuesday morning, and returned home and took his dogs for a walk in Alexandra Park.He was wearing dark clothing and distinctive bright blue trainers, and police say he was shot at approximately 09.15 BST on Tuesday.He was reported missing on Tuesday evening when he had not returned home.Police have appealed for information on a silver Peugeot 406 car, registration number GNZ 8168, that was found burnt out in Dunore Court in the New Lodge area of north Belfast at about 09:30 on Tuesday morning.They also want to hear from anyone who was in the park between 08:30 and 09:30 on Tuesday.DCI Galloway added: "We are aware of the claim of responsibility and that is forming part of my investigation and it is a line of inquiry."Kevin has been going about his normal routine so there is an element of targetting. He has been shot in a callous and brutal way."It is important that we identify witnesses, recover the firearm that was used, and we can only do that with the cooperation of the people of north Belfast, which I have to say to date has been fantastic."Secretary of State Theresa Villiers condemned the murder and that of a man in Londonderry on Thursday."The murders of two men in Londonderry and north Belfast are abhorrent and brutal crimes, for which there is no excuse," she said."I am sure the police will leave no stone unturned in bringing to justice the people responsible for these disgraceful attacks."DUP North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds said: "The entire community will share in the sense of shock at this appalling news."Our thoughts are with the family of the deceased. I appeal for anyone who can assist the police investigation to pass on whatever information they have."Sinn Féin North Belfast MLA Gerry Kelly said: "The murder of Kevin Kearney is to be condemned outright. The pseudo 'republican' group that carried out the killing have no support whatsoever within the local community."In fact, it is common knowledge that they have within their ranks people who have taken backhanders from drug dealers so that they can continue peddling drugs. This makes them the same as the drug dealers who bring death and destruction to the community."Masquerading under the name republican does not stop people from seeing these groups for what they really are. I would call on anyone who has any information on this killing to bring it forward to the PSNI."The people of north Belfast have suffered enough throughout the years without the blight of these maverick, self-serving, hypocritical groups bringing death to the community."SDLP councillor Pat Convery, who chairs the north Belfast community safety partnership, said: "This is a very tragic event."My thoughts and prayers are with the man's family."The park has been closed to the public while the investigation continues.</body>

      <body>A woman pregnant with twins who can not survive outside the womb has called for the health minister to allow her to have an abortion in Northern Ireland.The woman, who wants to be named only as Laura, said she has been told her twin girls have anencephaly - a severe brain abnormality.She is 22 weeks pregnant and any termination has to be before 24 weeks.Foetal abnormality is not a ground for abortion under Northern Ireland law.Laura said she felt "let down by her country" at having to leave to have the abortion."I'm not going to be near my family, I'm not going to have any of my family's support," she told BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan Show."I have a hard enough thing to go through at the minute, finding out I have twin girls with the same condition who are going to have absolutely no outcome of life whatsoever."To make that decision in the first place (to have an abortion) was one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make in my life."I think it's horrendous the fact that I have to go to a different country where I don't know anybody and have to go through something like that."Laura said she only found out she was expecting twins after her five-month scan; the next day she found out they had anencephaly and would have "absolutely no form of life whatsoever"."I don't think I could ever go full term and have them in your arms for a couple of hours and have to watch them pass away is just something I don't think I could cope with," she said."They only have a heartbeat, that's all they have, the only thing that's keeping them alive is me."She said there was also a strong chance the babies would die in the womb.The twins' father, Chris, added: "We would like to be given the option, like any family in our position, to get the treatment that we require in our own country and have our families around us."On Wednesday, another woman, Sarah Ewart, contacted the Nolan Show to highlight her experience.She had to travel to England for an abortion because her baby was also diagnosed with anencephaly.On Thursday, Justice Minister David Ford said he was committed to bringing a paper to the Northern Ireland Executive looking at issues around the termination of pregnancy."That arose out of the previous issue on the discussion of the Marie Stopes clinic," he said."I have written to the minister of health suggesting it should be a joint paper, because there are issues of both criminal law and health and social care issues."It seems to me that what we've had highlighted yesterday and today is the need that we perhaps need to widen out that consultation to look at difficult issues like foetal abnormality to see if where the law is currently drawn is in the right place."The BBC has contacted the Department of Health and the couple's local health trust and is awaiting responses.</body>

      <body>Rapper Coolio has surprised a group of students by cooking them a meal and performing in their front room.The impromptu performance of his 1995 hit Gangsta's Paradise came after the students met the American star at a gig in Preston.Before performing, he prepared a three-course meal after taking the students to a supermarket to buy ingredients.A film of the performance made by one of the students has received around one million views on YouTube.Fashion student Olivia Johnson-Aley, from Liverpool said it was "such a crazy and surreal moment, I had to film it"."It is amazing how many people have already watched it," she said. "We have been getting calls from media in the UK and America ever since."The 50-year-old hip-hop star had been performing at Macs Bar in Preston when he met the students and offered to cook them a meal.Law student Melissa Bryan, 21, from the Isle of Man said the rapper said he would "cook for us and he was true to his word".She said his "delicious" menu comprised of Coolio's Caprese Salad, Chicken á la Daaaamn, and Peach Crumble.Miss Bryan said that the food was "great and the sing-along was even better"."I was three when Gangsta's Paradise was released but it is a classic."We all knew the words off by heart. Every student does."Coolio, who has sold more than 17 million albums worldwide, has sold more than six million copies of Gangsta's Paradise since its release.Lorcan O'Mahony, who accompanied the rapper on his guitar, said he had "conveniently left" it in the room when he heard the rapper was coming to the house."After dinner, I asked if he would perform Gangsta's Paradise and we all got involved."It is something I will never forget."He added that he had "only learnt the chords a few hours earlier".The rapper eventually left the house at 03:00 BST to catch a flight.</body>

      <title>Court hears gun discharge dispute</title>
      <description>Some gun discharge residue on a coat linked to a man jailed for murdering a police officer could have come from a different incident, a court has heard.</description>

      <body>Some gun discharge residue on a coat linked to a man jailed for murdering a police officer could have come from a different incident, a court has heard.Brendan McConville and John Paul Wootton are appealing convictions for murdering Constable Stephen Carroll.Constable Carroll, 48, was shot after responding to a 999 call in Craigavon, County Armagh, in March 2009.The case against McConville and Wootton at the non-jury trial involved DNA and other evidence.On Thursday, prosecutors accepted they could not prove beyond reasonable doubt that either McConville or the murder weapon were transported in co-defendant Wootton's car.Instead they argued that the surrounding circumstances confirmed the two men's guilt.McConville, 42, and Wootton, 22, are both seeking to overturn their convictions for the murder.McConville, of Glenholme Avenue in the town, is serving at least a 25 year sentence for killing the policeman. Wootton, from Lurgan, received a minimum 14-year term.Prosecutors contended that Wootton's car was near the scene of the attack and driven off within minutes of the killing. However, his legal team insist absolutely no evidence exists to link him to any role in the shooting.Gun residue was found on a coat linked to McConville which was later recovered from the vehicle.On day three of the two men's joint appeal judges examined whether it could have come from a separate incident.Some of the residue could have come from another source, the Court of Appeal heard.Questioned on whether it could be proven that the coat was at the firing point on the night of the killing, prosecution counsel Ciaran Murphy QC said he could prove a connection with the relevant particles.Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan then asked: "Are you proving beyond reasonable doubt that the weapon was transported in Mr Wootton's car?"The barrister replied: "No."Sir Declan continued: "Are you proving beyond reasonable doubt that Mr McConville was transported in Mr Wootton's car."Again the response was: "No."Mr Murphy contended that scientific evidence connected the murder weapon - an AK47 rifle which was later recovered - to the jacket.After it was pointed out to him that some of the discharge could have come from a different incident, he stressed the rarity of the particles.During exchanges Sir Declan said: "The Crown accept there's at least a possibility there was some other source which was responsible for some of the gunshot residue."How then do you get from knowing there's another source as well as the gun that was recovered to concluding that other source was not responsible for the entirety of the gunshot residue?"According to Mr Murphy the surrounding circumstances provided the answer.Those established "a sufficient case for the trial judge to reach a conclusion that he was satisfied that at least some of these particles originated from the weapon that night", he argued.Earlier, Mr Murphy defended an account given by a key prosecution witness at the trial.Defence lawyers attacked his credibility, branding him a compulsive liar and a Walter Mitty-type character whose allegations of what he saw on the night of the shooting were "farcical".The man, known only as Witness M, has since left Northern Ireland to live under a protection programme.But Mr Murphy argued that he had reliably recalled seeing McConville near the scene, describing him as someone he knew by nickname and being able to remember exchanging words.Witness M claimed he was later approached by another man and warned to "keep your mouth shut".The defence pointed out how he only phoned police to make his claims 11 months later, making the call after drinking into the early hours of the morning.However, Mr Murphy said: "He was aware in his own mind of the consequences."The fact he was drinking at the time has little bearing other than to explain how he may personally have felt and to get up the courage to do what he did because he was nervous and said he had seen someone watching his house on different occasions."The hearing was adjourned until Friday.</body>

      <body>Figures show another significant rise in the number of patients who have had to wait more than nine months to start hospital treatment.More than 13,000 had been waiting over 36 weeks in August, a rise of over 2,000 in one month.The Welsh government's own target is for no-one to wait that long.The Welsh Conservatives have written to the first minister calling on him to personally intervene to deal with what they called "an escalating crisis".Darren Millar, the party's shadow minister for health, told Carwyn Jones the situation needed "immediate priority".He said: "I hope you will agree that patients across Wales - particularly the elderly and vulnerable - should not be faced with such long waits."Meanwhile, Kirsty Williams, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said the figures were a "national disgrace"."Why must patients in Wales have to put up with such an inferior service when compared to the rest of the UK?" she said."Years of Welsh Labour incompetence has led to thousands of people having to wait an awful long time until the start of their treatment."No one should have to wait this long, but it's particularly dreadful to think of the large amount of elderly people that are being forced to wait months on end."On Tuesday, it was announced that the Welsh NHS would be given £570m of extra funding over three years during the Welsh government's draft budget.Finance Minister Jane Hutt said the extra money would help the NHS in Wales to avoid a scandal such as the one in Stafford Hospital, where hundreds of patients died as a result of neglect and abuse.The Welsh government is expected to comment on the figures later.</body>

      <body>Hundreds of jobs will be cut at Carmarthenshire council as a result of the Welsh government's draft budget, its leader has said.At a council meeting on Thursday, Kevin Madge announced "many hundreds" of jobs would go as the authority would have to make savings of £30m.Offers of redundancy or early retirement have been made to staff.The Welsh government said it had cushioned the impact of UK government cuts in the past three years.But this week, Finance Minister Jane Hutt announced funding for local government would be cut by almost 6% next year.Local government spending will fall from £4.648bn this year to £4.466bn next year, a cut in cash terms of 3.91% or 5.81% in real terms.Ms Hutt stressed the priority was to protect health, schools and universal benefits such as free prescriptions, school breakfasts and bus passes for older people.Mr Madge warned on Thursday of extremely tough times ahead.In a statement, he said: "This is an unprecedented situation, and it means we are faced with making some very difficult and unpopular decisions."People will have to brace themselves - but I want to assure everyone that we will do our very best to protect frontline services, and continue to provide as many services as we can whilst avoiding compulsory redundancies wherever possible."He also appealed for "some understanding" from ministers on the "extraordinarily difficult times ahead" for councils.The Welsh government said in a statement that over the past three years it had been able to cushion local authorities from "the impact of relentless cuts to our budget from the UK government"."We have shaped our budget to focus on our core values of social justice and protecting the most vulnerable. We have made some tough decisions between areas as well as within programmes," said a spokesperson."We are looking at ways to work alongside and support authorities to manage the reductions to their funding, and the minister for local government and government business will announce full details of the local government settlement next week."The only way to confront these financial challenges and sustain local public services is to do different things. Councils need to strive for transformational change to manage the difficult times ahead."</body>

      <title>Route unveiled as baton trip begins</title>
      <description>Details of the Queen's Baton Relay's route around Scotland are unveiled as it sets off on the international leg of the journey.</description>

      <date>1381410636</date>
      <body>Details of the Queen's Baton Relay's route around Scotland have been unveiled as it sets off on the international leg of the journey.The baton will visit all 70 nations and territories of the Commonwealth before the Glasgow 2014 games start at Celtic Park on 23 July.Its 40-day tour of Scotland will begin in Edinburgh on 14 June, before ending with four days in Glasgow.The baton left Glasgow Airport on Thursday afternoon, bound for India.Organisers have also launched the campaign to recruit 4,000 baton-bearers.They are seeking nominations before 22 November via the Glasgow 2014 website.About 100 people each day will carry the baton on its journey around the country, an event Lord Smith of Kelvin, Glasgow 2014 chairman, hopes will help in "sharing the excitement of the countdown to the Commonwealth Games with communities across the nation".He said: "It's important as many people as possible feel part of this special moment and from today there's a chance for everyone to nominate the people in their street, village, town or city that they would like to see honoured as baton-bearers."Commonwealth Games Minister Shona Robison said the call for nominees for baton-bearers "gives everyone in Scotland a chance to recognise up to 4,000 individuals who have made an exceptional contribution to their local community, in particular through sport or their work with young people".On Wednesday, The Queen placed her message to the Commonwealth inside the baton during a special ceremony at Buckingham Palace.Cyclist Sir Chris Hoy, a six-time Olympic gold and double Commonwealth gold medallist, escorted the empty baton up The Mall to the palace in London.The Queen placed the hand-written scroll inside the specially-designed baton, which was then sealed for its 288-day journey through the Commonwealth nations and territories.The first baton bearer was Allan Wells, the Scottish sprinter who won gold at the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games as well the Commonwealth Games in 1978 and 1982.Stirling and Glasgow hosted official events on Thursday before the baton was transported to Glasgow Airport on its way to India.From there, it will travel to Commonwealth nations as diverse as Bangladesh, New Zealand, Nigeria and Barbados.However, it will not stopover in The Gambia, which last week withdrew from the Commonwealth, saying it will "never be a member of any neo-colonial institution".The baton will return to Europe on 4 May 2014 when it will visit Cyprus, Malta and Gibraltar before going on to Jersey, Guernsey and Isle of Man, who all send their own teams to the Games.The baton's visit to Northern Ireland begins on 20 May, Wales on 24 May and England, where it spends two weeks, from 31 May.Glasgow 2014 will be the 20th Commonwealth Games and will feature 17 sports in 11 days of competition, with 261 medal events.The Commonwealth of Nations has 54 members, but 70 teams participate in the Commonwealth Games because a number of British overseas territories, Crown dependencies and island states compete under their own flag.The baton's journey around the globe will be documented by adventurer and broadcaster Mark Beaumont for the BBC.</body>

      <body>A man who assaulted, raped and held a woman prisoner after she was snatched from Slovakia and trafficked to Lancashire has been jailed.Azam Khan "bought" the woman and "married" her at a local mosque in a bid to halt his deportation from the UK to Pakistan.Five other people helped in her trafficking after she was snatched in August 2012, Preston Crown Court heard.Khan, 34, of Brougham Street, Burnley was jailed for 12 years.The victim's story was described by prosecutor Joe Boyd as like "something from a 19th Century novel by Dickens".The Crown Prosecution Service's Emma Kehoe said the woman had been "falsely imprisoned, beaten and raped"."She had no money or identity documents and she was unable to speak English or ask anyone for help," she said."She was threatened and told she was not allowed to leave."The woman was brought to England on a coach and kept prisoner by Imrich Bodor, 45, and Slovakian Petra Dzudzova, 27, both of Clipstone Street, Bradford.Bodor was sentenced to nine years in prison. Dzudzova is due to be sentenced at a later date.Before being sold to Khan, she was handed over to Afghani Abdul Sabool Shinwary, 38, of Washington Street, Bradford, who sexually assaulted her, and Slovakian Kristina Makunova, 37, of Girlington Road, Bradford.Shinwary received a prison sentence of 10 years and three months.Makunova has already served a 51-week prison sentence after previously pleading guilty to human trafficking and false imprisonment offences.Khan's relative Nusrat Khan, 40, of Colne Road, Burnley was also found guilty of false imprisonment and received a jail sentence of nine months, suspended for two years.</body>

      <title>Forget 2014 World Cup win - Hoddle</title>
      <description>Glenn Hoddle says England should forget about winning the 2014 World Cup but thinks they can win a major tournament before 2022.</description>

      <body>Glenn Hoddle says England should forget about winning the 2014 World Cup but thinks success is not very far away.The ex-England boss is on a Football Association commission looking at ways of improving the nation's fortunes."It is unrealistic for England to think they can go and win the World Cup in Brazil," Hoddle told BBC Sport."Let's first qualify, then get the youngsters experiencing a tournament in Brazil so that in two years' time we can have a real go at the Euros."FA chairman Greg Dyke has also written off England's chances of winning in Brazil next year and has targeted success in the 2022 World Cup.But Hoddle told BBC Sport's Ben Smith: "I know Greg has said he wants England to win in 2022, but I think we can bring that forward."I would hope to say we could expect to get some success a little bit earlier than that."The former England and Tottenham midfielder thinks youngsters Ross Barkley, 19, and Jack Wilshere, 21, can help propel England to future success.But Hoddle says they need to be given the opportunity to play regular international football first, starting with next year's World Cup.England will book their place in Brazil if they win their final two qualifying games against Montenegro on Friday and then Poland next Tuesday.Roy Hodgson's side currently sit top of Group H, after picking 16 points from eight matches, one point ahead of Ukraine and Montenegro."I do believe we will be there, but it is about the experience that the likes of the Barkleys, the Wilsheres can get under their belt so that we can have a real onslaught at the Euros," said Hoddle, who was England boss from 1996 to 1999.The 55-year-old thinks the chances of England or any European side winning in Brazil next year are slim."No European team has ever won a World Cup in South America," he said."Spain have Europe's best chance, but even then they probably only have a 35% chance. England have got a lesser chance than that. I don't want to put a percentage on that."Hoddle has been joined on the FA commission by Danny Mills, Howard Wilkinson and Dario Gradi,The former England and Tottenham midfielder believes he can make a positive contribution."I really have got some exciting ideas that I want to run across this commission and I hope people will get on board with it," he said."It is something close to my heart, close to my heart for many years."Hoddle admits the number of foreigners in the Premier League is a hindrance and thinks England has a lot of work to do to catch up with other nations.Responding to BBC Sport's State of the Game survey, which has revealed that playing time for English players in the Premier League has dropped to just 31.8%, he feared the situation could get "worse and worse" if no action was taken."We have got to produce better players so they become as good as the Spanish kids, they become as good as the French and the South Americans," he said."We will always create exciting players, like your Ferdinands, your Owens and your Beckhams, but we need 15 of these players every two years coming through."That's what the Spanish have done, that's where the French have done, so we've got a lot of things to change if we are going to catch up. We've been stuck for a very long time."Hoddle also praised Dyke's leadership after meeting the FA chairman and giving him "a vision of how we could improve things".Hoddle, who spoke with Dyke "a couple of months back", added: "I am particularly impressed that Greg wants to change things."He's very successful in what he's done as a businessman and has a different outlook to some of his predecessors."</body>

      <body>The women's Tour of Britain is set to attract top riders after being given the same status as the men's race.World cycling's governing body, the UCI, has given the event 2.1 status for its launch in 2014.The race, to be staged over five days in May, will be separate to the men's event held in September."We are absolutely delighted that the UCI have awarded us 2.1 status for this exciting new event," said Guy Elliott, director of event organisers SweetSpot.The UCI grades all men's and women's stage races - any event that takes place over several days - in four categories: WT, 2.HC, 2.1 and 2.2.WT, which stands for World Tour, includes the sport's most prestigious races, such as the Tour de France.The 2.1 category is the third tier overall, below 2.HC. But giving the Tour of Britain 2.1 status ranks it among the highest-rated women's races, meaning it will be able to attract top riders.Plans for a women's race were confirmed in July. The event will take place between Wednesday, 7 May and Sunday, 11 May next year, with the opening stage to be held in Northamptonshire.Exact details of the route, and start and finish locations, have yet to be announced.</body>

      <title>Premier League one third English</title>
      <description>English footballers account for less than a third of minutes played in the Premier League, BBC Sport's State of the Game study shows.</description>

      <body>English footballers account for less than a third of all the minutes played in the Premier League, a State of the Game study for BBC Sport has found.The figure for home country players - 32.26% - is down from 35.43% in 2007-08 and is significantly lower than all other major European leagues according to football statisticians Opta.In La Liga, home of World Cup holders and European champions Spain, Spaniards account for 59% of all minutes played. In Germany's Bundesliga, Germans make up 50%.The minutes played by Scottish players in the Scottish Premiership has remained static - 57.36% in 2007-08 and 57.19% so far this season.But Scottish (3.27%), Welsh (3.17%) and Northern Irish (0.93%) players have got fewer minutes on the pitch in the Premier League than French (8.1%), Dutch (4%) and Spanish (6.27%) players so far this season.However, footballers from England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are playing more minutes in the Championship and the Scottish Premiership than they did five years ago.In total, 60.36% of minutes in the Premier League have been completed by foreign players so far this season, up from 56.7% in 2007-08.Former England captain Alan Shearer said: "These are tough times for English football at the moment. Everyone is aware that English football is not as healthy as it should be and I'm afraid it is all going to take time."Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said the figures were a "concern", but added: "There are only two ways you can see it - you have the opportunity to have the best players in the world in England, so let's see what they have and let's produce players who have the same qualities."Or you say, let's protect our players, keep the good players out and let's just play the English players. I believe that we live in a global world. The real question for English football is whether it can produce the players with the needed quality."In a statement, the Premier League said that it was working to encourage the development of home-grown talent, and highlighted the efforts being made as part of the Elite Player Performance Plan, a scheme designed to increase levels of investment and raise the standards of youth set-ups at English professional clubs."The Premier League is one season into the implementation of its £340m Elite Player Performance Plan, the number one stated aim of which is to develop more and better home-grown players," a spokesman said."Significant progress has already been made with club academies independently audited, coaching hours and provision increased, and new competitions established."Young home-grown players, including Daniel Sturridge [at Liverpool], Danny Welbeck [at Manchester United], Ross Barkley [at Everton], Ravel Morrison [at West Ham] and several others, have already made a significant impact this season. The clubs are working harder than ever to develop more home-grown players of sufficient quality to play in the Premier League."The BBC's study examined the minutes played by every nationality represented in the Premier League, the Championship and the Scottish Premiership so far this season, compared with the 2007-08 campaign, the last time all the home nations failed to qualify for a major tournament.The findings come ahead of a crucial few days in England's campaign to reach for next summer's World Cup in Brazil, a tournament that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have failed to qualify for.State of the Game found:Only last month, Football Association chairman Greg Dyke addressed what he called a "frightening trend" of the reduction in the number of English players playing regularly in the Premier League.Against the backdrop of a growing foreign influence in the Premier League, Dyke warned England might not be able to compete seriously on the world stage without changes in the domestic game.Shearer, who won 63 caps between 1992 and 2000 said: "It makes it harder for England, there's no doubt about it."But England didn't qualify for the US in 1994 when the percentage of British players was quite high, so I do believe that it's not only the number of foreign players in the Premier League that is making things difficult for England."I believe there are a number of other things. Foreign players are a lot cheaper than British players and as we all know, managers have no time whatsoever."There is also the hunger of young players and the coaching that players have. If you put all that together, then that's where England are at this moment in time."Chris Waddle, who won 62 caps for England between 1985 and 1991, said: "The Premier League is a great product to sell around the world but for the national team it does a lot of damage."All this money flying around in the Premier League, and grassroots [football] is going backwards."Former Football Association chairman Lord Triesman said it was an "acute problem and getting worse"."Unless there is some sort of ratio idea that Uefa president Michel Platini has been advocating over the years, I expect that we are not going to resolve that problem," he added.Former Northern Ireland international Billy Hamilton, who starred at the 1982 World Cup, said the figures painted a "bleak future" for his country."Unless the Premier League or indeed Championship put some kind of cap on the amount of foreign players then the statistics are only going to get worse for Northern Ireland," he said."Well, if the Premier League don't introduce a cap on foreign players to four or five in a team, I can tell you that England will never win another tournament."David Wetherall, head of player development at the Football League, said he was not surprised the numbers of UK numbers were on the up in the Championship."There's some fantastic youth development work being done in the Football League. About £60m per year is invested in youth development in the Football League, and two thirds of that comes from the clubs themselves."Figures amended at 13:12 BST on 10 Oct because of Serbia being counted twice</body>

      <title>The hunt for a long-lost John Wayne film</title>
      <description>The Oregon Trail, a 1936 film starring John Wayne, is missing. Fans and historians are trying to find it.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24407455</url>
      <date>1381368054</date>
      <body>John Wayne was the archetypal screen cowboy, embodying the rough independence of the American west for generations of film fans. Now, newly discovered still photographs offer fresh insight into a western he made that was last seen more than three-quarters of a century ago.Kent Sperring was raised in Ocala, Florida, in the 1940s by his mother, a widow who worked as a chemist's clerk."Money was kind of scarce," he said.Luckily, he could see "a double-feature western for nine cents" at the Ritz theatre on Saturdays. The movies made an impression."You came away from the movie knowing that if you did something bad or wrong, you were going to get punished for it," he said.Wayne and other good cowboys wore white hats. The bad ones wore black hats."It was almost that clear-cut," he said. "If you watched the films long enough, you'd see that those bad guys - they didn't end up too well."The films were wildly successful. Today, Wayne ranks as one of the most popular film stars of all time, admired by Sperring and countless others.Yet despite Wayne's iconic stature, one of his films is missing.The Oregon Trail, released by Republic Pictures in 1936, was shown in theatres - then disappeared. There are no known remaining prints.In the film Wayne plays John Delmont, a retired army captain who falls in love with a frontier woman played by Ann Rutherford, who later appears in Gone With the Wind. The plot hinges on the discovery of a journal bound in black that once belonged to Delmont's father.Reading the diary, Delmont learns that his father has been killed or was left to die by a renegade - and vows to hunt down the killer.Earlier this year Sperring, a retired telephone company manager in Duluth, Georgia, discovered 40 still photographs taken on the sets of The Oregon Trail.He came across the photos while ordering Wayne memorabilia from a video store, Eddie Brandt's Saturday Matinee, in North Hollywood."They sent me the negatives," said Sperring. "I think they did it by mistake."Decades ago, photographers would take pictures of actors, either during a scene or after it had been shot, with an 8in by 10in (20cm by 25cm) camera. The photographs, known as movie stills, were then displayed in glass cases outside of theatres.Sperring scanned the stills into a computer and sent them to the Lone Pine Film History Museum in Lone Pine, California, so they could be stored in the archives.These photographs and other promotional material are the film's lasting legacy. They provide insight into the film, showing the locations where it was shot and other details about the production.The promotional materials are also striking images. Aside from the stills, three posters remain. Painted in garish colours, Wayne fords a river in a stagecoach pulled by a team of wild-eyed horses.The Lone Pine museum, which celebrates the western film genre, hosts an annual film festival.This year it will take place from 11-13 October and will feature Jake Thorne in The Life and Legend of John Wayne.Lone Pine museum director Bob Sigman, former president of Republic Pictures, started his own search for the film a decade ago. He prides himself on his hard-nosed approach to the film world. He is the kind of person who says: "I've been in this business a long time.""If we could have brought out The Oregon Trail, it would have generated a million dollars in revenue," he said, standing in a room with klieg lights at the museum last summer.As he spoke, a Comstock Cowboys CD played in the background. The music has simple chords with lonely-guy lyrics: "I rode in the deadwood one dark, stormy evening."Sigman said he believed The Oregon Trail was misfiled and placed in the wrong canister.He picked up a rusted canister, a storage case for movie prints, that been lying on the floor. It was empty, except for a brochure from a 2003 film festival.He said the canister with The Oregon Trail may be sitting in a warehouse somewhere. He has travelled to Latin America in search of the film and has spoken with film distributors in Europe and the UK."I looked all over the world for it," he said. "It is one of the treasures that everybody wants."Should a print be found, it would not be the first time a lost film was rediscovered.Another film from the 1930s featuring Wayne - a pre-censorship version of Baby Face - was missing until a curator found it at the US Library of Congress in 2004.Too Much Johnson, a 1938 picture by Orson Welles, was discovered more recently in an Italian warehouse. The US premiere of the film will take place at the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York, on 16 October.By 1935, when The Oregon Trail was shot, Wayne, then 28, had already appeared in dozens of films.But his career prospects looked grim.His 1930 star turn in Raoul Walsh's The Big Trail was artistically ambitious but flopped at the box office.He spent the next several years appearing in poverty-row westerns, as the low-budget films were called. For a while he worked as a singing cowboy.Yet he was not a quitter. Courage, he once said, "is being scared to death but saddling up anyway".After The Oregon Trail, he appeared in several more films before he was propelled to stardom as the Ringo Kid in John Ford's Stagecoach in 1939.Wayne's earlier films are now prized by collectors and studied by fans and historians.Wayne himself described the work in simple terms. As he said in a BBC interview in 1964, the films tell "the story of the West - the story of a man fighting against the elements".The most compelling characters, he said, were men of action."There's no nuance," he said in a BBC interview in 1974."They drive ahead," Wayne said, "usually fighting something bigger than a petty little argument with someone."A historian at the museum, Chris Langley, is using the movie stills to track down locations where the film was shot. In this way, he hopes to deepen the public's understanding of the movie - and of Wayne.One Saturday morning last summer, Langley tossed a manila folder into the front seat of his car and drove about 10 miles (16km) to the Alabama Hills, where The Oregon Trail was shot in December 1935.Known as Hollywood's back lot, Alabama Hills was also the setting for Gunga Din, a 1939 movie based on a Rudyard Kipling poem, several Firestone tyre commercials, and Quentin Tarantino's recent Django Unchained.Mt Whitney's 14,497ft (4,418m) peak loomed in the distance. Granite rocks were scattered across a lunar landscape.Grabbing the folder, Langley climbed out of the car."I thought if I were ever in trouble, I'd like John Wayne to ride up," he said. "It's like a father figure, but it's more than that."It was a wet morning, with a sharp breeze that wrapped around your legs. Chunks of broken glass jutted from the dirt, and it was quiet. One could hear raindrops splash on dark leaves, and the place smelled like sage and Marlboro Lights."You're now leaning exactly where John Wayne is," said Langley. He held up a movie still. In the photograph Wayne leans against a rock. He wears a white jacket with fringe, cinched with a silver buckle.Sperring is now in Lone Pine for the film festival at the weekend. He too spent time in Alabama Hills, visiting places where Wayne acted out scenes in The Oregon Trail and other films."I don't want to sound goofy, but it's almost like you feel their presence," Sperring said. "It's a good feeling."For Sperring and others, Wayne was part of their childhood. As Joan Didion wrote in a 1965 essay for The Saturday Evening Post: "He determined forever the shape of certain of our dreams."The Oregon Trail is gone, but some things remain."I'll look at a rock that was there 75 years ago," Sperring said."It erodes, but it erodes very slowly because it's hard granite. You look, and you see that very little changes. The rocks will split and fall down, but they are still there."</body>

      <body>The Democratic Republic of Congo is potentially one of the richest countries on earth, but colonialism, slavery and corruption have turned it into one of the poorest, writes historian Dan Snow.The world's bloodiest conflict since World War II is still rumbling on today.It is a war in which more than five million people have died, millions more have been driven to the brink by starvation and disease and several million women and girls have been raped.The Great War of Africa, a conflagration that has sucked in soldiers and civilians from nine nations and countless armed rebel groups, has been fought almost entirely inside the borders of one unfortunate country - the Democratic Republic of Congo.It is a place seemingly blessed with every type of mineral, yet consistently rated lowest on the UN Human Development Index, where even the more fortunate live in grinding poverty.I went to the Congo this summer to find out what it was about the country's past that had delivered it into the hands of unimaginable violence and anarchy.The journey that I went on, through the Congo's abusive history, while travelling across its war-torn present, was the most disturbing experience of my career.I met rape victims, rebels, bloated politicians and haunted citizens of a country that has ceased to function - people who struggle to survive in a place cursed by a past that defies description, a history that will not release them from its death-like grip.The Congo's apocalyptic present is a direct product of decisions and actions taken over the past five centuries.In the late 15th Century an empire known as the Kingdom of Kongo dominated the western portion of the Congo, and bits of other modern states such as Angola.It was sophisticated, had its own aristocracy and an impressive civil service.When Portuguese traders arrived from Europe in the 1480s, they realised they had stumbled upon a land of vast natural wealth, rich in resources - particularly human flesh.The Congo was home to a seemingly inexhaustible supply of strong, disease-resistant slaves. The Portuguese quickly found this supply would be easier to tap if the interior of the continent was in a state of anarchy.They did their utmost to destroy any indigenous political force capable of curtailing their slaving or trading interests.Money and modern weapons were sent to rebels, Kongolese armies were defeated, kings were murdered, elites slaughtered and secession was encouraged.By the 1600s, the once-mighty kingdom had disintegrated into a leaderless, anarchy of mini-states locked in endemic civil war. Slaves, victims of this fighting, flowed to the coast and were carried to the Americas.About four million people were forcibly embarked at the mouth of the Congo River. English ships were at the heart of the trade. British cities and merchants grew rich on the back of Congolese resources they would never see.This first engagement with Europeans set the tone for the rest of the Congo's history.Development has been stifled, government has been weak and the rule of law non-existent. This was not through any innate fault of the Congolese, but because it has been in the interests of the powerful to destroy, suppress and prevent any strong, stable, legitimate government. That would interfere - as the Kongolese had threatened to interfere before - with the easy extraction of the nation's resources. The Congo has been utterly cursed by its natural wealth.The Congo is a massive country, the size of Western Europe.Limitless water, from the world's second-largest river, the Congo, a benign climate and rich soil make it fertile, beneath the soil abundant deposits of copper, gold, diamonds, cobalt, uranium, coltan and oil are just some of the minerals that should make it one of the world's richest countries.Instead it is the world's most hopeless.The interior of the Congo was opened up in the late 19th Century by the British-born explorer Henry Morton Stanley, his dreams of free trading associations with communities he met were shattered by the infamous King of the Belgians, Leopold, who hacked out a vast private empire.The world's largest supply of rubber was found at a time when bicycle and automobile tyres, and electrical insulation, had made it a vital commodity in the West.The late Victorian bicycle craze was enabled by Congolese rubber collected by slave labourers.To tap it, Congolese men were rounded up by a brutal Belgian-officered security force, their wives were interned to ensure compliance and were brutalised during their captivity. The men were then forced to go into the jungle and harvest the rubber.Disobedience or resistance was met by immediate punishment - flogging, severing of hands, and death. Millions perished.Tribal leaders capable of resisting were murdered, indigenous society decimated, proper education denied.A culture of rapacious, barbaric rule by a Belgian elite who had absolutely no interest in developing the country or population was created, and it has endured.In a move supposed to end the brutality, Belgium eventually annexed the Congo outright, but the problems in its former colony remained.Mining boomed, workers suffered in appalling conditions, producing the materials that fired industrial production in Europe and America.In World War I men on the Western Front and elsewhere did the dying, but it was Congo's minerals that did the killing.The brass casings of allied shells fired at Passchendaele and the Somme were 75% Congolese copper.In World War II, the uranium for the nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki came from a mine in south-east Congo.Western freedoms were defended with Congo's resources while black Congolese were denied the right to vote, or form unions and political associations. They were denied anything beyond the most basic of educations.They were kept at an infantile level of development that suited the rulers and mine owners but made sure that when independence came there was no home-grown elite who could run the country.Independence in 1960 was, therefore, predictably disastrous.Bits of the vast country immediately attempted to break away, the army mutinied against its Belgian officers and within weeks the Belgian elite who ran the state evacuated leaving nobody with the skills to run the government or economy.Of 5,000 government jobs pre-independence, just three were held by Congolese and there was not a single Congolese lawyer, doctor, economist or engineer.Chaos threatened to engulf the region. The Cold War superpowers moved to prevent the other gaining the upper hand.Sucked into these rivalries, the struggling Congolese leader, Patrice Lumumba, was horrifically beaten and executed by Western-backed rebels. A military strongman, Joseph-Desire Mobutu, who had a few years before been a sergeant in the colonial police force, took over.Mobutu became a tyrant. In 1972 he changed his name to Mobutu Sese Seko Nkuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga, meaning "the all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, goes from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake".The West tolerated him as long as the minerals flowed and the Congo was kept out of the Soviet orbit.He, his family and friends bled the country of billions of dollars, a $100m palace was built in the most remote jungle at Gbadolite, an ultra-long airstrip next to it was designed to take Concorde, which was duly chartered for shopping trips to Paris.Dissidents were tortured or bought off, ministers stole entire budgets, government atrophied. The West allowed his regime to borrow billions, which was then stolen and today's Congo is still expected to pay the bill.In 1997 an alliance of neighbouring African states, led by Rwanda - which was furious Mobutu's Congo was sheltering many of those responsible for the 1994 genocide - invaded, after deciding to get rid of Mobutu.A Congolese exile, Laurent Kabila, was dredged up in East Africa to act as a figurehead. Mobutu's cash-starved army imploded, its leaders, incompetent cronies of the president, abandoning their men in a mad dash to escape.Mobutu took off one last time from his jungle Versailles, his aircraft packed with valuables, his own unpaid soldiers firing at the plane as it lumbered into the air.Rwanda had effectively conquered its titanic neighbour with spectacular ease. Once installed however, Kabila, Rwanda's puppet, refused to do as he was told.Again Rwanda invaded, but this time they were just halted by her erstwhile African allies who now turned on each other and plunged Congo into a terrible war.Foreign armies clashed deep inside the Congo as the paper-thin state collapsed totally and anarchy spread.Hundreds of armed groups carried out atrocities, millions died.Ethnic and linguistic differences fanned the ferocity of the violence, while control of Congo's stunning natural wealth added a terrible urgency to the fighting.Forcibly conscripted child soldiers corralled armies of slaves to dig for minerals such as coltan, a key component in mobile phones, the latest obsession in the developed world, while annihilating enemy communities, raping women and driving survivors into the jungle to die of starvation and disease.A deeply flawed, partial peace was patched together a decade ago. In the far east of the Congo, there is once again a shooting war as a complex web of domestic and international rivalries see rebel groups clash with the army and the UN, while tiny community militias add to the general instability.The country has collapsed, roads no longer link the main cities, healthcare depends on aid and charity. The new regime is as grasping as its predecessors.I rode on one of the trainloads of copper that go straight from foreign-owned mines to the border, and on to the Far East, rumbling past shanty towns of displaced, poverty-stricken Congolese.The Portuguese, Belgians, Mobutu and the present government have all deliberately stifled the development of a strong state, army, judiciary and education system, because it interferes with their primary focus, making money from what lies under the Earth.The billions of pounds those minerals have generated have brought nothing but misery and death to the very people who live on top of them, while enriching a microscopic elite in the Congo and their foreign backers, and underpinning our technological revolution in the developed world.The Congo is a land far away, yet our histories are so closely linked. We have thrived from a lopsided relationship, yet we are utterly blind to it. The price of that myopia has been human suffering on an unimaginable scale.Dan Snow answered readers' questions on Twitter using #AskDanSnow. Here is a selection.Q: Did you ever feel in real danger?A: Shots were fired when we were on the frontline, but the biggest threat was terrible roads and bad vehiclesQ: Why go back to 1500s and ignore the devastating role of revolutionary movements in destabilizing Congo the last 50 years?A: We tried to do both. The problems of the recent past are children of the more distant history.Q: Why haven't western nations shown greater interest in stabilising DRC considering its mineral wealth?A: Sadly I think leaders think it's a massive, insoluble problem that they don't understand in a far away land.Q: How do you see these countries getting out of this situation?A: Rwanda succeeded in massive reduction in poverty, and development of infrastructure. It requires totally different leadership.Q: I visited DRC in 2012. Why are people so unaware of the negative impact of Western Europeans (and now China too)?A: It is a blind spot for us. I just don't know why. Perhaps we don't like to dwell on our failures.Q: What advice do you have for businesses intending to invest in the country?A: Have impeccable local political contacts, or don't even try.Q: Do you think the war in Congo is the obstacle to the country's poor utilization of it natural resources?A: Warlords control access to the resources and the bigger, more responsible mining firms will not risk the investment.Q: Is poverty in such a rich nation caused by greedy Congolese leaders or post-colonial powers?A: Nationality of the rulers hasn't mattered much, they've all behaved the same. The potential wealth has corrupted all of them.Q: How difficult was it to travel through the Democratic Republic of Congo?A: Exceptionally. Roads collapsed, bandits own the night, no road travel between the major cities.Q: How can we help the Congolese people to benefit from their own natural resources?A: We can pressure international players in the resources extraction industry to be more transparent.Q: If you could pick just one thing to change in Congo, what would it be?A: The rule of law. People need protection when rights are violated, to start businesses and to find out where the money goes.And finally. The Um Bongo thing. Everybody asks. Mbongo in a local language means money. So kids in the street shout it at you all the time.</body>

      <title>How much can an extra hour's sleep change you?</title>
      <description>The average Briton gets six-and-a-half hours sleep a night. Michael Mosley took part in an unusual experiment to see if this is enough.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24444634</url>
      <date>1381307042</date>
      <body>The average Briton gets six-and-a-half hours' sleep a night, according to the Sleep Council. Michael Mosley took part in an unusual experiment to see if this is enough.It has been known for some time that the amount of sleep people get has, on average, declined over the years.This has happened for a whole range of reasons, not least because we live in a culture where people are encouraged to think of sleep as a luxury - something you can easily cut back on. After all, that's what caffeine is for - to jolt you back into life. But while the average amount of sleep we are getting has fallen, rates of obesity and diabetes have soared. Could the two be connected?We wanted to see what the effect would be of increasing average sleep by just one hour. So we asked seven volunteers, who normally sleep anywhere between six and nine hours, to be studied at the University of Surrey's Sleep Research Centre.The volunteers were randomly allocated to two groups. One group was asked to sleep for six-and-a-half hours a night, the other got seven-and-a-half hours. After a week the researchers took blood tests and the volunteers were asked to switch sleep patterns. The group that had been sleeping six-and-a-half hours got an extra hour, the other group slept an hour less.While we were waiting to see what effect this would have, I went to the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford to learn more about what actually happens when we sleep.In the Sleep Centre, they fitted me up with a portable electro-encephalograph, a device that measures brain wave activity. Then, feeling slightly ridiculous, I went home and had my seven-and-a-half hours of sleep.The following day I went to discuss what had happened inside my head during the night with Dr Katharina Wulff.The first thing she pointed out was that I had very rapidly fallen into a state of deep sleep. Deep sleep sounds restful, but during it our brains are actually working hard. One of the main things the brain is doing is moving memories from short-term storage into long-term storage, allowing us more short-term memory space for the next day. If you don't get adequate deep sleep then these memories will be lost.You might think: "I'll cut back during the week and then make up for it at the weekend." Unfortunately it doesn't work like that, because memories need to be consolidated within 24 hours of being formed.Since deep sleep is so important for consolidating memories it is a good idea if you are revising or perhaps taking an exam to make sure that you're getting a reasonable night's sleep. In one study, people who failed to do so did 40% worse than their contemporaries.Deep sleep only lasts for a few hours. My electrode results showed that during the night my brain went through multiple phases of another kind of activity, called REM sleep."This is the phase when you are usually paralysed - so you can't move," Wulff explained. But the eye muscles are not paralysed, and that's why it's called rapid eye movement sleep."During REM sleep an extraordinary thing happens. One of the stress-related chemicals in the brain, noradrenalin, is switched off. It's the only time, day or night, this happens. It allows us to remain calm while our brains reprocess all the experiences of the day, helping us come to terms with particularly emotional events.We get more REM sleep in the last half of the night. Which means that if you are woken unexpectedly, your brain may not have dealt with all your emotions - which could leave you stressed and anxious. Drinking alcohol late at night is not a good idea as it reduces your REM sleep while it's being processed in your body.Back at the University of Surrey our sleep volunteers had finished their second week of the experiment. What we wanted to see was the effect switching from six-and-a-half hours to seven-and-a-half hours, or vice versa, would have on our volunteers.Computer tests revealed that most of them struggled with mental agility tasks when they had less sleep, but the most interesting results came from the blood tests that were run.Dr Simon Archer and his team at Surrey University were particularly interested in looking at the genes that were switched on or off in our volunteers by changes in the amount that we had made them sleep."We found that overall there were around 500 genes that were affected," Archer explained. "Some which were going up, and some which were going down."What they discovered is that when the volunteers cut back from seven-and-a-half to six-and-a-half hours' sleep a night, genes that are associated with processes like inflammation, immune response and response to stress became more active. The team also saw increases in the activity of genes associated with diabetes and risk of cancer. The reverse happened when the volunteers added an hour of sleep.So the clear message from this experiment was that if you are getting less than seven hours' sleep a night and can alter your sleep habits, even just a little bit, it could make you healthier. "Have a lie-in, it will do you good" - that's the kind of health message that doesn't come along very often.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on FacebookTrust Me I'm a Doctor is broadcast on 10 October on BBC Two at 20:00 BST, or catch up with iPlayer</body>

      <title>Minister considers gassing badgers</title>
      <description>The government is exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB, environment secretary Owen Paterson tells MPs.</description>

      <body>The government is exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has told MPs.A six week trial of badger culling in Somerset has now ended.But the firm behind it has asked for more time after its marksmen fell short of killing the target of 70% of the badger population.Mr Paterson said the Department for Food and Rural Affairs was looking at other methods including the use of gas.Responding to a question from Green MP Caroline Lucas in the Commons, Mr Paterson said: "Until we can establish vaccines, we have to use the tools used by other sensible countries - which is to remove wildlife - we made it quite clear in our TB strategy we would look at other methods of removing wildlife, and yes we are looking at gassing, but we will not use it unless it is proven to be safe, humane, and effective."Labour MP Barry Sheerman called the badger cull "morally reprehensible" and asked Mr Paterson "why doesn't he resign?" during heated Commons exchanges.Marksmen only managed to shoot 60% of the badgers in the trial area in Somerset, although estimates have been lowered as to how many badgers lived in the region in the first place.The company behind the cull has asked for more time and a similar time extension is being sought for a trial cull Gloucestershire.The government is due to make a decision on extending the culls later this week.Farmers have long blamed badgers for spreading bovine TB in cattle but animal rights groups say evidence does not support this.At one time gassing was the preferred method of culling but it was dropped in favour of shooting, which is seen as more humane.The RSPCA said it was "opposed to the use of gas to control badgers on welfare grounds and believes it is not humane as it may cause badgers to suffer prolonged deaths underground"."We are extremely concerned about the government's admission that they are looking into using gassing to cull badgers," the organisation said in a statement."Culling badgers will not solve the problem of bovine TB in cattle, whatever the method of culling."The possible gassing of badgers adds a further outrageous twist to this misguided policy. The RSPCA will look into reports that badgers have been gassed in and around the pilot cull areas."Martin Surl, Police and Crime Commissioner for Gloucestershire, has warned that plans to extend the cull could stretch police resources in his area.Mr Surl told the the Stroud News and Journal: "My concern is that the cull operators are feeling the pressure and may become more desperate in their attempts to shoot their quota of badgers while the people opposed to the cull are getting equally frustrated, all of which adds up to an unhelpful situation."But Laurence Robertson, Conservative MP for Tewkesbury, dismissed Mr Surl's concerns, accusing him in the Commons of being "publicity-seeking", adding that it was for the government to decide whether to extend the cull.In the trial which has just ended, the plan was to shoot and kill 70% of badgers in the areas of west Somerset and Gloucestershire by free shooting.Across both regions this meant around 5,000 badgers were to be killed in total.But Defra sources said these targets were based on population estimates from 2012 that have proved to be highly inaccurate.Explaining the failure to meet the target on Wednesday, Mr Paterson said: "The badgers moved the goalposts."We're dealing with a wild animal, subject to the vagaries of the weather and disease and breeding patterns."But rock star and campaigner Brian May, a leading opponent of the cull, branded the trial an "utter failure" and described the application for an extension as a "farce"."They were warned this would happen and they did not listen to the scientists," he added.</body>

      <title>Whitehall warned on 'food confusion'</title>
      <description>The UK's response to the horse meat scandal illustrated the "confusion" surrounding food policy in government, the National Audit Office says in a report.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24461896</url>
      <date>1381369820</date>
      <body>The response to the horsemeat scandal illustrated the "confusion" surrounding food policy in the UK government, the National Audit Office has claimed.A 2010 re-organisation had blurred the division of responsibilities between the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Food Standards Agency, it said.And local authorities had been unsure who had been taking the lead.Officials said intelligence sharing and food monitoring were being improved.Leading British supermarkets recalled processed beef products found to contain horsemeat after the first cases of adulteration came to light in January following an investigation by Ireland's Food Safety Authority.Others took frozen goods off their shelves as a precaution.Since then, tests on 24,480 samples by British food retailers and processors found horsemeat in 47 products, while testing by local authorities of 514 products labelled as containing beef as a major ingredient revealed two containing horse DNA and four with traces of pig DNA.So far three people have been arrested in the UK under the Fraud Act although no-one one has yet been prosecuted.In a report examining the response to the scandal in England, the public spending watchdog found the public's expectations about the authenticity of food were not being matched by the effectiveness of controls in place.Its main findings were:While the Food Safety Agency (FSA) is responsible for food safety issues, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs takes the lead on food authenticity and composition while the Department of Health is in charge of nutritional labelling issues.The National Audit Office's (NAO) criticisms echo those of the Commons Environment Committee, which said in July there had been a "lack of clarity" within Whitehall over where responsibility lay for dealing with such issues."The division of responsibility for food safety and food authenticity has created confusion," Amyas Morse, the watchdog's head, said."The government needs to remove this confusion and improve its understanding of potential food fraud."Labour said there was a case for food safety and food fraud issues to be brought back under one roof."The chaotic structure put in place after the election should be urgently reviewed," Maria Eagle, the shadow environment secretary, said."It is clear from this report that David Cameron's botched departmental re-organisation created confusion about who was responsible for ensuring that meat was not wrongly being passed off as beef."Added to this confusion was the complete failure of ministers to take seriously the possibility that horsemeat was entering the food chain despite clear indications of an increased risk that this was taking place."The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the watchdog was satisfied that controls in place to guarantee food safety were effective but that the government "wanted to prevent food fraud as well"."Defra and the FSA have already identified and begun work on the issues raised by the NAO," a spokeswoman said."We are improving intelligence-sharing and identifying parts of the food chain which need the closest monitoring."Food authenticity testing is making sure that consumers can be confident in the foods they purchase."However, it is important to work more closely with industry and local authorities so that resources can be targeted where they will be most effective."</body>

      <title>Sir Menzies to stand down in 2015</title>
      <description>Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell is to stand down as an MP at the next general election, due in May 2015.</description>

      <body>Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell has announced he will stand down as an MP at the next general election, due in May 2015.Sir Menzies, or Ming as he is widely known, said he had written to Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg to inform him of his decision.He has served as MP for North East Fife since 1987 and was leader of the Lib Dems from 2006-07.Sir Menzies said it had been "an enormous privilege" to serve as an MP.During his career representing his "wonderful" Scottish constituency, he said: "My wife and I have made many friends and have been supported by constituents of all political persuasions and none."It is always a regret to begin the process of retiring from the House of Commons but I believe now is the time to start."Mr Clegg said Sir Menzies was "a towering presence" in British politics and had "served this country and our party with unparalleled distinction"."As well as being an outstanding leader, Sir Menzies is a brilliant orator and someone who commands both attention and affection from all sides of the House in Westminster."Of his many achievements in politics, I suspect he will be most vividly remembered for his passionate and articulate opposition to the war in Iraq."Sir Menzies told the BBC he was leaving because of his age. He will be 80 when the next Parliament is due to end."I have had a good innings but it's time to give someone else a go," he told the BBC News Channel's chief political correspondent Norman Smith.He had contemplated leaving Parliament after he resigned as Liberal Democrat leader, he added.There is speculation that Sir Menzies will be offered a place in the House of Lords.Sir Menzies first stood as a candidate for the Liberal Democrats seat in 1976, but did not win his constituency for 11 years.He had originally intended to stand for two Parliaments, he told the BBC, but he has now have served in six Parliaments.In his first career as a sprinter, he held the UK 100m record from 1967 to 1974 and ran in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.He later became a QC, and spoke for his party on foreign affairs, defence and Europe for more than a decade.Earlier this year, he was included in the Queen's Birthday Honours list, which cited him as "one of the most respected politicians of his generation"."It is a complete surprise. I am delighted and honoured," he said at the time."Other contemporary holders include Lord Coe and Judi Dench, and it is a privilege to join such company."</body>

      <title>Alzheimer's breakthrough: Cure or hype?</title>
      <description>How significant are reports of a turning point in Alzheimer's disease?</description>

      <body>If you regularly walk past a newspaper stand, then "Alzheimer's cure" or "Major Alzheimer's breakthrough" headlines will be a familiar sight. And here we are again.UK researchers have, for the first time, used a chemical to prevent the death of brain tissue in a neurodegenerative disease.The Times went with Cure for Alzheimer's "within reach" on its front page, the Independent had Scientists hail historic breakthrough in war against Alzheimer's, and my BBC News website article used the headline Alzheimer's find is "turning point".One major difference this time is that sensible, cautious scientists are suggesting the latest discovery could be one for the history books.Nearly every report contains this quote from Prof Roger Morris, at King's College London: "This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer's disease."So what is it about the latest study that generates a rare level of excitement? And is a cure really on the cards?The prime source of excitement is that a chemical has stopped the death of brain cells, in a living brain, that would have otherwise died due to a neurodegenerative disease.This is a first and a significant one. When I interviewed Prof Morris on Wednesday night, he used the word "landmark" repeatedly.In the Medical Research Council study, the mice had prion disease, similar to the human form of mad cow disease. Within eight weeks, their brains deteriorated so badly that memory and movement were noticeably affected. By the 12th week, the mice were dead.But when the same infected animals were given a "drug-like compound", they survived the 12 weeks with no sign of the brain dying. The chemical also caused side-effects including weight loss and diabetes.The second tier of excitement comes from the potential implications.The chemical helps the brain cope with producing broken proteins. In Parkinson's the alpha-synuclein protein goes wrong, in Alzheimer's it's amyloid and tau, in Huntington's it's the Huntingtin protein.The brain's response to all of these diseases is to shut down protein production, but this eventually kills brain cells. The chemical helps brain cells ignore the broken proteins, keep functioning and stay alive.In the past, research on neurodegenerative diseases has focused on what is unique to that condition. This approach looks at what is common to all of them and if it really does work, then it raises the prospect of a single drug to cure or prevent nearly all forms of neurodegeneration. Another reason for excitement.Lead researcher Prof Giovanna Mallucci said: "If it stops brain degeneration in its tracks, it will halt disease in people who have already got it. And if we can detect early disease, it will prevent a lot of degeneration."The hope is to arrest the process of brain cell death, and that's what's so exciting."It's worth emphasising the precise findings of the study - a toxic chemical, which the researchers will not even call a drug, halts the death of brain cells in mice with prion disease.Clearly this is not a cure, but it points the way to one. It gives drugs companies and scientists something to work with.That process will take time, probably more than a decade, with no guarantee of success at the end.And the recent history of medical research is littered with examples of drugs that looked promising in mice, but were a bitter disappointment when tested in people.This chemical works in a mouse brain of 75 million neurons. A more complex human brain built from 85 billion neurons is a far different challenge.Dr Simon Ridley, the head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, told the BBC patients would be facing a long wait."I'm afraid it's far longer than any of us would like," he said."I think there are many people who'd be desperate for any news of new treatments, which they would like to take today."I think at this stage we could be looking at a decade before we'll know whether this will be effective."This study is certainly exciting scientifically. But it might take until 2023 to see whether it truly deserves its place in the history books.</body>

      <description>How ex-prisoner Frank Harris turned his life around</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24460089</url>
      <date>1381408161</date>
      <body>As Ofsted inspectors deliver a critical verdict of the education prisoners receive in England's jails, one ex-inmate describes how he finally learnt a vital lesson.Expelled from school at 12, Frank Harris says it was the thought of how he would be remembered by his own children that helped him see education as a way to change his life.The 53-year-old Londoner says he was in and out of prisons for more than 30 years before he found his "way out" through education and wants other people involved in crime to see it is not too late for them either."I wasn't getting any younger. I was thinking, 'What will my four kids do if I dropped down [dead]?'"If they said I was in and out of prison - that I wasted my time on earth. Now they can say I made mistakes, but I tried to do something different. That pushes me on."I'm still enjoying my education and still have something to give back."Frank is in the second year of a degree in criminology and criminal justice. He counsels and mentors others who have been involved in crime and has worked with the police on tackling gang culture.But in 2004 he was facing his longest prison stretch ever - four years for smuggling cocaine from Amsterdam - after what he says was a "lifetime of crime"."I knew I'd be coming out, that I needed to do something, to make a change instead of hanging around with people," he said."I found I enjoyed learning. I had been interested before in lots of things but never had the kind of environment for it to be cool to learn."In prison, he did basic skills lessons before getting A-grades in GCSE English and maths."People saying well done, that inspired me to say I enjoyed doing this education and it was positive. I saw I could change my life, learning and achieving things. I saw education as a way out and that it could be the key to set me free."After leaving jail, Frank says he was very tempted to go back to his old way of life but instead decided to stay in touch with a charity that had supported him inside - the Prisoners' Education Trust - and the St Giles Trust."Normally, I was getting picked up by one of my friends [when I got out of jail], and before I got back to London, I would be stoned and wouldn't get home for two days."The crucial thing this time was there was link. This group had offices you can get in touch with when you get out."Frank says he was on the verge of getting involved with crime again when, he says: "Something told me, 'Don't take the left path, take a right,' and instead, I went down to the offices."He went on take a qualification in counselling to help homeless and vulnerable people and to work for the charity Turning Point.He now counsels others, he says, "to try to stop them taking my path".Like many people in Britain's jails, Frank did badly at school. He had no academic qualifications before studying in prison in his 40s.Expelled at 12, he says he was "delinquent" for 18 months, before being sent to a reform "boarding school", where he says there was no proper teaching."The classroom was a work room and the teachers - who were really PE teachers - used to say, 'Finish that English off, then you can finish making your chair.'"Boys would be banging about while others were doing written work."Frank says things then went further downhill."I'd come home every two weeks - my family would not know me, I had no friends. I'd go around by myself and began breaking in to cars, doing rubbish stuff because I was lonely, bored."Shortly after that, Frank says, he began to get custodial sentences for theft and fraud and "that was it for 30 years".He says he was never involved with violent or sexual crimes, but witnessed violence."People were getting shot in a car next to me; people getting stabbed, but I never picked up a knife in anger. I was smoking crack but I always felt I was on the outside looking in; like I was not meant to be there."Now I know that reason was to say to young men and women, 'You don't have to go that way - it's such a waste.' I'm here to tell that story."If you find yourself on the that road, if you are in prison, there's a way out and it's education."Now I'm a proper father, a proper son, a proper grandfather. I'm stable and I have a family that's stable."</body>

      <title>Do you really need to drink eight cups of water a day?</title>
      <description>Do you really need to drink eight cups of water a day?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24464774</url>
      <date>1381393552</date>
      <body>Drinking eight cups or two litres of water a day is longstanding advice. But is there any scientific basis for it, asks Dr Chris van Tulleken.You know those ads that remind us that even a small drop in hydration levels can massively affect performance so you need to keep hydrated with whatever brand of isotonic super drink they're selling?They seem pretty scientific don't they? Man in white coat, athlete with electrodes attached and so on. And it's not a hard sell because drinking feels right - you're hot and sweating so surely replacing that fluid must be beneficial.Well earlier this year sports scientists in Australia did an extraordinary experiment that had never been done before (British Journal of Sports Medicine, September 2013, Current hydration guidelines are erroneous: dehydration does not impair exercise performance in the heat, Wall BA).This group wanted to find out what happened to performance after dehydration. So they took a group of cyclists and exercised them until they lost 3% of their total body weight in sweat.Then their performance was assessed after rehydration with either 1) nothing, 2) enough water to bring them back to 2% dehydration or 3) after full rehydration.So far nothing unusual, but the difference between this and almost every other study that's ever been done on hydration was that the cyclists were blind to how much water they got. The fluid was given intravenously without them knowing the volume.This is vital because we all, and especially athletes, have such an intimate psychological relationship with water consumption.Remarkably, there was no performance difference between those that were fully rehydrated and those that got nothing. This study was part of a growing movement to "drink to thirst" which hopes to persuade athletes not to over hydrate with the potentially fatal consequence of diluting your sodium level, causing hyponatraemia.Perhaps the result shouldn't be so surprising. Humans evolved doing intense exercise in extreme heat and dryness. We are able to tolerate losses in water relatively well whereas even slight over hydration can be far more dangerous. In simple terms, being too watery is as bad for you as being too concentrated.But what about the rest of us who aren't cycling around the desert in Western Australia?There is a very well accepted idea that we should drink about eight cups of water per day (two to three litres) in addition to our food and other drinks.We are awash with positive messages about the healing properties of water and how it will improve everything from our brains to our bowels. And we know that without it we will die in days.It's a short leap of logic to think that if a lack of water is bad for for you then hydration must be good - purifying, cleansing water washing through your organs must be beneficial, detoxifying. It surely improves your skin, helps you think, reduces your risk of kidney stones and turns your urine a lovely light, straw/champagne colour rather than the fetid orange syrup you produce at the end of a long day where you haven't had time to drink.So I've looked through the literature and I found a review article saying all of this and more. It was written by a group of respected physicians from American and French hospitals and it clearly supported the widely held belief that you should drink two to three litres of water a day.It said that people with a high urine output have a lower rate of kidney stone disease, that the flushing action of the water may reduce the risk of a urinary tract infection (especially in women after sex). Perhaps most importantly, they referenced a surprising study which showed that paradoxically an increased intake of water increased the risk of bladder cancer. But only tap water. And there's the clue.A footnote at the end of the article explained that what you thought was a scientific article in a scientific journal is in fact a supplement, sponsored by a major mineral water manufacturer. All of the authors received honoraria from this company, which also provided medical writing assistance. So this isn't research, it's marketing.And this is one of the reasons we're even discussing this - because increasingly drinking water doesn't just come out of our taps for free. It's sold to us by the same clever people that sell us yoghurts with bacteria in them that probably don't do us much good, something I look at separately in the television series I've been making. And these companies pretty consistently recommend two to three litres of water per day.So where did that number come from and is there any reason to think it correct?Well the grain of truth is this - people in temperate climates who are not doing sustained physical exercise do need around six to eight cups per day but that can be contained in food, alcohol or caffeinated beverages.Yes, beer and coffee do not dehydrate you to any noticeable extent (there's a nice paper where some medical students got to drink quite a lot of beer and had their urine studied - British Medical Journal (Clin Res Ed), December 1982, Acute biochemical responses to moderate beer drinking, Gill GV).There is no evidence that adding the eight cups of water to everything else you drink will do you any good and it could do you harm (American Journal of Physiological - Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology, November 2002, Drink at least eight glasses of water a day. Really? Is there scientific evidence for "8x8"? Valtin H).But the great thing is that just like a top-level athlete you don't need to worry about exactly what that total daily requirement is because your body will sort it all out for you.If you drink too much you pee it out. If you drink too little you get thirsty and pee less. It's all exquisitely well-controlled in the same way that your intake of oxygen is well-controlled.Saying that you should drink more water than your body asks for is like saying that you should consciously breathe more often than you feel like because if a little oxygen is good for you then more must be better.Like most things in life there's a Goldilocks amount - not too little and not too much. With this in mind, next week I'll deal with the health benefits of porridge and how to avoid being eaten by bears.Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on FacebookTrust Me I'm a Doctor is broadcast on 10 October on BBC Two at 20:00 BST, or catch up with iPlayer</body>

      <title>Is altruism self-interest in disguise?</title>
      <description>Does it matter why we help others?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24457645</url>
      <date>1381360309</date>
      <body>Is altruism simply self-interest in disguise? And can a mathematical equation hope to answer the question?In 1968, an academic almost unknown in the UK walked into University College London and presented its staff with an equation so remarkable, that they offered him an honorary position and the keys to his own office.His name was George Price, and his equation addressed a problem that has vexed scientists since Charles Darwin published On The Origin of Species more than a century earlier. If we are selfish creatures, engaged in a battle for survival, why do we display altruism? Why do we show kindness to others even at a cost to ourselves?Price's equation explained how altruism could thrive, even amongst groups of selfish people.It built on the work of a number of other scientists, arguably beginning with JBS Haldane, a British biologist who developed a theory in the early 1950s. When asked if he would sacrifice his own life to save that of another, he said that he would, but only under certain conditions. "I would lay down my life for two brothers, or eight cousins."Haldane's reasoning was a simplistic explanation of a theory that has come to dominate evolutionary biology - that of "kin selection".Since he would share 50% of each brother's genetic makeup, and 12.5% of each cousin's, his genes would survive even if he were to die.It took until the early 1960s for another scientist, William Donald Hamilton, to popularise the theory. He wrote a simple equation to explain that an organism would demonstrate self-sacrificing behaviour if it would enhance the reproductive chances of those it was closely related to.In 1967 Price arrived in London from the United States, where he had been a scientist and journalist, but with no background in the field of evolutionary biology.He discovered Hamilton's theory in a public library and thought he could improve upon it. Working in seclusion, he rewrote the equation in a simpler but more wide-reaching way. It explained the relationship between different generations of a population, and could be used to show how the prevalence of particular traits would change over time.Although it was a fairly simple statement, it had never been expressed in clear mathematical terms, and the staff at the University College London recognised his insight as wildly original.A debate about the scientific roots of altruism still rages to this day, but kin selection remains a hugely influential theory, and Price's contribution is held in high regard by many."It underpins a lot of modern evolutionary biology research," says Andy Gardner, an evolutionary biologist at Oxford University, who uses the Price Equation in much of his work.Oren Harman, who wrote Price's biography in 2010, says the view is shared by plenty of people in the field."Although there are those who fail to see the precise use of the equation, others think of it as the most simple and brilliant description of the dynamics of natural selection."But Price began to find the implications of his work very difficult to deal with, according to Harman. If altruism was simply an attempt to ensure the survival of one's own genes, could it be considered altruism at all?Lee Dugatkin, professor of Biology at the University of Louisville, thinks it was this thought that triggered a major change in Price. "That was what got him going," he says. "He was so depressed when he found out that Hamilton was right."In the summer of 1970, Price became a devout Christian and embarked on a radical project - giving himself over to the service of others."He was going to go out to try and show that human beings are the only species that can beat out their own nature. And he was going to do that by becoming a pure selfless altruist," says Harman.Price began giving money to homeless people, and invited many of them to live with him in his flat near Oxford Circus. His increasingly erratic behaviour left him penniless. He left his flat and eventually moved into a squat in Kentish Town.It is not universally agreed that Price's equation triggered his downfall - he was undoubtedly suffering from some form of mental illness as well. And in the winter of 1975, Price took his own life.For Harman, the two are inextricably linked. "I think the fact that George killed himself due to his interpretation of the equation really focuses the problem to the utmost degree."Price's story is laced with tragedy, but need his scientific work imply a dark, depressing view of human nature?Samir Okasha, professor of the philosophy of science at Bristol University, thinks not. "The idea that what evolutionary theory shows is that altruism is self-interest in disguise is, to my mind, a questionable thing to say."Behaviour in some animal species is indeed genetically determined, he says, but with humans "that certainly isn't the case". He argues that culture sets us apart from animals in that respect, and points to the huge variance in social norms in different countries, and over short periods of time."We have seen rather dramatic change over, say, a 300-year period, which cannot be explained by genetics," he says.Harman also disagrees with Price's interpretation of his own work. "It is not a necessary logical conclusion. It was his own conclusion, the conclusion of a troubled mind, but it's what led him to a terrible realisation that there is no true kindness in the world."If we want to understand behaviour, biology is part of it - it has to be by definition. But that's never an entire and complete explanation for the complexity and grandeur of the human condition."Gardner thinks it is always possible to think of people as attempting to protect and reproduce their own genetic material. "But that's not necessarily always selfish," he says. "There's room for altruism in that logic."Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <description>Should France follow the UK on weekend trading?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24458571</url>
      <date>1381401662</date>
      <body>Almost twenty years ago, a bitter war was fought over the future of Britain's Sundays - and today France is mired in a similar battle. But how has shopping on a Sunday re-shaped British society and do the French really have anything to fear?In November 1993, protesters from across much of the UK (although not Scotland) were confident they could keep big shops closed on Sundays.Outside Parliament they raised placards reading "Don't give in to supermarket greed" and "No government can change the laws of God".Things always appeared very different across the Channel. The French had always seemed to grasp the notion of work-life balance - in British imagination at least, reserving their weekends for red wine and serene lunches.Not everybody in the UK shared that desire for a day of rest, however. "About 50 years ago Sundays were completely dead," says Joe Moran, a cultural historian.Once, pubs had to close between 3-7pm on a Sunday, and theatres and cinemas were closed altogether. Those rules were steadily relaxed in the years that intervened, but by the early 90s most shops were still banned from trading on Sundays.Michael Schluter, founder of the Keep Sunday Special campaign, wanted to keep it that way, and lobbied MPs to support his movement. In December 1993, a vote in the House of Commons saw Schluter's vision defeated by just 18 votes. The following year all restrictions were removed from small shops, and those "over 280 square meters" in size were allowed to trade for six hours each Sunday.Today you only need to stand in a DIY superstore in a desolate retail park on a Sunday morning to see how things have changed. Customers gather in the store in the half-hour "browsing time" before the tills open, glancing over expectantly, ready to pounce. Their day is built around a visit to a big shop."It's fairly obvious that Sunday is a huge trading day in this country in spite of the fact that it's limited to six hours," says Richard Perks of market research firm Mintel.The British Retail Consortium says it is second only to Saturday for footfall and total sales - and is the biggest day in terms of hourly sales, as customers try to squeeze their shopping into the six hour window.While the UK has opened its shops on Sunday since 1994, the French have managed to keep most of theirs closed.It's easy to conjure up a vision of a stereotypical French Sunday and imagine families hiking through the Fontainebleau forest, cycling to the Bois de Boulogne park, or rounding off their poulet roti with a freshly baked tarte aux fraises.But now 20 years after the British battle was settled, a similar quarrel is bubbling in France, where different groups of workers take to the streets of Paris to argue both sides of the case. Its tangled web of regulations has been dubbed a "millefeuille" by the press - after the intricate, multi-layered, French pastry of the same name.Shops in designated tourist zones can open, as can garden centres and small owner-operated shops. Those selling food are permitted half a day's trading. For the most part, though, major retailers are forced to close all day, which has angered many business leaders, and some of their workers too.Castorama and Leroy Merlin - two major French DIY chains - have chosen to defy the ban, opening their doors to shoppers on the day of rest, and their employees have backed them. They have held "Yes Weekend" demonstrations to argue for their right to work.In the UK, there seems to be a particular link between Sunday leisure and home improvement.On a typical British Sunday, streams of family cars wait patiently for a space beneath IKEA's blue and yellow facade, trundling out hours later with open boots tied down by rope.It isn't just shopping that has turned Sundays upside down. The proliferation of televised sport has also contributed to a steady erosion of the distinction between the first and second days of the weekend. Schluter is convinced that the UK has lost something along the way, however.Besides small shops that have suffered from increased competition, family ties have been damaged too, he says. "There's a psychological shift which is hard to pin down or measure… towards an attitude that is less about the value of people and relationships and more about material goods."But the example of the British reforms is an inspiration to some French campaigners. Jerome Dubus of MEDEF, a consortium of French business leaders, says that reforms are overdue. "We are one of the last countries that haven't allowed Sunday work, we are behind as usual. I was a student in England 30 years ago. On Sundays everything was closed, there was nothing going on, we didn't know what to do, and the English were attached to it. But now it has changed a lot."Of course, the unions disagree. Christophe Le Comte, of Force Ouvriere, says that the move is just another example of employers trying to exploit their staff. "They are increasing the length of the working day, they are pushing back the age of retirement," he says. Le Comte bemoans the lack of employment protection in the UK and says Sunday trading had "disastrous consequences" for small businesses in the UK.Some change looks likely. The French government has now commissioned a review into the regulations, but whether it will endorse wholesale reform or add more layers to the pastry is difficult to know.Anne-Elisabeth Moutet, a French columnist for the British Daily Telegraph, thinks the unions are projecting a romantic notion of life in the country that is essentially a fiction."They describe a kind of idealised France of the 1950s in which everybody has got 2.3 children, and a dog, and a little house, and the children organise Sunday lunch for all members of the family."But half the households in large cities are single person households… so what they're describing is something that doesn't exist anymore."Trish Deseine, a food writer in Paris, has a very different outlook, and the city she describes will still sound appealing to the UK's Keep Sunday Special campaigners, who are still campaigning."If you walk by Montparnasse, you will see big family reunions in the restaurants," she says. "There is a definite distinction between Sunday and the rest of the week. There is a sense of occasion. It is quieter and more family oriented. I really hope it stays this way."She does not think the restrictions can last forever, but seems determined that change should at least be delayed."Eventually France will have to come around. The French are dragging their heels into a modern way of life, but I think it is a good thing that we are standing against it."Should France follow the UK and allow shops to open on Sundays? How has shopping on a Sunday re-shaped British society? Do the French really have anything to fear?Comment using the form below, on Facebook or on Twitter.</body>

      <description>Papers react to Royal Mail sell-off</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24470827</url>
      <date>1381379751</date>
      <body>The Guardian's main story is what it calls "the great mail sale" - for the paper the news that shares in Royal Mail are more than seven times oversubscribed is fuelling criticism that the price is too low and "reviving privatisation fever last seen in the 1980s".According to the Daily Mail, the political sensitivity of what it calls "the stampede" for shares means the final decision on who gets them could be taken by the prime minister.The Daily Telegraph sees it as the latest sign that British politics as a whole "has a ring of the 80s".The sale of Royal Mail is reviving hopes of a return to popular capitalism - something it believes should be embraced, though with some caution as well as optimism, it says.For the Daily Mirror, though, it is a case of "wealth lost in the post" - it accuses the government of short-changing taxpayers and "asset-stripping a part of our lives".The Independent leads with what it calls the landmark British study into potential treatments for Alzheimer's and other brain disorders.For the paper's health reporter, Charlie Cooper, while nothing is certain yet, "when leading lights in the field speak of possible 'turning points' and 'history' it is worth sitting up and paying attention".According to the Times, the findings are seen as a powerful challenge to conventional approaches to treating Alzheimer's, with independent observers reacting with excitement to the researchers' claims that a cure could now be "within reach".The Sun gives a broad welcome to what it calls the government's flagship Immigration Bill, which it says "finally backs up the talk of cracking down on those who live here illegally", but says it is a major disappointment for campaigners that plans to restrict GP care have been "ditched".For the Daily Telegraph, the legislation is "the government's response to the rise of the UK Independence Party and growing unease about immigration".But the Independent argues that a new survey shows the public are sceptical of the need for new rules."Maddy cops e-fit breakthrough" is the front page headline for the Daily Mirror which says British police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann are ready to release an image of a new suspect.It is also the lead story for the Daily Express which says detectives plan to release the picture in the next few days as part of a major appeal on the BBC's Crimewatch programme.Finally, the story of what the Daily Telegraph calls a "rookie pensioner's emergency night landing" appeals to almost all the papers."Hero? I was just holding the joystick" is the Daily Mail's headline, quoting John Wildey who landed a light aircraft at Humberside airport at the end of what it calls "70 minutes of terror" after the pilot collapsed.For readers wishing to prepare for similar emergences, many of the articles include handily labelled pictures of an instrument panel - and there is even a "how to land a plane" guide in the Independent.For the Daily Mirror, the tale of the man it calls a modest hero is "a soaring reminder that pensioners can reach for the skies".</body>

      <body>The owners of Wales' largest mine are filing for administration, it has been confirmed.The future of the Unity Mine, a drift mine near Neath, has been uncertain in recent months after management said they only had work for 66 of 220 staff.Richard Nugent, director with Unity Mine Limited, said the company had been "forced into the process of filing for administration".He added the workforce would be maintained until further notice."Unfortunately the Unity Group of Companies have been forced into the process of filing for administration whilst discussions continue about the future direction of the mine," he said."Fundraising negotiations are continuing with various parties and the current workforce will be maintained until further notice."Neath MP Peter Hain said the situation was "deeply worrying, especially for the workforce and their families".He added that he understood that discussions are taking place "imminently", with management at the mine "hopeful" that funding can be found to save the site."I am disappointed that recent discussions on grant aid did not succeed and I hope that these can be resurrected," he said.Mr Hain added outstanding planning and licensing problems had to be resolved as they were putting off investors."Unity remains a vital and exciting project and everyone must do everything to ensure it can both be saved and can move forward because not only 250 existing jobs are at stake but potentially many more too," he said.In recent months, workers at Unity Mine were told there was not enough work for everyone.Staff offered to share shifts between all of the workers which meant they got on average a quarter of their previous pay.It was seen as a way that could safeguard the pit's future.At the time The National Union of Miners (NUM) said it was not an ideal solution but it would provide a "breathing space".But bosses at the mine were unable to remedy the situation and have filed for administration.Gwenda Thomas, the assembly member for Neath, described the announcement that the mine had gone into administration as "extremely regrettable"."I sincerely hope that the administrators can find new owners for the mine, and preserve the miners' jobs and the future of the apprentices," she said.Welsh government officials are continuing to hold with the mine's management.Meanwhile, Tyrone O'Sullivan, chairman of Tower Colliery in the Cynon Valley, said: "It's difficult for me to comment further because a number of ex-Tower employees are working there and we are a rival company."But it's a tragedy that in a country that burned 61 million tonnes of coal last year that we are allowing mines to close."In September 2012 the BBC reported 94% of all Welsh coal came from opencast sites, the remainder from drift mines.The vast majority work was at two pits in the Neath Valley at Unity and Aberpergwm which is currently closed.Unity Mine opened in 2007 with reserves of up to 90 million tonnes of coal.It is a drift mine, which means that miners can walk into it from the surface rather than having to be transported down to the coal seams via a lift in a shaft.</body>

      <body>Figures show another significant rise in the number of patients who have had to wait more than nine months to start hospital treatment.More than 13,000 had been waiting over 36 weeks in August, a rise of over 2,000 in one month.The Welsh government's own target is for no-one to wait that long.The Welsh Conservatives have written to the first minister calling on him to personally intervene to deal with what they called "an escalating crisis".Darren Millar, the party's shadow minister for health, told Carwyn Jones the situation needed "immediate priority".He said: "I hope you will agree that patients across Wales - particularly the elderly and vulnerable - should not be faced with such long waits."Meanwhile, Kirsty Williams, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said the figures were a "national disgrace"."Why must patients in Wales have to put up with such an inferior service when compared to the rest of the UK?" she said."Years of Welsh Labour incompetence has led to thousands of people having to wait an awful long time until the start of their treatment."No one should have to wait this long, but it's particularly dreadful to think of the large amount of elderly people that are being forced to wait months on end."On Tuesday, it was announced that the Welsh NHS would be given £570m of extra funding over three years during the Welsh government's draft budget.Finance Minister Jane Hutt said the extra money would help the NHS in Wales to avoid a scandal such as the one in Stafford Hospital, where hundreds of patients died as a result of neglect and abuse.The Welsh government is expected to comment on the figures later.</body>

      <body>Hundreds of jobs will be cut at Carmarthenshire council as a result of the Welsh government's draft budget, its leader has said.At a council meeting on Thursday, Kevin Madge announced "many hundreds" of jobs would go as the authority would have to make savings of £30m.Offers of redundancy or early retirement have been made to staff.The Welsh government said it had cushioned the impact of UK government cuts in the past three years.But this week, Finance Minister Jane Hutt announced funding for local government would be cut by almost 6% next year.Local government spending will fall from £4.648bn this year to £4.466bn next year, a cut in cash terms of 3.91% or 5.81% in real terms.Ms Hutt stressed the priority was to protect health, schools and universal benefits such as free prescriptions, school breakfasts and bus passes for older people.Mr Madge warned on Thursday of extremely tough times ahead.In a statement, he said: "This is an unprecedented situation, and it means we are faced with making some very difficult and unpopular decisions."People will have to brace themselves - but I want to assure everyone that we will do our very best to protect frontline services, and continue to provide as many services as we can whilst avoiding compulsory redundancies wherever possible."He also appealed for "some understanding" from ministers on the "extraordinarily difficult times ahead" for councils.The Welsh government said in a statement that over the past three years it had been able to cushion local authorities from "the impact of relentless cuts to our budget from the UK government"."We have shaped our budget to focus on our core values of social justice and protecting the most vulnerable. We have made some tough decisions between areas as well as within programmes," said a spokesperson."We are looking at ways to work alongside and support authorities to manage the reductions to their funding, and the minister for local government and government business will announce full details of the local government settlement next week."The only way to confront these financial challenges and sustain local public services is to do different things. Councils need to strive for transformational change to manage the difficult times ahead."</body>

      <body>The mother of a murdered backpacker has urged the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to do more to help families whose relatives are killed abroad.Kirsty Jones, 23, from Tredomen, near Brecon, Powys was raped and strangled in Thailand in 2000.Sue Jones is annoyed she has had no response to a Freedom of Information request to have murder investigation files released.The FCO said it would meet any family concerned about a death overseas.Mrs Jones supported a protest by about 20 families, in a similar situation to her, outside the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London on Wednesday.She said she had been trying to persuade the Foreign Office to release documents relating to her daughter's murder for six months, but UK government officials had claimed the information could harm diplomatic relations or prejudice a future court case."As far as I'm concerned communication is their (the Foreign Office's) biggest problem," said Mrs Jones."They can only do as much as they're allowed to do but claiming that these documents could damage diplomatic relations is ridiculous."All we want to know is what happened and we want justice."Mrs Jones was unable to attend the protest in person.But she said: "I supported what the other families were doing in London yesterday. Some of those families don't even know the circumstances of their relatives' deaths."She added: "I don't know if the documents I've asked to be released are crucial or if they hold something that we already know about.'Incredibly difficult time'"I think sometimes the Foreign Office and the (UK) government could push a little bit more with their counterparts abroad. They must understand that all we want is closure."Kirsty Jones, a Liverpool University graduate, was killed in Chiang Ma in northern Thailand just three months into a two-year trip around the world in August, 2000.Since then, Mrs Jones has worked tirelessly to try to bring her daughter's murderer is brought to justice, even travelling to Thailand with Welsh police last year to publicise a £10,000 reward for information.But, despite numerous appeals, her daughter's killer has never been found.In response, the FCO said in a statement: "The FCO will meet with any family who is concerned about the death of a loved one overseas."This is an incredibly difficult time for any family and the FCO has teams of trained professionals in the UK and across the world ready to offer support."Every year, over 6,000 British nationals die overseas, and the FCO offers to provide consular support to every single family in conjunction with a range of partners including the police and coroner services.It added: "However, investigation of the death of any British national is a matter for the judicial process of the country they died in, and we must respect their systems just as we expect them to respect the UK's laws and legal processes."</body>

      <body>Detectives investigating historic sex abuse at children's homes in north Wales have arrested a man on suspicion of child cruelty and indecent assault.Officers attached to Operation Pallial - the investigation being run by the National Crime Agency (NCA) - arrested a 52-year-old from Mold, Flintshire.The offences, against four boys and one girl, are alleged to have taken place between 1981 and 1988, when they were aged 13 or 14 years old.The man was arrested in Merseyside.He has been taken to a police station to be interviewed in the St Helens area, close to where he was apprehended on Thursday morning.The arrest is the eleventh to date in relation to Operation Pallial, an investigation led by NCA Director General Keith Bristow into recent allegations of historic abuse in the care system in north Wales.It was launched last November to look at allegations relating to 18 care homes between 1963 and 1992.One person has so far been charged with a large number of serious sexual offences.</body>

      <body>Winter flights to skiing destinations are returning to Cardiff Airport after a three-year absence.Airline Flybe said the four direct routes to Chambery, Grenoble and Lyon in France and Geneva in Switzerland were positive news for Wales.The Exeter-based company said the flights would start operating from Cardiff on 21 December.Cardiff Airport was bought by the Welsh government for £52m in March after a slump in passenger numbers.The figures had fallen from a peak of two million in 2007 to just over one million in 2012.Flybe's four new routes will take the total it operates from Cardiff to nine.The company's marketing director Simon Lilley said: "We see these new routes as a natural addition to our network out of Cardiff Airport and are confident that these attractive winter destinations can only be positive news for Wales."Cardiff Airport's chief executive Jon Horne said the news heralded the return of ski destinations after an absence of three years."We have been working closely with Flybe as part of our strategy to bring back a greater choice of flights and destinations to Cardiff Airport and we look forward to exploring further opportunities in this regard," he said.Economy and Transport Minister Edwina Hart said that with recent improvements to the airport's terminal and public transport links, Cardiff now offered a "much improved service to passengers".</body>

      <title>Cardiff deny asking Mackay to resign</title>
      <description>Cardiff City deny they asked manager Malky Mackay to resign in the wake of suspending the club's head of recruitment.</description>

      <date>1381398170</date>
      <body>Cardiff City have denied reports they asked manager Malky Mackay to resign, BBC Wales Sport understands.Mackay is believed to have been left shocked and angered by Cardiff's recent decision to suspend his right-hand man but is not prepared to quit.The Premier League club have suspended head of recruitment Iain Moody and brought in 23-year-old Alisher Apsalyamov as his acting replacement.They have yet to comment about the suspension of Moody.In his scouting role, former Watford press officer Moody helped the Premier League newcomers sign summer recruits including Gary Medel from Sevilla and Steven Caulker from Tottenham.Apsalyamov is not believed to have any experience in football and his appointment is the latest controversy in the reign of owner Vincent Tan.Tan caused consternation among many Cardiff fans during the summer of 2012 after changing the club's colours from blue to red, while there have been reports of dressing-room unrest over bonuses.Cardiff City Supporters' Trust chairman Tim Hartley said recent developments and the appointment of Apsalyamov were of concern.He was worried about the impact it would have on Mackay's position and said the club needed to issue an official statement."Fans want Malky Mackay - who has done a fantastic job as manager, taking the club to the Premier League - to remain at Cardiff City," Hartley said."We don't want to see any action taken to undermine his position as manager and Cardiff City's efforts to have a successful first season in the top division."There are fears that the current developments could drive Malky into the arms of another Premier League club and that would be hugely damaging for the Bluebirds."Malky is a talented manager who has huge respect among the fans for what he has delivered."Fans deserve a clear statement on the position from the club on what has been happening and Malky's position needs to be made perfectly clear."Former England boss Graham Taylor, meanwhile, says he is bemused by recent developments."It is a very, very strange situation," said Taylor, who was Watford chairman and worked with Mackay and Moody at Vicarage Road."I cannot believe... the decision to replace Iain. I just cannot believe it."Whether your owner, chairman has kept you informed of all this, I cannot say. Only Malky will know that. From a distance it is very, very surprising.""I think there is a distinct possibility of [Mackay leaving]."On the face of it, if you are the manager of all things football... you are being usurped.""It will be interesting to see what Malky's reaction is. I do hope this doesn't have an adverse reaction on the team's performance and results."He is the manager and he has just got the club into the Premier League after such a long time out of it."I don't think you will see any public tantrums from Malky or anything like that [but] I know he will be extremely upset and very disappointed."Taylor says Mackay left Watford for Cardiff because of problems with the owner at Vicarage Road."Watford had problems with their owner as well," he said."It will be very interesting to see how he reacts because I honestly believe if Malky were to leave, it wouldn't be too long before he has another job somewhere else."</body>

      <body>Technology usually associated with Hollywood blockbusters is being used to help tackle arthritis.A virtual reality centre - believed to be the first of its kind in the UK - has been set up at Cardiff University with equipment used to create special effects in films.The £500,000 investment includes cameras, a cinema screen and computers to monitor how joints are moving.More than 10 million UK adults seek help for arthritis each year.It can lead to pain, disability, joint damage and reduced quality of life and treatment can include drugs, physical therapies and surgery.It is hoped the new technology will help arthritis patients and people who suffer from other limb disorders by allowing experts to examine their movement.Researchers are currently studying a group of patients with knee injuries who are each fitted with infra red sensors - similar to ones used to create special effects - before taking to the treadmill.As they take part in various exercises the researchers are then able to build a digital picture of the way each patient's joints are performing.Insights from the project are being used to help develop new rehabilitation tools to ease knee joint problems.The suite puts Wales at the forefront of research into arthritis, according to Dr Paulien Roos, academic fellow at Cardiff University's Biomechanics and Bioengineering Centre."It's an excellent tool that really helps to move our research forward."Normally it would take us days or even years to calculate the measurements this tool allows us to gather."We can now get that information immediately so we can give real time feedback to patients."We can tell patients how they can improve their movement and hopefully alleviate future joint problems."One of the patients taking part in the research was Liz Evans from Newport who badly damaged her knee in a skiing accident."I was made very aware that I was going to be vulnerable to getting osteoarthritis in years to come," she said."I don't want that to hit me. I'm keen to do whatever I can to help the researchers find out more about the causes and ways of postponing the onset of arthritis."It's helped me to understand the mechanics of my injury and it's also enjoyable to use."I think that there's a wealth of knowledge that can be gained by doing all those measures and getting a greater understanding of human movement."The project is supported by Arthritis Research UK, which funds one of the researchers.The charity's regional fundraising manager for south and mid Wales, Anna-Marie Jones, said it could lead to a breakthrough."One in six in the UK suffer with arthritis and that affects the young as well as the old," she said."There are actually 15,000 children in the UK that have arthritis."By putting our funds into work like this we certainly will become nearer to finding a cure for arthritis."</body>

      <body>Candidates have been put off applying for the vacant police chief constable job at Gwent Police because of the actions of its police and crime commissioner, a senior MP has claimed.Carmel Napier quit in June after an order from commissioner (PCC) Ian Johnston to "retire or be removed".Her deputy Jeff Farrar was the only applicant to replace her and is the "proposed candidate" for the top job.Caerphilly MP Wayne David said just one applicant was "disappointing'.The Gwent Police and Crime Panel will have to confirm the appointment which comes with a £133,068 a year salary.But Mr David, the parliamentary private secretary to Labour leader Ed Miliband, said he was not surprised more people did not go for the job.He told Radio Wales: "I was very disappointed because I was very much hoping there would be a wide field and the choice would be made from that wide field."Although an excellent chief constable has been selected in Jeff Farrar, who I know and hold in very high regard, it's nevertheless disappointing there wasn't a bigger field."I think you have to look at what's happened over the last few months in Gwent."Mr David said the way in which Mrs Napier was dealt with indicated that the commissioner had expected her to "basically kowtow" to him.He added: "I would imagine that many aspiring senior police officers in the county have seen what happened in Gwent and thought 'right, we're not going to be in that situation'."I think what's happened in Gwent - and inevitably the buck stops with him as the PCC - is one of the main reasons, probably the primary reason why there were not more applications."Mr Farrar, who has served as a police officer for 29 years, joined Gwent Police from neighbouring South Wales Police in 2009 having been appointed as assistant chief constable.He was then promoted to deputy chief constable in April 2011. He has been temporary chief constable since Mrs Napier's departure.Following an interview on Monday, Gwent Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Mr Johnston named Mr Farrar as his "proposed candidate", saying he was the "kind of leader Gwent Police needs at this time"."During the time I have worked with Jeff Farrar he has proved himself to be a highly competent and effective officer," he added.The decision will now be referred to the Gwent Police and Crime Panel - which oversees and scrutinises the PCC - on 8 November for it to confirm the appointment.Mr Johnston declined to comment on Mr David's remarks until after the confirmation hearing.A police watchdog said the forced departure Mrs Napier brought instability to Gwent Police at a critical time.HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said in July that the force faced a difficult challenge as the force has to save £23.5m by 2015.In July, Mrs Napier told MPs on the Home Affairs Committee that she was forced to resign following "menacing and bullying" treatment by the force's police commissioner.Mr Johnston denied the allegations and that the resignation had caused instability.</body>

      <title>SSE to raise energy prices by 8.2%</title>
      <description>A rise in electricity and gas prices is announced by energy firm SSE which is the parent company of Swalec.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24465979</url>
      <date>1381403372</date>
      <body>SSE customers will see an average 8.2% rise in gas and electricity prices from 15 November, the company has announced.The energy firm said the rise reflected higher costs of buying wholesale energy and paying to deliver it to customers' homes, plus government levies.The price rises will affect about 4.4 million electricity customers and 2.9 million gas customers, not including those on fixed-price tariffs.SSE's average annual dual-fuel energy bill will rise by £106 to £1,380.Business and Energy Minister Michael Fallon said he was "disappointed" by SSE's decision to increase energy prices.He told BBC Radio 5 live: "I would encourage all customers to look again at their tariffs and see whether they can switch to a cheaper tariff."He added the long-term answer to high energy bills was "more competition and encouraging consumers to shop around".Caroline Flint, shadow energy secretary, said: "When times are tough energy companies should be helping their customers not hitting them with more price rises to boost their profits."The company said that 8.2% was an average rise. Customers in the North of England and central Scotland would see the smallest increase, of 7%, in their dual fuel price. Customers in the South East of England would see the biggest, up 9.7%.SSE last increased its prices a year ago. It has now pledged not to raise them again before autumn 2014."We're sorry we have to do this," said SSE's Will Morris."We've done as much as we could to keep prices down, but the reality is that buying wholesale energy in global markets, delivering it to customers' homes, and government-imposed levies collected through bills - endorsed by all the major parties - all cost more than they did last year."SSE, made up of Southern Electric, Swalec and Scottish Hydro, said that for a typical dual-fuel customer, wholesale energy prices had gone up 4%, paying to use delivery networks was 10% more expensive, and government levies were 13% higher.About two-thirds of a household fuel bill goes on the cost of wholesale energy, the cost of running an energy sales business, and on the companies' profits.Up to 11% goes on government programmes to save energy, reduce emissions and tackle climate change, according to regulator Ofgem. SSE said it wanted this to be included in general taxation, rather than added to bills.However, Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: "Half of an average energy bill is made up of the wholesale cost of energy. This far outweighs the proportion of a bill that goes to help vulnerable households with their bills and to cut energy waste."The latest calculations from the regulator found that the average profit margin made by an energy supplier on an average £1,315 bill is £65.However, this figure can be volatile. The snapshot profit margin has risen above £100, but has also fallen to a negative figure at certain points in recent years.Profit levels prompted Labour leader Ed Miliband to declare that gas and electricity bills would not go up for 20 months if Labour won the 2015 election.Prime Minister David Cameron condemned the pledge as a "gimmick", saying the government was simplifying bills to make it easier for consumers to switch suppliers and encourage competition.SSE, formerly Scottish and Southern Energy, said it expected its annual profit margin to average about 5% over a three-to-five-year period, which it believed was "a fair amount".It said its profit margin was 4.2% in the 2012-13 financial year and was expected to fall short of the 5% target again this year."We know we will come in for a great deal of criticism for this decision and politicians will no doubt be lining up to condemn us," said SSE's Mr Morris."But over many years, policymakers themselves have failed to highlight adequately the cost to consumers of the policies they have pursued in government."They can't expect to have power stations replaced with new technologies, the network to be upgraded and nationwide energy efficiency schemes all to be funded for free."And as an energy provider, we are in the unenviable position of having to pass this cost on to consumers through energy bills."The announcement comes about a year after the last set of gas and electricity price rises.Between August and December 2012, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%.At that time, the companies blamed rising wholesale prices, the cost of transporting energy to homes, and the increasing cost of government social schemes for the increases.Advice line National Debtline said it had received a record 15,502 calls from people seeking help with energy debts in the first six months of this year. This was up 10% on last year.Adam Scorer, of watchdog Consumer Futures, said: "SSE and others who follow need to demonstrate why this rise is justified."</body>

      <body>Councils should introduce a voluntary ban on the release of sky lanterns and helium balloons on their land, says the Welsh government.It comes three months after ministers rejected banning them after a report said it could not be justified, but use would be discouraged.Natural Resources Minister Alun Davies has written to councils encouraging them to introduce the restrictions.There are worries the lanterns pose a fire risk and endanger livestock.Two environmental groups and the Farmers' Union of Wales (FUW) have called for an outright ban.Conwy council has already stopped people releasing sky lanterns and helium balloons on its land.Mr Davies warned of the danger and stress that sky lanterns could pose to animals and highlighted the fire risks."Sky lanterns and helium balloons pose a real danger to livestock, other animals and buildings," Mr Davies said."A recent independent report has found that the fire risk associated with the use of sky lanterns is significant, while we also know that the ingestion of debris from lanterns can kill or seriously harm an animal."We want to make people aware of the risks and that is why I have written to local authorities across Wales to encourage them to introduce a voluntary ban on the release of sky lanterns and helium balloons."We are also supporting the UK government's efforts to work with retailers and manufacturers to ensure that clear warnings about the risk of helium balloons and sky lanterns are placed on packaging."Farming unions have previously highlighted the risk the lanterns pose to animals and farm buildings, while fire service bosses have also warned of the dangers.FUW parliamentary committee chairman Gavin Williams welcomed Mr Davies's intervention, saying the UK government had "failed to act" on the issue.He said: "The risk of livestock ingesting parts of sky lanterns and the fire risk they represent are a huge concern, and we have asked members to continue to report incidents to their county branches so that evidence of their effects can continue to be collected."The Marine Conservation Society and Keep Wales Tidy have called for an outright ban.</body>

      <title>Salt firm lands £1.2m expansion cash</title>
      <description>A salt-making firm which claims TV chef Heston Blumenthal among its customers says it has secured £1.2m to expand and build a visitor centre.</description>

      <body>A salt-making firm which claims TV chef Heston Blumenthal among its customers says it has secured £1.2m to expand and build a visitor centre.Anglesey Sea Salt said the proposed salt plant would allow it to take on up to five staff and boost production.The firm has been using shipping containers and portable offices at Brynsiencyn for the past seven years.Its hand-made Halen Mon Pure White Sea Salt is exported to 15 countries and is also a Tesco Finest brand.Co-owner David Lea-Wilson said the firm had been working for a decade to replace the temporary structures used by its 17 staff to process the salt harvested from nearby mussel beds.He said the tipping point came with an award of just under £200,000 by the Coastal Communities Fund which had triggered an investment of more than £500,000 by himself and partner Alison Lea-Wilson.The firm has also been offered £100,000 through the Welsh government's economic growth fund with the aim of creating new jobs and safeguarding existing ones.In addition Anglesey council had "chipped in" £25,000, he said. Private sector sources accounted for the remainder.He said: "All the funding is in place now. We just need one more piece of the jigsaw, planning permission from Anglesey council."The firm already has full planning permission for the plant but amended planning permission for a visitor centre was applied for in June and will be decided later this year.Mr Lea-Wilson said production had been running at full capacity for the past few months. The firm produces around 500,000 containers of salt per year, ranging in size from a 3g sachet to a 25kg box.He said the company had around 6,000 visitors per year but was unable to accommodate them properly due to the nature of the food production process.The new building will have glass walls overlooking the production process and guided tours, he said.Last year the firm developed a new product, smoked water, at the request of Blumenthal, owner of the three-Michelin-starred Fat Duck restaurant in Berkshire.Orders for the product from Marks and Spencer had created two jobs at the site, Mr Lea-Wilson said.</body>

      <body>The body of a man found at a house on Anglesey had been there for a very long time, a coroner has said.Dewi Pritchard Jones, senior coroner for North West Wales, also said a woman living at the bungalow in the village of Llandegfan was being cared for in hospital.A post-mortem examination proved inconclusive, he said, and samples could take six weeks to analyse.North Wales Police said the death was not being treated as suspicious.The man's body was discovered on Saturday. The woman also living there is now being cared for at Ysbyty Gwynedd hospital in Bangor.Mr Pritchard Jones said neighbours had been "expressing concerns to the police and the police thought they had better take a look".He described the body as in a "very poor condition" but refused to speculate how long it may have been in the house.He stressed there was no evidence of a crime but added: "At present we've got no reason to suspect any foul play but we've got no reason to exclude anything either."Establishing the identity of the man beyond all doubt could prove impossible, he said, as the man they believe it to be had no children and no siblings from whom a DNA match might be found.Asked if it was thought the dead man was the husband of the woman living at the property, the coroner said: "We can't say it's the woman's husband's body - that would be a guess."He said three investigations were being carried out - a medical one, one by the police to try to establish who the man was, and a third "to try to establish what on earth was going on in that house"."We've got an awful lot of questions but very few answers," he said.</body>

      <title>£600m in major projects unveiled</title>
      <description>More than £600m is to be given to major projects - such as construction and roads - in a bid to stimulate the Welsh economy.</description>

      <body>More than £600m is to be handed out towards major projects in a bid to stimulate the economy in Wales.It includes £62m for the South Wales Metro transport project and £140m for a help-to-buy housing scheme.Finance Minister Jane Hutt says it will create or sustain 11,000 jobs and tackle poverty.The announcement comes a day after she unveiled big cuts for councils and in other areas to pay for a £570m increase in the health budget.Ms Hutt announced a series of capital spending commitments, including:Ms Hutt said: "The tough economic conditions continue but I am determined to use every pound available to invest in infrastructure and boost economic growth in the long-term."She said the new investment package, worth £617.5m, would "deliver real benefits across Wales," creating or supporting more than 11,000 jobs over the next two years."In addition to developing a range of innovative financing schemes to boost our capital investment, we will also take every opportunity to use European funding to maximise our investments in essential infrastructure that support growth and jobs across Wales," she added.There is also extra investment coming as a result of a budget deal announced on Tuesday between the Welsh Government, Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Liberal Democrats.This results in £15m being spent on a fund to help people with health issues live independently and free up hospital beds, while an extra £9.5m will provide robotic cancer treatment equipment and also on more telemedicine.Peter Black, Welsh Lib Dem finance spokesman welcomed the funding for Help to Buy but said it was essential the scheme was up and running as soon as possible."Only last week the housing minister was unable to provide even a launch date for this scheme - that, frankly, is not good enough," he said."This scheme already exists in England and I'm concerned that once again Welsh Labour government inaction is allowing Wales' housing market to be left behind."The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) gave its support to the capital spending announcements, but urged ministers to ensure transport improvements were spread evenly and not to focus too much attention on their aim of building an M4 relief road around Newport."Other parts of Wales need joined-up transport too, such as improvements west of Pont Abraham (the end of the M4 motorway) and support for the A470, making sure Wales is connected up and economic growth is across Wales," said Iestyn Davies from the FSB in Wales.However Emma Watkins, director of the employers' organisation CBI Wales, called on the UK government to give ministers in Cardiff the borrowing powers they were asking for as soon as possible, so the M4 relief road could be built, warning congestion was "strangling" the economy.She endorsed Ms Hutt's announcements but said it was simply not enough."We respect the fact that we're in challenging economic times and probably, given the settlement that they have, the announcement that's been made, over £600m for capital investment, is welcome," she said."But it's still a very small amount if we look at the bigger picture and what's needed to drive forward the economy and to help the infrastructure that we have here in Wales."</body>

      <body>Plans for a giant solar park with 180,000 electricity-generating panels are being drawn up for a site in Flintshire.Swansea-based Compton Group has earmarked 90 hectares (222 acres) next to Deeside Industrial Estate for the panels.The company says it could produce electricity for 11,000 homes annually.Compton Group is to hold a consultation later this month before submitting plans to Flintshire council.The proposed site is on land north of the A538 (Weighbridge Rd) close to Shotwick Lake Sailing Club.In January, Anglesey council granted permission for a solar park with 64,000 panels.Plans were agreed for a solar park on 28 hectares (70 acres) of land at Bodorgan Estate which was said to be the size of 28 football pitches.Pembrokeshire became the first council in Wales to grant planning permission for a solar farm at Rhos-y-Gilwen Mansion, in the north of the county, in January 2011.The project on a six-acre site was up and running and connected to the national grid within seven months.A Compton Group spokesman said: "Both the UK and Welsh governments have committed to significantly reducing CO2 emissions and solar parks are vital in meeting these targets and providing a sustainable source of renewable energy that reduces the reliance on fossil fuels."The developers are holding a drop-in session to provide details of the proposals at Quay Building, Fron Road, Connah's Quay, on Wednesday 23 October from 14:00 to 20:00 BST.</body>

      <body>An "important milestone" has been reached with the completion of work to protect an estate after floods claimed a life and affected 500 properties in a Denbighshire city last year.Workers have raised an embankment over 162 metres (531ft) long to protect homes on St Asaph's Roe Parc estate.Natural Resources Wales said more work is still needed around the tiny city.Work to clear potential blockages from a four mile (6.4km) section of the river Elwy is also under way.Tim Jones from Natural Resources Wales said: "While we can't prevent all flooding, there is a lot we can do to reduce the risk."The people of St Asaph know all too well the devastating impact that flooding can have and this is an important milestone in the journey to reduce flood risk for low-lying parts of the city."In July, a report into the flooding said about £5m is needed to improve flood defences in the area.About 500 homes were hit by floods and one person died when the Elwy river burst its banks last November.And a further 120 new build homes were affected by the floodwater at neighbouring Ruthin.</body>

      <title>20-year lake legal row continues</title>
      <description>A farmer loses the latest twist in a 20-year-long legal battle for planning permission for a large lake on his land in west Wales.</description>

      <body>A farmer has lost the latest twist in a 20-year-long legal battle for planning permission for a large lake.John Rogers built Bwlchyllan lake and embankment near Lampeter in 1991 without permission and Ceredigion council wanted the land restored due to safety fears.Mr Rogers has been fined twice by magistrates for ignoring an enforcement notice.Councillors refused to accept the lake had become part of the landscape.Following the vote councillors asked officers to put enforcement action in place to require Mr Rogers to remove an embankment which would in effect get rid of the lake.The lake is on sloping land and is about 180m (590ft) long and 80m (262 ft) at its widest point with a depth of 3.7m (12 ft).A retrospective planning application was refused in January this year because it again failed to demonstrate that the lake was safe.But it has since been deemed "as safe as can reasonably be expected," allowing planners to recommend approval of the plans.Despite the long legal history, councillors were asked to deal with this fresh application on its own merits.A planning report said the lake has now become part of the natural environment and landscape."Whether rightly or wrongly the lake has now been in existence since 1991, a period of over 20 years," says the report."As a result the site has been given the opportunity to develop naturally so it is surrounded by natural vegetation with reeds along the lake shore and on a small island in the centre of the lake."The embankment is now completely covered with mature vegetation which broadens densely on the lower reaches of the embankment."Meanwhile, structural engineers say because the lake and embankment have managed to survive significant flooding over the last 20 years, they should be considered stable.Councillors have also been told that there may be water voles at the lake and Natural Resources Wales wants an investigation to see if they do live there.But opponents are worried that the embankment is not safe and could give way at some point.Geoffrey Stubberfield, who lives near by, said: "We have concerns that the bank could be well unstable."Nobody saw how it was built. It's terribly dangerous. If there's a catastrophic collapse, it could mean lives."And Michael Jones, who also lives close to the lake, added: "There's evidence of weeping from it but it hasn't collapsed."</body>

      <body>A project to help restore a 200-year-old canal which crosses the Wales-England border has received £160,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF).Montgomery Canal Partnership wants to refurbish bridges, improve towpaths and reopen 2km of the canal, which runs between Powys and Shropshire.The money will enable Glandwr Cymru, the Canal and River Trust in Wales, to develop a larger bid of £3.7m from HLF.Glandwr Cymru said the project would help bring the waterway back to life.It said the scheme would also preserve rare natural habitats found along its course.The ultimate aim is to fully restore the entire 33-mile (53km) length of the canal as only parts of it are navigable by narrow boat.Glandwr Cymru chief executive Richard Parry said: "The Montgomery Canal is one of the most beautiful waterways in Britain."Whilst much of it can be enjoyed today, the goal of fully restoring it has been kept alive for decades by the tireless work of volunteers."We are delighted to be awarded this development funding. It is another big step towards the canal's full restoration and allows us to complete our application to the HLF for the full £3.7m grant."It follows a £1m investment to transform around 14 miles (23km) of the towpath between Newtown and Welshpool through a partnership between the Welsh government, Glandwr Cymru, Powys County Council and Sustrans.</body>

      <body>A controversial decision to turn the AandE service at Prince Philip Hospital in Llanelli into a nurse-led unit supported by GPs has been heavily criticised.Carmarthenshire councillors tabled a motion saying they "deplored" Health Minister Mark Drakeford's decision.It would increase pressure on Glangwili and Morriston hospitals, they said.The Welsh government said the minister had backed the decision of an independent panel of experts.Council leader Kevin Madge said: "I believe that the only way forward is to get the health minister down, and we will then negotiate and carry on the fight."We will continue making representations to the ministers. At the end of the day we have got to ensure that our services are safe."Campaigners in Llanelli have been given leave for a judicial review of the AandE changes at the hospital, but Mr Drakeford told AMs last month he would approve the plans.The judicial review is due to take place in November.The shake-up is one of several disputed changes to hospital services in west Wales proposed by Hywel Dda Health Board and referred to the minister.They include:In February the Community Health Council (CHC) said it could not support most of the proposals and referred them to the then Health Minister Lesley Griffiths for a decision.Ms Griffiths told the CHC in March that its referral did not satisfy Welsh government rules as it had not proposed alternatives.A month later, the CHC said it could not accept the health board's neonatal and AandE changes and referred those proposals for a second time to the Welsh government.Meanwhile, the CHC was able to "conditionally accept" the closure of the two minor injuries units and the closure of Mynydd Mawr hospital which are now being implemented.In response, the new health minister Mark Drakeford set up a scrutiny panel led by chief medical officer Dr Ruth Hussey to "consider these issues" and "examine all relevant documentation".The notice by Carmarthenshire councillors reads: "Carmarthenshire County Council deplores the decision to replace the level two AandE at Prince Philip Hospital with a nurse practitioner-led and GP-supported provision."We will continue to lobby the minister and the health board to review this decision to reduce resources and services at the hospital, and call for the level two AandE services to be preserved in its current configuration and where appropriate, enhanced."We would further request from the health minister a statement detailing the services available at our hospitals."A Welsh government spokesperson said: "The Health Minister, Mark Drakeford, backed the recommendations of an independent group of clinical experts to implement the changes to improve services at Prince Philip Hospital."The decision of the panel was influenced by their views on the best way to maintain high quality care for local residents."It would be plainly wrong for the health minister to question the judgement and recommendations of a group of such esteemed health professionals."The spokesperson added that the AandE saw 33,000 patients in 2011/12 of which 6,500 were major cases and 422 of those needed a transfer to another hospital.</body>

      <title>Bloodhound Diary: Building on the tides</title>
      <description>Engineers building the world's first 1,000mph car have to contend with the tides as they engage in precision manufacturing.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24458799</url>
      <date>1381334307</date>
      <body>A British team is developing a car that will be capable of reaching 1,000mph (1,610km/h). Powered by a rocket bolted to a Eurofighter-Typhoon jet engine, the vehicle will mount an assault on the land speed record. The vehicle will be run on Hakskeen Pan in Northern Cape, South Africa, in 2015 and 2016.Wing Commander Andy Green, world land-speed record holder, is writing a diary for the BBC News website about his experiences working on the Bloodhound project and the team's efforts to inspire national interest in science and engineering.It was exactly 30 years ago that Thrust 2 broke the World Land Speed Record - 633mph - and brought the record back to Britain.Until then, it seemed that the US had taken the record away from us for good, with all their new-fangled jet and rocket technology.Fortunately for Britain, a certain Richard Noble decided that we should get it back.When he set the record in 1983, he reminded us (and the rest of the world) that Britain was still a world-beater.Now, 30 years later, we're building something that would go past Thrust 2 like it's standing still - Bloodhound SSC, the world's first 1,000mph car.We have the best motorsports industry in the world (if you need proof, just have a look at where all the Formula 1 teams are based) and one of the best aerospace industries (see the RAF's world-class new Typhoon aircraft for further details).Bloodhound is going to be a product of both industries, with a bit of space technology thrown in.It's another world champion in the making.The car is being assembled at our Technical Centre in Bristol, and every time I see it, more parts have been added.It's also attracting attention from all over the globe: we've got more than 200 countries following it on the Bloodhound SSC website.One of the impressive things about the build is the precision involved.For example, we are aiming to assemble the fin to an accuracy of better than 1/12th of a degree.The whole car is being assembled with this kind of precision with the aid of a "surface table" - a super-flat, 7m-long slab of cast iron that weighs 10 tonnes.The accuracy of the build is regularly checked using a Hexagon laser, which will measure the position of any part of the car, in three dimensions, to one millionth of a metre.This has given us a bit of a problem, though, as the surface table (all 10 tonnes of it) keeps moving.After a lot of checking, it would appear that the surface table, and the whole of our Technical Centre, is actually floating.The ends of the table move up and down by a couple of millimetres or so with the tide. We're only a few hundred metres from the River Avon and the tide in the river makes the floor (and the surface table, and therefore our chassis) go up and down very slightly.If we're fitting new components, the first thing we have to do is re-level the chassis, so that the new bits go on perfectly straight.No-one said that building a 1,000mph car was going to be easy - but we didn't expect to be afloat while we were doing it!The last of the rear upper-chassis ribs have now been delivered.These are the big heavy ribs that will have to support the fin, while it's keeping the car straight.The fin has been stressed to take a 25kN (2.5 tonne) side load.I'm staggered by how much that is (we could lay the car on its side and park two normal road cars on the fin) and how little it is (at 1,000mph, the fin will develop 25kN of side load at a yaw angle of only 0.9 degrees).Sounds like my driving might have to be as accurate as the chassis build - although the 2.5 tonnes of correcting force should help.Don't forget that while the fin is doing its best to keep us pointy-end forwards, you can be right there (or at least your name can). If you want your name to travel at 1,000mph, then sign up here to our fin programme.There's more good news from the aerodynamics team this month.We've been worrying about something called the "yaw static margin" for a while now.The yaw static margin is the distance between the centre of gravity and the aerodynamic centre of the car. In other words, this is what keeps the car pointy-end forwards at high speeds.Ideally, we want the car to look like a dart, with the weight up front and big feathers at the back.We were worried that the static margin (a measure of how dart-like the car is) was smaller than we wanted. It turns out that we'd made two small errors in the calculation.One was in the aerodynamic model of the fin, which hadn't captured the latest changes to extend the trailing edge, so that made the centre of yaw move back a bit.The other change was finding an error in the (hugely complex) centre of gravity calculation, which moved it forward almost 300mm. That's a big gain, and suddenly the car is looking a lot more stable.This will make it easier to keep the car pointy-end forwards and, since that's my job as the driver, I'm delighted.While we're running the car on the desert, one of the key things we'll be checking is the wheel loads.These wheel loads are the result of the car's weight plus all the aerodynamic loads on the vehicle, so we're going to be checking all the aerodynamic forces (and pressures) very carefully.I've just seen a computer programme written by David Naumann, a PhD student at Swansea University. David's programme will compare the real-world pressures, from 120 pressure sensors on the car, with the predicted pressures from the Swansea computer model.This will allow us to check the car's performance very rapidly.We're planning to publish the programme before we start running, so that you can check the car's performance for yourself at home, every time we run.It will also let the 5,500 schools in our Education Programme follow the science as we test it. If your school hasn't signed up to our free programme yet, then join the Bloodhound Education Programme here. It's going to be quite an adventure.URT is now finishing off our carbon-fibre intake duct, which is essentially just a tube to feed air to the car's EJ200 jet engine.The intake was made in two halves and then bolted together to form the 2.2m-long tube. It's another part of the car that will see some big forces.At 1,000mph, the intake will be pressurised to 1.6 Bar (24lb per sq inch), which will try to force the two halves apart with a force of 290kN. That's 29 tonnes.Put another way, each bolt that holds the two halves together will take a load of 13.2kN, or 1.3 tonnes.So after parking two average-sized cars on the side of the fin, we could pick each of them up in turn with just one bolt from the intake.That would explain why the bolts cost about £20 each!If that wasn't enough to worry about, the intake has also been designed to withstand an engine "backfire" without collapsing.If the airflow into a jet engine breaks down, the jet can burp back the air it has been ingesting, known in the jet engine world as a "surge". This could briefly push the intake pressure up almost 3 Bar (44 psi), increasing the load on the intake to over 50 tonnes. That's the weight of four double-decker buses.The bad news is that this load would pretty much wreck the intake. The good news is that we're using the Typhoon's EJ200 engine, one of the world's best jet engines.In normal operation it just doesn't ever surge. I can floor the throttle pedal (which controls the jet engine) at a standstill, and the engine will give me as much power as possible, without any risk that it will surge.The intake doesn't have much to worry about - and neither do I.</body>

      <body>Flanker Justin Tipuric says the Ospreys must win their home games if they are to qualify for the Heineken Cup quarter-finals.The Ospreys open their Pool 1 campaign by hosting triple European Champions Leinster at the Liberty Stadium.The Wales and Lions openside claims victory over the Irish province is vital to secure a knockout place."We know how important it is to win our home games and that is what we have to try and do," said Tipuric."If you win your home games, you have a chance of getting through to the next round."The first two games are massive for us. They (Leinster) have got all their internationals back and Lions boys back as well."They have won the tournament a few times now, so there is nothing better than going up against opposition like them."It's not a bad team - it's going to be a tough game all round the field."We just have to make sure we look after the ball and try and stop them being as dangerous as they are, especially with turnover ball."The Ospreys have failed to make it past the quarter-finals of the Heineken Cup and have not qualified for the knockout stages since the 2009/10 season.The Welsh region has been drawn in the same Pool as former Heineken Cup champions Northampton Saints and Top 14 title winners Castres Olympique as well as as reigning Pro12 champions Leinster.While the Dubliners have a much better record in the Heineken Cup, the Ospreys have twice shocked Brian O'Driscoll and company in domestic Pro12 finals in Dublin.But the Ospreys suffered a 18-12 home defeat to Glasgow Warriors on Friday in the Pro12 before their Heineken Cup opener.Tipuric, along with Alyn Wyn Jones, Ian Evans, Richard Hibbard, Adam Jones and Ryan Jones, is one of six British and Irish Lions in the Ospreys pack."It is not bad is it?," said Tipuric."They are a bunch of great boys and the team is just getting stronger. Even if we do pick up bumps or injuries, we have got players to fill in."Tipuric, who played for Wales in the Six Nations title win over England in Cardiff, came off the bench for the Lions in the 41-16 win over the Wallabies in the third Test in Sydney to clinch the seriesBut he says life has not changed since he returned from the victorious Lions 2-1 Test series victory against Australia."You will always be known as a Lion, but you just get on with day-to-day things," said Tipuric"Unless I have a bright blue skull cap on I am quite alright, people don't take much notice. Even the big nose doesn't stand out that much. So it hasn't been too bad."</body>

      <description>A solicitor is jailed for stealing more than £200,000 - largely taken from a client's payout for brain damage - to buy cars and cosmetic surgery for his girlfriend.</description>

      <body>A solicitor has been jailed for stealing more than £200,000 from clients including one who had received compensation for brain damage.Gareth Arnold, 40, from Cardiff, spent the money on an "extravagant lifestyle" to impress his girlfriend, Swansea Crown Court was told.Arnold, from AM Law in Cardiff, admitted five charges of fraud.The judge said he had acted "cynically and ruthlessly" and sentenced him to four years.The court was told Arnold stole a total of £204,202 and spent money on luxury cars and cosmetic surgery for his partner.He took £174,000 from client Robert McCloy who had been awarded £300,000 compensation after a significant brain injury.Judge Paul Thomas told him: "You were entrusted to look after that money, to look after Mr McCloy's interests."But you decided that money would be better spent on your expensive cars and extravagant lifestyle and to impress your girlfriend."The court heard Arnold conned another client out of £30,000 following a house sale in London.Judge Thomas said Arnold had acted "cynically and ruthlessly".He added: "You have sullied the reputation of your profession and more importantly you have compromised the reputation of your family, bringing undeserved shame on them through no fault of their own."The reason was, quite simply, greed."The court heard Arnold was initially a partner in his father's firm, Arnolds Solicitors in Swansea, but he left to set up his own firm where accident victim Mr McCloy's compensation funds were transferred to.The judge said Mr McCloy's payout was intended to make his "shattered life as comfortable as such compensation could".Judge Thomas said: "That this would have had a financially devastating effect on Mr McCloy appears to have been of little if any consequence to you."The judge highlighted the "inevitable emotional impact" on Mr McCloy after trusting his solicitor."As if he did not have enough burdens to carry," he said."In this case... the financial loss is very significant, the human cost however is immense."Judge Thomas praised Mr McCloy's social worker Andrea Miles for her "great initiative and courage" for repeatedly raising concerns about Arnold's conduct.Matthew Roberts, defending, said Arnold had lost contact with his two children and family since his arrest.Mr Roberts added: "His professional career lays in tatters."</body>

      <title>Warburton wants deal within months</title>
      <description>Lions captain Sam Warburton says he would like a new deal to stay with Cardiff Blues agreed before Christmas.</description>

      <date>1381339774</date>
      <body>Sam Warburton says he would like his new Cardiff Blues contract sorted out before Christmas.The Wales and British and Irish Lions flanker is out of contract at the end of this season.But Warburton, who is one of six Welsh Lions whose current deal expires in the summer, is ready to buck the trend and not sign for a French or English club."For me, right now, my preferred option would be to stay at home," said Warburton, the 2013 Lions captain."I have let them know I would like to stay."Now I cannot influence what happens. There are meetings that now go on behind closed doors and I am hoping they are trying to sort something out."I am waiting to hear now and hoping it can be sorted out this side of Christmas."Warburton, 24, Blues team-mate Leigh Halfpenny, Scarlets' Jonathan Davies, and the Ospreys trio of Alun Wyn Jones, Adam Jones and Ian Evans could all be big-money targets for clubs outside Wales.But Warburton is the first to commit his future to Wales, as long as a new deal can be agreed.Warburton's agent Derwyn Jones, the former Wales lock, has already said the Blues have not been able to make a new contract offer as their budget is uncertain because of the row engulfing European rugby.English and French clubs have put in place plans to quit the Heineken Cup next year and have proposed the rival Rugby Champions Cup.The Aviva Premiership and French Top 14 clubs believe the current European structure favours teams from the Pro12 - made up of sides from Wales, Scotland, Ireland and Italy - both in terms of qualification and in their share of revenue.The Pro12 sides, or at least a reduced number, would be allowed to join the potential new tournament, but participation by teams could yet be vetoed by each nation's governing union and the International Rugby Board.The financial planning in Wales is complicated further by a proposed extra pot of £1m on offer from the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU).That sum has been earmarked for the four regions, but the Blues, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets do not yet know how the money will be shared and whether there will be any limit on what it can be spent on.Warburton does admit he fears being left in limbo and wants to know whether the Blues or the WRU can afford to offer him a deal."My only concern as a player is that it gets dragged out so long and you end up with nothing on the table," said Warburton"I haven't thought of a deadline yet but there will have to be a stage where there does become one."You cannot wait until the last day of the season because nobody will want you by then."It is a weird situation to be in and I have never been out of contract before because I have always ended up extending my contracts with the Blues."Warburton has seen a host of his Wales and Lions teammates leave for England and France, with wing George North at Northampton Saints and centre Jamie Roberts and flanker Dan Lydiate at Racing Metro 92 in Paris, France.Wales's Grand Slam-winning captain in 2012 says he does not blame players for leaving for Wales but he has decided to stay."I had a good chat with Dan for about an hour the other day and he is really enjoying it," said Warburton."I can see the positive of going there. Jamie is a free spirit anyway and, take the money out of it, he would have gone to experience Paris."Each individual is different and has a different thought process."Dan is developing his game as a flanker, his fiancee is a French teacher, so it makes sense for some people to go there. I don't blame them at all."</body>

      <title>Apology for no mural removal warning</title>
      <description>The chief executive of Newport council apologises for not telling councillors in advance when a Chartist mural would be demolished.</description>

      <body>The chief executive of Newport council has apologised for not telling councillors in advance when a Chartist mural would be demolished.In a letter, Will Godfrey said he knew the removal of the mosaic in a subway off John Frost Square was "imminent" the day before the removal.The 1978 35m (115ft) artwork depicting the 1839 uprising was pulled down to make way for a £100m shopping centre.Mr Godfrey said he tried to safeguard the public.Newport council said it would cost £600,000 to save and move the mural.The diggers moved in Thursday 3 October, a fortnight after Welsh heritage body Cadw declined to list the mosaic.Mr Godfrey said he and council leader Bob Bright knew of the decision."On reflection, as an officer group we should have informed all councillors that the demolition of the mural was imminent," he said."I apologise for this shortcoming but our focus was upon ensuring that the demolition could proceed with as little danger as possible to the public."The decision was not informed by any planned demonstration on 5 October, notification of which was in the public domain but of which the council was not formally notified."Mr Godfrey said he had attempted to contact local media to alert them."The process was not underhand or undemocratic as has been suggested in some parts of the media," he said.More than 200 campaigners protested at the site at the weekend after failing to have the mural preserved.Mr Godfrey said the council should now focus on what will replace the mosaic."Officers have advised the appropriate cabinet member that consultation should commence as soon as possible," he said."It is suggested that one of the options should be to commission a replica of the original mural."</body>

      <body>Figures show another significant rise in the number of patients who have had to wait more than nine months to start hospital treatment.More than 13,000 had been waiting over 36 weeks in August, a rise of over 2,000 in one month.The Welsh government's own target is for no-one to wait that long.The Welsh Conservatives have written to the first minister calling on him to personally intervene to deal with what they called "an escalating crisis".Darren Millar, the party's shadow minister for health, told Carwyn Jones the situation needed "immediate priority".He said: "I hope you will agree that patients across Wales - particularly the elderly and vulnerable - should not be faced with such long waits."Meanwhile, Kirsty Williams, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said the figures were a "national disgrace"."Why must patients in Wales have to put up with such an inferior service when compared to the rest of the UK?" she said."Years of Welsh Labour incompetence has led to thousands of people having to wait an awful long time until the start of their treatment."No one should have to wait this long, but it's particularly dreadful to think of the large amount of elderly people that are being forced to wait months on end."On Tuesday, it was announced that the Welsh NHS would be given £570m of extra funding over three years during the Welsh government's draft budget.Finance Minister Jane Hutt said the extra money would help the NHS in Wales to avoid a scandal such as the one in Stafford Hospital, where hundreds of patients died as a result of neglect and abuse.The Welsh government is expected to comment on the figures later.</body>

      <title>Obesity challenge 'urgent' warning</title>
      <description>Obesity is on the increase and remains one of the biggest challenges facing the health service, Wales' chief medical officer warns.</description>

      <date>1381335327</date>
      <body>Obesity is on the increase and remains one of the biggest challenges facing the population, Wales' chief medical officer has warned.It comes in her annual report on the nation's state of health.The report said people in Wales were living longer but ageing with chronic illnesses, many of them avoidable.Dr Ruth Hussey also said that the economic downturn may be taking its toll on the health of the population with "no quick fixes"."Obesity continues to increase with an associated rise in diabetes," she said in the report."There are more adults being treated for high blood pressure, and poor mental health remains a problem."Too few people do enough physical activity."In her report, she described an explosion in childhood obesity as "one of the most serious health challenges of the early 21st Century".She said the issue of overweight children had trebled in the last three decades, and could lead to "serious health consequences, significant reductions in quality of life and a greater risk of bullying and social isolation".According to a programme brought in during 2011 to measure the height and weight of every school pupil at age five in Wales, 28% were overweight or obese.Evidence presented in the report also suggested that there had been very little change in the rates of physical activity for any adult age group.In addition, with the exception of the over-65s, fewer adults were eating five or more portions of fruit and vegetables a day compared with 2008.In her conclusion, the chief medical officer stressed: "Action on obesity is urgent and there is growing evidence that physical activity benefits both our mental and physical health."Everyone needs to be more active."According to official figures, life expectancy in Wales in 2009-2011 had risen to 78 years for men and 82.2 years for women.The age you can expect to lead a full healthy life has also risen to 63 years. However, that also means that as women live longer, they can expect their general health to be poorer for longer as they get older.But the report also warned that many chronic illnesses could be avoided by reducing smoking and drinking, alongside improvements to nutrition and increased physical activity.The report also addressed the issue of the delicate balance between the economy of Wales and the health of its population."There are three major economic issues facing Wales with the potential to impact adversely on health, namely long-term structural poverty and deprivation, the impact of the economic downturn and the impact of benefit reform," said Dr Hussey."Poverty is currently harming health and the impact may worsen, at least temporarily, with the continued economic downturn and benefit reform."Poor health in turn places a significant burden on the economy."The challenge is whether Wales can create a beneficial cycle where better health supports a prospering economy that in turn generates good health."Responding to the publication of the report on Wednesday, the Health Minister Mark Drakeford said: "I welcome this report from the chief medical officer (CMO) in her first year in the role."As the CMO states we must be relentless in our aim of preventing poor health in Wales and this can be done through reducing unhealthy lifestyle factors such as smoking, drinking and obesity."Although life expectancy continues to improve, people are ageing with chronic illnesses which are often preventable and ageing well must be a key focus for us."The report from the chief medical officer comes as BBC Cymru Wales launches its own season of programmes aimed at inspiring people to make their lifestyles healthier.A poll of 502 people for the Live Longer Wales season found that 82% of people agreed that overweight people should have to lose weight before undergoing non-urgent surgery.Two-thirds of those questioned also backed the statement that the NHS spent too much on treating preventable illness that stemmed from poor diet and a lack of exercise.</body>

      <title>Cuts could make councils 'go bust'</title>
      <description>Councils in Wales could "go bust" in the next few years warns a senior Labour figure but the finance minister says local government knew tougher times were on the way.</description>

      <body>Councils in Wales could "go bust" next year due to on-going budget cuts, warns a senior Cardiff councillor.Russell Goodway said Wales' largest authority was itself finding it hard to absorb £20m in cuts this year let alone another £50m in 2014-15.His comments came after Finance Minister Jane Hutt unveiled cuts for councils in her draft budget.She said councils knew tougher times were on the way and she had been cushioning them for three years.Local government spending will fall from £4.648bn this year to £4.466bn next year, a cut in cash terms of 3.91% or 5.81% in real terms.The minister stressed the priority was to protect health, schools and universal benefits such as free prescriptions, school breakfasts and bus passes for older people.But Labour councillor Mr Goodway, Cardiff's cabinet member for finance, said the future looked "very dark"."I think there will be some local authorities in Wales that will go bust in the next two or three years. They will run out of money," he said."From where I am sitting we are in a very dark place this morning."I don't think that some local authorities are going to survive."Mr Goodway said he had heard of two unnamed councils which were in serious trouble.He said 60% of Cardiff council's £500m budget has to go on statutory services - such as roads cleaning - leaving cuts to be found from the balance."Even if we stopped spending every single penny that we spend on discretionary services that would not be enough to cut our spending," he said.Under the Welsh government draft budget, councils' own budgets will be around 9% lower in real terms between now and 2015-16.Some council have already announced closures affecting leisure centres, public toilets and libraries as well as cuts in bus travel subsidies and other areas to tackle on-going austerity measures.Steve Thomas, chief executive of the Welsh Local Government Association, said council tax could rise."It's a very tough budget and it's £175m coming out of council services," he told BBC Wales."We can't keep delivering the range of services that we're currently delivering so it will impact on things such as leisure services, libraries, refuse collections and the conditions of our roads."We run something like 735 services so there's going to be a massive impact for the Welsh public."We've yet to see the local government settlement but once we see it, I think there will be more pressure on the council tax," he said.But Mr Goodway said that even if Cardiff council tax could be raised by 20% it would still leave the authority £27m short of the cuts it needs to make."Council tax is going to have to go up but government has made it clear the maximum is 5%," he said."We have got to find different ways of doing things."He said Wales' 22 local authorities and seven health boards could be reduced in number to cut overheads.The Conservatives said councils should open up their books to consider how they can deliver more for less.Shadow Local Government Minister Janet Finch-Saunders AM said: "Local authorities should resist the easy route of cutting frontline services or forcing up council tax bills for hardworking families, but should consider whether they can improve transparency, eliminate wasteful spending and look at different ways of working."Ms Hutt said the Welsh government has been "supporting and cushioning" local government over the last three years in anticipation of the cuts."They know, and they have said quite clearly over the last 24 hours, that they recognise that tougher times are on the way," she said."What we are doing in this budget is putting more money in local services which will benefit local councils."She was referring to £600m in spending on new projects.</body>

      <body>Former Stoke City manager Tony Pulis says Craig Bellamy must "sort his temperament out" to become a manager.Striker Bellamy, 34, is to retire from Wales duty this month having spoken of wanting to one day manage Wales.Pulis says Bellamy is a "wonderful" and "smashing lad" who he had hoped to sign, and wished him the best in his ambition to be a manager."He'll have to sort his temperament out ... to deal and work with other players and other people," he said.Pulis steered Stoke to the Premier League in 2008, and kept the club in top flight for five seasons before departing ahead of the 2013-14 campaign.He has also managed Bournemouth, Gillingham, Bristol City, Portsmouth and Plymouth Argyle as well as another spell with Stoke from 2002-2005.Bellamy is pondering his future beyond Cardiff City's debut season in the Premier League, with retirement a possibility.The player has already has already announced his international retirement will follow Wales' 2014 World Cup qualifiers against Macedonia and Belgium.Wales face at Cardiff City Stadium on Friday, and travel to Belgium on Tuesday, 15 October.Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, Pulis said "terrific" Bellamy had been "wonderful for Wales".Newport-born Pulis added: "From what I can gather he wants to go on the coaching side of it and I wish him all the best in that field if he does do that."His human skills will have to improve a little bit when the old mist drops."But having said that it's nice to have that character, that determination and that real quality of wanting to win."But he'd have to generate that in the right way and like I say, I wish him all the best and fair play, what a great career."I actually went down to Cardiff, last year [or] the year before to meet him. I was desperate to try and sign him when he was having problems at Man City."And I found him an absolutely wonderful person one on one."I'd been told about his temperament in the group and what he can be like at times, the way he loses his temper."But [he's a] football nut, an absolute football nut and a smashing lad and I wish him all the best."</body>

      <body>Striker Rob Earnshaw says he is still available and eager to play for Wales.Wales manager Chris Coleman is without 10 frontline players because of injury for the World Cup qualifiers with Macedonia in Cardiff on Friday and then Belgium in Brussels on 15 October.Earnshaw, 32, is the leading scorer for Toronto FC in Major League Soccer this season, with seven goals in 24 games."I'm available for Wales, I want to play for Wales," said former Cardiff striker Earnshaw who has 58 Wales caps."I want to be involved now and I want to be involved in the next qualifiers too."I'm only 32, I feel great, I've had a good season here and I feel like I've got something to offer."I've scored a few goals over here, so I'd hope that gives the sign I'm still available and still willing to give something for my country."Wales manager Chris Coleman's options in attack for the two qualifiers have not been hit as hard by injury as his defence and midfield.But in the current campaign no player has been able to cement their place as an out-and-out striker in the Wales side, while 76-cap forward Craig Bellamy will retire from international football after the game against Belgium.David Cotterill of Doncaster, Charlton's Simon Church, Hal Robson-Kanu of Reading, Burnley's Sam Vokes and Millwall's Jermaine Easter are the attackers in the current squad.Earnshaw, who has scored 16 goals for Wales, joined Toronto in February 2013 on a free transfer having been released by Cardiff.His former clubs include West Bromwich Albion, Norwich City, Derby County and Nottingham Forest.</body>

      <description>Warning some children's school lunches are not big enough</description>

      <body>Some pupils are not being given enough food at Powys primary schools causing them to snack and lose concentration in lessons, an assembly member has warned.Montgomeryshire AM Russell George said parents and governors had told him 11-year-olds were being given the same portion sizes as four-year-olds.He claimed second helpings had also been banned and he intended to raise the issue with Powys council's leader.The authority said its meals met Welsh government requirements.Mr George said the issue was brought to his attention by a number of people across the county who he said felt the "extreme" school meals policy was leading to more snacking and bad dietary choices.He said the policy dictated that all primary school children received the same portion of food, regardless of age.And he said he had been told that second helpings of lunch had been stopped as the council tried to reduce waste."Parents are telling me that their children are coming home hungry, which then causes them to snack before their evening meal, all of which isn't lending itself to children leading healthy lifestyles," said the Conservative AM."Children of 10 and 11 years of age are clearly going to require different levels of nutrition to those of four and five-year-olds... this isn't rocket science."One chair of governors at a primary school in the county claimed more parents were switching their children to packed lunches because they no longer felt the school meals were offering value for money.He said he became concerned after noticing his own 10-year-old son was coming home from school hungry and that a number of other parents had raised the issue with him."I then raised it at a governor's meeting and was told that catering staff had been told that as of the start of this term additional food was not to be given," he said."I have spoken to the principal catering officer at the council and he said the rationale behind this was that he felt some schools were over-producing food."Also I think the thought is that by giving children seconds they're not going to have the balanced meal they should be getting."But what follows from that is that if you get wastage down to zero you have pupils going hungry as the portion sizes are the same for four to 11-year-olds."He said teachers were concerned that it was leading to poorer concentration from some pupils."The council's saying that all the pupils should get the same portion sizes as everyone pays the same but I think it's leading to some parents feeling that they are no longer getting value for money and are giving their children packed lunches instead," he added.A spokesperson for Powys council said dishes on school menus met the requirements of the Welsh government's Appetite for Life scheme, which aims to improve the nutritional standards of food and drink served in schools across Wales."As part of this scheme, there are recommended guidelines regarding the size of the portions. These portions have been analysed to ensure they meet the nutritional standards set out in the scheme," the spokesperson said."When planning school meals, the number of pupils who have school meals is always taken into consideration to ensure that school cooks do not over produce food and remain within their budgets."However, there will always be cases where food is left on the servery as pupils can choose whether they want a particular food on a school menu."If there is food left over, we have now advised school cooks to give out second helpings if there are pupils who want it."But we cannot overproduce food so that second helpings can be provided as this has a cost implication and also second portions are not taken into consideration when the menus are nutritionally analysed."A Welsh government spokesperson said: "We would never want to see children having school meals going hungry."We've given primary schools guidance on portion sizes which cater for changing nutritional requirements as children get older. So a child in year six would have a larger portion than a child in reception."</body>

      <title>Economy has 'slowest growth rate'</title>
      <description>Gloomy prediction for Welsh economy, says report</description>

      <date>1381402871</date>
      <body>The Welsh economy will struggle to achieve strong growth for the rest of the decade, an economic research company has said.Capital Economics projects a 2.7% average annual growth up to 2020 compared to 3.8% in the UK as a whole.It means the future for jobs and prosperity is not as good as the rest of the UK.The Welsh government said the firm's report shows progress in the Welsh economy.'Pretty stunning companies'Richard Holt, the report's author, told BBC Wales: "I wouldn't say {it's} grim but it's kind of not as good as elsewhere."The economy I think is genuinely growing and will probably grow faster next year than this year but other parts of the UK are growing faster still."Productivity in Wales is lower than in other parts of the UK. The public sector is larger in Wales than other parts of the UK which is difficult at a time of austerity when there's so much pressure to cut the public sector back."Wales is also a small economy by the standards of most parts of the UK along with the north east and Northern Ireland. And being small is harder in terms of getting economies of scale and Wales is fairly remote the other centres of the UK economy."Transport and infrastructure has to be part of it."But he added: "It's worth remembering there are some pretty stunning companies in Wales."Airbus are doing extraordinarily well and anything they can do to support the growth of suppliers around Airbus is clearly a potentially huge opportunity."Tata is doing well, Ford at Bridgend will next year be starting to build a new 1.5 litre engine which they're going to be selling across Europe."So there are some very impressive examples and it's a question of what one can do to build on the strengths."The UK economy grew by 0.6% in the three months to June, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics.And in July, it was revealed there has been a 191% rise in the number of investments by foreign companies into Wales.The number of projects went up from 23 to 67 in the last financial year.The Welsh government said the report shows the good progress the economy of Wales is making."Since devolution not only have we seen greater growth in employment in Wales than in England, but Wales has had larger gains in private sector employment and smaller increases in public sector employment than England," a spokesperson said."Despite cuts to our budgets imposed by the UK government, our unrelenting focus is on supporting economic growth and creation of high quality jobs in Wales."For example, this week we announced a programme of capital investment that will create 11,000 jobs."The capital investment, worth in total more than £600m, includes £62m for the South Wales Metro transport project and £140m for a help-to-buy housing scheme.</body>

      <body>A man who assaulted, raped and held a woman prisoner after she was snatched from Slovakia and trafficked to Lancashire has been jailed.Azam Khan "bought" the woman and "married" her at a local mosque in a bid to halt his deportation from the UK to Pakistan.Five other people helped in her trafficking after she was snatched in August 2012, Preston Crown Court heard.Khan, 34, of Brougham Street, Burnley was jailed for 12 years.The victim's story was described by prosecutor Joe Boyd as like "something from a 19th Century novel by Dickens".The Crown Prosecution Service's Emma Kehoe said the woman had been "falsely imprisoned, beaten and raped"."She had no money or identity documents and she was unable to speak English or ask anyone for help," she said."She was threatened and told she was not allowed to leave."The woman was brought to England on a coach and kept prisoner by Imrich Bodor, 45, and Slovakian Petra Dzudzova, 27, both of Clipstone Street, Bradford.Bodor was sentenced to nine years in prison. Dzudzova is due to be sentenced at a later date.Before being sold to Khan, she was handed over to Afghani Abdul Sabool Shinwary, 38, of Washington Street, Bradford, who sexually assaulted her, and Slovakian Kristina Makunova, 37, of Girlington Road, Bradford.Shinwary received a prison sentence of 10 years and three months.Makunova has already served a 51-week prison sentence after previously pleading guilty to human trafficking and false imprisonment offences.Khan's relative Nusrat Khan, 40, of Colne Road, Burnley was also found guilty of false imprisonment and received a jail sentence of nine months, suspended for two years.</body>

      <title>Free school head teacher, 27, quits</title>

      <body>A head teacher whose appointment to a new free school was criticised has quit her post weeks after starting.Pimlico Primary, which opened in September, said Annaliese Briggs, 27, had left the job to "pursue other opportunities in primary education".Miss Briggs was appointed in April as the head while still studying for her postgraduate certificate in education.Labour councillors in Westminster said governors may be regretting appointing someone with "no teaching experience".The primary school opened at the site of Pimlico Academy in Lupus Street, central London, with 60 pupils and aims to have 420 pupils by 2019.Pimlico Primary is sponsored by Future Academies, a charity founded by Lord Nash and his wife Caroline.A statement from Pimlico Primary said: "Having successfully set up Pimlico Primary, Annaliese Briggs has decided to leave Future Academies to pursue other opportunities in primary education."A new principal of Pimlico Primary has been appointed. Coming from within the group, our new principal is already known to the pupils and families of Pimlico Primary, and brings over 10 years' experience in both early years and leadership."We are delighted that Annaliese will continue to support Pimlico Primary as it grows by becoming a governor."Miss Briggs is completing a school-centred initial teacher training (SCITT) course in Wandsworth and will qualify with a postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE).She previously said she has classroom experience from teaching primary school children in supplementary schools and had been chosen to lead the school for her curriculum expertise.Reacting to the news that Miss Briggs has stepped down, leader of the Labour group at Westminster Council Councillor Paul Dimoldenberg said: "Being the head of an inner-London school is a tough job which can sometimes be very stressful."By appointing someone with no teaching experience or experience in running a school, the Pimlico academy governors might now consider that this is a decision they now regret."I hope that Ms Briggs' commitment to education is undiminished and wish her well in her future career."The Department for Education said it was a matter for the school.</body>

      <body>Police are considering what action to take against a Cambridge cyclist who dodged a level crossing barrier, coming within seconds of being hit by a train.British Transport Police (BTP) confirmed they spoke to a 26-year-old woman from the city on Wednesday.She was filmed cycling through the closed barrier at Waterbeach on 12 September.The woman came forward voluntarily, and BTP said they were deciding what further action to take.She was filmed passing the closed barrier and ignoring warning signals and lights.Rail bosses described it as "one of the closest near misses we've seen".Hundreds of thousands of people have watched footage of the woman cycling up to the tracks before slamming on her brakes, and edging backwards as the train speeds past.The driver of the train needed to apply the emergency brake when he saw her, operator Greater Anglia said.Moments later the woman was seen mopping her brow before cycling off in the direction she had come from.More than 100 trains travel through the Waterbeach crossing each day, at speeds of up to 75mph (120km/h).Since 1 January, there have been 70 reported incidents at level crossings in Cambridgeshire, a BTP spokesman said.However, he added that incidents such as this one were "extremely rare".</body>

      <body>Harrow Council in north-west London is offering council tenants payments of up to £38,000 to buy their own home on the private market.Under its Grants to Move scheme it will also pay up to £6,000 for people to move into a private rented home and help pay removal costs.A family of four is using the scheme to buy a home in the Midlands.The council has housing stock of 5,000 homes and 4,000 people on the waiting list, said a spokesman.The Conservative authority said its grants for people to move into bought or privately rented accommodation were designed for people already considering moving.Grants start at £20,000 for people buying homes who are in a one-bedroom council home and go to £38,000 for those leaving a four-bedroom home.For people moving to private rented accommodation, grants start at £1,500 to those leaving a one-bedroom home and go up to £6,000 if a four-bedroom home is being vacated.A payment of up to £4,500 for people willing to move to a smaller council or housing association property has been available for a few years.Barry Macleod-Cullinane, Harrow Council Cabinet Member for Adults and Housing, said: "Housing families in temporary accommodation costs Harrow Council around £3m a year."Doing nothing is not an option."We will treat each application on a case-by-case basis and there will be checks and balances in place to prevent fraud."The council said grants could not be used to buy council property and part of the grant would be reclaimed if people moved out of their newly purchased homes within five years.Since the offer became available at the end of September, a family of four has opted to buy a property in the Midlands and two women living alone in two-bedroom flats were paid £3,000 each to move into private rentals.Bob Blackman, Conservative MP for Harrow East said: "Harrow has a dearth of properties available for social rent so this is a good idea to attempt to encourage those who wish to move on to do so."It is also much more cost effective than buying up properties for social rent."In April the authority said it was considering offering up to £20,000 to those wishing to leave council property to move abroad because it has one of the smallest stocks of social housing in the capital.</body>

      <date>1381414854</date>
      <body>Protesters wanting justice for Daniel Pelka, who was killed by his mother and her partner, are demonstrating outside a council meeting.Campaign group Prevent Child Abuse are at the Council House while councillors discuss a report on Daniel's case.The group wants a law to be introduced which forces teachers and carers to report any signs of child abuse.A serious case review concluded council employees, the NHS and police missed opportunities to help Daniel, four.The meeting is the first time all 54 elected members of the council have met to discuss the findings.Daniel was starved and beaten for months before he died in March 2012 at his Coventry home.His mother Magdelena Luczak, 27, and her boyfriend Mariusz Krezolek, 34, were jailed for life after being found guilty of murder, at Birmingham Crown Court in July.Paramjit Pooni, who travelled from Hampshire to be part of the protest, said she felt "very sad" about what had happened to Daniel."It was astonishing that no one picked up on what was happening and I firmly believe mandatory child abuse reporting is the way forward," she said.Protestor Stuart Tollan, from Coventry, said: "I've never seen anything as disgusting as Daniel's case, eating out of bins and things like that."People should be sacked, dismissed and even prosecuted, they should be utterly ashamed of themselves."The group's protest comes after figures showed one-third of councils previously judged by Ofsted inspectors to have child protection weaknesses are still failing to meet minimum requirements.Questions have also been raised about the role of serious case reviews, in the wake of Daniel's case.</body>

      <title>Minister considers gassing badgers</title>
      <description>The government is exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB, environment secretary Owen Paterson tells MPs.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24475034</url>

      <body>The government is exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has told MPs.A six week trial of badger culling in Somerset has now ended.But the firm behind it has asked for more time after its marksmen fell short of killing the target of 70% of the badger population.Mr Paterson said the Department for Food and Rural Affairs was looking at other methods including the use of gas.Responding to a question from Green MP Caroline Lucas in the Commons, Mr Paterson said: "Until we can establish vaccines, we have to use the tools used by other sensible countries - which is to remove wildlife - we made it quite clear in our TB strategy we would look at other methods of removing wildlife, and yes we are looking at gassing, but we will not use it unless it is proven to be safe, humane, and effective."Labour MP Barry Sheerman called the badger cull "morally reprehensible" and asked Mr Paterson "why doesn't he resign?" during heated Commons exchanges.Marksmen only managed to shoot 60% of the badgers in the trial area in Somerset, although estimates have been lowered as to how many badgers lived in the region in the first place.The company behind the cull has asked for more time and a similar time extension is being sought for a trial cull Gloucestershire.The government is due to make a decision on extending the culls later this week.Farmers have long blamed badgers for spreading bovine TB in cattle but animal rights groups say evidence does not support this.At one time gassing was the preferred method of culling but it was dropped in favour of shooting, which is seen as more humane.The RSPCA said it was "opposed to the use of gas to control badgers on welfare grounds and believes it is not humane as it may cause badgers to suffer prolonged deaths underground"."We are extremely concerned about the government's admission that they are looking into using gassing to cull badgers," the organisation said in a statement."Culling badgers will not solve the problem of bovine TB in cattle, whatever the method of culling."The possible gassing of badgers adds a further outrageous twist to this misguided policy. The RSPCA will look into reports that badgers have been gassed in and around the pilot cull areas."Martin Surl, Police and Crime Commissioner for Gloucestershire, has warned that plans to extend the cull could stretch police resources in his area.Mr Surl told the the Stroud News and Journal: "My concern is that the cull operators are feeling the pressure and may become more desperate in their attempts to shoot their quota of badgers while the people opposed to the cull are getting equally frustrated, all of which adds up to an unhelpful situation."But Laurence Robertson, Conservative MP for Tewkesbury, dismissed Mr Surl's concerns, accusing him in the Commons of being "publicity-seeking", adding that it was for the government to decide whether to extend the cull.In the trial which has just ended, the plan was to shoot and kill 70% of badgers in the areas of west Somerset and Gloucestershire by free shooting.Across both regions this meant around 5,000 badgers were to be killed in total.But Defra sources said these targets were based on population estimates from 2012 that have proved to be highly inaccurate.Explaining the failure to meet the target on Wednesday, Mr Paterson said: "The badgers moved the goalposts."We're dealing with a wild animal, subject to the vagaries of the weather and disease and breeding patterns."But rock star and campaigner Brian May, a leading opponent of the cull, branded the trial an "utter failure" and described the application for an extension as a "farce"."They were warned this would happen and they did not listen to the scientists," he added.</body>

      <title>Inmate fights to keep prison open</title>
      <description>Solicitors for an inmate write to the government to say closing the Suffolk prison where he is held, would breach his human rights.</description>

      <body>Closing a Suffolk prison will breach an inmate's human rights, lawyers have told the government.The legal team alleges the therapy he is receiving at HMP Blundeston, to help him avoid re-offending on release, would be disrupted.In September, the Ministry of Justice said the prison, near Lowestoft, was set to close by the end of the year.Lawyers have written to the ministry to criticise the plan, which they said was decided without consultation.The letter, written by EBR Attridge solicitors and seen by the BBC, also says there was no assessment carried out on the impact of closure.The letter argues that as well as breaching the Human Rights Act, it was "in breach of our client's legitimate expectation that on commencing his treatment at HMP Blundeston, he would be given the chance to complete it".Solicitor Lorna Elliott argues the government is breaking the law if it does not allow a prisoner to complete his therapy to show he is no longer a danger to the public and can be released.The letter adds the prisoner has been receiving therapy for 13 months and that research has found that inmates who stay in therapy for longer than 18 months are found to have a 25% reduction in the risk of reoffending.Ms Elliott says: "The closure of HMP Blundeston will constitute a total destruction of its therapeutic community and will have a destructive and detrimental effect on the prisoners undergoing therapy."She adds that millions of pounds have been spent on the prison in recent years.Ms Elliott says the next step could be to seek a judicial review of the decision in the High Court.Ms Elliott would not say whether the case was being funded by legal aid.A Prison Service spokesperson said it would not comment on any possible legal action.She added: "The decision to close HMP Blundeston was made following a thorough assessment by senior managers in the National Offender Management Service."It was based on a range of factors, including the suitability of the accommodation, and was not a reflection of the current performance of the prison or its staff."We need a fit-for-purpose, modern estate which provides prison accommodation at a much lower cost to the taxpayer and in the right places to deliver our ambition of reducing reoffending."Our aim will be to avoid compulsory redundancies by firstly redeploying staff and, if necessary, offering voluntary early departures to staff in affected sites and neighbouring establishments."The jail is set to close in December.</body>

      <body>A once-prominent member of the English Defence League (EDL) who failed to turn up to his trial for attempted robbery has been captured.The trial heard that Guramit Singh Kalirai and two accomplices pinned a shop assistant to the ground and made threats to slash his throat.Kalirai was found guilty and sentenced in his absence to six and a half years at Nottingham Crown Court.He is now in custody after being arrested by police.Kalirai, who previously had a role as a spokesman for the EDL, is now due to appear at Nottingham Crown Court on 18 October.He was previously given a prison sentence of six and a half years on 24 September.Det Insp Rich Monk, of Nottinghamshire Police, said it was fortunate that no-one was seriously injured in the attempted robbery."The quick thinking and brave assistance provided by staff at nearby business premises resulted in the robbery being thwarted and an offender being arrested at the scene," he said.Kalirai, 31, of Ullswater Crescent, Bramcote, was arrested by officers in Long Eaton on Sunday.The attempted robbery happened on 2 May at Simply Hydro, in Wigwam Lane, Hucknall.Workers at a neighbouring business who heard shouts called the police.They also found one of the robbers hiding in a wall partition, and stopped him escaping before police arrived.Andrew Wheelhouse, 31, and David Mura, 26, were also jailed for the attempted robbery.Wheelhouse, of Alfreton, Derbyshire, was sentenced to five-and-a-half years in prison and Mura, of Stapleford, Nottinghamshire, was jailed for three years and three months.</body>

      <title>Footballer sidelined by spider bite</title>
      <description>A bite from Britain's most venomous spider, the false widow, sidelines an amateur footballer from Devon.</description>

      <date>1381401667</date>
      <body>An amateur footballer from Devon has been sidelined after being bitten by Britain's most venomous spider.Team-mates of Elmore Football Club player Steve Harris thought he was joking when he pulled out of the squad because of the injury.But the 22-year-old had been bitten in his sleep by a false widow spider and had to undergo an emergency operation at Torbay Hospital.The defender now has an open wound where surgeons cut away the poison.Mr Harris, from Dawlish, who turns out for the Tiverton-based side in the South West Peninsula Premier League, has been told he cannot play football for at least three weeks.He said: "When I woke up I had a pain in my side - a stinging feeling. I didn't take that much notice until it started swelling and the pain got worse."The area around the bite mark just ballooned and grew and grew."It was only when the area started to turn black, some four days after I first noticed the bite, that I decided I ought to go to hospital."Torbay Hospital said Mr Harris was first seen by his GP who diagnosed the spider bite and told him the surgery had seen six similar bites in the previous week."They told me the false black widow spider was the culprit," Mr Harris said."They operated on me immediately and it took half an hour to cut away the area around the bite to get at the poison. I now have an open wound and have to wait for it to heal over."I was in agony. I have never had pain like that before in my life. It's still very painful now. I still can't sleep properly and find it virtually impossible to get in and out of a car."In his teens he had spells at Plymouth Argyle, Norwich City, Yeovil Town and Salisbury, and joined Elmore two years ago.His friends still thought he was pulling their leg and it was only when he showed them a photo of his wound that they believed him.The false widow spider (steatoda nobilis) is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider known in Britain.It is thought to have arrived in Britain in crates of fruit from the Canary Islands in the late 19th Century, with the first reported sighting in Torquay in 1879.There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK.The spider, which is about the size of a 50p piece, belongs to the same family as the infamous black widow, although it is nowhere near as toxic.The severity of symptoms depends on the amount of venom injected but can include severe swelling, chest pains and tingling of fingers.The Natural History Museum said a succession of mild winters had resulted in a significant increase in the number of reported sightings and bites.Conservationists believe that changes in climate could be encouraging the spider to make itself at home in new areas.Buglife entomologist Steven Falk said false widow spiders were "ponderous, very slow moving and not at all aggressive".However, without "hard evidence" he said it was difficult to know how many bites - including Mr Harris's - they were responsible for and how many could be attributable to other insects, such as mosquitoes.</body>

      <body>A lap dancing club's licence renewal has been refused after an undercover police operation discovered "astonishing breaches" of regulations.Beavers in Watford applied to the council for a sexual entertainment venue (SEV) licence in August.Officers from Hertfordshire Police investigated the club after concerns about their conduct.They found "flagrant" breaches of rules including staff offering sexual services and touching customers.The "multiple breaches" of SEV licence laws were discovered by officers on the first night of the operation, the force said.A spokesman said evidence revealed this was "not an isolated incident"."The methods employed by dancers at the venue that regularly breached the terms of the licence were widespread," he added.Hertfordshire Police licensing officer John Corkett said: "The very nature of the activities that go on at such venues means that the management try their very best to avoid police attention and tend to 'keep under the radar'."It was quite astonishing that the undercover police operation detected such flagrant breaches of the licence on the very first night that they went into the club."The club's legal representatives have yet to comment on the decision.</body>

      <body>More Newcastle United fans were arrested at football matches during the 2012-13 season than any other club, according to Home Office statistics.Of the 175 Newcastle fans arrested, more than 100 were suspected of being involved in trouble after the club's 3-0 home defeat to Sunderland.The Home Office said total arrests in England and Wales had increased by 4% compared with the previous season.About 39 million supporters attended matches and 2,456 arrests were made.Leeds United had the highest number in the Championship, while Walsall and Oxford United came out top in League One and League Two respectively.Football Conference side Nuneaton Town had the sixth highest number of arrests.An operation involving four forces saw 87 fans arrested before a game with Lincoln City in March.Northumbria Police arrested more than 100 Newcastle fans after the disorder around St James' Park in April.Barry Rogerson, 45, of Bedlington, Northumberland, admitted violent disorder after he was seen punching a police horse in clashes following the game.Two 12-year-old boys received football banning orders for their part in the trouble.The Home Office data shows the most banning orders have been issued to Cardiff City fans, followed by Chelsea and Manchester United.The report states: "The general downwards trend in football-related arrests is continuing, although there remains a significant risk it will escalate if efforts to prevent and tackle football-related disorder are reduced."</body>

      <body>People have been evacuated from their homes after the Environment Agency warned of flooding during a tidal surge on the Norfolk coast.More than 30 people sought shelter at The Lighthouse Inn, the official flood rescue centre in Walcott, where high water hit at 10:45 BST.A force eight north to north-west wind meant the tide was predicted to be 3m high.By midday the worst of the surge appeared to have abated.The Walcott coast road remains closed, with seaweed and other debris strewn across along the seafront.The Environment Agency also issued a flood alert, meaning flooding is possible, in a larger area along the Norfolk coast and marshy areas inland.Norfolk Police has said the coast is "very dangerous" and warned people to keep away from the coastline between Hunstanton and Weybourne, where high tide is expected at 12:40.Richard Houghton of the Environment Agency said: "Our attention is very much focused on Walcott because of the risks to properties there."Not so much with waves coming over the wall, but there is a significant amount of spray which can make water accumulate."He added that there should be a normal high tide at just before midnight on Thursday, but there could be the knock-on effect of water locked in the Broads for up to three tides.Richard Cook, a flood co-ordinator from North Norfolk District Council, said the council had to make sure people were protected."The warnings were excellent - we've managed to get people in here [the centre] today, and make sure everyone is safe."The flood wardens prioritise people with mobility problems, with police, the fire service, Coastguard and Mundesley lifeboat also at the scene.Alan Robinson, of Helena Road, said he and his wife headed to the centre "just in case".Stuart Richards, who lives on the seafront at Walcott, said he and his wife were unable to return to their flooded house for a year after the 2007 tidal surge, but had "done all we can" this time.BBC Radio Norfolk reporter Andrew Turner, at Walcott, said he had seen waves 15ft (4m) high crashing against the sea wall and spraying up much higher."We've now got a large area of the road covered in seawater, it's like a river," he said."The wind hasn't dropped. The tide is at its peak but, at the moment, we've got a situation where everyone is safe."Mundesley lifeboat coxswain Brian Hall said: "Let's hope there's no-one silly enough to go out today."It's absolutely evil. The best place to be watching it is from your bedroom window."BBC Radio Norfolk reporter Jill Bennett, at Wells-next-the-Sea, said it appeared the town had "got away with it", with seawater lapping the car park.Speaking at about 09:30 BST, she said: "The sea is extremely rough, there is a strong wind and it's raining pretty hard."The Met Office has said it will be cold and windy all day, with coastal gales and frequent heavy, squally showers across much of Norfolk - particularly around Great Yarmouth.On Thursday night it is expected to be "very windy", perhaps "severe" on the coast, with some heavy, thundery showers for parts of the county.Friday is forecast to feel cold, with a strong, raw, north-easterly wind.</body>

      <body>More than one million people visited this summer's Gromit Unleashed arts trail in Bristol, bringing more than £75m to the city, organisers have said.Wallace and Gromit's Grand Appeal said 1.18 million people saw the sculptures, based on the famous Aardman animation.The 81 5ft (1.5m) dogs were decorated by artists and celebrities, including Sir Quentin Blake and Jools Holland.Aardman's chairman David Sproxton hopes to set up another project in 2015 involving Shaun the Sheep.Mr Sproxton said everyone at the Bristol-based company had been "bowled over" by the way people responded to the sculptures."Gromit Unleashed is the most successful project we've ever done beyond what we're usually associated with."We keep being asked 'what's next?' and it's certainly going to be a challenge to top this."The project partners are keen to see if we can scale up the idea with Shaun the Sheep in 2015 and roll it out nationally - or even internationally."Mr Sproxton said the project was at an exploratory stage but, with 2015 being the Chinese Year of the Sheep, it seemed like the "perfect time".The Gromit sculptures, which each weighed about 90lb (40kg), were on show in and around the city from 1 July to 8 September.They went to auction on 3 October, and raised over £2.3m for the Wallace and Gromit's Grand Appeal, the Bristol Children's Hospital Charity.A total of 92 lots - which included an additional 11 3ft (1m) Gromits weighing 33lb (15kg) each - made up the fundraising total.Pixar's Gromit Lightyear - based on the Toy Story character - was the star lot, reaching £65,000.Nicola Masters, director of Wallace and Gromit's Grand Appeal, said: "The figures are astonishing but the economic impact is only part of the equation as the project has not only helped bring people to visit this wonderful city, but got Bristol people out to explore parts of the city they have never seen before."The charity said the direct impact of the Gromit Unleashed project was more than £77m, which includes money spent on paid accommodation, travel, gifts and refreshments.Just over half of the visitors were from Bristol, with 42% coming from around the UK and the remaining 2% from overseas, in particular North America, Europe and Australia.Nearly 900,000 visitors came to the city specifically to see the sculptures, it is claimed.</body>

      <body>Rapper Coolio has surprised a group of students by cooking them a meal and performing in their front room.The impromptu performance of his 1995 hit Gangsta's Paradise came after the students met the American star at a gig in Preston.Before performing, he prepared a three-course meal after taking the students to a supermarket to buy ingredients.A film of the performance made by one of the students has received around one million views on YouTube.Fashion student Olivia Johnson-Aley, from Liverpool said it was "such a crazy and surreal moment, I had to film it"."It is amazing how many people have already watched it," she said. "We have been getting calls from media in the UK and America ever since."The 50-year-old hip-hop star had been performing at Macs Bar in Preston when he met the students and offered to cook them a meal.Law student Melissa Bryan, 21, from the Isle of Man said the rapper said he would "cook for us and he was true to his word".She said his "delicious" menu comprised of Coolio's Caprese Salad, Chicken á la Daaaamn, and Peach Crumble.Miss Bryan said that the food was "great and the sing-along was even better"."I was three when Gangsta's Paradise was released but it is a classic."We all knew the words off by heart. Every student does."Coolio, who has sold more than 17 million albums worldwide, has sold more than six million copies of Gangsta's Paradise since its release.Lorcan O'Mahony, who accompanied the rapper on his guitar, said he had "conveniently left" it in the room when he heard the rapper was coming to the house."After dinner, I asked if he would perform Gangsta's Paradise and we all got involved."It is something I will never forget."He added that he had "only learnt the chords a few hours earlier".The rapper eventually left the house at 03:00 BST to catch a flight.</body>

      <body>A county council has installed CCTV cameras to check on workers involved in over-running roadworks over claims they had "no sense of urgency".Work on Old Town High Street, in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, is expected to overrun by up to five weeks.Traders who want compensation for loss of revenue have reported workers "with their feet up" and "walking their dog".Contractors Jackson Civil Engineering said using CCTV was a "collective decision" to "monitor" the work.Businesses are demanding compensation for a drop in trade and said the overrun could force many of them out of business.Barry Garvin, from Fretts music shop, said his takings were down 40% and he was three weeks from closing because of the "mismanaged and poorly executed" project.He said he regularly saw men in diggers "with their feet up", texting and walking around "just chatting" or leaning on shovels with "no sense of urgency"."We expected disruption but we also expected the works to be carried out efficiently," he said."Last week there was a guy sitting in a digger, he was there for four hours and didn't move, I honestly thought he'd died, I was going to see if he was OK then I saw him stir."Liz Shipton, from the Rose and Crown public house, said the work was "a complete shambles"."The guys are sitting round doing nothing all day, one of them was walking his dog up and down yesterday," she said.Work to install the one-way system, run by Hertfordshire County Council (HCC) for Dacorum Borough Council, started in June and was due to finish at the end of October.Dacorum council leader Andrew Williams confirmed the work was due to be completed by the end of November.A spokesman for the contractors said "unforeseen circumstances" meant it had to "alter its approach" to the work, which had an effect on time and cost.It said it had an "open and honest discussion" with both councils."We took the collective decision to install cameras on the project to ensure the progress of the job can be monitored in the most efficient way possible," a statement said.Mr Williams said the cameras were to "make sure the amount of work that is supposed to be carried out is being completed".HCC said it was "not a covert operation" as all the workers were aware of the cameras, they were not manned on a live basis and it just meant the council could see if a complaint was valid.County councillor Terry Douris said it was about "making sure that we are getting the best out of [the contractors]"."We are paying these people and [any inactivity] like that would all come out in the final wash when the final bills are applied for and settled," he said.Mr Williams added the authority would not be compensating traders for loss of revenue because highway works are "something that have to be carried out"."You can't make such a major on-street improvement without closing roads and, unfortunately, affecting footfall," he said.HCC said the installation would cost up to £700, but confirmed connections from the usual town CCTV were being used so, as the area was already covered, any legal permissions were already in place.</body>

      <title>Banned Lee has 'proof' to clear name</title>
      <description>Stephen Lee insists he has evidence that will prove he is innocent of match fixing charges that led to his 12-year ban.</description>

      <body>Banned former world number five Stephen Lee says he has evidence that will prove he is innocent of match-fixing.The 38-year-old was given a 12-year ban and ordered to pay £40,000 costs after being found guilty of seven charges.But he told Talksport: "I have put all the money trails in place to show it is all legitimate and statements from seven players and two top-class referees who saw no wrongdoing."I'm going to clear my name. The facts will be coming out shortly."Lee, who has been a professional for more than 20 years and has won five ranking titles, was found to have fixed outcomes in seven matches in 2008 and 2009.In a 35-page summary of the case following a hearing in Bristol last month, tribunal chairman Adam Lewis QC said three groups of gamblers made a total profit of nearly £100,000 from betting on his matches.The tribunal ruled he deliberately lost matches against Ken Doherty and Marco Fu at the 2008 Malta Cup and agreed to lose the first frame against both Stephen Hendry and Mark King at the 2008 UK Championship.In addition, Lee lost matches by a predetermined score to Neil Robertson at the 2008 Malta Cup and to Mark Selby at the 2009 China Open.Lee, from Trowbridge in Wiltshire, was also found to have conspired to lose his 2009 World Championship first-round encounter with Ryan Day, a match in which he was beaten 10-4.The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) said Lee was involved in "the worst case of snooker corruption that we've seen".The governing body said Lee had been in contact with three sets of people who placed a variety of bets on his matches and added that, on one occasion, half the winnings of a successful bet were placed into his wife's bank account."The money they said had gone into my wife's bank account from betting is all lies," Lee protested. "Complete lies and we've got proof of that."No wrong money has gone into that account at all. It's in the appeal."Hopefully I can come through the other side. I want to get back playing. I really love this sport. There is no way in the world I would ever take any money to lose a frame or a match."The WPBSA said on Wednesday that it had asked Sport Resolutions UK to handle the appeal and appoint an independent QC to chair the appeals committee.</body>

      <body>Glenn Hoddle says England should forget about winning the 2014 World Cup but thinks success is not very far away.The ex-England boss is on a Football Association commission looking at ways of improving the nation's fortunes."It is unrealistic for England to think they can go and win the World Cup in Brazil," Hoddle told BBC Sport."Let's first qualify, then get the youngsters experiencing a tournament in Brazil so that in two years' time we can have a real go at the Euros."FA chairman Greg Dyke has also written off England's chances of winning in Brazil next year and has targeted success in the 2022 World Cup.But Hoddle told BBC Sport's Ben Smith: "I know Greg has said he wants England to win in 2022, but I think we can bring that forward."I would hope to say we could expect to get some success a little bit earlier than that."The former England and Tottenham midfielder thinks youngsters Ross Barkley, 19, and Jack Wilshere, 21, can help propel England to future success.But Hoddle says they need to be given the opportunity to play regular international football first, starting with next year's World Cup.England will book their place in Brazil if they win their final two qualifying games against Montenegro on Friday and then Poland next Tuesday.Roy Hodgson's side currently sit top of Group H, after picking 16 points from eight matches, one point ahead of Ukraine and Montenegro."I do believe we will be there, but it is about the experience that the likes of the Barkleys, the Wilsheres can get under their belt so that we can have a real onslaught at the Euros," said Hoddle, who was England boss from 1996 to 1999.The 55-year-old thinks the chances of England or any European side winning in Brazil next year are slim."No European team has ever won a World Cup in South America," he said."Spain have Europe's best chance, but even then they probably only have a 35% chance. England have got a lesser chance than that. I don't want to put a percentage on that."Hoddle has been joined on the FA commission by Danny Mills, Howard Wilkinson and Dario Gradi,The former England and Tottenham midfielder believes he can make a positive contribution."I really have got some exciting ideas that I want to run across this commission and I hope people will get on board with it," he said."It is something close to my heart, close to my heart for many years."Hoddle admits the number of foreigners in the Premier League is a hindrance and thinks England has a lot of work to do to catch up with other nations.Responding to BBC Sport's State of the Game survey, which has revealed that playing time for English players in the Premier League has dropped to just 31.8%, he feared the situation could get "worse and worse" if no action was taken."We have got to produce better players so they become as good as the Spanish kids, they become as good as the French and the South Americans," he said."We will always create exciting players, like your Ferdinands, your Owens and your Beckhams, but we need 15 of these players every two years coming through."That's what the Spanish have done, that's where the French have done, so we've got a lot of things to change if we are going to catch up. We've been stuck for a very long time."Hoddle also praised Dyke's leadership after meeting the FA chairman and giving him "a vision of how we could improve things".Hoddle, who spoke with Dyke "a couple of months back", added: "I am particularly impressed that Greg wants to change things."He's very successful in what he's done as a businessman and has a different outlook to some of his predecessors."</body>

      <body>Bath and England Saxons winger Tom Biggs is to switch codes to join Super League side Hull FC at the end of the Premiership season.The 29-year-old, who has signed a deal until the end of 2016, has scored 32 tries in 127 union appearances.Bath head coach Mike Ford had played down the possibility of the Beverley-born player switching codes last month."He was keen to have the opportunity to test himself in rugby league and play for us," said Hull boss Lee Radford."He is a local lad and an FC supporter, which you can see means a lot to him, and we're hoping we can nurture that enthusiasm to help him make a positive transition into our sport, which I am sure he will excel in."Biggs, who has also represented England at Under-21 and Sevens levels, was Bath's top try-scorer in the 2011-12 season when he was also named the supporters' player of the year."It's been a desire of his for a while to have a crack at rugby league," Bath director of rugby Gary Gold told BBC Radio Bristol."He's been approached and it's an opportunity for him to play in his hometown."From our point of view, it's very sad to see him go but he's been an outstanding servant for Bath and it's great to see someone fulfil a life-long ambition."Biggs becomes the second player, after Wigan back row Chris Tuson, to join the KC stadium side since Radford replaced Peter Gentle.Radford took over from the Australian after the club's 76-18 defeat by Huddersfield in the Super League play-offs.</body>

      <description>Owners mourn the end of the "infinitely recyclable" Defender</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-24458499</url>
      <date>1381392805</date>
      <body>It's the vehicle that can be patched up "with string" and carry you through deep waters, across Europe and into the Sahara Desert - at least, according to its owners.So there was heartache in the hills and despairing in the dales as Jaguar Land Rover announced it will cease production of its Defender model in 2015 because it will not meet new European laws on fuel emissions.The last Land Rover Defender will roll off the production line in Solihull in December 2015, bringing to an end a 67-year history of different versions of the model."It's a mistake," said Land Rover Defender owner Viv Wing, from Grantham in Lincolnshire. "What are they going to make instead? Something with nice seats and too much carpet, probably."While the luxuries of sleek, modern makes may be what many motor enthusiasts aspire to, it is the all-weather hardiness of the Defender that is part of the charm for its devoted worldwide following."It's a brilliant bit of kit," said Mrs Wing, the secretary of the Leicestershire and Rutland Land Rover Club. "Some people would prefer a Ferrari, but each to his own."For Mrs Wing, who has mobility issues following a riding accident, the Defender is a lifeline, taking her out into terrain she otherwise would not be able to access."I love the countryside and the Defender enables me to get out and see the views," she said. "We went up Stanage Edge in the Peak District in ours the other week."In October 2012, Mrs Wing and her husband Mick joined up with 10 other owners on a 3,000-mile round trip through Europe to the Sahara Desert."One guy's engine flooded, so he stood and fixed it by the side of the road in the desert," she said. "You can do that with a Land Rover."The ease of repair - at least for the pre-1998 models which were constructed with minimal electronics - is another appeal for owners."They're like a big Meccano set really," said Richard Smith, 48, from Redditch, chairman of the Midland Rover Owners Club - the oldest in the country. "They are infinitely recyclable."He uses his six Land Rovers - the oldest, a Series 2, dating from 1959, to take part in trialling and rallies."I've heard of people driving them round patched up with gaffer tape. I knew a guy who drove back from Wales with a piece of string tied round his throttle cable when his throttle broke."The Defender is probably best known for its all-weather roadworthiness. While some cars shrink from extreme conditions, the Defender was built to tackle them head-on.Mr Smith said his members work with NHS on-call medical staff during floods and snowfall to transport nurses to critically ill patients."It's quite fulfilling to be able to help them do that," he said. "Not many people know we are involved in that work."Often the love of Land Rovers is passed down the generations. Simone Birch, from Leicester, claims the vehicles are "in her blood".Both Mrs Birch's two grown-up sons own Land Rovers and her three-year-old grandson can now name all the different models."They have a cult following," she said. "When you pass another one on the road, the driver waves at you."So what will the demise of the Defender mean for devotees?"We'll still be able to get the parts - there are plenty of third-party suppliers," said John Kesterton, from Solihull, secretary of the Midland branch."And while we don't know what the replacement vehicle is going to be, hopefully it will maintain the Defender's off-road capabilities."So does he plan to trade in his 1998 Defender CSW, with 175,000 miles on the clock?"Not any time soon," he said.</body>

      <title>From drug smuggler to going straight</title>
      <description>How ex-prisoner Frank went from drug smuggling to a 'stable life'</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24460089</url>
      <date>1381408161</date>
      <body>As Ofsted inspectors deliver a critical verdict of the education prisoners receive in England's jails, one ex-inmate describes how he finally learnt a vital lesson.Expelled from school at 12, Frank Harris says it was the thought of how he would be remembered by his own children that helped him see education as a way to change his life.The 53-year-old Londoner says he was in and out of prisons for more than 30 years before he found his "way out" through education and wants other people involved in crime to see it is not too late for them either."I wasn't getting any younger. I was thinking, 'What will my four kids do if I dropped down [dead]?'"If they said I was in and out of prison - that I wasted my time on earth. Now they can say I made mistakes, but I tried to do something different. That pushes me on."I'm still enjoying my education and still have something to give back."Frank is in the second year of a degree in criminology and criminal justice. He counsels and mentors others who have been involved in crime and has worked with the police on tackling gang culture.But in 2004 he was facing his longest prison stretch ever - four years for smuggling cocaine from Amsterdam - after what he says was a "lifetime of crime"."I knew I'd be coming out, that I needed to do something, to make a change instead of hanging around with people," he said."I found I enjoyed learning. I had been interested before in lots of things but never had the kind of environment for it to be cool to learn."In prison, he did basic skills lessons before getting A-grades in GCSE English and maths."People saying well done, that inspired me to say I enjoyed doing this education and it was positive. I saw I could change my life, learning and achieving things. I saw education as a way out and that it could be the key to set me free."After leaving jail, Frank says he was very tempted to go back to his old way of life but instead decided to stay in touch with a charity that had supported him inside - the Prisoners' Education Trust - and the St Giles Trust."Normally, I was getting picked up by one of my friends [when I got out of jail], and before I got back to London, I would be stoned and wouldn't get home for two days."The crucial thing this time was there was link. This group had offices you can get in touch with when you get out."Frank says he was on the verge of getting involved with crime again when, he says: "Something told me, 'Don't take the left path, take a right,' and instead, I went down to the offices."He went on take a qualification in counselling to help homeless and vulnerable people and to work for the charity Turning Point.He now counsels others, he says, "to try to stop them taking my path".Like many people in Britain's jails, Frank did badly at school. He had no academic qualifications before studying in prison in his 40s.Expelled at 12, he says he was "delinquent" for 18 months, before being sent to a reform "boarding school", where he says there was no proper teaching."The classroom was a work room and the teachers - who were really PE teachers - used to say, 'Finish that English off, then you can finish making your chair.'"Boys would be banging about while others were doing written work."Frank says things then went further downhill."I'd come home every two weeks - my family would not know me, I had no friends. I'd go around by myself and began breaking in to cars, doing rubbish stuff because I was lonely, bored."Shortly after that, Frank says, he began to get custodial sentences for theft and fraud and "that was it for 30 years".He says he was never involved with violent or sexual crimes, but witnessed violence."People were getting shot in a car next to me; people getting stabbed, but I never picked up a knife in anger. I was smoking crack but I always felt I was on the outside looking in; like I was not meant to be there."Now I know that reason was to say to young men and women, 'You don't have to go that way - it's such a waste.' I'm here to tell that story."If you find yourself on the that road, if you are in prison, there's a way out and it's education."Now I'm a proper father, a proper son, a proper grandfather. I'm stable and I have a family that's stable."</body>

      <title>Premier League one third English</title>
      <description>Premier League now 'less than one third English', study finds</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24467371</url>
      <date>1381399460</date>
      <body>English footballers account for less than a third of all the minutes played in the Premier League, a State of the Game study for BBC Sport has found.The figure for home country players - 32.26% - is down from 35.43% in 2007-08 and is significantly lower than all other major European leagues according to football statisticians Opta.In La Liga, home of World Cup holders and European champions Spain, Spaniards account for 59% of all minutes played. In Germany's Bundesliga, Germans make up 50%.The minutes played by Scottish players in the Scottish Premiership has remained static - 57.36% in 2007-08 and 57.19% so far this season.But Scottish (3.27%), Welsh (3.17%) and Northern Irish (0.93%) players have got fewer minutes on the pitch in the Premier League than French (8.1%), Dutch (4%) and Spanish (6.27%) players so far this season.However, footballers from England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are playing more minutes in the Championship and the Scottish Premiership than they did five years ago.In total, 60.36% of minutes in the Premier League have been completed by foreign players so far this season, up from 56.7% in 2007-08.Former England captain Alan Shearer said: "These are tough times for English football at the moment. Everyone is aware that English football is not as healthy as it should be and I'm afraid it is all going to take time."Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said the figures were a "concern", but added: "There are only two ways you can see it - you have the opportunity to have the best players in the world in England, so let's see what they have and let's produce players who have the same qualities."Or you say, let's protect our players, keep the good players out and let's just play the English players. I believe that we live in a global world. The real question for English football is whether it can produce the players with the needed quality."In a statement, the Premier League said that it was working to encourage the development of home-grown talent, and highlighted the efforts being made as part of the Elite Player Performance Plan, a scheme designed to increase levels of investment and raise the standards of youth set-ups at English professional clubs."The Premier League is one season into the implementation of its £340m Elite Player Performance Plan, the number one stated aim of which is to develop more and better home-grown players," a spokesman said."Significant progress has already been made with club academies independently audited, coaching hours and provision increased, and new competitions established."Young home-grown players, including Daniel Sturridge [at Liverpool], Danny Welbeck [at Manchester United], Ross Barkley [at Everton], Ravel Morrison [at West Ham] and several others, have already made a significant impact this season. The clubs are working harder than ever to develop more home-grown players of sufficient quality to play in the Premier League."The BBC's study examined the minutes played by every nationality represented in the Premier League, the Championship and the Scottish Premiership so far this season, compared with the 2007-08 campaign, the last time all the home nations failed to qualify for a major tournament.The findings come ahead of a crucial few days in England's campaign to reach for next summer's World Cup in Brazil, a tournament that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have failed to qualify for.State of the Game found:Only last month, Football Association chairman Greg Dyke addressed what he called a "frightening trend" of the reduction in the number of English players playing regularly in the Premier League.Against the backdrop of a growing foreign influence in the Premier League, Dyke warned England might not be able to compete seriously on the world stage without changes in the domestic game.Shearer, who won 63 caps between 1992 and 2000 said: "It makes it harder for England, there's no doubt about it."But England didn't qualify for the US in 1994 when the percentage of British players was quite high, so I do believe that it's not only the number of foreign players in the Premier League that is making things difficult for England."I believe there are a number of other things. Foreign players are a lot cheaper than British players and as we all know, managers have no time whatsoever."There is also the hunger of young players and the coaching that players have. If you put all that together, then that's where England are at this moment in time."Chris Waddle, who won 62 caps for England between 1985 and 1991, said: "The Premier League is a great product to sell around the world but for the national team it does a lot of damage."All this money flying around in the Premier League, and grassroots [football] is going backwards."Former Football Association chairman Lord Triesman said it was an "acute problem and getting worse"."Unless there is some sort of ratio idea that Uefa president Michel Platini has been advocating over the years, I expect that we are not going to resolve that problem," he added.Former Northern Ireland international Billy Hamilton, who starred at the 1982 World Cup, said the figures painted a "bleak future" for his country."Unless the Premier League or indeed Championship put some kind of cap on the amount of foreign players then the statistics are only going to get worse for Northern Ireland," he said."Well, if the Premier League don't introduce a cap on foreign players to four or five in a team, I can tell you that England will never win another tournament."David Wetherall, head of player development at the Football League, said he was not surprised the numbers of UK numbers were on the up in the Championship."There's some fantastic youth development work being done in the Football League. About £60m per year is invested in youth development in the Football League, and two thirds of that comes from the clubs themselves."Figures amended at 13:12 BST on 10 Oct because of Serbia being counted twice</body>

      <title>Right town for The Wrong Mans</title>
      <description>Will The Wrong Mans make Bracknell cool?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-24271085</url>
      <date>1381379395</date>
      <body>BBC Two comedy series The Wrong Mans features a character tasked with regenerating the often unloved town of Bracknell. But could the show actually help the Berkshire town overcome its image problem?"If you like James Cracknell. You'll love Bracknell."Perhaps not the slogan the town planning officers had in mind when devising its regeneration, but one that features in The Wrong Mans.While James Corden and Mathew Baynton's creation is a work of fiction, it does touch on an element of reality.Sam Pinkett, Baynton's lead character in the six-part series, is a town planning and noise guidance adviser for Berkshire County Council. He is part of a team overseeing the rebranding of Bracknell to tie in with a new development.While Berkshire County Council may not have existed as a local authority since 1998, Bracknell's regeneration is very much of the moment.Work began in August to demolish a third of the town centre and replace its "Brutalist" architecture with a more modern look. The move has been described by academics as "short term pain for long term gain".In a scene from the first episode of the series, Sam Pinkett is tasked with creating the slogan for the regenerated Bracknell.His suggestions include: "Bracknell's Dead. Long Live Bracknell" and "Bracknell's back on track, y'all".He then decides to tie in one of Berkshire's famous Olympians with the slogan: "If you like James Cracknell, you'll love Bracknell."The rower tweeted his delight at being mentioned in the show, saying it was an improvement on the playground taunt of "James Cracknell smells of mackerel".But Sam finally cracks his slogan conundrum in the second episode, when he coins the phrase: "Bracknell: Small Town, Big Future".But what do the real team tasked with regenerating Bracknell make of it?Although the series is actually filmed in Surrey, Helen Barnett, from the Bracknell Regeneration Partnership, believes the show could change the town's image."The town is in the throes of a major regeneration, so it is not so much RIP Bracknell, but more welcome to the new Bracknell," she said."Part of our job is changing the perception the town has with people who don't live there."Hopefully people like James Corden can help make that happen."But, why choose Bracknell as the home of lead characters Sam and Phil?"Without giving too much away, later in the series it's important geographically where it's set in terms of the plot," said Baynton."But also, we wanted it to be one of those pleasant, small towns where people lead relatively comfortable, quiet lives. It's very important to the contrast of all of this awful, criminal action that descends upon them, that these guys (Sam and Phil) are not prepared for it."Corden added: "We wanted it to be close enough to London, so that if you felt the characters had to go in to the city at any time, that wasn't a million miles away. But, by the same token, we wanted to set it in the South, as that's where Mat and I are both from."Lots of my friends live in Berkshire, my sister lives in Reading and I grew up nearby in Buckinghamshire. It's an area I know quite well and Bracknell was just circumstantial really. We just sort of put a pin in a map and decided it was going to be where we'd set it."The Wrong Mans is on BBC Two at 9pm on Tuesdays until 29 October.</body>

      <title>Freed Libyan PM calls for calm</title>
      <description>Libyan PM Ali Zeidan calls for "caution and wisdom" after being freed from the custody of militiamen who held him for several hours in Tripoli.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24481032</url>
      <date>1381419570</date>
      <body>Libyan PM Ali Zeidan has called for "rationality and wisdom" after being freed from the custody of militiamen.He was abducted from a Tripoli hotel and held for several hours by armed men whose identity has yet to be confirmed.In a cabinet meeting, the PM thanked "real revolutionaries" who took part in a security operation to free him.The motive of the abduction is unclear but some militias had been angered by a US commando raid to capture senior al-Qaeda suspect Anas al-Liby.Many militia groups saw the raid in Tripoli on Saturday as a breach of Libyan sovereignty and there is growing pressure on the government to explain if it was involved.One group, the Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room (LROR), said it had captured Mr Zeidan, claiming it was acting on orders from the prosecutor general. But the justice ministry denied this.The LROR said its actions had not been related to Mr Liby's detention.The official Lana news agency also named another formal rebel group, the Brigade for the Fight against Crime, as being involved.Two years after the overthrow of Col Muammar Gaddafi, Libya still has no constitution and divisions between secular and Islamist forces have paralysed parliament.The government has been struggling to contain the numerous militias who control many parts of the country.Mr Zeidan's cabinet meeting following his release was shown live on Libya's al-Ahrar television.He thanked those who had helped free him but gave no details about them or the abductors.He said: "I salute the revolutionaries who had an important role. The real revolutionaries, those who rose above greedy demands, I salute them for what they did in this affair."Mr Zeidan urged them to "assimilate into the state, and play an active role in it through its civilian and military institutions".He added: "Only with an army and the police can a state exist."The prime minister said of his capture: "These are accidental things from the revolution's overflow and they will disappear."He also said Libya would "regain its health" and be "an active, positive nation".Mr Zeidan ended by calling for "caution and rationality in handling this matter".A spokesperson for David Cameron said the UK Prime Minister had spoken to Mr Zeidan since his release and had promised to help build a "stable, free, peaceful and prosperous" Libya.The spokesperson said: "Both leaders agreed that Libya's democratically elected representatives and leaders must be able to carry out their duties and deliver Libya's political transition free from the threat of kidnap, violence and armed intimidation. A minority of individuals must not be allowed to undermine that."Mr Zeidan had been taken in a pre-dawn raid on the Corinthia Hotel by more than 100 armed men.Photographs circulating online showed Mr Zeidan being surrounded and led away. There were no reports of violence during his capture.In claiming it carried out the attack, the LROR said it was acting on the orders of the prosecutor general and in accordance with a section of Libya's criminal code relating to "crimes and misdemeanours harmful to state security".But Justice Minister Salah al-Marghani said the prosecutor general had issued no arrest warrant, according to state-run National Libyan TV.The prime minister was reportedly held at the interior ministry anti-crime department in Tripoli, where an official said he was treated well.In a news conference shortly before the release was announced, the government condemned the "criminal act" of his detention and said it would not give in to "blackmail".The LROR is one of a number of militias operating in Libya which are nominally attached to government ministries but often act independently and, correspondents say, often have the upper hand over police and army forces.Earlier this week, the prime minister appealed for Western help in tackling rising militancy in Libya.In an interview with the BBC on Monday, he said Libya was being used as a base to export weapons throughout the region.Mr Liby, 49, is believed to have been one of the masterminds behind the 1998 US embassy attacks, which killed more than 220 people in Kenya and Tanzania.He was living openly in Tripoli before his capture by US commandos early on Saturday morning.In remains unclear whether the Libyan government had prior knowledge of the operation to capture him.Libya asked the US for clarification of the incident and has questioned the US ambassador, but the PM also said it would not harm ties with Washington.</body>

      <description>US Republicans offer President Obama a short-term debt limit increase in exchange for negotiations about how to end a government shutdown.</description>

      <body>US Republicans have offered President Barack Obama a short-term debt limit increase to stave off default.House Speaker John Boehner said they would do so in exchange for wider negotiations with the White House to end a government shutdown that took effect on 1 October.Republicans will meet Mr Obama later on Thursday.Officials have warned the US will risk default on 17 October if the nation's borrowing limit is not increased.Mr Boehner said on Thursday: "What we want to do is to offer the president today the ability to move a temporary increase in the debt ceiling in agreement to go to conference on the budget for his willingness to sit down and discuss with us a way forward to reopen the government."A spokesman for Mr Boehner told reporters that the deal on the table ahead of Thursday afternoon's meeting was a "clean" increase of the debt limit, with no additional policies attached.But it would only last six weeks - until November 22.On Wednesday, Mr Obama met House Democrats at the White House and told them he would prefer a longer-term increase of one year to the nation's $16.69 trillion (£10.47 trillion) debt ceiling.But the president said he was willing to accept a short-term rise in the borrowing cap to "give Boehner some time to deal with the Tea Party wing of his party", Representative Peter Welch told the Associated Press news agency after the meeting.Earlier, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told a congressional panel the US could not prioritise between its payment obligations once borrowing was exhausted.Mr Lew warned lawmakers the government could miss pension and healthcare payments for the elderly as well as military salaries.And a missing payment on US debt would trigger a potentially more profound financial crisis, he warned."This system was not designed to be turned off selectively," Mr Lew told a Senate hearing. "It would be chaos."</body>

      <title>Tendulkar to retire from all cricket</title>
      <description>Legendary India batsman Sachin Tendulkar announces his retirement from all forms of cricket at the age of 40.</description>

      <date>1381409632</date>
      <body>Legendary batsman Sachin Tendulkar will retire from all forms of cricket after playing his 200th Test next month.The 40-year-old former India captain, who retired from one-day internationals in December 2012, will end his career with two matches against West Indies."It's hard to imagine a life without playing cricket because it's all I've ever done since I was 11," he said.Tendulkar is the highest scorer in both Tests and ODIs, with 15,837 runs in 198 Tests and 18,426 runs in 463 ODIs.He made his international debut aged 16 in November 1989 and last year became the only batsman in the history of the game to reach 100 international centuries."All my life, I have had a dream of playing cricket for India. I have been living this dream every day for the last 24 years," Tendulkar said.He played his final Twenty20 match last weekend in the Champions League T20 final between his Mumbai Indians team and a Rajasthan Royals side led by another former India skipper, his long-standing team-mate Rahul Dravid.Tendulkar's final appearances will also take place in India and he said: "It's been a huge honour to have represented my country and played all over the world. I look forward to playing my 200th Test match on home soil, as I call it a day."He also holds the record for the most number of Test appearances, with Australians Ricky Ponting and Steve Waugh joint second on 168, followed by Rahul Dravid (164) and South African Jacques Kallis, who is still playing, on 162.The president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, N Srinivasan, said: "He is without doubt the greatest cricketer India has produced."In fact, one should really say he ranks among the top of all-time great sportspersons in the world. No one has served Indian cricket as Sachin has."He has truly been an ambassador for India and Indian cricket. He has been an inspiration for generations of sportsmen, not just cricketers."We respect his decision to retire, although many of us can't imagine an Indian team without Sachin."Tendulkar was tipped for greatness from an early age, and whilst still at school in 1988 he made an unbeaten 326 in a stand of 664 with Vinod Kambli in the semi-finals of the Harris Shield.His first Test century came in his 14th innings and was against England at Old Trafford in 1990.There were six double centuries, the first of which came against New Zealand in 1999 and the most recent a 214 against Australia in Bangalore in October 2010, with his highest score an unbeaten 248 against Bangladesh in 2004.Tendulkar racked up 16 Test hundreds before he turned 25 and in 2000 became the first man to score 50 international tons, while in 2010 he became the first double centurion in a one-day international.It was hoped his 100th international hundred would be in the 2,000th Test match, which was against England at the home of cricket, Lord's, in 2011 but he was dismissed for 34 and 12 and the feat was achieved in an ODI the following year.One of his most memorable Test centuries was an unbeaten 103 that inspired India to victory against England in December 2008 and came shortly after terror attacks hit his home city of Mumbai.Tendulkar was popular across the world, and in 1992 became the first overseas player to sign for Yorkshire, scoring more than 1,000 runs in the summer.BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew said on Twitter:  "Perfect symmetry to Sachin's retirement: 200th Test, not confirmed, surely to be played in Mumbai. Also a charming man to deal with, which I have been fortunate to do many times."Former England captain Michael Vaughan tweeted:  "One of the greatest ever Sachin Tendulkar is retiring. One of my heroes and an absolute joy to play against."And England batsman Kevin Pietersen also took to Twitter  to dub Tendulkar: "Undisputed Champion of Cricket!"In a special BBC Radio 5 live programme on Monday 14 October at 21:00 BST, Mark Chapman is joined by BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew and Indian commentator Prakash Wakankar as they look back at the career of Sachin Tendulkar.</body>

      <body>Prison guards faked logs about their monitoring of Ohio kidnapper Ariel Castro in the hours before he killed himself last month, officials say.An inquiry has found video footage that indicated two guards failed to make checks at least eight times on the day Castro was found hanged in his cell.In August, Castro was sentenced to life imprisonment for abducting three women over a decade.He raped them repeatedly while holding them in his Cleveland home.The Ohio Department for Rehabilitation and Correction published its findings on Thursday.The report said that prison guards had failed to check Castro at least eight times between 15:03 and 20:15 local time on 3 September. He was found hanged at 21:18.The document said that "post log books were falsified" and that "there was no satisfactory verification process in place".It was also revealed that Castro "was found in his cell with a Bible open to John Chapters 2 and 3"."Additionally, he had pictures of his family out and arranged in a poster-board fashion. His pants and underwear were pulled down to his ankles."The convict left no suicide note.The report said Castro's intentions were unclear, however the facts had been "relayed to the Ohio State Highway Patrol for consideration of the possibility of auto-erotic asphyxiation".</body>

      <body>Pakistani ex-President Pervez Musharraf has been arrested over a 2007 mosque raid a day after the country's supreme court granted him bail in another case.The operation ordered by Gen Musharraf on Islamabad's besieged Red Mosque left a cleric and more than 100 others dead.Gen Musharraf is already under house arrest on other charges, but appeared to take a step towards freedom after he was granted bail on Thursday.He insists all the charges against him are politically motivated.Gen Musharraf is facing murder trials over the assassination of Benazir Bhutto and a Baloch tribal leader.He also faces charges over his attempt to sack Pakistan's higher judiciary in 2007. The current government has said it will try him for treason.Thursday's arrest is believed to relate to the death of radical cleric Abdul Rashid Ghazi who was killed when Pakistani troops stormed the mosque after a stand-off with hardline Islamists barricaded inside.Gen Musharraf has been in custody since April after he was hit with a series of charges relating to his 1999-2008 rule shortly after returning from self-imposed exile to contest a general election, won by Nawaz Sharif's party.The general had come to power in 1999 when he ousted Mr Sharif, who was prime minister at the time, in a bloodless coup.After he was defeated by Benazir Bhutto's party in 2008, he left Pakistan to live in self-imposed exile in Dubai and London.</body>

      <title>Alice Munro wins Nobel Literature Prize</title>
      <description>Canadian author Alice Munro wins the 2013 Nobel Prize for Literature, making her only the 13th woman to receive the award since its inception in 1901.</description>

      <date>1381409500</date>
      <body>Canadian author Alice Munro has won the 2013 Nobel Prize for Literature.Making the announcement, Peter Englund, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, called her a "master of the contemporary short story".The 82-year-old, whose books include Dear Life and Dance of the Happy Shades, is only the 13th woman to win the prize since its inception in 1901."I knew I was in the running, yes, but I never thought I would win," Munro told Canadian media.Presented by the Nobel Foundation, the award - which is presented to a living writer - is worth eight million kronor (£770,000).Previous winners include literary giants such as Rudyard Kipling, Toni Morrison and Ernest Hemingway.Mr Englund told The Associated Press that he had not been able to contact Munro ahead of the announcement so left a message on her answering machine, informing her of her win."She has taken an art form, the short story, which has tended to come a little bit in the shadow behind the novel, and she has cultivated it almost to perfection,'' he added.Munro, who began writing in her teenage years, published her first story, The Dimensions of a Shadow, in 1950.She had been studying English at the University of Western Ontario at the time.Dance of the Happy Shades, published in 1968, was Munro's first collection, and it went on to win Canada's highest literary prize, the Governor General's Award.In 2009, she won the Man Booker International Prize for her entire body of work - but she downplayed her achievements."I think maybe I was successful in doing this because I didn't have any other talents," she once said in an interview with Book Lounge.BBC Arts Editor Will Gompertz said Munro had been "at the very top of her game since she started"."Very few writers are her equal," he said, adding "she gets to the heart of what it is to be human"."I thought she might not win because she's not overtly political; and of late the Nobel has tended to go to political writers."The award "probably won't make a commercial difference" to the author, he added, but it "makes a huge difference to how her work will be viewed in historical terms"."If she hadn't won it before she died, I think it would have been a terrible, terrible omission."Often compared to Anton Chekhov, she is known for writing about the human spirit and a regular theme of her work is the dilemma faced by young girls growing up and coming to terms with living in a small town.The Nobel academy praised her "finely tuned storytelling, which is characterised by clarity and psychological realism".Munro, whose daughter woke her to tell her she had won the Nobel, said she was "terribly surprised" and "delighted".Speaking to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), she said she always viewed her chances of winning as "one of those pipe dreams" that "might happen, but it probably wouldn't"."It's the middle of the night here and I had forgotten about it all, of course," she added.Since the 1960s, Munro has published more than a dozen collections of short stories, many of which take place in her native southwest Ontario.Her writing has brought her several awards. She won The Commonwealth Writers' Prize, the National Book Critics Circle prize for Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage, and is a three-time winner of the Governor General's prize.Other notable books include Lives of Girls and Women, Who Do You Think You Are, The Progress of Love and Runaway.In 1980, The Beggar Maid was shortlisted for the annual Booker Prize for Fiction and her stories frequently appear in publications such as the New Yorker and the Paris Review.Several of her stories have also been adapted for the screen, including The Bear Came Over the Mountain, which became Away from Her, starring Julie Christie and Gordon Pinsent.Munro revealed earlier this year that her latest book, Dear Life, published in 2012, would be her last."Perhaps, when you're my age, you don't wish to be alone as much as a writer has to be," she told Canada's National Post.In 2009, Munro revealed she had been receiving treatment for cancer. She also had bypass surgery for a heart condition.Notriously publicity-shy, Munro shies away from public events.According to American literary critic David Homel: "She is not a socialite. She is actually rarely seen in public, and does not go on book tours.Munro will be presented with her latest award at a formal ceremony in Stockholm on 10 December, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, who established the prize.Last year's recipient was Chinese novelist Mo Yan.</body>

      <title>Norwegian suspected over Kenya siege</title>

      <body>Norway's intelligence agency says it is investigating whether a Norwegian citizen was involved in the attack on Nairobi's Westgate shopping centre.The PST said it had sent investigators to Kenya to try to verify the claim.It said it was opening an inquiry "based on information that a Norwegian citizen may have been involved".A Norwegian of Somali origin may have been involved in planning and carrying out the 21 September attack in which at least 67 people died, the PST said."The enquiry will primarily be aimed at helping prevent new terrorist acts and [determining] to what degree the Norwegian... was involved in the attack," the agency said.It added that it would also try to establish if the unnamed suspect had ties to Somalia's al-Shabab, the al-Qaeda-linked militant group which said it had carried out the attack.The PST said it was working to assess any potential threats to Norway and Norwegian interests.Reports have suggested that an al-Shabab leader targeted at the weekend in a US military operation may have spent time in Norway.The 5 October raid failed to capture Abdukadir Mohamed Abdukadir, alias Ikrima. He is thought to be a Kenyan citizen of Somali origin, one of many Kenyan Somalis and other foreign fighters who have joined the group.Norway's TV2 reported earlier this week that Ikrima had travelled to Norway and applied for asylum in 2004 but left in 2008 before there was a decision on his application.Norwegian officials have not commented on the claims.Last week Kenya's military identified four men it said were involved in the Westgate siege. It said Abu Baara al-Sudani, Omar Nabhan, Khattab al-Kene and Umayr were killed during the standoff.Sudani was said to have been an "experienced fighter" from Sudan, who led the group. Nabhan was a Kenyan of Arab origin and Kene a Somali linked to al-Shabab. Details about Umayr were not available.</body>

      <title>Egypt condemns US aid suspension</title>
      <description>Egypt's army-backed government condemns a decision by the US to suspend some of its financial and military aid over a crackdown on Islamists.</description>

      <body>Egypt has criticised a decision by the US to suspend a large part of the $1.3bn (£810m) in aid it receives, following months of political turmoil.A government spokesman in Cairo said the move was wrong and Egypt would "not surrender to American pressure".The US said this week it was suspending the delivery of large-scale military systems and withholding cash support.But US Secretary of State John Kerry later stressed the decision was not "a withdrawal from our relationship"."The interim government understands very well our commitment to the success of this government," Mr Kerry said.He was speaking shortly after Egyptian foreign ministry spokesman Badr Abdelatty criticised Washington's move, saying Egypt was "continuing on its path towards democracy".Since the Egyptian army ousted Mohammed Morsi as president in July, the authorities have clashed repeatedly with his Muslim Brotherhood supporters.The US state department launched a review of its aid to Egypt in August after a crackdown that left hundreds of people dead.On Wednesday, it said it would halt the delivery of Apache helicopters, as well as Harpoon missiles and tank parts.Washington would also halt a $260m cash transfer and a $300m loan guarantee, officials said.The freeze was not intended to be permanent, the state department added."We will continue to hold the delivery of certain large-scale military systems and cash assistance to the government pending credible progress toward an inclusive, democratically elected civilian government through free and fair elections," state department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.The BBC's Kim Ghattas in Washington says the suspension of aid is more symbolic than a painful cut in essential aid.The announcement had been expected, with deliveries of military hardware already halted, a military exercise cancelled, and cash aid in effect on hold since the summer, our correspondent says.The US will continue to provide health and education assistance, and money to help Egypt to ensure security in the increasingly volatile Sinai peninsula.</body>

      <body>Pakistani schoolgirl and campaigner Malala Yousafzai, who was shot in the head by the Taliban, has won the EU's Sakharov human rights prize.The 16-year-old activist was shot a year ago for campaigning for better rights for girls.The Sakharov Prize for free speech is awarded by the European Parliament annually in memory of Soviet physicist and dissident Andrei Sakharov.US whistleblower Edward Snowden had been a contender for the prize.The 50,000 euro ($65,000) prize is considered Europe's top human rights award.Malala rose to prominence in 2009 after writing a blog anonymously for the BBC Urdu service about her life under Taliban rule and the lack of education for girls.She lived in Pakistan's mountainous Swat Valley and her name became internationally known after the Pakistan army pushed the Taliban out of the area in 2009.The Taliban's Islamist doctrine puts harsh restrictions on women's rights and one of the militants shot her as she was riding in a bus with school friends."Today, we decided to let the world know that our hope for a better future stands in young people like Malala Yousafzai," said the head of the conservative European People's Party (EPP), Joseph Daul.Malala received a standing ovation in July this year for an address to the United Nations General Assembly, in which she vowed she would never be silenced.MEPs in Strasbourg said Malala was "incredibly brave" to continue promoting the rights of children. Her new home is in Birmingham, in the UK.She joins a distinguished list of winners of the Sakharov Prize which includes South Africa's Nelson Mandela and Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma, also known as Myanmar. The award will be officially presented at a ceremony in Strasbourg in November.Three jailed Belarusian dissidents were also on the shortlist for the prize this year, along with Edward Snowden, who leaked thousands of documents detailing US National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance activities worldwide.</body>

      <title>Fresh glitches hit Boeing Dreamliner</title>
      <description>Japan Airlines says it has turned around two of its Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft during flights due to technical problems.</description>

      <body>Japan Airlines (JAL) says it has turned around two of its Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft during flights due to technical problems.On one plane one of the two anti-ice systems, which prevent ice building up around the engine, failed.Meanwhile, an electrical glitch made six toilets unusable on another flight.These are the latest technical issues to hit the Dreamliner, which saw the entire fleet being grounded earlier this year following battery problems.The anti-icing system failed on a Tokyo-bound flight that took off from San Diego.A spokesperson for JAL told the BBC that a similar issue had forced a Tokyo-to-Singapore flight to be turned back in June this year.Meanwhile, an electrical system failure connected to the lavatories affected a flight from Moscow to Tokyo.The failure resulted in six of the seven toilets on the plane not being able to flush.The airline said that it was looking into the problems.The 787 Dreamliner has suffered a series of technical and safety problems in recent months.In January, its entire fleet was temporarily grounded. That move was prompted after a fire broke out on one of JAL's Dreamliners, and an All Nippon Airways (ANA) flight was forced to make an emergency landing because of a battery fault and a fire in one of the electrical compartments.Though the planes have since been allowed back into the air, other issues have emerged.In July, a fire broke out on a 787 jet operated by Ethiopian Airlines while it was parked at Heathrow airport. It was traced to the upper rear part of the plane where a locator transmitter is located.Then in August, ANA said it had found damage to the battery wiring on two 787 locator transmitters during checks. US carrier United Airlines also found a pinched wire during an inspection of one of its six 787s.The issues have hurt Boeing.Earlier this week, JAL announced a $9.5bn (£5.9bn) plane deal with rival Airbus. It is the first time that it has agreed to buy Airbus planes, having preferred Boeing for many decades.Analysts have hinted that issues with the Dreamliner may have played a role in JAL's decision.However, despite the issues the Dreamliner is still considered to be one of the most advanced planes in the industry and continues to remain popular.Boeing has received orders for more than 950 jets since its launch.</body>

      <title>World adopts landmark mercury treaty</title>
      <description>Nations have begun signing a legally binding treaty designed to curb mercury pollution and the use of the toxic metal in products around the globe.</description>

      <body>Nations have begun signing a legally binding treaty designed to curb mercury pollution and the use of the toxic metal in products around the globe.Mercury can produce a range of adverse human health effects, including permanent damage to the nervous system.The UN treaty was formally adopted at a high level meeting in Japan.The Minamata Convention was named after the Japanese city that, in the 1950s, saw one of the world's worst cases of mercury poisoning.In January, four years of negotiations concluded with more than 140 countries agreeing on a set of legally binding measures to curb mercury pollution.UN data showed that mercury emissions were rising in a number of developing nations.The convention regulates a range of areas, including:Earlier this year, the UN Environment Programme (Unep) published a report warning that developing nations were facing growing health and environmental risks from increased exposure to mercury.It said a growth in small-scale mining and coal burning were the main reasons for the rise in emissions.As a result of rapid industrialisation, South-East Asia was the largest regional emitter and accounted for almost half of the element's annual global emissions, it said.'Highly toxic'Mercury - a heavy, silvery white metal - is a liquid at room temperature and can evaporate easily. Within the environment, it is found in cinnabar deposits. It is also found in natural forms in a range of other rocks, including limestone and coal.Mercury can be released into the environment through a number of industrial processes including mining, metal and cement production, and the burning of fossil fuels.Once emitted, it persists in the environment for a long time - circulating through air, water, soil and living organisms - and can be dispersed over vast distances.The World Health Organization (WHO) says: "Mercury is highly toxic to human health, posing a particular threat to the development of the (unborn) child and early in life."The inhalation of mercury vapour can produce harmful effects on the nervous, digestive and immune systems, lungs and kidneys, and may be fatal."The inorganic salts of mercury are corrosive to the skin, eyes and gastrointestinal tract, and may induce kidney toxicity if ingested."The Unep assessment said the concentration of mercury in the top 100m of the world's oceans had doubled over the past century, and estimated that 260 tonnes of the toxic metal had made their way from soil into rivers and lakes.Another characteristic, it added, was that mercury became more concentrated as it moved up the food chain, reaching its highest levels in predator fish that could be consumed by humans.Campaigners urged nations to sign the land-mark agreement."Millions of people around the world are exposed to the toxic effect of mercury," said Juliane Kippenberg, senior children's right researcher at Human Rights Watch."This treaty will help protect both the environment and people's right to health."</body>

      <body>Wilfried Martens, who served nine times as prime minister of Belgium and later led the European Parliament's main centre-right group, has died aged 77.He died during the night at his home in Lokeren, in East Flanders, in the presence of his wife and children, Belgium's Le Soir newspaper reports.Mr Martens led coalitions almost continuously between 1979 and 1992.Current PM Elio Di Rupo, a Socialist, paid tribute to a "true statesman and one of the fathers of federal Belgium".In honour of Mr Martens, the European Parliament is holding a minute's silence at midday (10:00 GMT) during its plenary session in Strasbourg.The parliament's German president, Martin Schulz, tweeted that Mr Martens had been a "statesman of Belgium, Europe and an outstanding leader of European Parliament".Mr Martens remained the leader of the European People's Party (EPP), the parliamentary group he co-founded, until his death, only handing over temporary responsibility on Tuesday.EPP colleagues paid tribute to him."A distinguished colleague, Wilfried Martens has passed away," wrote Finnish MEP Eija-Riitta Korhola in a tweet. "My deepest condolences to his family on behalf of the Finnish EPP delegation.""Contrary to what is often said, certain people are irreplaceable," former Polish Prime Minister and MEP Jerzy Buzek tweeted.As prime minister, Mr Martens presided over coalitions that spanned right and left, implementing austerity programmes.The cause of death was not reported. According to Le Soir, Mr Martens said his goodbyes to his family in recent days.He had recently undergone hospital treatment and was due to step down as chairman of the EPP.Only last month, he tweeted to congratulate the German and Austrian conservative leaders on their election victories.Britain's Baroness Margaret Thatcher first became prime minister in the same year as Mr Martens in Belgium, and he paid tribute to his "long-time friend" when she died in April."Although we had very different visions for the future of Europe, we developed a close personal relationship and shared many special moments..." he wrote in an EPP press release."In 1990, just a few days prior to her resignation, I was sitting by her side at a dinner in the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles, discussing her political frustrations. She will always be remembered by her strength, courage and decisiveness."</body>

      <body>Residents in a city in western Japan are to be offered compensation after being attacked by a wild monkey.The city of Hyuga in Miyazaki Prefecture will give 20,000 yen ($205; £120) to each of the 18 victims, the Kyodo news agency reports.The male macaque was eventually captured on 9 September after terrorising the town for one and a half weeks.Among the victims, a man required 20 stitches in his arms and right leg.He was attacked from behind while riding a bicycle.The monkey was cornered in an empty house in a hunt involving 2,500 fire-fighters, police and licensed hunters.It was put down shortly after being captured, AFP news agency reported.The owner of the house was given 300,000 yen in compensation after its walls and ceilings were damaged in the hunt."Considering the seriousness of the situation in which the residents were consecutively menaced and many of whom suffered injuries, we have decided to provide compensation money for this incident," a municipal official was quoted by Kyodo as saying.The compensation decision was approved unanimously by the municipal assembly of the city on Tuesday.A monkey attack alert on the prefecture's website has now been removed.But patrols are continuing in the city in case of further danger, local official Kenji Yoshida has said."But we have not found any other monkeys threatening our people and the city has now returned to calm and normal."Macaque monkeys are common in the wild throughout Japan, where the densely-wooded hillsides provide a habitat.</body>

      <body>Austrian scientists have found that 19 Tyrolean men alive today are related to Oetzi the Iceman, whose 5,300-year-old frozen body was found in the Alps.Their relationship was established through DNA analysis by scientists from the Institute of Legal Medicine at Innsbruck Medical University.The men have not been told about their connection to Oetzi. The DNA tests were taken from blood donors in Tyrol.A particular genetic mutation was matched, the APA news agency reports.Oetzi's body was found frozen in the Italian Alps in 1991.Walther Parson from the Institute told APA, the Austrian Press Agency, that the same mutation might be found in the nearby Swiss region of Engadine and in Italy's South Tyrol region."We have already found Swiss and Italian partners so that we can pursue our research," he said.He was quoted as saying DNA had been analysed from 3,700 men who had given blood donations in Tyrol. They also provided data on their ancestry.Women were not included in the study, as a different procedure would be required to match their genes.Since Oetzi was first found by hikers with an arrow buried in his back, experts have determined that he died from his wounds. There has been extensive debate as to whether he fell where he died or was buried there by others.</body>

      <body>The US Army is working to develop "revolutionary" smart armour that would give its troops "superhuman strength".It is calling on the technology industry, government labs and academia to help build the Iron Man-style suit.Other exoskeletons that allow soldiers to carry large loads much further have already been tested by the army.The Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (Talos) would have such a frame but would also have layers of smart materials fitted with sensors.The suit would also need to have wide-area networking and a wearable computer similar to Google Glass, the US Army said.It should be made of smart material fitted with sensors to monitor body temperature, heart rate and hydration levels.The exoskeleton, which could be attached to arms and legs, would be likely to use hydraulics to greatly increase strength."The requirement is a comprehensive family of systems in a combat armour suit where we bring together an exoskeleton with innovative armour, displays for power monitoring, health monitoring, and integrating a weapon into that," said Lt Col Karl Borjes, a science adviser at the US Army's research, development and engineering command."It's advanced armour. It's communications, antennas. It's cognitive performance. It's sensors, miniature-type circuits. That's all going to fit in here, too," he added.According to US Army Sgt Maj Chris Faris, "no one industry can build it".Instead the army is calling on research and development organisations, private industry as well as government labs and academia to support the project.The US Army said it was likely that scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology would be involved in the design.An MIT team is currently developing liquid body armour - made from fluids that transform into a solid when a magnetic field or electrical current is applied.In an interview with US news site NPR, MIT professor Gareth McKinley compared the futuristic armour to that seen in Hollywood films."It sounds exactly like Iron Man," he said."The other kind of things that you see in the movies... would be the kind of external suit that Sigourney Weaver wears in Aliens, where it's a large robot that amplifies the motions and lifting capability of a human."The aim is the get the Talos armour out in the field within three years.</body>

      <body>The father of fugitive former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden has arrived in Russia to visit his son.Lon Snowden told journalists on his arrival in Moscow that he felt "extreme gratitude that my son is safe and secure and he's free".Edward Snowden was granted asylum in Russia in August after weeks spent in a transit zone at Moscow airport when the US revoked his travel documents.The 30-year-old leaked many thousands of US intelligence documents.The information, published in The Guardian and Washington Post newspapers, revealed extensive internet and phone surveillance by both US and British intelligence.In the US, Edward Snowden faces charges of theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified intelligence.Each of the charges carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence.Lon Snowden, arriving at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, was met by his son's Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena."I'm here to learn more about my son's situation," Mr Snowden told reporters. "My hope is to learn more about his circumstances and his health and to discuss legal options.""If the opportunity presents itself, I certainly hope that I have the opportunity to see my son," he said in televised remarks."I'm not sure that my son will be returning to the US. That's his decision, he's an adult."Lon Snowden has in the past praised his son for speaking "the truth" and making great sacrifices, and has spoken of his concern that he would not face a fair trial if he returned to the US.Edward Snowden accessed many of the documents while working for the defence contractor Booz Allen Hamilton in Hawaii, where he had been living with his girlfriend.As the revelations became public, Mr Snowden fled to Hong Kong where, with his consent, The Guardian revealed his identity in June.To escape US attempts to extradite him, Mr Snowden moved on to Russia where he remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport until Russia granted him asylum.Russia's move added to already tense relations with the US. Washington cancelled a bilateral summit in September.</body>

      <body>Thirteen inmates have been killed and at least 30 injured in a fight between rival gangs in a prison in Brazil.Riot police say they have regained control of Pedrinhas prison in Sao Luis, in the state of Maranhao, and are searching the jail for illegal weapons.Prison guards said fighting had broken out after they discovered inmates digging an escape tunnel.Brazilian prisons suffer from extreme overcrowding and riots and gang warfare are not unusual.The riot started after guards received a tip-off that 60 inmates were digging a tunnel through which they were planning to escape at dawn, Maranhao state security secretary Aluisio Mendes said."When the guards tried to access the cell in which the entrance to the tunnel was located, the prisoners tried to fight them off," he added.Prisoners started a fire and members of rival gangs took advantage of the confusion to settle scores, officials said.Relatives of inmates gathered outside the prison complex demanding information and threw stones at the guards.Several buses were also set alight by the relatives, local media reported.Pedrinhas is notorious for its gang warfare. Earlier this month, three inmates were killed, one of them decapitated.Another was electrocuted when he got entangled in cables used to light an escape tunnel last month.Brazil's Minister of Justice, Jose Eduardo Cardozo, said last year that Brazil had "a medieval prison system, which not only violates human rights [but] does not allow for the most important element of a penal sanction, which is social reintegration".Officials say that despite building new prisons they have not been able to keep pace with the increasing number of detainees, making it hard for them to improve conditions within the jails.</body>

      <title>UN sued over Haiti cholera epidemic</title>
      <description>The UN faces a claim for compensation by victims of a cholera epidemic in Haiti, which victims' lawyers say was caused by peacekeepers.</description>

      <date>1381331536</date>
      <body>Lawyers representing victims of a cholera epidemic in Haiti have filed a lawsuit against the United Nations at a court in New York.They say UN peacekeepers introduced cholera to Haiti in 2010. The disease killed more than 8,000 people and made hundreds of thousands sick.The lawyers are demanding compensation of $100,000 (£62,000) for every person who died and $50,000 for each of those who became ill.The UN says it has legal immunity.Lawyers filed the suit at the US District Court in New York. They said they were left with no other option after the UN had rejected previous claims for compensation."The UN refused to even consider them. We then felt we had no choice but to file in a national court," Brian Concannon, director of the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, which is bringing the case, told the BBC.BBC international development correspondent Mark Doyle says investigations have pointed strongly to leaking sewage at a camp for UN soldiers from Nepal, where cholera is endemic, as the origin of the outbreak in Haiti.No cases of the bacterial infection, which causes diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and muscle cramps, had been recorded in Haiti for a century until the outbreak in late 2010.Then cases mounted quickly in an area near the camp.Leading cholera expert Danielle Lantagne, who once worked for the UN, said in the past that the outbreak's "most likely source" was the UN camp.In February, a spokesman for UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the petition for compensation was "not receivable" under a 1947 convention which grants the UN immunity for its actions.Our correspondent says the UN's position is unlikely to change.</body>

      <title>Taylor to serve jail term in UK</title>
      <description>Liberian ex-President Charles Taylor is to serve his 50-year war crimes sentence in the UK, Justice Minister Jeremy Wright confirms.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24474588</url>
      <date>1381404403</date>
      <body>Ex-Liberian President Charles Taylor is to serve his 50-year war crimes sentence in the UK, Justice Minister Jeremy Wright has confirmed.Finland, Rwanda and Sweden were other possibilities following the rejection of his appeal last month by a UN-backed special court in The Hague.It ruled that his convictions had been proved beyond doubt.He was sentenced in May 2012 for aiding rebels who committed atrocities in Sierra Leone during its civil war.Because of fears his trial could spark renewed conflict in West Africa, it was moved from Sierra Leone to The Hague, and the UK at the time offered to jail him if convicted.Mr Wright made the announcement in a written statement to Parliament, saying it followed a request from the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL)."Taylor will now be transferred to a prison in the UK to serve that sentence," he said, adding that international justice was central to British foreign policy."The United Kingdom's offer to enforce any sentence imposed on former President Taylor by the SCSL was crucial to ensuring that he could be transferred to The Hague to stand trial for his crimes," Mr Wright said.The SCSL found Taylor, 65, guilty of 11 crimes including terrorism, rape, murder and the use of child soldiers by rebel groups in neighbouring Sierra Leone during the 1991-2002 conflict in which some 50,000 people died.He was found to have supplied weapons to the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels in exchange for a constant flow of so-called blood diamonds.The rebels were notorious for hacking off the limbs of civilians to terrorise the population.Taylor has always insisted he is innocent and his only contact with the rebels was to urge them to stop fighting.He is the first former head of state convicted by an international war crimes court since World War II.UK forces intervened in Sierra Leone in 2000, sending 800 paratroopers to protect Freetown as rebel forces were closing in on the capital. They evacuated British citizens and helped secure the airport for beleaguered UN peacekeepers.The British forces pushed back the rebels, allowing the UN peacekeeping force to operate effectively. British forces then stayed on for another two years to re-train the Sierra Leone army.An act of parliament was passed in 2007 to allow for Taylor to serve his sentence in the UK at the cost of the government."The conviction of Charles Taylor is a landmark moment for international justice," Mr Wright said."It clearly demonstrates that those who commit atrocities will be held to account and that no matter their position they will not enjoy impunity."It is not the first time the UK has imprisoned foreign nationals convicted of war crimes.Four men convicted of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia served time in British high-security prisons. One former Bosnian-Serb general was stabbed at Wakefield prison in apparent retaliation for the massacre of Muslims in the UN safe haven of Srebrenica in 1995.The UK also offered to jail the former President of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic, had he been convicted at his trial in The Hague on charges of war crimes and genocide. But he died in 2006 while on trial.</body>

      <title>Kenyan fury as police 'ignore rape'</title>

      <body>Kenyans are outraged that three men accused of gang-raping and dumping a girl in a pit latrine were ordered by police to cut grass as punishment.The 16-year old was attacked after returning from a grandfather's funeral in a village in western Kenya, Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper reports.Her back was broken during the attacks and she now uses a wheelchair.Rights activists and MPs denounced the police for failing to investigate the girl's complaints."Everyone is incensed, to say the least," Saida Ali, executive director of Kenya's Coalition on Violence against Women, told the BBC's Newsday programme.The police were investigating the conduct of officers who dealt with the girl's complaint, Halima Mohamed, the police commander of Busia County, where the attack took place, the Daily Nation reports.The BBC's David Okwembah in the capital, Nairobi, says the apparent failure by police to act on this incident is an example of the incompetence which many Kenyans feel afflicts the force, especially after the recent attack on the Westgate shopping centre.The girl apparently knew some of the alleged attackers, and police recorded a case of assault against three of them.Villagers took the three accused to the local police station after hearing of the attack."The three... were only ordered to cut grass around the police camp and set free shortly after," the girl's mother is quoted as saying.The girl's plight was discussed by the Kenyan parliament's national security committee on Wednesday."It is shocking and unbelievable. We want to get to the bottom of it," said committee chairman Asman Kimama."I want my attackers arrested and punished," the girl told the newspaper."My wish is to see justice done," she said.Ms Mohamed told the BBC police had ordered the girl's mother to "clean her up" after the alleged rape, destroying vital forensic evidence that could be used against the suspects."This is one of many cases of blatant impunity on the part of police," she added.The Nation Media Group has offered to pay the girl's medical expenses and has launched a campaign to bring the alleged attackers to justice."Not only did she suffer a brutal crime that changed her life forever; she was also denied justice," said Ann Gitao-Kinyua, the Nation Media Group's marketing director.Readers of the newspaper and BBC listeners reacted furiously to the attack, describing it as despicable and calling for prosecutions against the alleged rapists and the police for failing to arrest and charge them.</body>

      <title>UK troops praised for Afghan role</title>

      <date>1381421046</date>
      <body>An army commander has paid tribute to British troops, as the deployment of the last major British force to Helmand in southern Afghanistan begins.Speaking at a handover ceremony at Camp Bastion, commander Brig James Woodham praised soldiers from 1st Mechanized Brigade for "a job well done".The 7th Armoured Brigade, the Desert Rats have now begun their mission.They will be responsible for packing away forces' equipment ahead of the final British pullout next year.Troops are not expected to be involved in regular fighting as Afghan forces will now take the lead.But some will remain in the country for nine months, rather than the usual six.Around 100 soldiers from both incoming and outgoing brigades gathered to take part in the handover to the Germany-based Desert Rats.After the blue flag of the Desert Rats was raised to the sound of bagpipes, incoming commander Brig Woodham said he was determined to build on 1st Mechanized Brigade's investment and bring the campaign to a successful conclusion."I congratulate the 1st Mechanized Brigade on a job well done and I wish them a safe and swift trip back to their families."For the Desert Rats - we've got a job to do," he said.Outgoing commander Brig Rupert Jones also praised his troops and said Afghan forces had "exceeded all expectations" while leading for the first time in a summer fighting season.He said he was confident Afghan forces were capable of taking control as UK troops stepped back.He also defended the role that Nato-led International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) has played in Afghanistan.It follows comments made by President Hamid Karzai in a BBC interview which criticised the Nato exercise in Afghanistan for causing "a lot of suffering" and making "no gains".Brig Jones said: "What I hear from local Afghan commanders and governance leaders is that they recognise the job that Isaf have done here for them - that the situation has been transformed - but importantly that they are now ready to take forward the mantle."Operation Herrick 19, the latest deployment, runs until June 2014.A large part of the force is made up of engineers as attention turns to bringing back equipment and disposing of what cannot be returned.Afghan forces will take the lead on all operations, but British troops have enough army and infantry for combat.All combat operations in the country are expected to be over by the end of next year, leaving Afghan forces fully in control.The UK presence in Afghanistan will be almost halved by the end of this year to 5,200.British troops are now placed at five bases - down from a peak of more than 130 - and rarely go on patrol.Six thousand soldiers and 300 armoured vehicles took part in a final training exercise, named Pashtun Dawn, ahead of the deployment.The exercise was the largest on Salisbury Plain for 10 years.Major Chris Hunter, a former bomb disposal officer for the British Army, told the BBC that Afghan forces should now be prepared to lead operations."It's down to leadership. They're certainly trained, they're certainly equipped to carry out the role," he added.</body>

      <body>Australian police say they have seized guns, ammunition and drugs in a series of raids on the Hells Angels motorcycle gang in the state of Victoria.Around 60 properties were raided on Thursday, in an operation involving more than 700 police.The move came days after new anti-fortification laws came into effect, making it easier for police to storm biker gang-linked properties.There have been several cases of biker gang-related violence in recent months."We've located a number of firearms, a large quantity of ammunition, we've located drugs, [and] a large quantity of cash," Acting Deputy Commissioner Steve Fontana told reporters on Thursday.Police found so much ammunition at one address that they needed to "get a trailer in to cart it away", he said.However, he added that police were still searching for "high-powered military-style weapons" believed to be in the gang's possession.On Sunday, Victoria state introduced laws allowing police to remove barriers, cameras and booby traps at biker club facilities during raids. However, police said that Thursday morning's operation was not linked to the new laws.Last week, eight members of the rival Hells Angels and Comanchero gangs were charged in Melbourne over a spate of shootings.Last year police warned that feuds between motorcycle gangs - including a series of shootings in Sydney - were a step away from becoming an all-out war.</body>

      <body>The main opposition candidate in Azerbaijan has called for the results of Wednesday's presidential election to be cancelled over alleged vote-rigging.Ilham Aliyev officially won re-election for a third term, with official results giving him more than 80% of the vote.Jamil Hasanli said the election was not free and fair because of electoral fraud and government control of all television channels.European observers found the election had been "seriously flawed".The election was "undermined by limitations on the freedoms of expression, assembly and association that did not guarantee a level playing field for candidates", the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said in a press release.OSCE observers reported "clear indications of ballot box stuffing" in 37 polling stations and took a negative view of counting at 58% of the polling stations they inspected.According to the latest results available, Mr Aliyev won 85% of the vote to 5% for Mr Hasanli.The Aliyev family has ruled the energy-rich ex-Soviet state for two decades.Human rights groups say the government cracked down on its critics in an unprecedented campaign of repression in the run-up to the vote.Mr Aliyev, who enjoys immense power after inheriting the presidency from his father in 2003, abolished a two-term presidential limit in a controversial referendum in 2009.But political opposition in the country of nine million has also been blunted by prosperity, with oil wealth more than tripling gross domestic product.The president has courted Western states attracted by its strategic location and status as a producer and transporter of oil and gas.Oil multinationals BP, ExxonMobil and other Western companies have invested billions of dollars to tap into Azerbaijan's oil riches.An oil pipeline supported by the US and the European Union to pump Azerbaijani crude oil via Georgia to Turkey - bypassing Russia - went into operation in 2005.The pipeline is seen as an important part of the West's aim of reducing Europe's dependence on Russian energy resources.</body>

      <body>Russia has replaced the head of its space programme, Vladimir Popovkin.The move follows a series of setbacks including an unmanned rocket that crashed and exploded seconds after lift-off.Oleg Ostapenko, who was previously a deputy defence minister, was appointed the new space chief by prime minister Dmitry Medvedev.Prior to his ministerial role, Ostapenko served as commander of the military's space forces.Speaking to Mr Ostapenko, Mr Medvedev said: "You've been engaged in the space industry all your life including at the military posts."Now you are set to be involved with space in a slightly different dimension. No doubt that this topic is complex and requires greater attention from the state."The outgoing Vladimir Popovkin had been in the role for two-and-a-half years. He was appointed in April 2011 during a time of difficulty with the country's space programme. Russia had lost three satellites when a rocket crashed into the Pacific Ocean.Mr Popovkin had pledged to improve manufacturing standards and quality checks, but he struggled to deliver.His time as head was marked by embarrassments including the explosion of an unmanned Russian Proton-M rocket, crashed after its launch from the Russian Baikonur facility in Kazakhstan.The accident was captured live by Russian television in July and the crash spread hundreds of tonnes of toxic rocket fuel.Other countries still depend on Russia to launch manned rockets to the International Space Station.</body>

Five have been wounded.Egypt's security forces have been engaged in a major offensive against Islamist militants in Sinai for weeks.Attacks on security forces have increased since Islamist President Mohammed Morsi was ousted by the military in early July, prompting a large-scale operation by the military.Earlier this week, four people were killed and 45 injured in a car bomb attack on a security building in al-Tour, in southern Sinai.Last month, at least six soldiers were killed in a double suicide bomb attack in Rafah, on the border with the Gaza Strip.The Egyptian military has recently cracked down on tunnels used by militants and smugglers under the border.Local media reports suggest the Egyptian army is considering military action in the Gaza Strip if attacks on its troops in the Sinai Peninsula are not stopped.The Sinai region has grown increasingly volatile since the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak in early 2011.During his period in office, President Morsi took measures to curb the lawlessness, but he was accused by the army of being too lenient.</body>

      <description>The global chemical weapons watchdog urges a ceasefire in Syria to enable it to meet deadlines for inspecting and destroying the stockpiles.</description>

      <date>1381326505</date>
      <body>The global chemical weapons watchdog has called for a ceasefire in Syria to enable it to destroy the stockpiles.The organisation's chief, Ahmet Uzumcu, said the deadline for destroying equipment was "extremely tight", but was possible if truces were agreed.Some early work of the inspectors was disrupted when they came under fire.Under a UN resolution, Syria's chemical weapons production equipment must be destroyed by 1 November and stockpiles must be disposed of by mid-2014."If some temporary ceasefires can be established, I think those targets could be reached," said Mr Uzumcu, head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).He told reporters in The Hague that Syrian authorities had so far been co-operative.He said the inspectors had 20 sites to visit in the coming weeks and had so far completed inspections at one facility.An inspections team came under sniper fire on 26 August, but there have been no reported attacks on inspectors since.The OPCW, mandated under the UN resolution, earlier said it would send a second team to Syria to help meet the deadlines.Meanwhile, the conflict in Syria continues to rage:Some 100,000 people have been killed since the start of the two-year conflict, in which armed opposition groups are seeking to topple President Bashar al-Assad.Chemical weapons are responsible for a comparatively small number of those deaths, and rebels have warned that destroying the weapons will not end the war.On Sunday, members of the joint OPCW-UN mission observed Syrian staff using cutting torches and angle-grinders to destroy missile warheads, aerial bombs, and mixing equipment.Dismantling work is continuing at undisclosed locations all week.The diplomacy that led to the disarmament deal was sparked by a poison-gas attack on 21 August in which hundreds were killed.Western nations blamed forces loyal to President Assad, but he blamed rebel fighters.The UN estimates that by the end of 2014 more than eight million Syrians could have been forced from their homes, and the number of refugees outside Syria could hit 5.2 million.</body>

      <title>More energy price rises expected</title>
      <description>Consumer groups predict that the UK's other major energy suppliers will raise prices after SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24475868</url>
      <date>1381419415</date>
      <body>Consumer groups are predicting that the UK's other major energy suppliers will raise prices after SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills.SSE said its average annual dual fuel energy bill would rise by £106 to £1,380 on 15 November.One industry expert described the move as "the final nail in the coffin for affordable energy", but SSE said that many costs were beyond its control.The decision prompted fevered political debate over who to blame for the rise.Citizens Advice is expecting an "avalanche" of increases but has called on the other energy firms to freeze prices."This price rise will be a blow for stretched budgets," said the charity's chief executive Gillian Guy."I hope other energy firms show an understanding of their customers' financial situation by not raising their prices this winter."Many households are facing a daily battle try to make their frozen incomes cover mounting energy, food and travel costs. Further increases will push people into poverty."SSE said that 8.2% was an average rise. Customers in the North of England and central Scotland would see the smallest increase, of 7%, in their dual fuel price. Customers in the South East of England would see the biggest, up 9.7%.It added that the rise reflected higher costs of buying wholesale energy and paying to deliver it to customers' homes, plus government levies.The move has amplified political debate about the issue of energy bills.Labour leader Ed Miliband, who pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election, described SSE's price rise as a "scandal". He accused the government of "letting energy companies get away with this".But Prime Minister David Cameron branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas.SSE's price rises will affect about 4.4 million domestic electricity customers and 2.9 million domestic gas customers.One of those customers is Gary Waywell, from Somerset, who has been a SSE customer for eight years.He said he was surprised by the size of the price rise and angry at the timing just before winter."I can hardly go to my boss and say, 'would you mind giving me an extra £16 a week for the winter. I don't think he is going to smile at that," he said.SSE's Will Morris said he understood customers' frustration."We're sorry we have to do this," he said."We've done as much as we could to keep prices down, but the reality is that buying wholesale energy in global markets, delivering it to customers' homes, and government-imposed levies collected through bills - endorsed by all the major parties - all cost more than they did last year."SSE, made up of Southern Electric, Swalec and Scottish Hydro, said that for a typical dual-fuel customer, wholesale energy prices had gone up 4%, paying to use delivery networks was 10% more expensive, and government levies were 13% higher.Up to 11% of a customer's bill goes on government programmes to save energy, reduce emissions and tackle climate change, according to regulator Ofgem. SSE said it wanted this to be included in general taxation, rather than added to bills.However, Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: "Half of an average energy bill is made up of the wholesale cost of energy. This far outweighs the proportion of a bill that goes to help vulnerable households with their bills and to cut energy waste."SSE's announcement comes about a year after the last set of gas and electricity price rises.Between August and December 2012, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%.Ann Robinson, from price comparison website Uswitch, which could benefit from consumers swapping suppliers, said: "This is a crippling blow for consumers, who are still reeling from last winter's price hike. Adding to an already sky-high energy bill will leave consumers buckling under the pressure. It's the final nail in the coffin for affordable energy."Of course the danger now is that the other big six suppliers will follow suit. This raises the spectre of yet more households forced to cut back on their heating."The latest calculations from the regulator found that the average profit margin made by an energy supplier on an average £1,315 bill is £65.SSE, formerly Scottish and Southern Energy, said it expected its annual profit margin to average about 5% over a three-to-five-year period, which it believed was "a fair amount".It said its profit margin was 4.2% in the 2012-13 financial year and was expected to fall short of the 5% target again this year."We know we will come in for a great deal of criticism for this decision and politicians will no doubt be lining up to condemn us," said SSE's Mr Morris."But over many years, policymakers themselves have failed to highlight adequately the cost to consumers of the policies they have pursued in government."They can't expect to have power stations replaced with new technologies, the network to be upgraded and nationwide energy efficiency schemes all to be funded for free."And as an energy provider, we are in the unenviable position of having to pass this cost on to consumers through energy bills."The BBC understands that the government is prepared to look at easing green taxes on smaller energy companies. These costs include paying for measures to save energy, reduce emissions and tackle climate change, and also include the cost of social programmes to help vulnerable customers.At present, companies with 250,000 customers are liable to pay the green levy.This threshold could be changed in order to encourage smaller energy companies to enter the market and challenge the big six. Only three smaller energy firms are operating in the UK at the moment.</body>

      <title>Royal Mail sale: Small bids favoured</title>
      <description>Investors who applied for £750 worth of Royal Mail shares will receive their full allocation, the BBC has learned.</description>

      <date>1381415339</date>
      <body>Small investors will be favoured in the privatisation of the Royal Mail, at the expense of those seeking a large allocation, the BBC has learned.Anyone who subscribed for the minimum entitlement of £750 will receive 100% of their application, according to BBC business editor Robert Peston.But those who have applied for £10,000 worth of shares or more, will not receive any, he said.Demand for Royal Mail shares far outstripped the supply.Robert Peston said: "A government source said to me that ministers wanted to reward the Mrs Migginses, but not the big professional investors."Royal Mail's shares will be priced at 330p, which is at the top end of what the government was hoping for and values the entire Royal Mail at £3.3bn.Shares were initially priced between 260p and 330p, but strong demand led the government to revise the figures upwards on Friday last week.There were more than 700,000 individual applications for shares, which far outstripped the value of shares available.Retail investors could apply for up to £10,000 worth of Royal Mail shares online, but could bid for a much bigger allocation if they applied through a stock broker.But the government has decided to favour more modest investors and any applications seeking more than £10,000 worth of shares will receive none.The applications indicate that individual investors had about £4bn to spend on Royal Mail shares, which is much more than the £517m worth of shares on offer.Applications for shares from professional investors also far outstripped the amount allocated to them.Our business editor says that combined, individual and professional investors may have had £15bn available to invest.He also said that individual investors could be allotted as much as 33% of the total shares on offer, up from the original amount of 30%, while professional investors could expect their share to be reduced slightly to 67%.The government will sell 52.2% of the company, the maximum it was prepared to sell at this stage, he adds.That puts the value for the Treasury of the privatisation at £1.7bn.Full trading in Royal Mail shares begins next Tuesday on the London Stock Exchange.However, investors have been able to speculate on the value of Royal Mail ahead of the official start of trading on what is known as the grey market.Financial bookmaker IG Index says that, as of Thursday morning, orders placed by its clients indicate Royal Mail shares could be worth between 405p and 425p each.However, that is just an indication and the market may react differently next week.Under the terms of the share sale, a 10% stake in the business has been reserved for Royal Mail employees.Members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) are voting on whether to strike over the government's privatisation plan.The ballot closes on 16 October and strike action could begin as early as 23 October.Royal Mail says the fundraising will provide it with the money needed to modernise and compete in a competitive parcels market.Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna criticised the government on Monday for "short-changing" taxpayers.In particular, Labour says the privatisation may be undervaluing Royal Mail's property, some of which is in prime locations.However, on Wednesday, Business Secretary Vince Cable told a parliamentary committee: "We're confident that it's priced in the right place".</body>

      <body>Global shipments of personal computers (PCs) have hit a five-year low, according to new figures from the research firm Gartner.Shipments totalled 80.3m units in the three months to September, down 8.6% from a year ago.PC sales have now fallen for six quarters in a row, hurt by the growing popularity of tablets and smartphones.Gartner said falling prices of tablets had further hurt sales of PCs in emerging markets."Consumers' shift from PCs to tablets for daily content consumption continued to decrease the installed base of PCs both in mature as well as in emerging markets," Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner, said in a statement."A greater availability of inexpensive Android tablets attracted first-time consumers in emerging markets, and as supplementary devices in mature markets."Research firm IDC, also released figures on Thursday, which showed global shipments of PCs fell by 7.6% to 81.6m units over the period.Gartner and IDC use slightly different methods to calculate PC shipment data.IDC said it was likely the ongoing decline in PC sales would continue into next year."Whether constrained by a weak economy or being selective in their tech investments, buyers continue to evaluate options and delay PC replacements," Loren Loverde, vice president of IDC's Worldwide PC Trackers, said in a statement.In July this year, IDC had said it was still looking for some improvement in growth during the second half of the year. It has now reversed that view."The third quarter was pretty close to forecast, which unfortunately doesn't reflect much improvement in the PC market, or potential for near-term growth," said Mr Loverde.</body>

      <description>China overtakes the US to become the biggest importer of oil in the world, US government data shows.</description>

      <date>1381407351</date>
      <body>China has knocked the US from its top spot as the world's biggest net importer of oil, US government data shows.The country's fast growing economy, as well as the rise in car sales, has led to its new status, according to September's data.Oil consumption in China outstripped production by 6.3m barrels a day, said the Energy Information Administration (EIA).In the US, the figure was 6.1m.China's own oil supply has been outstripped by its economic boom, and its oil fields have been damaged by flooding during the past few months.The country had to import to make up the shortfall, said the EIA.It predicts the trend will continue into 2014.The US uses 18.6m barrels of oil per day compared to China's 10.9m, despite having a population a third the size of China's.But the US is increasingly able to support itself after the growth of its domestic hydraulic fracturing, or fracking - a new technique of drilling for gas and oil from shale rock.It has attracted controversy from environmental campaigners who are concerned about the large quantities of water used and the potential danger of carcinogenic chemicals. The campaigners say the chemicals could escape and contaminate groundwater.Jason Gammel, Head of European oil and Gas Research at Macquarie, said he expected the trend to last for the next five years.He said he expected America to produce 20 to 22m barrels of oil per day by 2022.Mr Gammel said: "The US has moved very quickly to utilise fracking and horizontal drilling activities."But he said such an approach would be difficult for China to mimic, as the US was already well prepared to take advantage of the new techniques, for example with its large oil field services</body>

      <title>Yellen nominated as new US Fed boss</title>
      <description>US President Barack Obama nominates Federal Reserve vice-chair Janet Yellen to be the next head of the US central bank.</description>

      <date>1381350437</date>
      <body>US President Barack Obama has officially nominated Federal Reserve vice-chair Janet Yellen to be the next head of the US central bank.He called her one of the nation's foremost economists and policy makers.Ms Yellen said if confirmed by the Senate she would do her utmost "to promote maximum employment, stable prices and a stable financial system".She said more needed to be done to strengthen the US economy although progress had been made recently.The president praised Ms Yellen's ability to build consensus and listen to competing views.He added that she was "committed to increasing employment and understands the human costs when Americans can't find a job".If the nomination is confirmed by the US Senate, Ms Yellen, 67, would replace Ben Bernanke, who has held the post for eight years.She has been his deputy for the past two years, and would become the first woman to head the Federal Reserve.She has taught at Harvard University and the London School of Economics, as well as holding a series of senior administrative positions in the US.Ms Yellen, like Mr Bernanke, is seen as a "dove", meaning she prefers to prioritise boosting employment by keeping rates low rather than worrying about inflation.Her nomination had been widely expected since former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers withdrew his candidature last month amid opposition from liberal Democrats.As Democrats control the 100-seat Senate, Ms Yellen's appointment would only need six Republican votes to overcome potential any procedural hurdles.Some conservatives are scrutinising her views on monetary policy and her support for previous federal stimulus efforts.On Wednesday, the second-most powerful Republican in the Senate questioned whether she was the right choice."Ms Yellen subscribes to the liberal school of thought that the best way to handle our nation's fiscal challenges is to throw more money at them," John Cornyn of Texas, the party's whip in the Senate, said in a statement."This stimulus obsession is the reason the nation finds itself in the fiscal calamity it does today, and the last thing we need is a leader at the helm of the Federal Reserve who is intent on more quantitative easing that harms our economy."Senator Bob Corker, a leading Republican on the banking committee, said in a statement: "I voted against Vice-Chairman Yellen's original nomination to the Fed in 2010 because of her dovish views on monetary policy.""We will closely examine her record since that time, but I am not aware of anything that demonstrates her views have changed."But Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said Ms Yellen would win Senate confirmation "by a wide margin".The chairman of the US Senate banking committee, Tim Johnson, said she had "a depth of experience that is second to none"."I have no doubt she will be an excellent Federal Reserve chairman," he added.The BBC's chief business correspondent, Linda Yueh, says the transition from Mr Bernanke to Ms Yellen is likely to be "seamless" and will not have much impact, because the two already work so closely together."I don't think there's going to be a radical change," she said on Radio 4's Today programme, adding that the changeover was unlikely to alter the timing of the Fed's withdrawal of economic stimulus.Ms Yellen's most recent academic post was at the University of California, Berkeley. A former colleague there, Laura Tyson, professor of business and economics, told the BBC Ms Yellen's nomination was "terrific news"."We have an outstanding candidate who is a wonderful match of skills and experience and temperament and reputation around the world at a time when monetary policy is extremely important," she said."Continuity is important and Janet is an outstanding candidate."A former member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve, Prof Randy Kroszner, told the BBC that Ms Yellen was "battle tested" and would be driven by the data in deciding when to reduce support to the markets.</body>

      <title>Forget 2014 World Cup win - Hoddle</title>

      <body>Glenn Hoddle says England should forget about winning the 2014 World Cup but thinks success is not very far away.The ex-England boss is on a Football Association commission looking at ways of improving the nation's fortunes."It is unrealistic for England to think they can go and win the World Cup in Brazil," Hoddle told BBC Sport."Let's first qualify, then get the youngsters experiencing a tournament in Brazil so that in two years' time we can have a real go at the Euros."FA chairman Greg Dyke has also written off England's chances of winning in Brazil next year and has targeted success in the 2022 World Cup.But Hoddle told BBC Sport's Ben Smith: "I know Greg has said he wants England to win in 2022, but I think we can bring that forward."I would hope to say we could expect to get some success a little bit earlier than that."The former England and Tottenham midfielder thinks youngsters Ross Barkley, 19, and Jack Wilshere, 21, can help propel England to future success.But Hoddle says they need to be given the opportunity to play regular international football first, starting with next year's World Cup.England will book their place in Brazil if they win their final two qualifying games against Montenegro on Friday and then Poland next Tuesday.Roy Hodgson's side currently sit top of Group H, after picking 16 points from eight matches, one point ahead of Ukraine and Montenegro."I do believe we will be there, but it is about the experience that the likes of the Barkleys, the Wilsheres can get under their belt so that we can have a real onslaught at the Euros," said Hoddle, who was England boss from 1996 to 1999.The 55-year-old thinks the chances of England or any European side winning in Brazil next year are slim."No European team has ever won a World Cup in South America," he said."Spain have Europe's best chance, but even then they probably only have a 35% chance. England have got a lesser chance than that. I don't want to put a percentage on that."Hoddle has been joined on the FA commission by Danny Mills, Howard Wilkinson and Dario Gradi,The former England and Tottenham midfielder believes he can make a positive contribution."I really have got some exciting ideas that I want to run across this commission and I hope people will get on board with it," he said."It is something close to my heart, close to my heart for many years."Hoddle admits the number of foreigners in the Premier League is a hindrance and thinks England has a lot of work to do to catch up with other nations.Responding to BBC Sport's State of the Game survey, which has revealed that playing time for English players in the Premier League has dropped to just 31.8%, he feared the situation could get "worse and worse" if no action was taken."We have got to produce better players so they become as good as the Spanish kids, they become as good as the French and the South Americans," he said."We will always create exciting players, like your Ferdinands, your Owens and your Beckhams, but we need 15 of these players every two years coming through."That's what the Spanish have done, that's where the French have done, so we've got a lot of things to change if we are going to catch up. We've been stuck for a very long time."Hoddle also praised Dyke's leadership after meeting the FA chairman and giving him "a vision of how we could improve things".Hoddle, who spoke with Dyke "a couple of months back", added: "I am particularly impressed that Greg wants to change things."He's very successful in what he's done as a businessman and has a different outlook to some of his predecessors."</body>

      <body>English footballers account for less than a third of all the minutes played in the Premier League, a State of the Game study for BBC Sport has found.The figure for home country players - 32.26% - is down from 35.43% in 2007-08 and is significantly lower than all other major European leagues according to football statisticians Opta.In La Liga, home of World Cup holders and European champions Spain, Spaniards account for 59% of all minutes played. In Germany's Bundesliga, Germans make up 50%.The minutes played by Scottish players in the Scottish Premiership has remained static - 57.36% in 2007-08 and 57.19% so far this season.But Scottish (3.27%), Welsh (3.17%) and Northern Irish (0.93%) players have got fewer minutes on the pitch in the Premier League than French (8.1%), Dutch (4%) and Spanish (6.27%) players so far this season.However, footballers from England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are playing more minutes in the Championship and the Scottish Premiership than they did five years ago.In total, 60.36% of minutes in the Premier League have been completed by foreign players so far this season, up from 56.7% in 2007-08.Former England captain Alan Shearer said: "These are tough times for English football at the moment. Everyone is aware that English football is not as healthy as it should be and I'm afraid it is all going to take time."Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said the figures were a "concern", but added: "There are only two ways you can see it - you have the opportunity to have the best players in the world in England, so let's see what they have and let's produce players who have the same qualities."Or you say, let's protect our players, keep the good players out and let's just play the English players. I believe that we live in a global world. The real question for English football is whether it can produce the players with the needed quality."In a statement, the Premier League said that it was working to encourage the development of home-grown talent, and highlighted the efforts being made as part of the Elite Player Performance Plan, a scheme designed to increase levels of investment and raise the standards of youth set-ups at English professional clubs."The Premier League is one season into the implementation of its £340m Elite Player Performance Plan, the number one stated aim of which is to develop more and better home-grown players," a spokesman said."Significant progress has already been made with club academies independently audited, coaching hours and provision increased, and new competitions established."Young home-grown players, including Daniel Sturridge [at Liverpool], Danny Welbeck [at Manchester United], Ross Barkley [at Everton], Ravel Morrison [at West Ham] and several others, have already made a significant impact this season. The clubs are working harder than ever to develop more home-grown players of sufficient quality to play in the Premier League."The BBC's study examined the minutes played by every nationality represented in the Premier League, the Championship and the Scottish Premiership so far this season, compared with the 2007-08 campaign, the last time all the home nations failed to qualify for a major tournament.The findings come ahead of a crucial few days in England's campaign to reach for next summer's World Cup in Brazil, a tournament that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have failed to qualify for.State of the Game found:Only last month, Football Association chairman Greg Dyke addressed what he called a "frightening trend" of the reduction in the number of English players playing regularly in the Premier League.Against the backdrop of a growing foreign influence in the Premier League, Dyke warned England might not be able to compete seriously on the world stage without changes in the domestic game.Shearer, who won 63 caps between 1992 and 2000 said: "It makes it harder for England, there's no doubt about it."But England didn't qualify for the US in 1994 when the percentage of British players was quite high, so I do believe that it's not only the number of foreign players in the Premier League that is making things difficult for England."I believe there are a number of other things. Foreign players are a lot cheaper than British players and as we all know, managers have no time whatsoever."There is also the hunger of young players and the coaching that players have. If you put all that together, then that's where England are at this moment in time."Chris Waddle, who won 62 caps for England between 1985 and 1991, said: "The Premier League is a great product to sell around the world but for the national team it does a lot of damage."All this money flying around in the Premier League, and grassroots [football] is going backwards."Former Football Association chairman Lord Triesman said it was an "acute problem and getting worse"."Unless there is some sort of ratio idea that Uefa president Michel Platini has been advocating over the years, I expect that we are not going to resolve that problem," he added.Former Northern Ireland international Billy Hamilton, who starred at the 1982 World Cup, said the figures painted a "bleak future" for his country."Unless the Premier League or indeed Championship put some kind of cap on the amount of foreign players then the statistics are only going to get worse for Northern Ireland," he said."Well, if the Premier League don't introduce a cap on foreign players to four or five in a team, I can tell you that England will never win another tournament."David Wetherall, head of player development at the Football League, said he was not surprised the numbers of UK numbers were on the up in the Championship."There's some fantastic youth development work being done in the Football League. About £60m per year is invested in youth development in the Football League, and two thirds of that comes from the clubs themselves."Figures amended at 13:12 BST on 10 Oct because of Serbia being counted twice</body>

      <body>A printing mix up led to early copies of the latest Bridget Jones book having a chunk of Sir David Jason's memoirs in the middle.About 40 pages of Sir David's My Life were printed in Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, both of which came out on the same day."The printers have had a Bridget moment," said publishers Vintage.It said it was recalling the misprinted copies and replacing them with correct versions."A printing error has been detected in some of the very early copies of Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy," said a Vintage spokesman."Copies printed on one day have given readers an accidental preview of David Jason's autobiography."Both Fielding and Sir David's book were published on what the publishing world has dubbed "Super Thursday", when publishing houses put out some of their highest-priority titles for the Christmas market.Among other books released are Jennifer Saunders' autobiography Bonkers, My Life in Laughs; Mo Farah's Twin Ambitions and John Bishop's How Did All This Happen?Mad About the Boy signals the final chapter of hapless "singleton" Bridget Jones's diaries.Fans may already know one of the significant plotlines after extracts were earlier published in the Sunday Times Magazine.Although Fielding herself approved the reveal, some fans were shocked to be told of such a major twist before the book had even been published.</body>

      <title>Bacon painting could make $85m</title>
      <description>A painting by Francis Bacon of his friend and fellow artist Lucian Freud is expected to sell for at least $85m (£53m) when it is auctioned for the first time in New York next month.</description>

      <body>A painting by Francis Bacon of his friend and fellow artist Lucian Freud is expected to sell for at least $85m (£53m) when it is auctioned for the first time in New York next month.The triptych, Three Studies of Lucian Freud (1969), is considered to be one of Bacon's greatest masterpieces.It will have its first ever UK public viewing at Christie's from 13 to 18 October during Frieze Art week.A smaller, preparatory triptych of Freud sold at auction for £23m in 2011.Three Studies for a Portrait of Lucian Freud, painted in 1965, had been expected to sell for between £7m and £9m.Francis Outred, head of Post-War and Contemporary Art at Christie's, Europe said the Three Studies of Lucian Freud, completed four years later, was "a true masterpiece and one of the greatest paintings to come up for auction in a current generation"."It is an undeniable icon of 20th Century art and a painting that Bacon preserved as one of his favourites."Outred said the first public unveiling of the complete painting in London was "quite a moment"."The work is a very important international painting but it's also a conversation between two masters who happen to be British."It marks Bacon and Freud's relationship, paying tribute to the creative and emotional kinship between the two artists," he added.Bacon and Freud met in 1945 and became close companions, painting each other on a number of occasions, before their relationship cooled during the 1970s.Bacon, known for his triptychs, painted Three Studies of Lucian Freud in 1969 at London's Royal College of Art, after his studio was destroyed in a fire.With its sunshine yellow background, it is an "extraordinary piece of paintwork" and one of only two existing, full length triptychs of Freud.The other, painted in 1966, was last seen in 1992, according to Outred, "but no one knows where it is".Exhibited in Bacon's renowned retrospective at the Grand Palais, Paris in 1971-1972, the three panels that form the painting were separated for almost fifteen years in the mid-1970s.One panel was shown at the Tate in 1985 before the three sections were reassembled in their original splendour.The complete work was displayed in New Haven, Connecticut in 1999.According to the curator Martin Harrison: "Bacon was deeply distressed when the triptych was dismantled, noting on a photograph of the left panel that it was only 'a fragment of a triptych… and I think it is meaningless unless it is united with the other two panels.'"Its reassembly into the form he intended would, if he lived to see it, have caused him profound satisfaction, given that this was among the surprisingly small number of his paintings he held in high regard."</body>

      <title>Katzenberg: My $75m Breaking Bad bid</title>
      <description>The CEO of DreamWorks Animation, Jeffrey Katzenberg, reveals he offered to pay $75m for three new episodes of hit series Breaking Bad to form part of a pay-per-view TV experiment.</description>

      <date>1381406561</date>
      <body>Jeffrey Katzenberg, the CEO of DreamWorks Animation, has revealed he offered to pay $75m (£47m) for three new episodes of Breaking Bad.He told Mipcom TV festival in Cannes that he wanted to air the hour-long episodes online, in six-minute chunks.Mr Katzenberg hoped the subscription service would prove the "greatest pay-per-view television event for scripted programming anybody's ever done".Hit AMC drama Breaking Bad came to a dramatic finale earlier this month."There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that millions of people would have downloaded those episodes," said Mr Katzenberg of his attempt to prolong the show's life beyond its five seasons.Elaborating on the unsuccessful Breaking Bad pitch, Mr Katzenberg told The Guardian newspaper: "My idea was literally that you'd pay 50 cents a day for 30 days, so it would be $15, and I actually think there are 10 million people around the world that would have done that."That's $150m, so the $75m I was prepared to pay would have delivered a 100% return on investment. And I'm trying to get people to think about this space in a new way by telling that story. It's emblematic of an opportunity coming."While giving Mipcom's keynote speech, he told TV executives that distributors would continue to pay a premium for high-quality content, whether it lives on traditional television or online.According to The Hollywood Reporter, the DreamWorks chief recently paid $33m (£20.7m) for Brian Robbins' YouTube channel AwesomenessTV, a deal he said is an "enormous opportunity".It currently has 909,000 subscribers and 176 million views and it has spawned a successful Nickelodeon series of the same name, utilising the YouTube content."It gets us directly in touch with the teen audience in a way that movies and TV can't," said Mr Katzenberg.He made the point that younger consumers are not only watching more content online, but are far more engaged with content viewed on touch-screen devices than they are with traditional televisions.Mr Katzenberg said the internet is "a great incubator of talent and concepts" and has the "ability to drive viewers" to television, as it has already been doing with AwesomenessTV.DreamWorks Animation also has a five-year deal to create 300 hours of original "kid-targeted" content for Netflix."Whether the media is old or the media is new, content continues to drive success," said Mr Katzenberg.He insisted films would remain the "heart and soul" of the DreamWorks Animation brand but it would "look like a very different company" in 15 years time.</body>

      <title>The revenge of China's scorned mistresses</title>
      <description>How China's scorned mistresses take their revenge</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-24394243</url>
      <date>1381369692</date>
      <body>Lust, power and corruption can make for an explosive mix. An unlikely whistle-blower for President Xi Jinping's much publicised crackdown on official corruption has emerged - the scorned mistress.In recent weeks their public accounts have offered a rare glimpse of the extravagant lifestyles of the Communist Party elite, enraging the Chinese public.The most high-profile case is that of Ji Yingnan - a mistress who shamed her former lover in the full glare of China's hundreds of millions of microblog users.Sensationally, the 26-year-old identified him as Fan Yue, a deputy director at the State Administration of Archives.This summer Ms Ji posted videos and pictures of the couple on the internet. There were pictures of the couple enjoying shopping sprees, splashing about in a private swimming pool, and at a party where the official asked his mistress to marry him.According to Ms Ji's account, she exposed her boyfriend after discovering he was married with a teenage son."I had no idea he was such a liar," Ms Ji, the TV presenter, told the Global Times, a Chinese newspaper."He always promised to marry me and I always thought he would be my fiance, or even husband."But what shocked the public were the staggering sums of cash involved. According to the mistress, her lover gave her more than a $1,000 (£600) a day in pocket money, a luxury car and promises of an apartment.She told the Global Times that she initially reported Mr Fan to the authorities, believing he was involved in corruption. But she said she never received a reply and then decided to post her allegations online.The details of her lavish lifestyle raised the obvious question: how could her lover afford all this on a modest government salary?According to the state-run news agency, Xinhua, Mr Fan was sacked from his job in June and is now being investigated over the corruption allegations. The BBC could not reach Mr Fan for comment.One of the main sites that posted the revelations is run by Zhu Ruifeng, an anti-corruption blogger. He shot to prominence last year after posting an explosive sex tape starring a government official, Lei Zhengfu, which triggered a corruption investigation, ultimately landing the official in jail.With the growing power of the internet, details that would have once remained private are now leaking into the public domain.Sex scandals, of course, happen in all countries. But the difference in China, says Mr Zhu, is that government officials are using public money to pay for their love lives."In China nothing is clear," he says, "The public don't know what officials are up to. But mistresses live with government officials, they spend their money, they know about everything that goes on."When a mistress stands up, the truth comes out."A powerful energy official, Liu Tienan, was sacked from his post in May after his former mistress told a journalist that her lover had helped defraud banks of $200 million.Mistresses have become the ultimate symbol of corruption in China. According to a government report in 2007, an astonishing 90% of top officials brought down by corruption scandals had kept a mistress - and in many cases they had more than one.Former Railways Minister Liu Zhijun, jailed for corruption earlier this year, reportedly kept 18 mistresses.I met a 26-year-old who told she me was once a mistress. With her long, black hair and designer clothes, she looked like she had just stepped off a catwalk.She did not want to be identified, but told me her lover was a top company executive. She says that she witnessed corruption."Businessmen and officials work together very closely," she said. "A government official asked my boyfriend for a favour. But this time, he didn't want money. He wanted my boyfriend to get him a mistress."Mistresses are nothing new in China. Emperors were renowned for keeping concubines. But China's top sexologist, Li Yinghe, believes that many Chinese men believe they are still living in imperial times."I think many Chinese men have an emperor's complex," she says. "Being an emperor means you can have many women. This is something they are proud of. They see women as trophies of their success."Little wonder then that the ruling Communist Party is now trying to stop its pillow talk becoming public.In May, the People's Daily newspaper - the mouthpiece of the party - ran an editorial saying that the country cannot count on mistresses to expose corruption."Some [mistresses] directly solicit bribes or seek huge illegal profits," it said. "To pin anti-corruption hopes on them is to go in for evil attacking evil."In recent weeks, authorities have also introduced tougher measures to control the internet - where many of the revelations have emerged. It is clear that the party wants to draw a veil over its most intimate secrets.</body>

      <title>NSA chief pledges more transparency</title>
      <description>US electronic spy agency chief speaks to the BBC</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24470450</url>
      <date>1381407161</date>
      <body>The US electronic spy agency is committed to being more transparent, a senior official has told the BBC.In a rare interview on a recent visit to London, National Security Agency (NSA) Deputy Director Chris Inglis spoke to the BBC about cyber-security.His comments came in the wake of revelations about the agency's work from former contractor Edward Snowden.Mr Snowden's leaks sparked a debate about secrecy and the scale of the agency's powers.In the interview, Mr Inglis said there was a need to consider the balance between secrecy and transparency in order to have the public's confidence.With the world becoming more reliant on the internet, Mr Inglis outlined concerns over three threats in cyberspace: the theft of intellectual property and secrets; disruption of networks (for instance, attacks that have taken websites of American banks offline in recent months); and destructive acts such as those that targeted Saudi Aramco last year, destroying tens of thousands of computers."There is no failure of imagination in this space," he said of those seeking to exploit the internet.Dealing with threats requires more being done by both the private sector and the government to better defend networks and deter adversaries, he said.Responses to cyber attacks - such as those on American banks, which many commentators believe came from Iran - needed to be carefully thought through and might involve a range of tools, the NSA's number-two said."If at the end of the day we were to determine that those were attributable to another nation state, then surely we might think that is then the crossing of a red line," Mr Inglis said. "But the response should be proportionate," adding that it may come from the private sector rather than government.Dealing with commercial espionage in cyberspace, he said, might also involve a range of measures including private or public diplomatic pressure and the targeting of individuals for criminal prosecution.The job of the NSA, Mr Inglis said, was to exploit networks to collect intelligence in cyberspace and to defend certain networks - but not carry out destructive acts."NSA had a responsibility from way back, from our earliest days, to both break codes and make codes," he said. "We have a responsibility to do intelligence in a space we once called the telecommunications arena - now cyberspace - and the responsibility to make codes or to defend signals communications of interest."That's different than what most people conceive as offence or attack in this space."That task of destructive cyber attack, if ordered, lies with the US military's rapidly expanding Cyber Command.However, both the NSA and Cyber Command are led by the same man - General Keith Alexander - because the three fields of exploiting, defending and attacking are closely related."We realised a long time ago that the predicate for all those actions is first understanding how cyberspace works," Mr Inglis said. "Second: finding, fixing, holding in your mind's eye the thing that you would either defend, or exploit or attack. And then - and only then - do you make that final choice about what you are going to do about that."At least in the military component, the US has chosen to invest all those things in a single person such that that person may then orient and synchronise those activities in a way that they complement each other."Mr Inglis has worked for more than 25 years in the NSA, the last seven as deputy director, the highest-ranking civilian.There is no doubt that the last few months will have been the most difficult as the NSA - which was so secret people used to joke that its initials stood for "no such agency" - has been thrust into an uncomfortable spotlight by the leaks by Mr Snowden."I do think there needs to be more transparency," Mr Inglis told the BBC."We've had a discussion many times across the summer about the need to perhaps rebalance the balance between national security and civil liberties," he said."I don't think that is the case. I think that both of those must be given equal and full support. I don't think that we trade one for the other."But I do think we have to consider the balance between secrecy and transparency in order to have the public's confidence or [that of] those who stand in the shoes of the public and act on their behalf, say in the Congress," Mr Inglis added. "There needs to be greater transparency and we are committed to that."The revelations from Mr Snowden have indicated a scale of capability that has surprised even close observers of the NSA and its British partner GCHQ, and this has raised concerns over whether the capabilities are sufficiently accountable."I can appreciate that people are nervous," Mr Inglis said."And we ourselves at NSA need to respect that and therefore offer up whatever is necessary in terms of transparency to secure the confidence of our overseers and beyond them the American public - and for that matter allies."One of the tensions for the NSA over many years is the balance between its two roles of defending networks and exploiting them for intelligence.The most controversial revelation within the cyber security community was the claim that the NSA had been deliberately weakening some of the security protocols surrounding encryption, either by introducing back doors or by modifying international standards to ensure it could gain access to gather intelligence on its targets."What we have found over time is that our adversaries are using precisely the same communication systems, services, pathways as our citizens," Mr Inglis told the BBC."But in pursuing our adversaries we must also defend our citizens," he said. "We must not hold them at risk. And so we do try to crack the encryption used by terrorists and other adversaries in that system. We need to make sure that we do not hold at risk the encryption that is used by US citizens.""So that's rule one and we do in fact find ways to do precisely that," he added. "It is false to imagine or say that NSA broadly has the capability to decrypt most of the encryption that is used by any citizen in the world but in particular US citizens."The revelations by the Guardian newspaper that the NSA was collecting metadata about US communications raised concerns that the agency was getting involved in domestic surveillance.Mr Inglis argued that this collection operated under constraints."Beyond saying that I'm not Big Brother I think we are committed to demonstrating we are not Big Brother," he said, adding that this would involve illuminating the controls on the NSA's actions and performance statistics on those controls.Even beyond the revelations by Mr Snowden, the role of the NSA in cyberspace and the resulting questions of where responsibility lies for defence, intelligence gathering and attack mean the agency is unlikely to be able to retreat back into the secrecy that it enjoyed for so long.</body>

      <description>The Italian village wiped out by a wave</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24464867</url>
      <date>1381392165</date>
      <body>Fifty years ago Italians woke to news of a disaster of Biblical proportions. At a stroke - in an Alpine valley north of Venice - some 2,000 people had been killed, entire communities wiped off the face of the Earth. It was, according to the UN Scientific and Cultural agency Unesco, one of the worst man-made environmental disasters of all time.The inscription on the little town's war memorial promises that the sacrifice of those who died fighting for their country will never be forgotten.Look beyond it, east across the valley of the Piave, and you see a vast white dam, high up in the cleft of a narrow gorge, its concrete wall reflecting the rays of the setting sun. The dam is called Vajont. And it, too, is a memorial of sorts.When built, it was the tallest dam of its kind in the world, harnessing the waters of a small mountain torrent to create a lake meant to generate hydroelectric power for northern Italy's postwar economic miracle. But the engineers and geologists had ignored the warnings of locals that the land was unstable and that their work had triggered worrying seismic movements.Late on the evening of 9 October 1963, a vast chunk of the mountainside, the size of a small town and 400m (1,312ft) deep, sheared off.Forty-five seconds later, travelling at 100km/h (62mph), it plunged into the new artificial lake, creating an inland tsunami that rose more than 200m above the dam before plunging headlong towards Longarone, directly in its path.The wall of water pushed an air pocket before it. It was more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb. So strong, in fact, that almost all the victims were found naked, their clothes blown off by the blast.Grainy black and white footage from the next day shows a moonscape, a valley scoured clean of life. The survivors - the rescuers too - look tiny, dazed, insignificant.The dam survived but 80% of the inhabitants of Longarone and its satellite villages did not. In all, almost 2,000 people are known to have died - but the final death toll will never be known.Just 30 of Longarone's children lived. One of them was Micaela Colletti, 12 at the time. She lost her parents, a sister and her grandmother. They only ever identified her father. Today, she campaigns to preserve the memory of the victims and the lessons to be learnt.The swallows swooped and screeched as Ms Colletti recalled the evening of 9 October: "My father returned home from work as normal but almost straightaway he left again in the car, which had never happened before."Five minutes later I heard what I thought was a thunderclap. It was incredibly loud. My granny came into my room and said she was going to close all the shutters because a storm was coming."At exactly the same moment all the lights went out and I heard a sound, impossible to describe properly. The closest thing I've ever heard to it is the sound of metal shop shutters rolling down, crashing shut, but this was a million, a billion times worse."I felt my bed collapsing, as if there was a hole opening up beneath me and an irresistible force dragging me out. I couldn't do anything. I had no idea what was happening."She was hurled more than 350m through the air and buried."When they pulled me out there was a popping sound, like when you open a bottle, and someone said 'We've found another old one'. I was just 12 but I was covered in mud and completely black and must have looked like an old woman."I remember I was on the shoulders of the only fireman from the town to survive and he kept stumbling over these bright, incredibly white, translucent rocks and I kept asking him to put me down, but he wouldn't."And there was this huge moon so close and so bright it scared me. I felt if I stretched out my hand I could touch it. I've never seen a moon like it, so close and so huge."Then they put me in a car and I heard someone crying and I suddenly realised it was me."We were walking down a rough track across the chunk of mountainside that had sheared off, down and into the lake. From afar - from the village of Casso hanging high above the dam on the other side of the valley - the scale of the landslide is mind-boggling.The track led down, through rock and scrub, to the side of the dam, the sound of the torrent barely audible more than 200m below. Ms Colletti was talking about the daily struggle to make sense of her disaster."Even if you leave, you take it with you," she said. "It's better to confront reality every day, because you need to make sense of it."For six years after the disaster, she lived her own dream. She fell in love. Before she knew it she was married, became pregnant, and then, on 9 October 1969, six years to the day after the disaster, she lost the baby girl she had been expecting.And at that moment, she said, she understood that she had to wake up: "I had a choice: either I killed myself because it was all too much or I lived day by day, one day at a time."The simplest things still catch her out: the sight of a mother and daughter out shopping for clothes together, a mother with her daughter, dressed for her wedding."It's better to confront these little sadnesses," she said."Because sooner or later these things will arrive and if you've tried to hide from them the blow is even harder. If you don't have the moral courage to look fino in fondo -- into the depths - you learn nothing."How can you teach anyone else anything if you don't know yourself?"Fifty years on, another reality is encroaching. Renato Migotti is an architect. He, too, survived the disaster while most of his schoolmates did not.He said it was time to pass the responsibility for maintaining the memory of Vajont to the next generation."Our testimony has to pass to our children and grandchildren, so that they can carry on the memory of Vajont even when we are no longer here," he said."Together we have to begin the process of transforming our personal testimony into lasting history."Alessio Riccardo is 25, a member of that next generation."Physically, Longarone has been rebuilt," he said."But the society, the community has not been completely built. People who were here before 1963 think that anyone who arrived here after the tragedy is a stranger, a foreigner. This is a type of thinking that we must change."It was not hard to spot the headstone of Ms Colletti's father in the cemetery at Fortogna where the victims of the disaster are buried.Flowers are banned here, photographs too, but the headstone bearing the name of her father defiantly bears a battered picture of him as she likes to remember him: dashing, debonair, a cigarette in one hand.The cemetery is a neat but cold and impersonal place. It was not always so. A few years ago, the local authorities were given money to renovate it. Where once there was a very human - and very Italian - clutter of personal memorials and memories, they imposed order.Even worse, says Ms Colletti, it is a lie. In place of the jumble of memorials to the 700 or so victims whose bodies were identified and laid to rest by their families - and the far greater number of unmarked graves of the unknown - they imposed uniformity and order.Today every victim has his or her own headstone but they bear no relation to the remains that lie beneath.Ms Colletti used to know where her father lay. Now she does not. His headstone lies next to that of her mother, sister and grandmother, none of whose bodies were ever found."It is," she said, "like losing your father all over again.

We compared this with data from the whole of the 2007-8 season.You can see just how things have changed on the world map of UK football by clicking on individual countries. The darker the colour the more minutes players from that country have played.The figures are supplied by Opta and based on percentages of all minutes played per nation in the 2007/08 season, and the 2013-14 season to Oct 1, 2013.• Figures amended at 13:00 BST due to Serbia being counted twice</body>
