      <body>WH Smith has taken its UK site completely offline until all abuse-themed e-books are removed from its product listings.The move comes after last week's revelations that Amazon, WH Smith, Barnes and Noble, and other retailers were selling pornographic e-books featuring incest, rape and bestiality on their sites.WH Smith said it was "disgusted" by such titles and found them "unacceptable".It takes e-book content from Kobo.com.In a statement Kobo said it was "working quickly to review its catalogue and remove the content, authors and publishers in question"."We are also evaluating new procedures to help ensure that this type of content will not become available... in the future," it said.Meanwhile visitors to the WHSmith.co.uk website were greeted by a holding page statement.The retailer said it had taken the site offline "to best protect our customers and the public"."Our website will become live again once all self published e-books have been removed and we are totally sure that there are no offending titles available", it said."We sincerely apologise for any offence caused."While Kobo said some publishers and authors had violated its self-publishing policies, it maintained that its goal was "not to negatively impact the freedom of expression and the work of the amazing self-published community that has been created at Kobo.com."Over the weekend US retailing giant Barnes and Noble said offending titles were "in violation" of its policy on content offered in the NOOK Bookstore and were in the process of being removed."When there are violations to the content policy that are brought to our attention, either through our internal process or from a customer or external source, we have a rapid response team in place to appropriately categorise or remove the content in accordance with our policy," it said.Self-published e-books have grown massively in popularity along with the growth in digital e-readers and tablet computers, but retailers have been struggling to filter explicit content that breaches their website guidelines.On Friday, technology news site The Kernel revealed how Amazon, Barnes and Noble, WH Smith, Waterstones and Foyles were listing what it called "breathtakingly obscene" books on their websites.But Fiona Allen, spokeswoman for Waterstones, told the BBC: "None of the e-books mentioned in current reporting are now or ever have been available in Waterstones shops or listed on Waterstones' website."She admitted that Waterstones was concerned about some print titles and was investigating those, but that all such printed book data was supplied by Nielsen, a data provider.</body>

      <body>Google is facing a backlash over plans to put people's faces and comments about products and places into adverts.The "shared endorsements" policy change starts on 11 November and covers the comments, "follows" and other actions people do on Google+.One protest involves people swapping their profile pictures for that of Google boss Eric Schmidt so his image rather than their own appears on ads.Google said it had made it easy for people to opt out of the system.The search giant started alerting people about the upcoming policy change via banners on its main webpage and in a page explaining the change to its "policies and principles".Google also gave examples of how the "shared endorsement" system might work. This showed people's faces and comments appearing below Street View images of a bagel shop and search results for products and places.Many people protested about the change to Google, and some altered their image profiles on the Google+ social network in response.So far, Google has not issued an official comment about the protests over "shared endorsements". However, in its explanatory pages it said it was easy to opt out of the system by clicking a box on the Google+ account settings page.It warned that if people did not want to be part of the programme some of their comments and follows may no longer be visible to others they know on Google+.Social network Facebook faced strong criticism over a similar system called "sponsored stories" it rolled out in 2011.Legal action following the criticism eventually led to Facebook paying out $20m to compensate people whose images it used without permission.</body>

      <body>Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's Twitter feed briefly followed a Persian erotica account before unfollowing it on Sunday, The Times of Israel reports.The PM's Twitter account, @Netanyahu, followed some 90 accounts, mainly of Israeli embassies and the government, at the time, the paper said.But one of the most recent it was following was @PersianHotBook, it said.The PM's Likud party later said it managed the page and that it was investigating a "malfunction"."It was a malfunction and the issue will be checked. In any case, the account was removed immediately," Likud is quoted as saying by reporter Chico Menashe from Israel Radio in a tweet.The page @PersianHotBook describes itself as "the first library of hot sex books [in the] Persian language".Early on Sunday, the page only had 15 followers, one of which was the prime minister's account, the newspaper reported.But later the prime minister's Twitter feed no longer followed @PersianHotBook, it said, and had also stopped following other feeds, bringing down to 81 the number of feeds it was following.This gave rise to amused comments on social media sites, with one user interpreting the interest as a desire to want "to see the real Iranian weapon of mass destruction".Last week, in an interview with the BBC Persian service, Mr Netanyahu said that if Iranians were free they would wear blue jeans, and listen to Western music.His comments led to reactions from Iranians in Iran and abroad on social media sites, with many posts showing mainly young Iranians wearing jeans and listening to Western music, some in comic poses.</body>

      <body>Apple should use its enormous cash reserves to make some big-name acquisitions, the company's former boss John Sculley has said.He said it could shift the "whole landscape of e-commerce" if it bought, for example, eBay.He said it should ignore the wishes of activist investor Carl Icahn, who wants the company to buy back stock."Apple's about building great products, building and shaping markets," Mr Sculley said."Carl Icahn has suggested to [Apple chief executive] Tim Cook, 'Why don't you buy more stock back or make a bigger dividend?'"I'd rather see Apple continue to invest in building... even make big acquisitions that were strategic, as opposed to buying more stock back, or giving more dividends."Mr Sculley was the chief executive of Apple between 1983 and 1993.During his tenure, he famously engineered the "forcing out" of Steve Jobs from the company - a decision he later said was due to his own inexperience in appreciating Mr Jobs' vision for future products.Traditionally, Apple has not acquired large scale companies - instead buying smaller companies with specific technologies, and folding them into the business.One recent example of this is Siri, a company Apple acquired in 2010 when it wanted to provide an integrated personal assistant on its iPhone and iPad products.Mr Sculley said that while he had "no insider knowledge" of the firm he left in 1993, he said he now wonders if it is time for Apple to change its growth strategy."Apple's never been an acquirer of big companies before, and when you look at the [Apple digital ticket system] Passbook, and fingerprint recognition - what would it mean if Apple went out and bought eBay? And they had PayPal, and integrated that?"My guess is you'd suddenly see the whole landscape of e-commerce shift."You have Amazon, which is on the fast-track to dominate every aspect of e-commerce - suddenly the game, the landscape, would change."Mr Sculley was in London ahead of the UK launch of the latest product he is working on - the Misfit Shine, a wearable device that monitors various aspects of a person's health."The future of wearable products has the potential to have a huge impact on healthcare," he said.He also, at the age of 74, offers his services as a mentor to up and coming Silicon Valley chief executives - something he said he wished he had while at Apple."When you're dealing in industries where there's such a thin line between success and failure, having another set of trusted eyes can be a real nice advantage."Mr Sculley also offered warm words for the soon-to-be-departing Microsoft boss, Steve Ballmer."Here's a man who has spent 33 years at Microsoft, loves the company," he said. "He really did not get enough credit for what he did accomplish."I can't name a CEO who didn't make some mistakes in the hi-tech industry."I think Ballmer has a lot he ought to be proud of. So he didn't get everything right - not many people do."He added: "I think it's important the CEOs do move on."Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC</body>

      <body>The "dark web" services used by criminals will continue to evolve in an attempt to evade authorities, the UK's cybercrime boss has warned.Last week, notorious drugs market place the Silk Road was shut down after a lengthy investigation.Andy Archibald, interim head of the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU), said officers identified individuals who were using the site.But he said new methods were needed to keep up with the threat."[Online anonymity service] Tor evolves, and will resecure itself," Mr Archibald told the BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones."The success we've had may not necessarily mean that by the same routes and same approaches we can get into other criminal forums."We have to continually probe and identify those forums and then seek to infiltrate them and use other tools."It's not simply a case of because we were able to infiltrate Tor on this occasion that we'll be able to do it next time around as well."Mr Archibald's comments came as the NCCU announced its first conviction. Twenty-seven-year-old Olukunle Babatunde received a five years and six month prison sentence.The man, from Croydon, south London, pleaded guilty to using "phishing" scams in an attempt to defraud banks, financial institutions and their customers.</body>

      <title>Ultrasound offers gesture control</title>
      <description>Ultrasound technology to enable mobiles and tablets to be controlled by gesture has been developed.</description>

      <body>Ultrasound technology that enables mobiles and tablets to be controlled by gesture could go into production as early as next year.Norwegian start-up Elliptic Labs is in talks with Asian handset manufacturers to get the chip embedded in devices.The technology works via an ultrasound chip that uses sound waves to interpret hand movements.The move towards gesture control has gathered pace and there are now many such products on the market.What sets Elliptic's gesture-control system apart from others is its wide field of use, up to a metre away from the phone. It means it can identify mid-air gestures accurately.Because it uses sound rather than sight, the sensor can recognise gestures from a 180-degree field. It also consumes less power and works in the dark.By contrast Samsung's Galaxy S4 uses an infrared sensor that can only interpret hand movements within a very small zone."The user needs to learn the exact spot to gesture to instead of having a large interactive space around the device," said Erik Forsstrom, the user interface designer for Elliptic Labs.Allowing users more freedom in how they gesture is vital if such products are to become mainstream, he thinks."With a small screen such as a phone or a tablet, the normal body language is not that precise. You need a large zone in which to gesture."If consumers can quickly see the effects their gestures have on screen, he thinks, "it is quite likely that this is the next step within mobile".The technology was recently shown off at Japanese tech show Ceatec.In the demonstration, an Android smartphone was housed in a case containing the ultrasound transmitters.But Elliptic Labs said it had formed partnerships with a number of Asian handset manufacturers who are looking at building the ultrasound chip into devices, as early as next year.Increasingly firms are experimenting with gesture control.PrimeSense, the company that developed gesture control for Microsoft's Kinect console, has also made strides towards bringing the technology to mobile.By shrinking down the sensor used in the Kinect, the firm showed it working with a Nexus 10 at a Google developers' conference in May.Meanwhile Disney is testing technology that allows users to "feel" the texture of objects on a flat touchscreen.The technique involves sending tiny vibrations through the display that let people "feel" the shallow bumps, ridges and edges of an object.Ben Wood, analyst with research firm CCS Insight thinks such devices could be ready for the mass market."Apple's success has made gestures a part of everyday life. Now consumers understand they can manipulate a screen with a gesture or a swipe everyone is racing to find innovative ways to exploit this behaviour."Ultrasonic is particularly interesting as you don't need to touch the screen which can be an almost magical experience."It is ideal if you have dirty or sweaty hands. A common example people use is flicking through a recipe when cooking. Other examples include transitioning through a slideshow of photos or flicking through music tracks or turning the page on an ebook," he said."The big challenge that remains is how you make users aware of the capability."See more tech from the Ceatec show on Click this weekend</body>

      <body>Foxconn, the world's biggest contract electronics maker, has admitted student interns worked shifts at a factory in China that were in violation of its company policies.The firm, which makes products for some the world's biggest brands, has been under scrutiny for labour practices.It had admitted to hiring underage interns at the same unit last year.Foxconn said actions had been taken to bring the factory "into full compliance with our code and policies"."There have been a few instances where our policies pertaining to overtime and night shift work were not enforced," the company said in a statement.The manufacturing giant is owned by Taiwanese group Hon Hai Precision and employs about 800,000 workers around the globe.Foxconn, while not a household name in itself for many consumers, is used by most of the big technology giants around the world, including Apple, Sony, Microsoft, HP, and Nokia.It first came under scrutiny for its labour practices when 13 employees committed suicide at its Chinese plants in 2010.The incidents raised concerns over working conditions at its units in China and drew attention to growing labour strikes.For its part, Foxconn responded by raising wages, shortening working hours and employing counsellors on site.It also installed suicide nets to factory living-quarters at its Shenzhen factory.Also in 2010, Foxconn temporarily shut down a unit in India after 250 workers fell sick.And in May 2011, two people were killed after an explosion at a company plant in Chengdu.</body>

      <body>The US Army is working to develop "revolutionary" smart armour that would give its troops "superhuman strength".It is calling on the technology industry, government labs and academia to help build the Iron Man-style suit.Other exoskeletons that allow soldiers to carry large loads much further have already been tested by the army.The Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (Talos) would have such a frame but would also have layers of smart materials fitted with sensors.The suit would also need to have wide-area networking and a wearable computer similar to Google Glass, the US Army said.It should be made of smart material fitted with sensors to monitor body temperature, heart rate and hydration levels.The exoskeleton, which could be attached to arms and legs, would be likely to use hydraulics to greatly increase strength."The requirement is a comprehensive family of systems in a combat armour suit where we bring together an exoskeleton with innovative armour, displays for power monitoring, health monitoring, and integrating a weapon into that," said Lt Col Karl Borjes, a science adviser at the US Army's research, development and engineering command."It's advanced armour. It's communications, antennas. It's cognitive performance. It's sensors, miniature-type circuits. That's all going to fit in here, too," he added.According to US Army Sgt Maj Chris Faris, "no one industry can build it".Instead the army is calling on research and development organisations, private industry as well as government labs and academia to support the project.The US Army said it was likely that scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology would be involved in the design.An MIT team is currently developing liquid body armour - made from fluids that transform into a solid when a magnetic field or electrical current is applied.In an interview with US news site NPR, MIT professor Gareth McKinley compared the futuristic armour to that seen in Hollywood films."It sounds exactly like Iron Man," he said."The other kind of things that you see in the movies... would be the kind of external suit that Sigourney Weaver wears in Aliens, where it's a large robot that amplifies the motions and lifting capability of a human."The aim is the get the Talos armour out in the field within three years.</body>

      <title>Ofcom price hike alarms mobile firms</title>
      <description>Mobile networks left "disappointed" as Ofcom proposes quadrupled licence fees, leading to concerns the cost may be passed on to consumers.</description>

      <body>Mobile network operators may have to pay more than four times the current amount to use the radio spectrum, under new proposals from Ofcom.The regulator said the new licensing fees reflected market value based on other European countries.Operators told the BBC the increase was "excessive". Vodafone said it was "disappointed".Some analysts have raised concerns the increased costs might be passed on to the public."The size of these figures may come as bad news to the mobile networks, but more worryingly could sound alarm bells for consumers," said Adam Kirby, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com."The proposed new costs reflect a huge leap in the amount networks will have to pay the regulator for using the spectrum - our concern is that it will be consumers who are left to foot the bill."However, the good news for concerned consumers is that no increases have been confirmed as yet - Ofcom are now consulting on the fees. It remains to be seen how much these costs will actually rise, and if the networks can fight back and keep a lid on these increases."An Ofcom spokesman told the BBC that while it had no control over how much operators charged customers, it did not expect the rise to have an impact on bills.In an advisory note, financial services firm JP Morgan said it expected the competitiveness of the mobile market would stop costs being passed down.However, operators contacted by the BBC expressed concern that the rise had been higher than they had budgeted for.The affected companies - Vodafone, O2, EE and Three - each told the BBC that they would respond to Ofcom's announcement in due course.EE said it would aim to stress that "there must be a balance between licence fees and the critical 4G network investment consumers and businesses are demanding to drive growth and jobs for the UK economy".Vodafone criticised Ofcom, saying: "We are disappointed that Ofcom is proposing a 430% increase in the fees we pay for our existing spectrum at a time when we are investing more than ever in vital national digital infrastructure."The regulator should be encouraging such private sector investment in infrastructure and new services like 4G, which will benefit consumers, businesses and the wider British economy for many years to come."Prices for the 900Mhz and 1800Mhz spectrum bands were set when it was used for 2G services several years ago. Ofcom has since "liberated" the spectrum - the term given when a certain band is freed up for different purposes.In this case, it meant that operators could use the bands for higher-speed services such as 4G.In 2010, the government instructed Ofcom to revisit the cost of the licences for 900Mhz and 1800Mhz which - in comparison with other equivalent services across the EU - were considered to be very cheap.The new prices will see Vodafone and O2's individual fees rise from £15.6m to £83.1m. EE will pay £107.1m, up from £24.9m, and Three will go from £8.3m to £35.7m.The increase comes at a time when operators are facing a drop in income via calls made while customers are overseas. The European Union is pressing hard for far lower roaming costs in a bid to reduce so-called "bill shock".A source at one of the affected operators said he expected operators would now engage in a tug of war with Ofcom to see the proposed amounts lowered.In response, the regulator said: "It's a consultation - we welcome the views of our stakeholders. Nothing's final at this stage."They've been expecting this for some time and we've based our proposed annual license fees on market value."Ofcom also dismissed the suggestion that the price hike is in response to a lower-than-expected return from the recent auction of 4G spectrum, which took place earlier in the year.That sale raised £2.3bn - less than the £3.5bn expected by the Office for Budget Responsibility.The shortfall is being investigated by the National Audit Office, which expects to publish its findings early next year.Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC.</body>

      <title>Ford car wrests control of steering</title>
      <description>Ford is testing a car that takes control of the steering wheel away from the driver if it believes they are failing to take the action necessary to avoid a crash.</description>

      <body>A car that takes control of the steering wheel when it detects the risk of a collision is being tested at a research facility in Germany.Ford said the Obstacle Avoidance system first warned the driver of danger and then took charge if they did not react.The firm said the equipment had been fitted to one of its vehicles as part of a project involving other carmakers and suppliers.One analyst said it was a staging post on the route to "driverless cars".The system scans up to 200m (650ft) ahead by using three radars, a number of ultrasonic sensors and a camera, which are all installed in the vehicle.An additional built-in display shows a warning sign and sounds a chime. Then, if necessary, it applies the brakes, scans for a gap in the road ahead, and steers to avoid a crash."You're driving down the road and a pedestrian or something comes out from either side of your vehicle from your peripheral vision where you don't have a good look at it," said Barb Samardzich, vice-president of product development at Ford's European division."Obstacle Avoidance can sense that the pedestrian or that object is coming across the front of your vehicle. If it doesn't sense you responding accordingly in your vehicle by braking or manoeuvring, it will take over."The firm showed off the tech at a facility in Lommel, Belgium, earlier this week.The new technology builds on safety features already offered by Ford.Last year it introduced Lane Keeping Alert, a feature that vibrates the wheel - but does not take control - if it detects the driver is drifting out of a lane without using an indicator.Ford's existing Active City Stop facility also aims to reduce the severity of collisions by applying the brakes if it detects an object in front of the vehicle. But it works only if the object is static or travelling less than 30km/h (19mph) faster than the car.By contrast, the company said the new tech was being tested at speeds of over 60 km/h (38mph).Other manufacturers involved in the project at Aachen include BMW, Fiat, Daimler, Volvo and Volkswagen. They will share data from the tests to develop systems of their own.Volvo - which is owned by China's Geely - has already introduced its own pedestrian and cyclist alert system, which sounds an alarm and applies the brakes. The firm told the BBC in March that it was now adapting the system so it would soon be able to recognise animals.There may be resistance from some to the idea of a car taking control from its driver.But Ford points out that fewer than one-third of all drivers involved in rear-end collisions had attempted to steer clear of the accident, according to data collected by Germany's Federal Statistical Office.With that in mind, one independent analyst said it should not be too hard for manufacturers to convince motorists of the innovation's benefit."The logic behind the technology is impeccable - anything that can avoid a potentially dangerous situation that can cause injury or death sounds like a good piece of equipment," said Tim Urquhart, senior analyst at consultants IHS Automotive."Obviously it will come at a price. But there will be less resistance to a piece of technology like this than there will be to the concept of totally driverless cars."But autonomous vehicles are already being tested by Google, Daimler and others, and taking steering control in an emergency situation is obviously a pretty significant step along the road."Ford said more tests were needed and it was not yet ready to announce a launch date for its Obstacle Avoidance system.</body>

      <body>Russian police have reportedly arrested a man on suspicion of masterminding two infamous hacking tools.He is suspected of being the man behind the alias Paunch - the nickname used by the creator of the Blackhole and Cool exploit kits, sold to cybercriminals to infect web users with malware.The Russian authorities have not confirmed the details.But security firms said they had already detected a decline in the programs' use.A spokesman for the law enforcement agency Europol told the BBC: "Europol and the European Cybercrime Centre has been informed that a high-level suspected cyber criminal has been arrested."We can only refer you to the Russian authorities, they are the ones who should speak about this topic."The Russian police's press office said it had nothing to add at this time.However, Alexander Gostev, chief security expert at the Moscow-based internet protection provider Kaspersky Lab, said the arrest had been confirmed to him by "anonymous sources".The Blackhole kit, released in 2010, dominated the crimeware market throughout 2012 and the start of 2013, according to Fraser Howard, a researcher at the anti-virus company Sophos.He said the code had been sold for an annual licence of $1,500 (£940) or could be rented from its creator for $200 (£125) for one week's use, among other price plans.The software targeted a range of vulnerabilities in the Java programming language, Adobe's Flash media player, Windows software and PDF files.It had two ways of doing this:Among the malware downloaded was:Although Mr Howard said Blackhole was once the biggest threat of its kind, he added that in recent months it had been overshadowed by rival kits, including Sweet Orange and Neutrino.According to the researcher, the Blackhole and Cool kits put together were only involved in about 4% of all malware detected by Sophos in August, down from 28% the previous year.The figure had since dropped to 2% in recent days, he added.Another independent security blogger stressed that the arrest was still significant."If it's true that the brains behind the Blackhole has been apprehended it's a very big deal - a real coup for the cybercrime-fighting authorities, and hopefully cause disruption to the development of one of the most notorious exploit kits the web has ever seen," said Graham Cluley."However, it's worth remembering that nature abhors a vacuum, and there would surely be other online criminals waiting to take their place, promoting their alternative exploit kits and malicious code."Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, agreed."If indeed it is Paunch that they arrested, that is a major arrest - he is a big deal," he told the BBC."He was clearly the biggest player in providing exploit kits - not just by selling them, but also renting and leasing them to online criminals."Both Blackhole and its successor Cool have been very popular."Users didn't have to be very technical to operate them - there was a manual that came with them - they just had to get them running and be able to break into a high-profile website, or create a new one from scratch, to install something bad on your computer."</body>

      <body>Global shipments of personal computers (PCs) have hit a five-year low, according to new figures from the research firm Gartner.Shipments totalled 80.3m units in the three months to September, down 8.6% from a year ago.PC sales have now fallen for six quarters in a row, hurt by the growing popularity of tablets and smartphones.Gartner said falling prices of tablets had further hurt sales of PCs in emerging markets."Consumers' shift from PCs to tablets for daily content consumption continued to decrease the installed base of PCs both in mature as well as in emerging markets," Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner, said in a statement."A greater availability of inexpensive Android tablets attracted first-time consumers in emerging markets, and as supplementary devices in mature markets."Research firm IDC, also released figures on Thursday, which showed global shipments of PCs fell by 7.6% to 81.6m units over the period.Gartner and IDC use slightly different methods to calculate PC shipment data.IDC said it was likely the ongoing decline in PC sales would continue into next year."Whether constrained by a weak economy or being selective in their tech investments, buyers continue to evaluate options and delay PC replacements," Loren Loverde, vice president of IDC's Worldwide PC Trackers, said in a statement.In July this year, IDC had said it was still looking for some improvement in growth during the second half of the year. It has now reversed that view."The third quarter was pretty close to forecast, which unfortunately doesn't reflect much improvement in the PC market, or potential for near-term growth," said Mr Loverde.</body>

      <body>Samsung Electronics, the world's best-selling smartphone maker, has launched a handset with a curved display screen.Called the Galaxy Round, the smartphone will feature a 5.7in (14.5cm) display.The launch comes just days after rival LG said it would begin production of curved-screen phones next year.Digital display technology has been progressing towards curved screens. Both Samsung and LG already offer curved organic light-emitting diode (OLED) television sets.Samsung said the curved screen display would help consumers use some of the features on the phone, including those that enable users to check information such as date, time and missed calls when home screen is off, with more ease.At the same time, users can also change music tracks on their phone, even while its display is off.The Galaxy Round will initially be launched only in South Korea. The firm gave no indication of its plans for a global launch.The global smartphone market has been growing rapidly.According to research firm CCS Insight, worldwide smartphone sales will hit nearly one billion in 2013 - accounting for more than half the total of 1.7 billion mobile phones sold.As as result, smartphone manufacturers have been keen to offer new products to win consumers.With display technology moving towards flexible and bendy screens, it is one area that companies have been looking at.Some analysts said that while the initial offering of curved-screen phones may not see huge sales, the segment of flexible displays was one to keep an eye on."These phones may not be a game-changer today, but they are definitely an indication of things to come," Manoj Menon, managing director of consulting firm Frost and Sullivan, told the BBC."Flexible displays have a huge role to play as the market place for 'internet of things' grows."This refers to the idea that many things in homes or offices - not just typical computers - will soon be connected to the internet.The sector is tipped by many to be a major industry in the near future.Mr Menon said that as flexible screens became more advanced and cost-effective to make, it was likely to speed up growth in the sector.</body>

      <body>Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger says he plans to publish more revelations from Edward Snowden despite MI5 warning that such disclosures cause enormous damage.Mr Rusbridger insisted the paper was right to publish files leaked by the US intelligence analyst and had helped to prompt a necessary and overdue debate.His comments come after criticism from the new head of MI5, Andrew Parker.Making public the "reach and limits" of intelligence-gathering techniques gave terrorists the advantage, he said.Mr Snowden, a former CIA contractor, fled to Russia with a wealth of secret data including some 58,000 files from GCHQ, Britain's electronic eavesdropping agency.The stories that followed in the Guardian newspaper, based on material provided by Mr Snowden, revealed the huge capacity of British and US intelligence agencies - GCHQ and NSA - to monitor communications.Mr Rusbridger said more stories would be published in the future as the leaked documents were "slowly and responsibly" worked through.In his first public speech since his appointment to director general in April, Mr Parker said intelligence gathered by GCHQ had played a vital role in stopping many UK terrorist plots over the past decade.Without mentioning Mr Snowden by name, he said ''it causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques".He warned that terrorists now had tens of thousands of means of communication "through e-mail, IP telephony, in-game communication, social networking, chat rooms, anonymising services and a myriad of mobile apps".Mr Parker said it was vital for MI5 to retain the capability to access such information if it was to protect the country.Mr Rusbridger said those on the security side of the argument wanted to keep everything secret and did not want a debate."You don't want the press or anyone else writing about it. But MI5 cannot be the only voice in the debate," he told BBC Radio 4's World at One.He added that his newspaper had revealed the "extent to which entire populations are now being potentially put under surveillance"."I just spent a week in America where everybody is talking about this, from the president down."He added: "It's quite surprising to me that the number of MPs in this country who have said anything at all in the last four months can be counted on one hand - Malcolm Rifkind, Tom Watson, David Davis."So, if Parliament's not going to have this discussion and if the courts can only do this in private then I think absolutely it falls to the press to stimulate a discussion, which as I say, throughout America, throughout Europe, is one that the public are intensely interested in."Asked about Mr Parker's suggestion that publishing the documents was helping terrorists, Mr Rusbridger said: "They will always say that. You read histories of intelligence and you go back to the 1990s and the security people were saying the same."The independent MP Patrick Mercer said intelligence data should not be published if it compromised public security."If in any way our security is compromised by revealing too much, that's a mistake. Just imagine if we had revealed the whole Enigma secret during the Second World War."That might have been in the public's interest - but we'd have lost the war."</body>

      <description>Panasonic, the Japanese electronics company, may stop production of loss-making plasma TV screens in 2014, according to reports.</description>

      <body>Panasonic, the Japanese electronics company, is to stop production of plasma TV screens in 2014, according to reports.The company will close its plasma screen factory in Amagasaki and put it up for sale next year, Nikkei business daily and Reuters have said.Panasonic's plasma TV division made huge losses in recent years.But a Panasonic spokesman told the BBC: "Nothing has been decided at this stage."Other electronics companies, such as Hitachi and Pioneer, have already pulled out of the sector.In its last financial year, Panasonic as a whole made a loss of 754bn yen (£4.85bn), following a 772bn yen loss the previous year.This is despite the fact that its plasma TVs are critically acclaimed, with the European Imaging Sound Association voting Panasonic's Viera TX-P60ZT65 European home cinema TV of the year 2013-2014.Plasma screens, which use electrically charged ionised gases, are praised for their brightness, deep blacks, and rich colour displays, but tend to use more electricity than other screen technologies."In the last two or three years plasma TVs have lost most of the advantages they had to LCD [liquid crystal display] TVs," said Tom Morrod, senior director of consumer electronics at research company IHS."We're forecasting that they will be gone completely by 2018."Panasonic president Kazuhiro Tsuga's is focused on jettisoning underperforming divisions and concentrating on higher-margin products in a bid to return the group to profitability.Panasonic, along with its domestic rivals Sharp and Sony, have all struggled to cope with falling electronics prices and stiff competition from South Korean and Taiwanese manufacturers.Meanwhile, new screen technologies, such as LCD, organic light emitting diode (OLED), and the most recent ultra-high-definition 4K standard, may have hastened plasma's demise.</body>

      <body>If you've ever wondered what an iCamera might look like, a Jony Ive-designed Leica might offer a few hints.Apple's feted design chief teamed up with industrial designer Marc Newson to create the device as a bespoke item for a charity auction.While some may want to see it go into wider production, the amount of work that went into it means that the price would be out of reach for most.It is expected to fetch between $500,000 (£312,000) and $750,000.The special edition Leica M camera features an anodised aluminium case with tens of thousands of individual perforations.The camera took 85 days and more than 735 hours to manufacture.During that time more than 550 models and 1,000 prototype parts were made and tested; 55 engineers worked on the process.As for the specifications under the bonnet, it is similar to the standard $7,000 Leica and features a 24-megapixel full-frame CMOS sensor and comes with a 50mm f/2 aperture lens.The RED charity, founded by U2's Bono, will host the auction in New York on November 23. All proceeds will go to the Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria.Other items to be auctioned include a grand piano picked by the two designers, gold Apple earbuds and a cosmonaut suit.</body>

      <title>Hi-tech $100 banknote goes into use</title>
      <description>The US Federal Reserve issues a new high-tech $100 banknote, comprising several new security features designed to beat the counterfeiters.</description>

      <body>The US Federal Reserve has issued a new hi-tech $100 banknote comprising several new security features.It includes a blue 3D security ribbon and a bell and inkwell logo that authorities say are particularly difficult to replicate.These combine with traditional security features, such as a portrait watermark and an embedded security thread that glows pink under ultraviolet light.The 2010 design was delayed because of "unexpected production challenges".The 3D security ribbon - which is woven into the note, not printed on it - features images of 100s that change into bells and move upwards or sideways depending on how you tilt the paper.Referring to the embedded security thread Chadwick Wasilenkoff, chief executive of security paper company Fortress Paper, told the BBC: "It's not a small incremental step up for security, it's a giant leap."Tilting also reveals a green bell within a copper-coloured inkwell to the right of the blue ribbon.In addition, the 100 number in the bottom right-hand corner shifts from copper to green.The redesigned banknote, which features a portrait of US founding father and scientist Benjamin Franklin, also includes raised "intaglio" printing that gives the notes a distinctive feel, and microprinted words that are difficult to read without magnification.Over a decade of research and development has gone into the new note, the Fed said, in a joint project with the US Secret Service and the Department of the Treasury.Advances in design software and high-resolution copying and printing have made it easier for counterfeiters to print fake money and harder for retailers to spot the forgeries.US authorities say that $100 bill is the most counterfeited of all US banknotes, but accurate figures for the total value of counterfeit cash in circulation are hard to come by.The US Secret Service estimates that counterfeit bills account for less than 0.01% of the $1.1 trillion (£683bn) of US money in circulation.It says about $80.7m of counterfeit currency changed hands domestically in 2012, and about $14.5m abroad.The authorities seized $9.7m in counterfeit cash before it could make it in to the US money supply, and seized $56.8m abroad in 2012.Bruce Schneier, security expert at BT, told the BBC: "Bills have to be easy to produce cheaply and in large quantities by the government, yet hard to reproduce in small quantities by counterfeiters."Making something that costs less than a dollar to produce and over $100 to reproduce is a very difficult problem."</body>

      <description>The very strange life of millionaire John McAfee</description>

      <body>Who is the real John McAfee? He's the man who went on the run after his neighbour was found dead, face-up, with a bullet in his head. He's the man who jump-started the multibillion-dollar anti-virus industry. And now he thinks he can make you invisible on the internet.Within tech circles he's long been a legend. But for most people, McAfee came to prominence last year when he fled his Central American home - teeth stained, hair dyed, in disguise - rather than let himself be questioned by authorities he accused of being corrupt.He tells the BBC he had "no connection whatsoever" with his neighbour's death. Police say he remains a "person of interest".Back in the US, after posting footage of young female "friends" stroking his naked tattooed torso, he now plans to neutralise the NSA's cyber-surveillance system.It might suggest a crazed, perhaps even deranged, personality. One journalist who has interviewed McAfee many times described him a "master manipulator" who lies and deceives."I've been called paranoid, schizophrenic, the wild child of Silicon Valley," McAfee acknowledges.But he has a different perspective: "I'm an entrepreneur. I always have been. I am curious and I enjoy solving problems."I think that it's when we step out of the road, step outside the box, become our own person and we walk fearlessly down paths other people wouldn't look at, that true progress comes. And sometimes true beauty as well."We're missing that. We're missing the people who have the courage to walk into the wilderness just to see what's there."This is how Amy Emshwiller, the teenage ex-prostitute he lived with in Belize, describes him: "He's sweet, generous. He likes to like adventures. He's serious and usually he has a dark sense of humour. He's generally a sweet guy. He just doesn't like to be [expletive] with."So, who is the real John McAfee?To have any chance of knowing and gaining an informed opinion of what really motivated his erratic-sounding behaviour after the killing of Gregory Faull, you must travel deep into the 68-year-old's past.Despite his Southern accent, the bleached-blond and goateed businessman is in fact half-British - the son of an Englishwoman who met an American soldier stationed in the UK during World War II."I feel as much British as I do American," McAfee says. "There's not much difference between our countries."They moved to Virginia when he was young, where he had a troubled childhood. His father was an abusive alcoholic who, when McAfee was aged 15, shot himself dead. In the following years, McAfee says, he too began drinking heavily and taking drugs, but still managed to maintain a promising academic career.That came to an end in the late 1960s when Northeast State Louisiana State College terminated his PhD in mathematics after it was revealed that he had slept with an undergraduate he was mentoring.They later married and McAfee turned his skills to a series of programming jobs with some of the biggest tech organisations of the time including Nasa, General Electric, Siemens, Univac and Xerox, all the while continuing to indulge in his addictions."Most of my bosses also used drugs of some kind," he says. "I was in the tech field, after all, we were the leading edge in technology and the leading age in personal experimentation."I had to hide it from my mother and sometimes from my wife. But in the work environment - depending on where you worked - in some companies drugs were taken openly at lunchtime in people's offices. It was a bizarre time."Matters came to a head in the early 1980s after his wife left him, his most recent employer, Omex, let him go and the scale of his drug dependency forced him to seek help."It was 1984, the last time that I took drugs, drank alcohol or sold drugs for that matter," he says."I simply stopped. I started going to an organisation called Alcoholics Anonymous... and that was my last taste of that world."However, it is still with me. My body is covered with tattoos from that period. And I'm afraid some of my ideas and concepts and attitudes that were moulded during that time are still with me. That's why people think, perhaps, I'm a little bit off the wall."Despite his troubles, McAfee managed to land a job at defence contractor Lockheed Martin, where he worked on a classified voice-recognition program.There he came across an unusual bit of self-replicating code designed to copy itself on to any floppy disk inserted into affected computers. When examined, it contained the message: "Welcome to the dungeon. Beware of this VIRUS.""When I first read about the Pakistani Brain virus, I'd never heard of a virus before, neither had anyone in technology," remembers McAfee. "It fascinated me."He worked out a way to disinfect the computers and then spread the cure via the bulletin board system, a precursor to the web.The challenge inspired him to set up a business of his own: McAfee Associates - a firm that would later be sold, years after he had left, to Intel for more than $7.6bn (£4.7bn)."I knew the field would become extremely large because people being who they are, there will always be hackers," he says."It's why we have graffiti on the walls of the inner city. People like to deface things. They like to disrupt things."So, given that fact, computer viruses were not going to go away and were only going to get worse. I just did what I could to be at the forefront of that industry for as long as I could."Despite this, he says, he has never himself used any of the products made by the firm that continues to bear his name."I'm constantly under attack, yet I use no software protection."I protect myself by constantly changing my IP [internet protocol] address, by not attaching my name to any device I use, and by not going on to sites where you might pick up a virus."Porn sites, for example, I just don't go there."Secondly, I practise safe computing. If someone sends me an email with a link, I'm not going there until I can call the person to verify that they sent me the email."It sounds absurd to live that way, but I would rather trust my own devices and thoughts than someone else's software."After selling his stake in the business in 1994, McAfee went on to found and sell other companies, including an instant messaging system, a firewall provider and a ranch from which he offered flights in "trikes" - low-flying, engine-powered cabins suspended from hang-gliders.Then he headed south.In 2008, at an age others might be thinking of putting up their feet, McAfee moved to the jungle of Belize with the stated intention of trying to cure another kind of infection."I came across a concept called quorum sensing, which is the technique that bacteria use to communicate with each other."Up until about 10 years ago we didn't even know that bacteria did communicate, but we find out they have a very sophisticated communication system. I wanted to explore and investigate that to see if we could come up with new antibiotics."He picked the area, he says, because the plants that grew along the country's Rio Nuevo river contained compounds that inhibit bacteria from sending chemical signals to each other and thus thwart their ability to co-ordinate an attack.Things didn't go as planned.The first sign of trouble was when journalists invited to his Carmelita, Orange Walk, base wrote stories that made clear they did not know what to make of the operation.Then a falling-out with the microbiologist he was working with, Allison Adonizio, put the project at risk when she quit.Dr Adonizio, who is now based in Philadelphia, did not want to be interviewed.In April 2012, matters came to a head when the Belize police force's Gang Suppression Unit raided the research facility.McAfee says the officers claimed they suspected it was being used to make the illegal psycho-stimulant methamphetamine.They shot his dog, he says, confiscated both his passport and licensed weapons on the property, and briefly imprisoned him before dropping the charges."Under no circumstances did they really believe it was a meth lab," he states."Everybody knew it was a biotech lab because I had hired half of the people in the village to work there. They all knew what I was doing."It's a pirate haven. It's an extremely corrupt and dangerous place."I knew this and my friends all advised me against it. I just thought I was smart enough to sidestep it. Unfortunately, I was not."I was there for a year and the local politician sent a representative and asked for $2m for a campaign donation. I said no. Two weeks later they raided my compound."McAfee says when he was asked a second time for the cash he went on a publicity blitz, posting messages online, and speaking to local and international press about the incident. It became political.The Belize Times - published by the leading opposition party - suggested the "barbaric assault" on McAfee was a "global black eye" for the nation and a threat to its tourist industry."I do wish that I were smarter socially," reflects McAfee."I think I have the ability to solve mathematical equations and programming issues very easily, but I am a little bit naive in some social situations. And certainly in Belize I was way naive."At the time of the raid, McAfee had begun an affair with a 16-year-old ex-prostitute he had met on Belize Independence Day."I was partying, I was drinking, and I went into this bar and the owner said a friend wants to meet me and likes me," remembers Amy Emshwiller, who still lives in Belize."[He said] can I have your number, and then two weeks later he called me."She says he was unaware she was less than a quarter of his age."He didn't know how old I was. I lied to him saying I was 18, and he thought it was OK."I let him fall in love first before I told him my age."When I told him he was so [expletive] shocked that he didn't know what to do. He was baffled. And he was like: 'I still love you, I don't know what to do. I'm in love with a young girl.' That's how that happened."McAfee's long-term American girlfriend left him. And like many things in his life, the new affair proved complicated.One night Emshwiller took McAfee's gun. She aimed it at his head, squeezed her eyes shut and pulled the trigger. She missed.He continued the relationship."Amy, for one - and many girls in Belize - has a horrific story of abuse that if I told you, you could not believe it," McAfee explains."Of course she's not going to be well. Of course she's going to have issues."When she tried to shoot me in the head what I saw was a frightened child."What I saw was a confused girl who had been so abused - physically, sexually, emotionally - beyond any description."What are you going to do? Throw her out? That doesn't help her."All she did was burst my eardrum. I'm deaf in one ear now, but I don't have a bullet in my head. Forgiveness is one of the graces that we have as human beings. Can I be faulted for indulging in it?"Emshwiller confirms the event but says she wanted to scare, not kill, him after he had said he wanted another girl. She adds it was not the only such incident provoked by her jealousy."One time before, I held him in the corner and I put a knife at his throat," she says."And he just said: 'Go ahead. Kill me.' And I couldn't do it. I just dropped the knife and walked out."Following the raid, McAfee and Emshwiller moved to his villa at San Pedro - a town on Belize's biggest island, Ambergris Caye - where they agreed to have an open relationship.There they were visited by Chad Essley, a cartoonist, who began collaborating on a book about McAfee's life."I didn't quite realise that his lifestyle would be this older guy surrounded by young girls and bodyguards with guns," he says."Many of these girls were former prostitutes or had very rough lives."It was expressly forbidden to go out in the town and drink - the smell of alcohol, he could not be around it. He didn't want any of the girls doing any drugs at all."I interviewed each of these girls, got their background. They were incredibly sad. They were definitely in a better sort of situation being around John."Meanwhile next door, Gregory Faull, an Orlando sports bar owner who had recently divorced and decided to live in his Belize holiday home, was becoming increasingly irate at his neighbour's activities.On Thursday, 8 November 2012, McAfee made the local headlines when he donated 40 stun guns, handcuffs and batons to the local police at a press conference.Mayor Daniel Guerrero thanked him, stating: "Crime is affecting the tourism industry as we have been listed on travel advisories; it is time to stop this. Let us protect our industry and turn San Pedro into the safe haven once more."That night the local TV bulletin declared that "the hatchet was formally buried", suggesting the rift between McAfee and Belize's authorities had ended.Early on Sunday morning, Mr Faull was found dead in a pool of his blood by his housekeeper. Police called to the scene found a single 9mm shell nearby. They said a mobile phone and laptop were missing but there were no visible signs of a forced entry.The head of the police's Gang Suppression Unit told a local newspaper that his officers wanted to speak to McAfee as part of the investigation, but when they called at his house he did not appear to be in.An article posted the following day by Wired magazine revealed why.McAfee told the publication he had seen the officers approaching and had hidden in the sand of his property putting a cardboard box over his head.He recalls that his caretaker had told him of Mr Faull's murder, and now he feared for his own life."The first thing that came to my mind was, 'Oh, my Lord. The government is finally trying to rid themselves of me,' he says."The government does from time to time."I had certainly been a huge thorn in their side, and they had simply got the wrong white man."Seriously, this is what went through my mind. My friends sort of calmed me down, and later said that's absurd. At the time I did not think so."McAfee acknowledges that he and Mr Faull had been at odds, but plays down the idea they hated each other or that he suspected him of being the person who had fed two of Emshwiller's dogs a poisoned tortilla."The entire five years I was there, I'd said maybe 15 words to him," he says."He did not like my dogs and the past two occasions I had seen him walking on the beach he complained. But so did everybody."There was no ongoing argument. Yeah, he was mad about my dogs. Maybe as I'm beginning to think now, maybe he was the one who poisoned them. At the time I certainly did not believe that."In fact, as ABC News later revealed, Mr Faull had filed a complaint to Mayor Guerrero about McAfee the previous month.It said McAfee's dog had attacked a tourist; that his security guards had "terrified" other residents by walking around with shotguns and shining lights in their eyes, and that taxis and other traffic had been arriving at his property "at all hours", causing a disturbance."I did not find that out until weeks after I came back to the States," says McAfee when pressed about this."Belize is not like America where you file a complaint and then the police come out and chase things out. You file a complaint and it goes into a drawer."McAfee then went on the run, saying he feared he would be "silenced" if he was caught and thrown in jail.It made headlines worldwide, in no small part due to the fact that he was posting updates to a blog and giving frequent interviews - actions he says were designed to ensure he couldn't be made to disappear if he had been caught."I disguised myself as a ragged salesman," he recalls."All it takes is some dirty clothes and not bathing for a few days and not combing my hair."You know, people saw my photograph everywhere because all of the police and army had it for that month and a half I was underground. I just made sure I looked different than that."Questioned about the affair, Dean Barrow, Belize's prime minister, made it clear McAfee was not an official murder suspect, and had only been classed instead a "person of interest"."I don't want to be unkind to the gentleman, but I believe he is extremely paranoid, even bonkers," the politician added.During this time McAfee continued to see Emshwiller."When he was on the run I went for lunches with him and then he would call and say: 'Come to this place, or go there,' she recalls."How to come, when to come. Not to go out, or stay home, or go to a different location. He would tell me that so nobody would get me."She adds that she regrets she did not go with him when he finally decided to escape the country.The next major development came on 3 December when a reporter and photographer from Vice magazine revealed they were documenting McAfee's life on the run.In what proved a frustrating twist for the tech guru, they then unwittingly revealed he had crossed the border to Guatemala - a fact revealed by a photo uploaded to the Vice website by staff at its headquarters, who failed to wipe its location data."I had gone out of my way to arrange the escape and I was breathing easily and looking forward to a few days of relaxation," remembers McAfee."We immediately had to go on the run again because we were in Guatemala illegally at this point. But it was no-one's real fault. It was just the fault of the moment."A few days later McAfee was arrested. There was initially speculation he would be sent back to Belize, but a week later he was allowed to fly to Miami a free man."After it was over I asked myself, 'Good Lord, I must have been afraid,'" he says."But I really can't remember. I remember merely trying to solve the problems that occurred as they occurred."McAfee has offered a $25,000 bounty for information relating to Mr Faull's death, but says an attempt to contact the victim's family proved unsuccessful.The family has called the reward a "hollow gesture" and suggested if McAfee really wanted to help he would have met with the Belize police.A spokesman for the country's government said its authorities still wanted to speak to the businessman."Mr McAfee's claims and his behaviour have been extreme," he told the BBC."The investigation is ongoing and McAfee remains a person of interest. If McAfee were to respond to questioning it would make a difference to the progress of the investigation - but this is currently out of the hands of the government of Belize."So long as the crime remains unsolved, it is inevitable the entrepreneur will always face suspicion. But he says he can live with that."There's always going to be someone who likes you and someone who dislikes you," he says."Someone who thinks you're a hero and some that think you're a villain. You know I just do what I can in situations like this to continue to state that I'm totally innocent."That doesn't mean he is trying to forget his time in Belize.In addition to the graphic novel, he is working with a Canadian firm to make both a documentary and a movie about his time there.He adds that George Jung - the imprisoned cocaine drugs lord portrayed by Johnny Depp in the film Blow - has been picked to write his biography.While those projects brew, McAfee has returned to Silicon Valley, announcing the forthcoming launch of a $100 gadget that he promises can make you invisible on the net."If you cannot see it, you cannot hack it, you cannot look at it, you cannot spy on anything happening inside it," he explains.He says the D-Central units will fit in people's pockets and allow their phones, tablets and PCs to communicate with other owners' devices within a three-block radius.He adds they can also connect to the net anonymously via a node - a separate piece of equipment attached to the network - either directly or with their encrypted data relayed relayed via other D-Central boxes.Each will frequently change their network identifier - a long number used by devices as an ID - making them hard to track, he explains.He suggests it will appeal to college students who want to copy music anonymously and to businesses wanting to prevent the theft of corporate secrets.He's also well aware that in the light of Edward Snowden's leaks about surveillance techniques used by the US and UK governments, part of the appeal will be thwarting their efforts."You know from their own paranoia and desire to stay in power, they are watching everything they can," he says.Will the tech work? Will he really frustrate the authorities once again?At this point, like so much of John McAfee's life, it's impossible to be sure of all the facts and it's ultimately up to you whether you take him at his word.</body>

      <body>Funsho Lawal beams as she strides towards the Jumia delivery van parked outside her house in Surulere, a Lagos neighbourhood.The delight on her face soon fades as she struggles to fit into the bright red high heels she had ordered."This was the last pair. They only had them in this size," she complains.Funsho's expression changes again as she scrolls through her smartphone to find another pair of shoes on the Jumia website."This is the best, the very best way to shop," she says."I don't have to go out to the shop because they deliver right here to my house."Ten miles of traffic-congested roads away, in a huge warehouse, dozens of shelves stand stacked with a wide variety of products - from electronics to kitchen utensils.This 90,000-sq-ft (8,360-sq-m) building is the headquarters of Jumia, a company started just over a year ago.Now it is one of Nigeria's largest online retailers, with 500 workers and 150 delivery vehicles nationwide.The company's Harvard-educated co-founder Raphael Afaedor is bullish about the current growth."Every one of Nigeria's 36 states has had a Jumia parcel delivered there, so we're moving gradually to reach every Nigerian with organised retail," Mr Afaedor says.Jumia faces strong competition from Konga and Dealdey - similar retail websites also experiencing rapid growth.This rivalry presents options for Nigerian shoppers looking for home-grown answers to Amazon - which as yet has no dedicated retail presence on the continent - or eBay.Folake Adeniji, another online shopper, says: "For a long time I had to rely on people going abroad to come back with clothes and household items."Even if I found the items in shops they were always overpriced, so these shopping websites are like a breath of fresh air."Other avenues have opened in Nigeria's internet space, with companies offering services in food and drink, real estate, travel and mobile money transfer, among others.Mark Essien, a software developer, runs Hotels.ng - a website offering listings and reviews for more than 4,500 hotels in Nigeria.It is difficult to find a current database of phone numbers for hotels around the country - many of which do not have websites.This presents an opportunity for companies such as Mr Essien's, which has 40 employees, including some who have to physically visit hotels around the country to get them listed.The five-month-old company is confident that demand for its services will grow.Mr Essien says: "A lot of people are sceptical about companies like ours, but at the same time there is a lot of demand."We have people using our services. We have not started customer marketing yet, but every week we have close to 1,000 bookings."Mr Essien credits much of this initial success to another company, Spark.ng, which provided funding and mentorship that allowed Hotels.ng to grow as aggressively as it has.Spark has a fund of $1m (£616,000) to offer local internet start-ups. It is led by, among others, Jason Njoku, an internet entrepreneur who runs several online platforms, including IrokoTV, the largest distributor of Nigerian films.Meanwhile, Jumia received investment from Rocket Internet, a German online incubator which has now replicated the site in Kenya.While the companies are not willing to divulge the financial details of these partnerships, some observers believe the current period is a healthy one in Nigeria's e-commerce industry.For many years, any mention of Nigeria and the internet was met with scepticism because of worries about cybercrime.This has made it hard for local companies to gain the trust of the public, both abroad and within the country, although they are making attempts to overcome this."There are definitely technological challenges in Nigeria that are not faced in other countries," Mr Essien says."Payment systems are very manual - cards don't work very well. A lot of our customers prefer paying by bank deposits."The logistics network is very poor across Nigeria but a lot of these problems also represent opportunities that people can solve and create big companies out of," he adds.Customers can pay for their goods on delivery, in cash or by card, eliminating the fear of online fraud."It is interesting the amount of investment these companies are spending on advertising on television and on billboards," says Loy Okezie, a technology news blogger."The retail sites are booming and we can now compare them to other sites in the rest of the continent and India."Mr Okezie adds that much of the activity picked up in 2012 and the online supermarkets are currently more popular because they cater to immediate needs.According to the Nigeria Communications Commission, in June 2013 the country had 48.1 million active internet subscriptions through mobile phone networks.This presents a huge market for online trade - and one that local start-ups are keen to exploit.</body>

      <body>When 15-year-old Eric Rash committed suicide in 2011, his family and friends wanted to know why.In a bid to find answers, they went to Eric's Facebook account, and after failing to guess his password, appealed to the social media giant to grant them access.Facebook refused.Giving unauthorised access to someone other than the account holder, the company said, was against its privacy policy.The Rashes, who live in Virginia, tried to fight their case in court, but soon found there just wasn't any legislation that covered the management of "digital assets".The family's tragic battle is just one of many examples in which the internet has been shown to be woefully unprepared for dealing with death.In the two years since the Rashes' case, which led to the drafting of a federal law concerning the data of minors, few countries have issued clear guidance on the rights of families to access their deceased loved ones' data.And despite the fact that we put more of our lives in the cloud than ever before, few of us are preparing for our digital afterlife."We're accumulating far more digital records in our lives than we are physical ones," says Evan Carroll, who runs The Digital Beyond, a website which explores the subject of digital death."But we haven't yet entered the age where we are taking the question of what happens to those records seriously."Since Mr Carroll and his friend John Romano first raised the issue of the digital afterlife at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in 2009, some prominent companies have developed policies for dealing with deceased customers.Google has a step-by-step process allowing users to plan what they want done with their account, and will sometimes provide the contents of an email account which hasn't left specific instructions, after a "careful review".Facebook and Yahoo have taken a stricter stance, and won't hand over data without a court order, but the former allows relatives to choose whether they want to close an account or turn it into a memorial page.However many web companies are lagging behind.Cloud-based services which store our financial details, emails, music collections, social media interactions, photos and many other potentially precious items have different policies on data ownership, if indeed they have any.As a result, it is more difficult to bequeath your iTunes library to a loved one than it is to leave your CD collection to them in a shoebox.So why are we leaving our digital identities hostage to fortune?Part of the problem is that internet users have tended to be too young to be worrying about their mortality.But as the average browser gets older (the Office for National Statistics reckons almost 70% of all 65-74-year-olds in the UK are online), the idea of drafting a "digital will" is taking hold."We've seen several thousands sign up to our various membership packages," says Paul Golding, who co-launched Cirrus Legacy - a service which allows you to record login details for all your online accounts and leave instructions to a nominated guardian - just a year ago."People are beginning to realise what they could lose."Putting details of your online life in an actual will is not an option, as they are publicly accessible documents, but highlighting where they can be found is a safer bet. Although with passwords and usernames changing all the time, the challenge is to keep the information up to date.Digital estate planning, as the process of filing your details with a third party has become known, is an increasingly popular business, and many online services offer much more than simply making arrangements for accessing accounts.Some, such as My Wonderful Life, allow members to write messages to be sent to their dear ones from beyond the grave. Others, such as the ifidie Facebook app, give people the opportunity to share a posthumous joke, or record a confessional video to be released upon their demise.But it is the more conventional services offered by these companies which are proving vital to grieving families.Most of the time, families don't even know which online accounts their relative had signed up to, let alone the login details.And the cost of not knowing even a simple email password can be enormous, explains Evan Carroll."Email serves many purposes, only one of which is the digital equivalent of our mailboxes," he says. "It is the master key to many other accounts."But although leaving a list of your online accounts and passwords with a digital estate service might seem like a good solution, it is riddled with risks.Putting all your online security details in one place puts you at the mercy of a successful hacking attack. And, as Mr Golding admits, if he received "correct information" from a court of law, requiring him to hand over a list of passwords, he would "have to comply".Furthermore, using the login details left by a dead family member is potentially illegal. The terms and conditions of most established online services state that nobody other than the owner is allowed to use the account.Your loved ones may also not thank you for some posthumous revelations. Details of extra-marital affairs or a gambling addiction, which would otherwise have been taken to the grave, could be made available to mourners.But although much of the digital will-making process is still being ironed out, Mr Carroll urges people to do something, even if it is just writing a manual list and putting it in a safe place known only to a spouse."Many people say 'I don't have anything that I care about online'," he says."But you never know what will one day be of value to your family."</body>

      <description>Celebrating the Pi with fire, vegetables and pets</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24395858</url>

      <body>There's no doubt that the Raspberry Pi bare-bones computer has captured the imagination of makers, hackers and artists around the world.The computers have been put to some novel uses, including a controller for a robot boat that is piloting itself across the Atlantic Ocean.As the millionth Raspberry Pi rolls off its UK production line, the BBC takes a look at a few of the more ambitious and creative projects that the bare-bones computer has made possible.Created by US teenager Chris Marion, Fire Hero mates the Raspberry Pi with canisters of propane and a microcontroller to add pyrotechnic effects that synchronise to music being played on an electric guitar.Hit the right notes and flames will shoot from a rig of six small propane "poofers", four medium-sized "poofers" and two huge cannons.The big ones produce flames that shoot more than 30m (100ft) into the air.Mr Marion said work on the original Fire Hero began in 2010, but the Pi helped him refine his control of the flames.The Pi sits at the centre of the system, reading data from the guitar and passing it to a separate device that opens and closes valves releasing the propane that is then ignited.Programming the Pi to act as the controller was not the hardest part of the project, he told the BBC."The real programming magic lies in the intelligent note and chord detection algorithms to transfer the data stream from the instruments to the Fire Hero device," he said.Fire Hero 3 has been shown off at a few music festivals in the US and its success has led Mr Marion to plan a bigger, flamier set up that, he estimates, will be six times the size of the latest version.It will still have a Pi at its core and is set to debut at a festival in 2014."My vision is to be able to bring a revolutionary new kind of special effects to live performances that enthrals the audience and provides additional sensory stimulation to further immerse them in the performance," he said.The Pi is not just helping people, man's best friends are benefiting too.In particular, a Hungarian vizsla dog called Judd has done very well thanks to a Pi-controlled treat dispenser.Created by Judd's owner, John Saunders, the little web-connected gadget dispenses doggy treats when an email is sent to a specific address.The dispenser drew on many of Mr Saunders's skills, but as he was weakest at coding, getting the Pi to co-ordinate all the moving parts had been tricky, he said."I'm not a programmer by trade, so that was much harder for me than the machining and design," he said.At the time the project was being developed, there was little information or code examples online to help get the gadget working. A web-based appeal helped him debug his code.The Pi was essential to the interactive part of the treat dispenser, he said. Rival controllers, such as the Arduino, were just as good at connecting to electronics but the Pi was much better when it came to working with the web."The machine received so many emails (including corresponding "thank you" emails) that Google shut down the account due to spam-suspicion - so that was frustrating," he added.Judd liked it too."The servo motor does a 'wiggle' upon receiving an email (which happens a few seconds before the treats fall out)," Mr Saunders told the BBC. "Judd learned to recognise this servo noise just about anywhere in the house and would run over to the machine."Most Pi projects just use one of the machines as a central controller. But one was nowhere near enough for Simon Cox, an engineering professor at the University of Southampton.Prof Cox created a supercomputer for less than £2,500 using 64 interconnected Raspberry Pi devices. The computing cluster runs off mains power and can address 1TB of memory."Building it was absolutely not about computer power," he said. Instead the system, dubbed Iridis Pi, was built to help people get to grips with the computational challenges of working with large numbers of tightly connected computers."It's about understanding all the pain of getting them to work together and the intricacies of building an algorithm to use them," he said.That was a skill all engineers needed in order to design and test their ideas, he said, but one that few had a chance to exercise before they reached university.The schematics and software for Iridis-Pi had been publicly released so anyone could replicate it and start developing that much-needed competence with computational science, said Prof Cox.Most Pi-based projects flaunt their wires and make a virtue of the tiny computer at their heart. Not so with Scott Garner's Beet Box project.In the creation of these interactive vegetables, Mr Garner, a designer and craftsman, was more interested in what he calls "invisible technology"."I like the idea of the next generation growing up in a world that isn't all screens and buttons - I think some nice wood and a few vegetables make for a good alternative," he said."Having done some experiments with both capacitive sensors and 'edible circuits', I decided it would be interesting to combine both concepts," he added."I spent a little time trying to think of the perfect vegetable-instrument combo and once I hit on beats from beets there was no looking back."The Pi won out over other ways to connect up and control sensors and speakers because of its processing power. Despite its flexibility this Pi project did present some unique problems."Dealing with produce as part of a circuit definitely comes with some challenges," said Mr Garner."The biggest difficultly is that as the beets dry out, their ability to conduct the touch signals is weakened."In practice, though, they suffered cosmetic damage from so many hands long before they failed as sensors, so having a few spares at the ready was necessary."The Raspberry Pi computers that Brendan O'Connor has used for his project are also hidden, albeit for very different reasons.Mr O'Connor has used the devices to help create some passive surveillance devices that can sit and sip the air for all the data leaking out from smartphones, tablets and laptops.Mr O'Connor's plan was to spread a series of the Pi-powered sensors, or Distributed Object Locators (Dols), around a city and use them to gradually build up information about the gadgets that pass by.Each one is about the size of a can of spam and is battery powered so it could sit unobtrusively in a locker, on top of a cupboard or in a bush in a park for weeks grabbing data.The Pi helped make it possible to get the boxes co-ordinating the information they find and sending it to their controller.The boxes - called CreepyDols - gather up the many status and query messages sent out by the gadgets that people carry around, said Mr O'Connor.Most of them had no idea their gadgets were broadcasting this information or that it could be used to pick them out of a crowd."Even a very savvy user has no way to stop it being shared," he said.Passive surveillance systems were also finding a role in environmental monitoring, said Mr O'Connor, where many different local conditions, such as humidity, temperature and rainfall, needed to be logged over a long period of time.</body>

      <title>The tech modernising Kenya's matatus</title>
      <description>How tech is modernising Nairobi's ramshackle buses</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24426676</url>
      <date>1381187146</date>

      <body>Matatus - the ramshackle public minibuses seating between 14 and 24 people that zip along the streets of Kenya's capital Nairobi - carry a third of the city's residents to and from work each day.The journey from the city centre to the working-class suburb of Rongai takes between 45 minutes and two hours, depending on traffic.Yet inside the "Ferguson" matatu - named for its colourful images of the former Manchester United manager - half a dozen passengers seem oblivious to the length of their commute.Instead, they sit glued to their smartphones, checking the latest news, YouTube videos and catching up on emails.Ferguson is one of more than 1,000 matatus in the city now equipped with free wi-fi for passengers to enjoy through a service called Vuma Online, launched this April by Safaricom, Kenya's biggest telecom company.The goal, according to Kevin Bett of Safaricom, is to "convert [passengers] to internet users".But for matatu drivers and conductors it's giving them an edge over intense competition for passengers."We get more passengers," says Victor Njuguna, a Vuma-equipped matatu conductor. "They actually wait for our bus - they want to enjoy free wi-fi."Nairobi is East Africa's economic, business and technology hub.It has grown from half a million residents in the 1970s to more than three million today. It has grown outward, not upward resulting in an unplanned semi-urban sprawl.It is perhaps no surprise then that the city ranks as the fourth most painful commute in the world, according to IBM's Commuter Pain Index.The government estimates that traffic jams cost the economy more than 50m Kenyan shillings (£365,000; $585,000) per day in lost productivity, fuel consumption and pollution.While the government has ambitious plans to build new roads and bypasses for the city, and even establish a mass rapid transit system and rapid light rail by 2030, progress, like the traffic itself, seems painfully slow.Though Nairobi's commute is dreadful to most, for some of Kenya's burgeoning "silicon savannah" techies, it's an opportunity."Commutes can be up to three hours long," says Jeremy Gordon, chief executive of FlashCast, a Kenyan tech start-up. "That's a captive audience whose time is pretty under-used."Launched in 2012, FlashCast has designed a location-based advertising system for buses and matatus, using a red LED marquee display connected to a GPS unit and 3G modem installed in the vehicles.Yet advertising alone can be boring."If we can't make it an entertaining, engaging experience, it's not worth it for them," explains Mr Gordon. "We also display news headlines, short quizzes, games, word scrambles and discussion topics."For example, in April they asked riders on selected buses to nominate the #BestDressed Passenger on the bus.The replies ended up being a huge hit, with responses such as "Red lipstick grey top blue jeans seated back seat next 2 the window on the left side. #pliz…""People have a desire to be stimulated when they're sitting in traffic," says Mr Gordon, "so it's a win win."It's also a win for the vehicle owners, since they earn a share of the advertising revenues.However, entertaining commuters - and occasionally helping them hit on each other - isn't the only service FlashCast offers.Since its GPS units track vehicles in real time, it is making that traffic information available through its Android mobile app so that customers can track the location and movement of certain buses, to help figure out which route to take to beat the traffic.Traffic delays are just one part of Nairobi's commuter woes. A greater problem lies in the structure of the public transportation system itself - a semi-formal and chaotic set-up of 20,000 privately owned matatus and buses.Although in theory there may be set prices, the market forces of supply and demand come into play. So if it rains, for example, prices go up.And since passengers pay cash fares directly to drivers or conductors, the matatu and bus owners have no way of knowing how much profit their vehicles are making.As a result, owners simply demand a flat daily fee from their staff, with the remaining profits split between the driver and conductor.While in Europe and other parts of the world prepaid cashless systems for public transportation are the norm, in Nairobi cash is still king.Yet that may be about to change. In May, Google launched a cashless, prepaid card system for the city's public transport, called BebaPay.Conductors are equipped with small, NFC (near-field communication) enabled smartphones. Passengers simply tap their BebaPay card to the phone.Money is then digitally transferred from the card to the phone, and passengers get a message on their phone confirming the transaction.The physical BebaPay cards can be purchased and topped up with credit at various locations across the city. The service doesn't require a bank account - just a Google account - and the cards and phones work without an internet connection."Cashless will lead to greater transparency, accountability, organisation… and ultimately better public transportation infrastructure," says Denis Gikunda from Google's Nairobi office.BebaPay is part of Google's broader strategy to "simplify payments", he says, and improve lives of people in emerging markets."Transport was a great place to begin, because it captures all the problems - a lot of transactions, frequently, all cash-based."Eventually, he says, BebaPay will not just be used for transportation, but for payment services across the city - from taxis, to public toilets and small retail kiosks.These high-tech solutions are certainly helping commuters in various ways, but few address one of passengers' main concerns - safety.The World Health Organization's Global Status Report on Road Safety estimates that there were nearly 8,500 deaths from traffic incidents in Kenya last year.One-third of all fatalities are passengers, many a result of "unsafe forms of public transportation". The finger is often pointed at reckless matatu drivers."What [passengers] want most is safety - to arrive at the destination in one piece," says Simon Kimuta of the Matatu Owners Association of Kenya.For that, he says, what Nairobi needs is better fleet management to monitor activity, and vehicles fitted with gadgets to monitor speeding, so owners can react.Yet more simple methods may also be effective.An initiative called the Zusha Project, funded by Georgetown University, recently randomly assigned stickers to the passenger cabs of 2,500 matatus around Kenya, with mottos such as "stand up and speak up" against bad driving.The idea was to get passengers to complain directly to the drivers about their reckless driving.After looking at aggregated insurance data, the project found matatus with stickers were in fact half as likely to get into accidents.As Billy Jack, associate professor of economics at Georgetown University who was part of the project, puts it: "Sometimes it's a low-tech solution that works the best."</body>

      <description>New research says that the El Nino weather phenomenon will be more intense as a result of rising temperatures.</description>

      <body>Scientists say they are more certain than ever about the impact of global warming on a critical weather pattern.The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) occurs in the Pacific Ocean but plays an important part in the world's climate system.Researchers have until now been unsure as to how rising temperatures would affect ENSO in the future.But this new study suggests that droughts and floods driven by ENSO will be more intense.The ENSO phenomenon plays a complicated role in the global weather system.The El Nino part of the equation sees a warming of the eastern and tropical Pacific, while its cooler sister, La Nina, makes things chillier in these same regions.Like water in a bathtub, the warmer or cooler waters slosh back and forth across the Pacific Ocean. They are responsible for rainfall patterns across Australia and the equatorial region, but their effects are also felt much further away.During the Northern Hemisphere winter, for example, you can get more intense rainfall over the southern part of the US in a warmer El Nino phase.For years, scientists have been concerned about how this sensitive weather system might be changed by rising temperatures from global warming.Now, in this new paper, published in the journal Nature, researchers give their most "robust" projections yet.Using the latest generation of climate models, they found a consistent projection for the future of ENSO.According to the lead author, Dr Scott Power from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, global warming interferes with the way El Nino temperature patterns affect rainfall."This interference causes an intensification of El Nino-driven drying in the western Pacific and rainfall increases in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific," he said.According to Dr Wenju Cai, a scientist at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), who was not involved with the study, the paper is "significant"."Up until now, there has been a lack of agreement among computer models as to how ENSO will change in the future," he explained."This paper is significant in that there is stronger agreement among different climate models in predicting the future impact."This study finds that both wet and dry anomalies will be greater in future El Nino years. This means that ENSO-induced droughts and floods will be more intense in the future."Follow Matt on Twitter.</body>

      <title>'Diamond rain' on Saturn and Jupiter</title>
      <description>Diamonds as big as jewels fall as "rain" on Saturn and Jupiter, seeded by giant lightning storms, according to new calculations by US scientists.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24477667</url>
      <date>1381748668</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70411000/jpg/_70411790_e4250960-uncut_diamonds-spl.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Diamonds that are the right size to have been worn by stars of the Silver Screen could rain down on Saturn and Jupiter, US scientists have calculated.New atmospheric data for the gas giants indicates that carbon is abundant in its dazzling crystal form, they say.Lightning storms turn methane into soot (carbon) which as it falls hardens into chunks of graphite and then diamond.These diamond "hail stones" eventually melt into a liquid sea in the planets' hot cores, they told a conference.The biggest diamonds would likely be about a centimetre in diameter - "big enough to put on a ring, although of course they would be uncut," says Dr Kevin Baines, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.He added they would be of a size that the late film actress Elizabeth Taylor would have been "proud to wear"."The bottom line is that 1,000 tonnes of diamonds a year are being created on Saturn."People ask me - how can you really tell? Because there's no way you can go and observe it."It all boils down to the chemistry. And we think we're pretty certain."Baines presented his unpublished findings at the annual meeting of the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society in Denver, Colorado, alongside his co-author Mona Delitsky, from California Speciality Engineering.Uranus and Neptune have long been thought to harbour gemstones. But Saturn and Jupiter were not thought to have suitable atmospheres.Baines and Delitsky analysed the latest temperature and pressure predictions for the planets' interiors, as well as new data on how carbon behaves in different conditions.They concluded that stable crystals of diamond will "hail down over a huge region" of Saturn in particular."It all begins in the upper atmosphere, in the thunderstorm alleys, where lightning turns methane into soot," said Baines."As the soot falls, the pressure on it increases. And after about 1,000 miles it turns to graphite - the sheet-like form of carbon you find in pencils."By a depth of 6,000km, these chunks of falling graphite toughen into diamonds - strong and unreactive.These continue to fall for another 30,000km - "about two-and-a-half Earth-spans" says Baines."Once you get down to those extreme depths, the pressure and temperature is so hellish, there's no way the diamonds could remain solid."It's very uncertain what happens to carbon down there."One possibility is that a "sea" of liquid carbon could form."Diamonds aren't forever on Saturn and Jupiter. But they are on Uranus and Neptune, which are colder at their cores," says Baines.The findings are yet to be peer reviewed, but other planetary experts contacted by BBC News said the possibility of diamond rain "cannot be dismissed"."The idea that there is a depth range within the atmospheres of Jupiter and (even more so) Saturn within which carbon would be stable as diamond does seem sensible," says Prof Raymond Jeanloz, one of the team who first predicted diamonds on Uranus and Neptune."And given the large sizes of these planets, the amount of carbon (therefore diamond) that may be present is hardly negligible."However Dr Nadine Nettelmann, of the University of California, Santa Cruz, said further work was needed to understand whether carbon can form diamonds in an atmosphere which is rich in hydrogen and helium - such as Saturn's."Baines and Delitsky considered the data for pure carbon, instead of a carbon-hydrogen-helium mixture," she explained."We cannot exclude the proposed scenario (diamond rain on Saturn and Jupiter) but we simply have no data on mixtures in the planets. So we do not know if diamond formation occurs at all."Meanwhile, an exoplanet that was believed to consist largely of diamond may not be so precious after all, according to new research.The so-called "diamond planet" 55 Cancri e orbits a star 40 light-years from our Solar System.A study in 2010 suggested it was a rocky world with a surface of graphite surrounding a thick layer of diamond, instead of water and granite like Earth.But new research to be published in the Astrophysical Journal, calls this conclusion in question, making it unlikely any space probe sent to sample the planet's innards would dig up anything sparkling.Carbon, the element diamonds are made of, now appears to be less abundant in relation to oxygen in the planet's host star - and by extension, perhaps the planet."Based on what we know at this point, 55 Cancri e is more of a 'diamond in the rough'," said author Johanna Teske, of the University of Arizona.</body>

      <title>GM 'golden rice' opponents 'wicked'</title>
      <description>Opponents to the development of a type of genetically modified rice enriched with vitamin A are criticised as "wicked" by the environment secretary.</description>

      <body>Opponents of the development of a type of genetically modified (GM) rice enriched with vitamin A are "wicked", the environment secretary has said.In an interview with the Independent, Owen Paterson said they could be condemning millions of people in the developing world to a premature death.Mr Paterson backed a letter from international scientists calling for the rapid development of "golden rice".But campaigners say the benefits claimed for the rice are misleading.Mr Paterson told the newspaper: "It's just disgusting that little children are allowed to go blind and die because of a hang-up by a small number of people about this technology."I feel really strongly about it. I think what they do is absolutely wicked. There is no other word for it."Mr Paterson did not specify any particular groups in his interview but also said opponents of GM technology were "casting a dark shadow over attempts to feed the world".BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said Mr Paterson was known as a strong supporter of GM crops but his language seemed certain to raise hackles with those who took a different view.A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokeswoman said it was Mr Paterson's strong personal view.People in the developed usually world get enough vitamin A from their diet by eating foods like cheese, yoghurts and eggs.But deficiency is a common problem in developing countries, and is estimated to affect between 140 million and 250 million children under the age of five.Vitamin A is needed for healthy skin and eyes and to help strengthen the immune system so that the body can fight infections. Deficiency can lead to blindness, illness and death.Supplements are available and the World Health Organisation advocates routine administration of vitamin A in countries where deficiency is a problem.High doses of vitamin A can be harmful, however, particularly in pregnancyMeanwhile, in a letter to US journal Science, a group of leading academics has accused Western non-governmental organisations of fuelling opposition to the development of GM technologies.They wrote: "If ever there was a clear-cut cause for outrage, it is the concerted campaign by Greenpeace and other non-governmental organisations, as well as by individuals, against golden rice."Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth have said there are more effective solutions to vitamin A deficiency.Mr Paterson also used the interview to defend the government's handling of the badger cull - aimed at preventing the spread of bovine TB - against criticism from animal welfare groups.He said: "I cannot understand anyone wanting to tolerate this disgusting disease."I find it incomprehensible that these badger groups don't see that this is a horrendous disease for the badgers themselves."</body>

      <title>Hundreds of illegal waste sites shut</title>
      <description>The Environment Agency says that it is shutting down 25 illegal waste sites every week.</description>

      <body>The number of illegal waste sites being shut down has increased by 70% in the past 12 months, according to the Environment Agency.Some 1,279 locations were identified and closed in 2012/13, according to its Waste Crime Report.However, construction waste continues to be a problem, while scrap cars were found at a quarter of all illegal sites.And the number of successful prosecutions was down by 30%.The legitimate waste and recycling industry currently generates over £12bn every year in the UK, and employs about 128,000 people.Illegal operators, on the other hand, usually offer to dispose of waste at extremely low prices, and are said to be diverting up to £1bn per year from legitimate businesses.Often the waste is buried or burned with no safeguards for the environment. As well as infestations of flies and acrid smoke, it can lead to serious pollution incidents.While local authorities deal with most cases of fly-tipping, the Environment Agency deals with larger-scale dumping and illegal exports of waste.Two years ago, it set up an illegal waste taskforce. Its latest report states that, over the past 12 months, it closed down an average of 25 of these sites every week."We've shut more sites down faster than ever," said Mat Crocker, head of waste at the agency."We put additional resources to it, we got more people in with the right skill sets, and we've also targeted our efforts at the right people so we can deal with it faster."While the number of sites being closed down is at record levels, the number of successful prosecutions for waste crime is down to its lowest level in four years.In 2102/13, 171 prosecutions were completed, leading to five custodial sentences. In 2011/12, there were 249 prosecutions with 10 ending in jail terms."We target our prosecutions at the most serious offenders," Mat Crocker explained. "Quite often by providing clear information and following it up with the right type of encouragement, people stop."Prosecution is just one of the tools in the bag, really."One feature of large-scale waste business is that dumpers are often clustered around key motorway links near London and in the North West.The agency identified 820 active sites in March this year - the vast majority around these pivotal transport routes.It also carried out inspections on shipping containers in an attempt to curb the illegal export of waste.Follow Matt on Twitter.</body>

      <body>The Conservative Party has said councils in Scotland have received more than 2,500 wind farm applications in the past 18 months.The party's figures indicate the local authorities facing the greatest workload in dealing with the proposals are Aberdeenshire, Highland and Orkney.The Conservatives said wind farms have become a "gravy train".The Scottish government said it has given councils additional funding to deal with the applications.The 2,508 applications represented, according to the Conservatives, seven every working day.Conservative energy spokesman Murdo Fraser said: "Alex Salmond has played to the gallery on this one, but the figures show the rush of wind farm applications remains intense."These applications put council planning departments under immense strain, and cause great concern to communities worried about the impact a massive wind farm on their doorstep will have."And even if a council does reject an application, there is a good chance the turbine-hungry Scottish government will overturn the ruling in pursuit of its own overly green policies."Mr Fraser added: "This surge has to stop, and the way to do that is ending ludicrous subsidies for an unreliable and intermittent energy source, and stop inviting companies to develop in areas which are clearly unsuitable."We appreciate that wind farms have a place, but the fact there are seven wind farm applications a day in Scotland proves this is a gravy train threatening to career out of control."The Scottish government has said its policy represents a "balance" between different interests.A spokeswoman said: "We recognise that some planning authorities face pressure from the volume of wind turbine applications they receive, and have identified additional funds to assist them."Seventeen bids were received for additional funds and earlier this year £725,000 was made available to support all of those bids."Our policy on wind farm applications aims to strike an appropriate balance between Scotland's massive green energy potential and the need to satisfactorily address the impacts on communities and the environment."</body>

      <title>New ideas for how Earth core formed</title>
      <description>Experiments on samples of iron and rock held at immense pressures have led to new ideas of how Earth's core formed.</description>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70418000/jpg/_70418705_c0102776-earth_s_internal_structure%2C_artwork-spl.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Experiments on samples of iron and rock held at immense pressures have led to new ideas of how Earth's core formed.Scientists from Stanford University have shown that iron metal will flow through rocks 1,000km beneath our feet.Using sophisticated X-ray imaging, they watched molten metal moving through rocks, squeezed to huge pressures between the tips of pairs of diamonds.Their results suggest that Earth's core did not form in a single step, but grew in a complicated sequence over time.The depths of Earth are complex and multi-layered.At the surface, the rocks forming the foundations of our cities, the stones that we build our lives upon, also provide the raw materials for society - metals, fuel, water and nutrients.These are no more than a thin geological veneer on the planet. In many respects, the deep Earth remains as much of a mystery as Jupiter or Mars.But new research in the journal Nature Geosciences gives new clues about how Earth may have taken shape and built its core.A group of scientists, led by Stanford's Prof Wendy Mao, have shown how metallic iron may be squeezed out of rocky silicates more than 1,000km beneath the surface to form a metallic core.If you were to follow Jules Verne on a journey to the centre of the Earth, you would find a chemistry dominated by just three elements, until you got almost half the way to the centre - that's the first 3,000km of your journey.Oxygen, silicon and magnesium (plus a little bit of iron) make up more than 90% of Earth's blanketing "ceramic" mantle.Electrically and thermally insulating, the mantle is like a rock-wool blanket around the core. The minerals of the mantle are the stony part of the planet. But as you delve deeper on this "thought field trip", things suddenly and drastically change.With more than half your journey ahead of you, you cross a boundary from the stony mantle into the metallic core. It is initially liquid in its upper stretches, and then solid right the way to the centre of the Earth.The chemistry changes too, with iron forming almost all of the core, segregated into Earth's dense inner sphere.The boundary between the metallic core and rocky mantle is a place of extremes. Physically, Earth's metallic liquid outer core is as different to the rocky mantle that overlies it as the seas are from the ocean floor here near Earth's surface.One might (just about) imagine an inverted world of storms and currents of flowing red-hot metal in the molten outer core, pulsing through channels and inverted "ocean" floors at the base of the mantle.The flowing of metal in the outer part of the core gives Earth its magnetic field, protects us from bombarding solar storms, and allows life to thrive.How Earth's core came about has puzzled Earth Scientists for many years. Experiments on mixtures of silicate minerals and iron, cooked up in the laboratory, show that iron sits in tiny isolated lumps within the rock, remaining trapped and pinned at the junctions between the mineral grains.This observation has led to the view that iron only segregates very early in the life of the planet, when the upper part of the rocky mantle was in fact super-hot and molten.It is thought that droplets of iron rained down through the red-hot magma ocean to settle at its base, resting on the solid deeper mantle, then sinking as large "diapirs" driven by gravity through the solid mantle to eventually form a core.The paper by Crystal Shi and Wendy Mao begins to paint a different picture."We know that Earth today has a core and a mantle that are differentiated. With improving technology, we can look at different mechanisms of how this came to be in a new light," said Prof Mao.Using intense X-rays to probe samples held at extreme pressure and temperature squeezed between the tips of diamond crystals, the researchers find that when pressure increases deep into the mantle, iron liquid begins to wet the surfaces of the silicate mineral grains.This means that threads of iron can join up and begin to flow in rivulets through the solid mantle - a process called percolation.It also means that iron can begin to segregate if the rocks are deep enough, even when the mantle is not a molten magma ocean."In order for percolation to be efficient, the molten iron needs to be able to form continuous channels through the solid," Prof Mao explained."Scientists had said this theory wasn't possible, but now we're saying - under certain conditions that we know exist in the planet - it could happen. So, this brings back another possibility for how the core might have formed."Commenting on the results, Geoffrey Bromiley, of the University of Edinburgh, UK, who was not involved in the study, told the BBC: "This new data suggests that we cannot assume that core formation is a simple, single-stage event. Core formation was a complex, multi-stage process that must have had an equally complex influence on the subsequent chemistry of the Earth."Their deep percolation model implies that early core formation can only be initiated in large planets. As a result, the chemistry of the Earth may have been 'reset' by core formation in a markedly different way from smaller planets and asteroids."As such, we might not be able to use geochemical data from meteorites to constrain the bulk composition of the Earth. This is currently an important assumption pervading Earth Science."The results were reliant on recent advances in 3D imaging of minuscule samples using powerful synchrotron electron accelerators that generate intense beams of X-rays.Similar to medical imaging, these sorts of experiments are revealing the nanoscale properties of minerals and melts. But they are also leading to new understanding of how huge objects like planets form and evolve.Dr Bromiley and his colleagues are now investigating the influence of other factors, like the deformation that asteroids and other bodies might have experienced on their chaotic pathways through the early Solar System, on their formation.He added: "The challenge now lies in finding a way to model the numerous processes of core formation to understand their timing and subsequent influence on the chemistry of not just the Earth, but also the other rocky bodies of the inner Solar System."We are increasingly observing metallic cores in bodies much smaller than the Earth. What process might have aided core formation in bodies that were never large enough to permit percolation of core forming melts at great depths?"</body>

      <body>A licence has been granted to extend the badger cull in Somerset until 1 November.The planned six-week trial came to an end on Monday, but the firm behind it asked for more time after its marksmen fell short of killing the target of 70% of the badger population.A similar trial in Gloucestershire is due to end next week, with an application made to extend it also.Ministers and the NFU say badger culling is needed to control cattle TB.Around 28,000 cattle were slaughtered in 2012 at a cost of £100m to taxpayers.However, animal welfare groups say scientific evidence does not support the policy of shooting badgers in an attempt to control the disease.The government agency Natural England said on Friday that "criteria have been met to allow control of badgers to continue under licence in west Somerset for the purpose of preventing the spread of bovine tuberculosis"."The new licence authorises a three-week control operation to be carried out this autumn and supplements that authorised under the original four-year licence granted in October last year," it said on its website.It said the new licence allowed culling to continue and specified a minimum number of 165 badgers and a maximum number of 282 badgers "to deliver disease control benefits while reducing the risk of local extinction".An application to extend culling in Gloucestershire had also been received, said Natural England, and would be processed in due course.The Badger Trust said it had received a message from solicitors at Defra that a licence had been issued allowing the cull to start immediately and continue until midday on 1 November.The original plan was to kill 70% of badgers in the areas of west Somerset and Gloucestershire by free shooting.Across both regions this meant around 5,000 badgers were to be killed in total.But Defra said these targets were based on population estimates from 2012 that had turned out to be highly inaccurate.In west Somerset, the population, which had been estimated at 2,400, has now been revised downwards to 1,450. In Gloucestershire, the numbers have been lowered from 3,400 to 2,350.Environment Secretary Owen Paterson told the House of Commons that 850 badgers had been shot in Somerset during the six-week trial, just over 40% of an initial target of 2,081.</body>

      <body>Nobel Prize-winning scientist Prof Peter Higgs has revealed he did not know he had won the award until a woman congratulated him in the street.Prof Higgs, who does not own a mobile phone, said a former neighbour had pulled up in her car as he was returning from lunch in Edinburgh.He added: "She congratulated me on the news and I said 'oh, what news?'"The woman had been alerted by her daughter in London that Prof Higgs had won the award, he revealed.He added: "I heard more about it obviously when I got home and started reading the messages."The 84-year-old emeritus professor at the University of Edinburgh was recognised by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for his work on the theory of the particle which shares his name, the Higgs boson.He shares this year's physics prize with Francois Englert of Belgium, and joins the ranks of past Nobel winners including Marie Curie and Albert Einstein.The existence of the so-called "God particle", said to give matter its substance, or mass, was proved almost 50 years later by a team from the European nuclear research facility (Cern) and its Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland.Speaking for the first time about the award at a media conference at the University of Edinburgh, he said: "How do I feel? Well, obviously I'm delighted and rather relieved in a sense that it's all over. It has been a long time coming."An old friend told him he had been nominated as far back as 1980, he said.Prof Higgs added: "In terms of later events, it seemed to me for many years that the experimental verification might not come in my lifetime."But since the start up of the LHC it has been pretty clear that they would get there, and despite some mishaps they did get there".Stressing the involvement of other theorists and Cern, he added: "I think clearly they should, but it is going to be even more difficult for the Nobel Committee to allocate the credit when it comes to an organisation like Cern."I should remind you that although only two of us have shared this prize, Francois Englert of Brussels and myself, that the work in 1964 involved three groups of people, (including) two in Brussels."Unfortunately Robert Brout died a few years ago so is no longer able to be awarded the prize, but he would certainly have been one of the winners if he had still been alive."But there were three others who also contributed and it is already difficult to allocate the credit amongst the theorists."Although a lot of people seem to think I did all this single-handed, it was actually part of a theoretical programme which had been started in 1960."Prof Higgs was born in Newcastle, but developed his theory while working at the University of Edinburgh.The landmark research that defined what was to become known as the Higgs boson was published in 1964.Discovering the particle became one of the most sought-after goals in science, and the team of scientists behind the $10bn LHC at Cern made proving its existence a key priority.In July of last year, physicists at Cern confirmed the discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson.Prof Higgs, who had often been uncomfortable with the attention his theory brought, was in Geneva to hear the news, and wiped a tear from his eye as the announcement was made.Reacting to the discovery at the time, he told reporters: "It's very nice to be right sometimes."</body>

      <description>Astronomers detect the tell-tale signs of a shattered asteroid being eaten by a dead star, or white dwarf.</description>

      <body>Astronomers have detected the tell-tale signs of a shattered asteroid being eaten by a dead star, or white dwarf.The Hubble telescope spotted the event some 150 light-years from Earth.The researchers tell Science Magazine that the chemical signatures in the star's atmosphere indicate the asteroid must contain a lot of water.This makes it the first time both water and a rocky surface - key components for habitable planets - have been found together beyond our Solar System.The dead star is called GD 61. It has long since burnt through its nuclear fuel and has shrunk down to a dimly glowing ember.But its gravity is still intense, and it is shredding rocky objects in its vicinity and pulling the debris into its outermost layers.Hubble and the Hawaiian Keck observatory record how this inflow of material taints the star's atmosphere.They detect elements such as magnesium, silicon, iron, and oxygen - the chemical ingredients of rock minerals.But what piques the scientists' interest is the abundance of oxygen.This is far too high to be explained just from the in-fall of rock, and indicates that whatever is being dragged on to the dwarf must also contain a lot of water.The team's calculations point to the source body being an asteroid at least 90km across and composed of perhaps 26% by mass of water.This water content is very similar to Ceres, the largest asteroid in the main belt of our Solar System and the target of a Nasa probe in 2015.By way of comparison, the Earth is a very dry object, containing just 0.02% by mass of water, and much of this was probably delivered by comets and asteroids.The astronomers - from the universities of Cambridge and Warwick, UK, and from Kiel, Germany - speculate that a similar water-delivery system could also have occurred in the GD 61 system, which is very likely to have had rocky planets in its heyday.Lead author Dr Jay Farihi told the BBC's Science In Action programme: "The reason that we can say that is that the planet-formation process starts with things as small as dust grains. They grow into things as big as pebbles and boulders and then as large as asteroids. Once you get to things as big as asteroids, planets are essentially inevitable - it's a runaway process; you simply cannot stop it."Having asteroids and no planets is logically possible but it's very likely physically implausible. So, we know there were rocky planets [in GD 61] because we can see the rocky building blocks; and we know there was the potential to deliver water to their surfaces because we've seen at least one very water-rich and large asteroid."Of the 1,000 planets so far identified beyond our Solar System, none has been definitively associated with the presence of water.For most of these objects, all that is known is a few details such as distance, size, density and the time taken to orbit the host star. The Hubble-Keck observations therefore represent the first time water has definitively been put in immediate contact with a far-off rocky surface, says Dr Farihi.The GD 61 system also gives us a glimpse of what is likely to occur one day in the vicinity of our own star - the Sun. Billions of years into the future, it too will burn out and shrink into a white dwarf, consuming asteroids and other debris."I think alien astronomers would then be getting pretty similar information to what we're getting on GD 61," Dr Farihi, from the Cambridge Institute of Astronomy, explained."I guess it would depend on what time they looked and which asteroid they were lucky enough to catch. But we know of water-rich asteroids in the outer main belt and I think there would be a good chance that they would see a signature of something like the asteroid Ceres. And in that case, if the alien astronomers speculated about habitable planets - well, if they're looking back at our system, in that case they'd be correct."Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos</body>

      <body>The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the body overseeing the destruction of Syria's chemical arsenal, has won the Nobel Peace Prize.The Nobel Committee said it was in honour of the OPCW's "extensive work to eliminate chemical weapons".The OPCW, based in The Hague, was established to enforce the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention.OPCW director general Ahmet Uzumcu said the award was a "great honour" and would spur it on in its work.He said the deployment of chemical weapons in Syria had been a "tragic reminder that there remains much work to be done".The OPCW recently sent inspectors to oversee the dismantling of Syria's stockpile of chemical weapons.It is the first time OPCW inspectors have worked in an active war zone.The watchdog picks up a gold medal and 8m Swedish kronor ($1.25m; £780,000) as winner of the most coveted of the Nobel honours.UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon praised the award, saying the OPCW had "greatly strengthened the rule of law in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation".Announcing the award in Oslo, Norwegian Nobel Committee chairman Thorbjoern Jagland said it wanted to recognise the OPCW's "extensive work"."The conventions and the work of the OPCW have defined the use of chemical weapons as a taboo under international law," he said."Recent events in Syria, where chemical weapons have again been put to use, have underlined the need to enhance the efforts to do away with such weapons."The Nobel Committee also criticised Russia and the US for failing to meet an April 2012 deadline to destroy their chemical weapons arsenals.The OPCW's Ahmet Uzumcu said the organisation had been working "with quiet determination to rid the world of these heinous weapons", away from the spotlight, for the past 16 years.He said the Syria mission was the first time the OPCW had worked to such a short timeframe and in an ongoing conflict, and that it was "conscious of the enormous trust" placed on it by the international community.Praising the commitment of his staff and the support of member states, he said the Nobel Peace Prize would "spur us to untiring effort, even stronger commitment and greater dedication" to bring about a world free of chemical weapons".The head of the OPCW inspection team in Syria, Ake Sellstrom, said: "This is a powerful pat on the back that will strengthen the organisation's work in Syria."The OPCW is made up of 189 member states and the principal role of its 500-strong staff is to monitor and destroy all existing chemical weapons.It draws on a network of some of the best laboratories and scientists in the world to help it in its work, the BBC's science correspondent Pallab Ghosh says.The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention has contributed to the destruction of nearly 80% of the world's chemical weapons stockpile.Syria is expected to sign the treaty in the coming days.French President Francois Hollande said the Nobel prize was a "vindication" of the international efforts in Syria and pledged continued support for the OPCW's work there and elsewhere.US Secretary of State John Kerry said the "Nobel Committee has rightly recognised [the OPCW's] bravery and resolve".European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso, EU President Herman Van Rompuy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel all congratulated the OPCW.There were a record 259 nominees for this year's Peace Prize, but the list remains a secret.Pakistani schoolgirl campaigner Malala Yousafzai and gynaecologist Denis Mukwege of the Democratic Republic of Congo had been tipped as favourites to take the award.Malala praised the work of the OPCW after the announcement and thanked those who had offered her encouragement."I would like to congratulate them on this much-deserved global recognition," she said in a statement."I would also like to thank the people and media in Pakistan, and those from all over the world, for their support, kindness and prayers. I will continue to fight for the education for every child, and I hope people will continue to support me in my cause."Others who had been listed as contenders were Chelsea Manning (formerly Bradley Manning), the US soldier convicted of giving classified documents to Wikileaks and Maggie Gobran, an Egyptian computer scientist who abandoned her academic career to become a Coptic Christian nun and founded the charity Stephen's Children.But an hour before Friday's announcement, NRK reported the award would go to the OPCW.The European Union won the prize in 2012 in recognition of its contribution to peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe.Previous Nobel Peace Prize laureates include anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela, US President Barack Obama, the Dalai Lama and Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.The Nobel Committee has in the past publicly regretted never awarding the prize to Mahatma Gandhi, the pacifist leader of the Indian nationalist movement against British rule, even though he was nominated five times.</body>

      <title>Meerkats 'pay rent' to top female</title>

      <body>Some subordinate female meerkats wet-nurse a dominant female's offspring in exchange for not being evicted from the group, a study suggests.Researchers found that females were more likely to do this if they had recently lost pups or had returned to the group following eviction.A group's dominant female aggressively suppresses other females from breeding through infanticide or eviction.The findings have been published in the Animal Behaviour journal."When dominant females are pregnant, in the last few weeks of the pregnancy they usually throw out the top level of subordinate females," explained co-author Kirsty Macleod, a zoologist at the University of Cambridge."That can be four or five subordinate females that are really strongly aggressed."This is because if a female is pregnant herself, she is more likely to kill the pups of another pregnant female in an attempt to try and secure care for her own pups."In the past, we thought that this behaviour was to try and stop the (dominant female's) pups being killed,"Ms Macleod told BBC News that it was much more beneficial for females to belong to a group."If they are on their own then they have a much more higher likelihood of being predated," she said."In many cases, these females are evicted and we never see them again, so returning to the group is really crucial to their survival."What we do see in the wild when they do return to the group is this extreme grovelling behaviour, so we can see that they are quite obviously trying to appease the dominant female. When they start lactating, this seems to fit with that behaviour [pattern]."Damp nipplesThe idea of subordinate females "paying rent" was based on data gathered from research carried out between 1996 and 2011, during which time scientists observed the behaviour of 40 groups of meerkats.Because most wet-nursing occurred underground in a group's burrows, females were identified as producing milk through the presence of suckle marks and sand being stuck to damp nipples."Just the sheer volume of data available to me meant that I could look at a lot of different things and fairly definitively make these assumptions, even if it is just short of saying that this is definitely what is happening," Ms Macleod explained.The meerkats in the study are part of a long-term project headed by the University of Cambridge and Professor Tim Clutton-Brock, who is a co-author on the paper.The project, carried out in the Kalahari region of South Africa, also featured in the TV natural history series, Meerkat Manor and a Natural World documentary, to be broadcast on BBC2 (except Scotland) at 2100 UK time."Wet-nursing by formerly evicted meerkats may be a way of 'paying rent' to be allowed back into the group without receiving further aggression," Ms Macleod observed.She added that researchers had long known about this "allolactation" behaviour among meerkats, with it occurring in almost half of the litters.But, she observed: "In a number of cases, it looks as if they are doing it when they are not pregnant themselves. Physiologically speaking, that is quite a big jump in terms of co-operative behaviour."The University of Cambridge researcher explained that wet-nursing was just one of a suite of co-operative behaviours that subordinate meerkats do."More common behaviour includes feeding the pups when they are a little older, such as catching a scorpion or other invertebrates and passing it on."They also babysit as well, so when the pups are very small a subordinate female will stay at the burrow for the entire day, meaning that [the adult is] losing all the benefits of foraging for that day."Ms Macleod said that she planned to carry out further research as part of her PhD research: "What I would like to look at in order to nail this (rent) idea down is whether the females that come back and start lactating are subject to less aggression."Basically, being a subordinate female meerkat is quite a rough deal because you are in a group and you are caring for another females' young."Then, if you try to have your own young, you are chased out of the group or your pups get eaten."So there is this constant and very complex trade-off between the costs of trying to leave the group and have your own offspring against the benefits are being in the group."</body>

      <body>Climate-sceptic newspapers are conspiring with energy firms in a campaign of misinformation on bills, says the former head of the government economic service, Lord Stern.He says they want to shift blame for rising bills on to green taxes.It is clear, he says, that the real culprit for bill increases has been the soaring price of gas.The cost of energy was thrust back into the headlines when the firm SSE announced an 8.2% price rise.It blamed part of the rise on taxes supporting renewable power.Lord Stern, who wrote an influential global review of climate change economics, said the UK's dependence on fossil fuels had generated three-quarters of the increase in costs for households.Less than a fifth of the £70 rise was forced by green taxes, he said, and most of that goes to help poor families insulate their homes.Lord Stern told BBC News: "There is currently a concerted campaign to mislead the British public about the factors that are driving up consumers' electricity and gas bills."He warned that if the campaign succeeded in getting cuts in support for renewables, consumers would face even higher bills in the future as the cost of fossil fuels continued to rise.The left-leaning think-tank IPPR said today that just 6% of SSE's price rise was caused by rising government green taxes.And the renewables agency RegenSW said that green taxes on energy constituted less than 3% of the average dual-fuel bill.They complain that by comparison, the UK is spending £2.3bn a year for the nuclear clean-up. The final clean-up bill could top £100bn.Supporters of renewables also point out that the government is about to announce a long-term price support deal for EDF's planned Hinkley C nuclear station.The price is reported to be roughly double the current market rate for electricity, locking in the price for 35 years.Lord Stern said that with fossil fuel prices likely to continue to rise, support for renewables would actually make bills cheaper in the long run.He also had a warning for people hopeful that shale gas would bring down bills."Domestic supplies of shale gas are unlikely to make much difference to fuel bills, because the UK is unlikely to have big enough reserves to reduce European gas prices, which determine wholesale prices. The gas may also take many years to exploit," he said.Supporters of shale gas argue that exploiting the UK's resources will generate revenue for the government and therefore has the potential to reduce taxes on individuals.They believe it will be cheaper and more reliable in the medium term to keep the UK largely powered by gas.</body>

      <body>Austrian scientists have found that 19 Tyrolean men alive today are related to Oetzi the Iceman, whose 5,300-year-old frozen body was found in the Alps.Their relationship was established through DNA analysis by scientists from the Institute of Legal Medicine at Innsbruck Medical University.The men have not been told about their connection to Oetzi. The DNA tests were taken from blood donors in Tyrol.A particular genetic mutation was matched, the APA news agency reports.Oetzi's body was found frozen in the Italian Alps in 1991.Walther Parson from the Institute told APA, the Austrian Press Agency, that the same mutation might be found in the nearby Swiss region of Engadine and in Italy's South Tyrol region."We have already found Swiss and Italian partners so that we can pursue our research," he said.He was quoted as saying DNA had been analysed from 3,700 men who had given blood donations in Tyrol. They also provided data on their ancestry.Women were not included in the study, as a different procedure would be required to match their genes.Since Oetzi was first found by hikers with an arrow buried in his back, experts have determined that he died from his wounds. There has been extensive debate as to whether he fell where he died or was buried there by others.</body>

      <body>Birds, such as great and blue tits, search for food in the morning but only return to eat it in late afternoon, scientists have found.The team believe the behaviour maximises their chances of avoiding predators during the day without starving to death overnight.Researchers from the University of Oxford tracked the birds' winter foraging movements using tiny tags.All five of the studied species of songbirds behaved in the same way.The results are published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters."Our results are important because they provide a new hypothesis for how animals forage," said Damien Farine, lead author from the University of Oxford."They suggest that animals integrate the different risks they face into one strategy that can be applied to satisfy both their need to avoid predation and avoid risk."Scientists have been studying bird populations at Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, UK since 1947.Finding food becomes more and more relevant towards the end of the winter when large sources of food, such as beech mast, have become depleted.The team knew from previous studies that, when the predation risk appears high, birds delay putting on fat until late in the day."In the 1970s, when there were almost no sparrowhawks, tits used to be much fatter [in winter], which helped them avoid the risk of starvation."When sparrowhawks returned [in greater numbers], the average body weight of great tits, for example, decreased," Mr Farine told BBC Nature.According to Mr Farine these birds had shifted from a strategy of being fat, to a strategy where they delayed putting on fat until late in the day."However, no one had previously thought to test how birds manage the need to find food so that they can ensure that there will be enough food left at the end of the day in order to put on the necessary amount of fat and survive the long winter nights," he said.Instead of simply idly waiting until the afternoon, birds were actively seeking out new sources of food to work out where their next meal was coming from.Mr Farine said: "They can vary their strategy within the day in order to satisfy multiple needs, in this case avoiding predation but also finding ephemeral food."Mr Farine said he was hoping to test a number of questions that arose from these results.Previous studies have shown that along the social ties, information about food sources are transmitted between individual birds within a population."We would like to test if individuals vary in their use of this social information over the course of a day. For example, if they have not gained good quality information in the morning, do they ignore it and search for their own food?" Mr Farine told BBC Nature."We would then like conduct further research on the afternoon and evening strategies in order to test whether the birds actually do remember what the best site was that they visited by placing different quality foods out for them to discover."Join BBC Nature on Facebook and Twitter @BBCNature.</body>

      <title>GM yeast brews fuel from rubbish</title>
      <description>Food science researchers from the USA have developed a GM yeast that turns rubbish into fuel.</description>

      <body>US researchers have used genetically modified yeast to enhance the production of biofuels from waste materials.The new method solves some of the problems in using waste like straw to make bioethanol fuel.The scientists involved say the development could help overcome reservations about using land for fuel production.The research is published in the journal Nature Communications.Many states around the world have plans to replace gasoline with bioethanol, but this has typically been by changing land-use from food crops to biofuel.Just this week, a representative of South Africa's farming community announced that sorghum harvests would need to increase five fold to meet their government's commitment to incorporate at least 2% bioethanol in petrol.Sorghum is South Africa's second biggest summer crop and is a staple food as well as being used in brewing and livestock feed.However, scientists are now seeking more sustainable routes to generating biofuel - routes that would have a lighter impact on food prices and production.One is to consider using non-conventional plants such as seaweed. But among the most radical ideas is the suggestion that biowastes should be used to produce bioethanol, which is added to petrol replacing some fossil fuel."Wastes present a major opportunity in this respect. We have to start to think about wastes, such as sewage or landfill waste as resources - not problems to be disposed of," Dr Gavin Collins, an environmental microbiologist at the National University of Ireland, Galway, told BBC News.Using microbes to make fuel from biomass involves breaking down large complex biopolymer molecules.These are indigestible to most bugs, and attempts to incorporate them into fuel production have slowed down the biotechnology, creating bottlenecks.One chemical that is produced when processing biowastes is a large sugar molecule called xylose.When you try and use yeast to ferment xylose, rather than making alcohol for fuel directly, it generates acetic acid - essentially vinegar. This is poisonous to the yeast, and stops the fermentation.Breaking down xylose and making acetic acid non-toxic are the two major problems that must be solved if biowastes such as straw are to be fermented to make fuel.Now, US biotechnologists appear to have solved both problems, by developing a genetically engineered strain of yeast that simultaneously breaks down xylose and converts acetic acid to fuel."Xylose is a sugar; we can engineer yeast to ferment xylose," said University of Illinois Prof Yong-Su Jin, one of the authors of the study."However, acetic acid is a toxic compound that kills yeast. That is one of the biggest problems in cellulosic ethanol production."The yeast digests the sugars in oxygen-poor conditions, making the process more efficient than digesters that rely on active mixing of air into the system.A new pathway, not yet discovered in nature, has been genetically engineered in the lab. This breakthrough means yeasts can be used much more efficiently to convert biowaste into biofuel."We sort of rebuilt how yeast uses carbon," said principal investigator Dr Jamie Cate, of the University of California at BerkeleyOne hurdle to implementing the discovery is that the new yeast that has been developed is genetically modified, and it is not yet clear how easily GM yeasts might be accepted for use on an industrial scale.Dr Gavin Collins, however, remains upbeat about the prospects for biotechnology."We probably know the function of only about 0.01% of all living microbes on Earth," he said."It may be that many of them can efficiently degrade even complex plant material and other wastes under anaerobic conditions. They may be present in nature but we haven't found them yet."However, just look at what we have been able to do with the small fraction of microbes we understand - everything from antibiotic production; food and alcohol production; and biofuel production."Just think what we could do, or what we might discover, if we understood the function of just another 1%."</body>

      <body>DNA from ancient skeletons has revealed how a complex patchwork of prehistoric migrations fashioned the modern European gene pool.The study appears to refute the picture of Europeans as a simple mixture of indigenous hunters and Near Eastern farmers who arrived 7,000 years ago.The findings by an international team have been published in Science journal.DNA was analysed from 364 skeletons unearthed in Germany - an important crossroads for prehistoric cultures."This is the largest and most detailed genetic time series of Europe yet created, allowing us to establish a complete genetic chronology," said co-author Dr Wolfgang Haak of the Australian Centre for DNA (ACAD) in Adelaide."Focusing on this small but highly important geographic region meant we could generate a gapless record, and directly observe genetic changes in 'real-time' from 7,500 to 3,500 years ago, from the earliest farmers to the early Bronze Age."Dr Haak and his colleagues analysed DNA extracted from the teeth and bones of well-preserved remains from the Mittelelbe-Saale region of Germany. They focused on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) - the genetic information in the cell's "batteries".MtDNA is passed down from a mother to her children, allowing geneticists to probe the maternal histories of populations. Geneticists recognise a variety of mitochondrial DNA "clans", or lineages, in human populations. And each of these lineages has its own distinct history.The team's results show that indigenous hunter-gatherers in Central Europe were edged out by incomers from Anatolia (modern Turkey) some 7,500 years ago. A majority of the hunters belonged to the maternal clan known as haplogroup U, whilst the farmers carried a selection of genetic lineages characteristic of the Near East.Around 6,100 years ago, farming was introduced to Scandinavia, which coincided with the appearance of Neolithic mtDNA lineages in that region too."In some ways agriculture was an obvious and easy way to go in the Fertile Crescent. But once you take it out of there, it involves an abrupt shift in lifestyle," said Dr Spencer Wells, director of the Genographic Project and an Explorer-in-Residence at National Geographic, adding that early agricultural groups were living "on the edge"."They were basically taking crops that had evolved over millions of years in the Middle East and were adapted to that dry-wet pattern of seasonality and moving them into an area that was recently de-glaciated."It was no trivial thing to transfer crops such as barley and rye to the northern fringes of Europe."Dr Wells thinks this precarious existence may be reflected in the spread of the lactase persistence gene, which enables people to digest milk into adulthood. Scandinavian populations have some of the highest frequencies of this gene variant in Europe, and it appears to have undergone strong natural selection in the last few thousand years - suggesting milk had a key nutritional role and the ability to drink it conferred an enormous advantage."What it implies is that the underlying farming culture is not stable. They are literally teetering on the brink of dying out," said Dr Wells.Indeed, something does seem to have happened to the descendents of the first farmers in Central Europe. The DNA evidence shows that about a millennium later, genetic lineages associated with these Near Eastern pioneers decline, and those of the hunter-gatherers bounce back. Climate change and disease are both possibilities, but the causes are a matter for further investigation.A second study, also published in Science by Ruth Bollongino at the University of Mainz, Germany and colleagues, implies that hunter-gatherer cultures persisted alongside farming cultures for 2,000 years after the introduction of agriculture to the region - with very little interbreeding between the two.From 4,800 years ago, novel maternal lineages spread into the region, associated with the emergence of the Corded Ware people - who take their name from the inscribed patterns on their pottery.The study suggests this culture was brought by groups moving in from the East. Scientists compared the mtDNA types found in Corded Ware people with modern populations and found distinct affinities with present-day groups in Eastern Europe, the Baltic region and the Caucasus.A few hundred years later, a counterpart of this society swept in from the West. This ancient group, known as the Bell Beaker Culture, was in part responsible for the spread of a mtDNA lineage called Haplogroup H.Largely absent from Central European hunters and scarce in early Neolithic farmers, H remains the dominant maternal lineage in Europe today and comparisons between the Bell Beaker people and modern populations suggest they came from Iberia - modern Spain and Portugal."Our study shows that a simple mix of indigenous hunter-gatherers and the incoming Near Eastern farmers cannot explain the modern-day diversity alone," said co-author Guido Brandt, from the University of Mainz."The genetic results are much more complex than that. Instead, we found that two particular cultures at the brink of the Bronze Age 4,200 years ago had a marked role in the formation of Central Europe's genetic makeup."Spencer Wells explained: "When you look at today's populations, what you are seeing is a hazy palimpsest of what actually went on to create present-day patterns."Dr Haak concurs: "None of the dynamic changes we observed could have been inferred from modern-day genetic data alone, highlighting the potential power of combining ancient DNA studies with archaeology to reconstruct human evolutionary history."</body>

      <body>Scott Carpenter, one of the original members of the Mercury 7 - Nasa's first group of astronauts - has died aged 88, his family has announced.In 1962 Mr Carpenter became the second American to orbit the earth, piloting the Aurora 7 spacecraft through three revolutions of the earth.After retiring in 1969 he took up oceanographic activities.John Glenn, who flew the first orbital mission, is the last surviving member of the Mercury team.Scott Carpenter's wife, Patty Barrett, said her husband had suffered complications following a stroke in September and died in a Denver hospice.He lived in Vail, Colorado.Mr Carpenter, who was born in Boulder, Colorado, was commissioned in the US Navy in 1949 and served as a pilot during the Korean War.In April 1959 he was selected as one of the original seven Mercury astronauts and underwent training with Nasa, specialising in communication and navigation.He was the backup pilot for John Glenn during preparation for the first US manned orbital space flight in February 1962, and gave the historic send-off to his teammate: "Godspeed, John Glenn.''During his own flight, Scott Carpenter's capsule landed 288 miles away from where it was meant to, leaving Nasa and the nation waiting anxiously to see if he had survived.The Navy recovered him from the Caribbean, floating in his life-raft with his feet propped up.In a joint lecture with John Glenn 49 years later at the Smithsonian Institution, Mr Carpenter recalled his feelings from that time."You're looking out at a totally black sky, seeing an altimeter reading of 90,000ft and realise you are going straight up. And the thought crossed my mind: What am I doing?''Scott Carpenter did not go back into space but later joined the US Navy's SeaLab II programme and in 1965 spent 30 days under the ocean off the coast of California.After retirement he founded his company Sea Sciences, working closely with diver and researcher Jacques Cousteau.</body>

      <body>The US Army is working to develop "revolutionary" smart armour that would give its troops "superhuman strength".It is calling on the technology industry, government labs and academia to help build the Iron Man-style suit.Other exoskeletons that allow soldiers to carry large loads much further have already been tested by the army.The Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (Talos) would have such a frame but would also have layers of smart materials fitted with sensors.The suit would also need to have wide-area networking and a wearable computer similar to Google Glass, the US Army said.It should be made of smart material fitted with sensors to monitor body temperature, heart rate and hydration levels.The exoskeleton, which could be attached to arms and legs, would be likely to use hydraulics to greatly increase strength."The requirement is a comprehensive family of systems in a combat armour suit where we bring together an exoskeleton with innovative armour, displays for power monitoring, health monitoring, and integrating a weapon into that," said Lt Col Karl Borjes, a science adviser at the US Army's research, development and engineering command."It's advanced armour. It's communications, antennas. It's cognitive performance. It's sensors, miniature-type circuits. That's all going to fit in here, too," he added.According to US Army Sgt Maj Chris Faris, "no one industry can build it".Instead the army is calling on research and development organisations, private industry as well as government labs and academia to support the project.The US Army said it was likely that scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology would be involved in the design.An MIT team is currently developing liquid body armour - made from fluids that transform into a solid when a magnetic field or electrical current is applied.In an interview with US news site NPR, MIT professor Gareth McKinley compared the futuristic armour to that seen in Hollywood films."It sounds exactly like Iron Man," he said."The other kind of things that you see in the movies... would be the kind of external suit that Sigourney Weaver wears in Aliens, where it's a large robot that amplifies the motions and lifting capability of a human."The aim is the get the Talos armour out in the field within three years.</body>

      <body>Russia has replaced the head of its space programme, Vladimir Popovkin.The move follows a series of setbacks including an unmanned rocket that crashed and exploded seconds after lift-off.Oleg Ostapenko, who was previously a deputy defence minister, was appointed the new space chief by prime minister Dmitry Medvedev.Prior to his ministerial role, Ostapenko served as commander of the military's space forces.Speaking to Mr Ostapenko, Mr Medvedev said: "You've been engaged in the space industry all your life including at the military posts."Now you are set to be involved with space in a slightly different dimension. No doubt that this topic is complex and requires greater attention from the state."The outgoing Vladimir Popovkin had been in the role for two-and-a-half years. He was appointed in April 2011 during a time of difficulty with the country's space programme. Russia had lost three satellites when a rocket crashed into the Pacific Ocean.Mr Popovkin had pledged to improve manufacturing standards and quality checks, but he struggled to deliver.His time as head was marked by embarrassments including the explosion of an unmanned Russian Proton-M rocket, crashed after its launch from the Russian Baikonur facility in Kazakhstan.The accident was captured live by Russian television in July and the crash spread hundreds of tonnes of toxic rocket fuel.Other countries still depend on Russia to launch manned rockets to the International Space Station.</body>

      <title>Fears for science amid US shutdown</title>
      <description>American scientists are scrambling to preserve vital research programmes amid the US government funding shutdown.</description>

      <body>American scientists are scrambling to preserve vital research programmes amid the US government funding shutdown.Key projects investigating ice loss in Antarctica are among those at risk as plans for fieldwork are stalled.If the expeditions do not go ahead, it could jeopardise investigations that have gathered data over decades.Medical research, including studies of degenerative disease, is also held up as government-employed scientists have been sent home.The case of the National Science Foundation is typical of many US funding bodies - it has closed its front door and no-one is answering calls or emails. Websites of the likes of Nasa are redirecting to holding pages.The chief concern among scientists is that long-running projects monitoring change could now be harmed by a sudden break in the flow of data.One major initiative known as IceBridge - which uses aircraft to study the edges of the ice-sheet in West Antarctica, and is regarded as crucial for understanding future sea-level rise - has been delayed by two weeks already.The planes are fitted with laser and radar systems to measure the height of the ice sheet as it approaches the coast - and gathering annual data is essential for researchers trying to understand patterns of change.The plan for the approaching field season in Antarctica was to operate the plane from landing strips on the ice but this will become impossible later next month as temperatures rise with the Southern Hemisphere summer, potentially putting at risk the entire season's fieldwork.Teams involved in the project are known to be working on contingency plans in the hope that a budget deal can be struck soon by US President Barack Obama and the House of Representatives.With official lines of communication between funding agencies and scientists currently suspended, many have resorted to private corridors to maintain some level of organisation. Information is being passed through Gmail and Hotmail accounts, and through social media such as Facebook and Twitter.The message put out to Antarctic researchers on Wednesday was that the upcoming season was not all lost. Many groups are not due to go out until December, and so there is still the chance that some projects can be rescued."But there is this overwhelming sense of confusion and frustration, and the inability to get clear information on what is going on because the NSF has closed along with the other government agencies," one university glaciologist told the BBC."We've been told to keep planning for the Antarctic season, but it's like being at school and all the teachers have gone home; you don't know where to go for guidance because they're not there."With many major research projects now run internationally, the effect of the US shutdown will also be felt by scientists beyond the United States.Several British polar scientists are thought to be scheduled to join American expeditions but face being delayed or even losing out completely.For the moment, the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) is insisting that the impact on UK polar science will be minimal.But Prof Jane Francis, director of BAS, warned in a statement that, "the potential loss of data which would be collected by American scientists, and shared with other research teams, would have an impact on the science we conduct."At present, BAS is working on the assumption the US financial situation will be resolved soon, and any joint work can go ahead as planned. We are monitoring the situation on a daily basis."One American project known as RICE, investigating a margin of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, is due to involve scientists from China, New Zealand, Denmark and one researcher from the UK. At the moment, its fate is uncertain.Other fields of research are vulnerable, too - and British scientists are among those raising concerns.Prof John Hardy, of University College London, said: "Vital work on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's is being held up while hardworking scientists are being forced to stay at home, without even being allowed to read their email. It is difficult to see how this is fiscally responsible."Imran Khan, chief executive of the British Science Association, said: "The biggest lesson we should take from this week's Nobel Prizes is that science doesn't belong to one nation; it's an international and collaborative human enterprise."Our scientists work with American scientists, and the UK public benefits enormously from research that goes on there, as well as vice versa."If the shutdown continues, it's bad news for both scientists and the public here in the UK as well as across the pond."American satellites are still functioning and data is being gathered, but Nasa scientists are among those refused funding to travel to international conferences - a key part of the process of scientific exchange.One leading space agency scientist, speaking from home, told me that the shutdown was "deeply frustrating and very bad for morale - it's illegal for us to work".Instead of managing a research project, he's keeping himself busy in his garden. "The koi pond has never looked better," he said.</body>

      <title>New data on badger TB spread</title>
      <description>Cattle to cattle transmission of bovine TB accounts for 94% of cases, new data suggests.</description>

      <body>Herd-to-herd transmission of bovine TB in cattle accounts for 94% of cases, according to new data.Further analysis of scientific evidence from the Krebs badger culling trial found around 6% of infected cattle catch TB directly from badgers.The figure rises to about 50%, when cattle infected by badgers pass it on to other herds, say Imperial College London scientists.The government is to decide shortly whether to extend pilot culls.A six-week trial of badger culling in Somerset has now ended, but the firm behind it has asked for more time after its marksmen fell short of killing the target of 70% of the badger population.A similar trial in Gloucestershire is still ongoing. An application has been made to extend the trial, but it is not known how many badgers have been shot.The role of badgers in spreading bovine TB has been hotly debated as part of discussions about whether badgers in England should be culled to control the spread of the disease.The scientific evidence for and against badger culling comes from the £50m Randomised Badger Culling (Krebs) trial.The study, which ran from 1998 to 2005, found evidence that culling could reduce TB in herds inside culled areas, while increasing TB in areas nearby.Mathematical modelling revealed that in high TB areas badgers accounted for roughly 50% of cases in cattle.A new more detailed analysis published in the journal PLOS Currents Outbreaks found that of this 50%, 6% was because of primary transmission from badgers to cattle, with the remainder coming from cattle that had been infected by badgers passing the disease on to other herds.Research leader Prof Christl Donnelly told the BBC: "The results show that both badgers and cattle are important in this transmission system - that we're getting introductions from badgers and they're being amplified spreading from herd to herd."The 6% figure tells you about introductions into herds and that tells you that 6% of the introductions into herds come from badgers; 94% of them come from other cattle herds."She said the estimates came from early in the Krebs trial and further control measures had been introduced since then to reduce cattle to cattle transmission.Prof Donnelly added: "These findings confirm that badgers do play a large role in the spread of bovine TB. These figures should inform the debate, even if they don't point to a single way forward."Ministers and the NFU say badger culling is needed to control TB in cattle.Around 28,000 cattle were slaughtered in 2012 at a cost of £100m to taxpayers. However, animal rights groups say scientific evidence does not support the policy of shooting badgers in an attempt to control the disease.</body>

      <body>African elephants have demonstrated what appears to be an instinctive understanding of human gestures, according to UK scientists.In a series of tests, researcher Ann Smet, of the University of St Andrews, offered the animals a choice between two identical buckets, then pointed at the one containing a hidden treat.From the first trial, the elephants chose the correct bucket.The results are published in the journal Current Biology.The scientists worked with captive elephants at a lodge in Zimbabwe.Prof Richard Byrne, a co-author on the research, said the elephants had been rescued from culling operations and trained for riding."They specifically train the elephants to respond to vocal cues. They don't use any gestures at all," said Prof Byrne."The idea is that the handler can walk behind the elephant and just tell it what to do with words."Despite this, the animals seemed to grasp the meaning of pointing from the outset. This makes them the only non-human animals to understand the gesture without being trained to do so.In previous studies, Prof Byrne said, our closest primate cousins, the chimpanzees, proved to be "hopeless" at at similar task.Ms Smet added that she had been impressed by the animals' apparently innate understanding of the gesture."Of course we had hoped that the elephants would be able to learn to follow human pointing, or we wouldn't have done the experiment in the first place," she said."But it was really surprising that they didn't seem to have to learn anything."It seems that understanding pointing is an ability elephants just possess naturally and they are cognitively much more like us than has been realised."Prof Byrne said studying elephants helped build a map of part of the evolutionary tree that is very distant from humans."They're so unrelated to us," he told BBC News. "So if we find human-like abilities in an animal like an elephant, that hasn't shared a common ancestor with people for more than 100 million years , we can be pretty sure that it's evolved completely separately, by what's called convergent evolution."The researchers said their findings might explain how elephants have successfully been tamed and have "historically had a close bond with humans, in spite of being potentially dangerous and unmanageable due to their great size".But the scientists added the results could be a hint that the animals gesture to one another in the wild with their "highly controllable trunks".Ms Smet told BBC News: "The next step [in our research] is to test whether when an elephant extends its trunk upwards and outwards - as they regularly do, such as when detecting a predator, this functions as a point."</body>

      <body>Nations have begun signing a legally binding treaty designed to curb mercury pollution and the use of the toxic metal in products around the globe.Mercury can produce a range of adverse human health effects, including permanent damage to the nervous system.The UN treaty was formally adopted at a high level meeting in Japan.The Minamata Convention was named after the Japanese city that, in the 1950s, saw one of the world's worst cases of mercury poisoning.In January, four years of negotiations concluded with more than 140 countries agreeing on a set of legally binding measures to curb mercury pollution.UN data showed that mercury emissions were rising in a number of developing nations.The convention regulates a range of areas, including:Earlier this year, the UN Environment Programme (Unep) published a report warning that developing nations were facing growing health and environmental risks from increased exposure to mercury.It said a growth in small-scale mining and coal burning were the main reasons for the rise in emissions.As a result of rapid industrialisation, South-East Asia was the largest regional emitter and accounted for almost half of the element's annual global emissions, it said.'Highly toxic'Mercury - a heavy, silvery white metal - is a liquid at room temperature and can evaporate easily. Within the environment, it is found in cinnabar deposits. It is also found in natural forms in a range of other rocks, including limestone and coal.Mercury can be released into the environment through a number of industrial processes including mining, metal and cement production, and the burning of fossil fuels.Once emitted, it persists in the environment for a long time - circulating through air, water, soil and living organisms - and can be dispersed over vast distances.The World Health Organization (WHO) says: "Mercury is highly toxic to human health, posing a particular threat to the development of the (unborn) child and early in life."The inhalation of mercury vapour can produce harmful effects on the nervous, digestive and immune systems, lungs and kidneys, and may be fatal."The inorganic salts of mercury are corrosive to the skin, eyes and gastrointestinal tract, and may induce kidney toxicity if ingested."The Unep assessment said the concentration of mercury in the top 100m of the world's oceans had doubled over the past century, and estimated that 260 tonnes of the toxic metal had made their way from soil into rivers and lakes.Another characteristic, it added, was that mercury became more concentrated as it moved up the food chain, reaching its highest levels in predator fish that could be consumed by humans.Campaigners urged nations to sign the land-mark agreement."Millions of people around the world are exposed to the toxic effect of mercury," said Juliane Kippenberg, senior children's right researcher at Human Rights Watch."This treaty will help protect both the environment and people's right to health."</body>

      <body>The government is exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has told MPs.A six week trial of badger culling in Somerset has now ended.But the firm behind it has asked for more time after its marksmen fell short of killing the target of 70% of the badger population.Mr Paterson said the Department for Food and Rural Affairs was looking at other methods including the use of gas.Responding to a question from Green MP Caroline Lucas in the Commons, Mr Paterson said: "Until we can establish vaccines, we have to use the tools used by other sensible countries - which is to remove wildlife - we made it quite clear in our TB strategy we would look at other methods of removing wildlife, and yes we are looking at gassing, but we will not use it unless it is proven to be safe, humane, and effective."Labour MP Barry Sheerman called the badger cull "morally reprehensible" and asked Mr Paterson "why doesn't he resign?" during heated Commons exchanges.Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said the gassing of badgers was "inhumane" and she hoped Mr Paterson's words "will not be interpreted as a green light for illegal gassing of settings, of which there have been credible reports".She called for a "coordinated plan across England to vaccinate badgers and improve biosecurity to reduce transmission among cattle and between cattle, badgers and other wildlife".Marksmen only managed to shoot 60% of the badgers in the trial area in Somerset, although estimates have been lowered as to how many badgers lived in the region in the first place.The company behind the cull has asked for more time and a similar time extension is being sought for a trial cull Gloucestershire.The government is due to make a decision on extending the culls later this week.Farmers have long blamed badgers for spreading bovine TB in cattle but animal rights groups say evidence does not support this.At one time gassing was the preferred method of culling but it was dropped in favour of shooting, which is seen as more humane.The RSPCA said it was "opposed to the use of gas to control badgers on welfare grounds and believes it is not humane as it may cause badgers to suffer prolonged deaths underground"."We are extremely concerned about the government's admission that they are looking into using gassing to cull badgers," the organisation said in a statement."Culling badgers will not solve the problem of bovine TB in cattle, whatever the method of culling."The possible gassing of badgers adds a further outrageous twist to this misguided policy. The RSPCA will look into reports that badgers have been gassed in and around the pilot cull areas."Martin Surl, Police and Crime Commissioner for Gloucestershire, has warned that plans to extend the cull could stretch police resources in his area.Mr Surl told the the Stroud News and Journal: "My concern is that the cull operators are feeling the pressure and may become more desperate in their attempts to shoot their quota of badgers while the people opposed to the cull are getting equally frustrated, all of which adds up to an unhelpful situation."But Laurence Robertson, Conservative MP for Tewkesbury, dismissed Mr Surl's concerns, accusing him in the Commons of being "publicity-seeking", adding that it was for the government to decide whether to extend the cull.In the trial, the plan was to shoot and kill 70% of badgers in the areas of west Somerset and Gloucestershire by free shooting. It has ended in Somerset and is due to finish in Gloucestershire on Monday.Across both regions this meant around 5,000 badgers were to be killed in total.But Defra sources said these targets were based on population estimates from 2012 that have proved to be highly inaccurate.Explaining the failure to meet the target on Wednesday, Mr Paterson said: "The badgers moved the goalposts."We're dealing with a wild animal, subject to the vagaries of the weather and disease and breeding patterns."But rock star and campaigner Brian May, a leading opponent of the cull, branded the trial an "utter failure" and described the application for an extension as a "farce"."They were warned this would happen and they did not listen to the scientists," he added.</body>

      <title>Mixed fortunes for Cape vultures</title>
      <description>Expanding networks of pylons and power lines in southern Africa are extending Cape vultures' foraging range but it comes at a cost, say scientists.</description>

      <body>Cape vultures in southern Africa are using expanding networks of pylons and power lines to extend their range, say scientists.At the same time these lines are also contributing to this threatened bird of prey's decline through fatal collisions and electrocutions.The study involved a team of experts from the UK and South Africa tracking individual bird movements using GPS.The results are published in the online journal PLoS One.Southern Africa's Cape vultures (Gyps coprotheres) - like many other species of vulture - are in decline. Contributing factors include feeding on illegally poisoned carcasses and fatal collisions with wind turbines and power lines.To understand more about their movements, and how these vultures interact with power lines, a team of scientists fitted GPS devices to five adult and four immature birds."What we were trying to find out was how far they were going and what sort of areas they were feeding in," explained lead researcher Louis Phipps from Nottingham Trent University, UK.They thought the birds would be travelling large distances, but were not expecting the vultures to be travelling across almost the whole of southern Africa."Their individual home ranges on average cover an area larger than the British Isles which is a huge area and among the largest areas of any vulture," said Mr Phipps.From the capture site the birds travelled up to 1,000km (621 miles) in a straight line and as a group entered five different countries, regularly crossing international borders."It seems that their movement actually followed the pattern and distribution of where those [power] lines were and have been constructed," he said.According to Mr Phipps these vultures are using the pylons and power lines as roosting and perching sites where no other suitable perches are available, allowing them to travel beyond the recognised range for this species.And because they are spending more time in the vicinity of these power lines, the vultures are at a higher risk of colliding with the overhead wires. Even though they could travel further by using the power lines as roost sites, there is an increased risk of fatalities."So just as a mortality factor power lines are bad, but potentially they may be benefitting them by furthering their range to the west," Mr Phipps told BBC Nature.The study also examined the role of protected areas and wildlife reserves."Our data actually shows that although vultures, especially Cape vultures, definitely need these areas for protection...they actually spend most of their time foraging on private farmland."This leaves them exposed to the full range of threats in the wider landscape, more exposed to poisoned livestock carcasses and harmful veterinary drugs which was the cause of the Asian vulture population collapse."Mr Phipps explained that as GPS tracking is very accurate it shows exactly where vultures are foraging, building on this data in the future will allow co-ordinated cross border conservation measures to be implemented in exactly the right areas."There are lots of factors playing against each other that make the vultures' daily life a very big struggle," Mr Phipps told BBC Nature."On balance power lines are not a good thing for vultures."Join BBC Nature on Facebook and Twitter @BBCNature.</body>

      <title>Strategy focuses on UK trees' future</title>
      <description>An official strategy is due to be unveiled that aims to protect the UK's broadleaved woodlands.</description>

      <body>An official strategy is due to be unveiled later that aims to protect the UK's broadleaved tree species.The strategy has been developed by Forest Research, part of the Forestry Commission, and two charities, the Earth Trust and Future Trees Trust.It will be launched by environment minister Lord De Mauley at an event in Westminster.It encourages people to choose seeds and saplings carefully to ensure that the trees which they plant do well.Broadleaved trees are those which have wide leaves rather than the needle-like leaves of conifers. They include ash, beech, birch, elm, holly, hornbeam, lime, oak and poplar.The document's authors say broadleaved woodlands have declined over the past 200 years, resulting in 95% of hardwood timber now having to be imported.The 16-page vision, called A Future With Broadleaved Trees, says the trees have a "very special place in our national psyche" but are "much more than just beautiful things".Co-author Dr Steve Lee from Forest Research - the scientific arm of the Forestry Commission - explained: "If they are good quality and grow well, they will lock up carbon for a long period of time. Also, you can make good quality products from the timber, which will last for a very long time."The act of planting a tree, and the cost of that tree, is probably going to be the same regardless of where you get it from," he told BBC News."So you could plant a maladapted tree, wait a long time and it does not grow very well. Yet you could invest the same amount of money in another tree, which grows very well and remains more resilient to any changes that come along in terms of climate, pests and diseases."What we are really saying that the effort is the same, so look around before you plant and think hard about what it is and why it is you are planting those trees."The strategy, which looks ahead to 2025, is centred around three core objectives:Earth Trust chief executive Jayne Manley explained: "Our much loved broadleaved trees could provide significant benefits to people and the environment as well as the rural economy."We need to focus on these trees rather than take them for granted and part of this is identifying and planting 'improved' trees which are productive, healthy and adaptable."Dr Lee added: "What you are really after is something that will remain well adapted on that site and will remain resilient to any environmental impacts that may occur over the 80-year or so rotation period."The suggestion is that the local material, which you might have planted in the past without really thinking about it, might not be the most resilient in the future."</body>

      <title>Four 'flying ant days' in a month</title>
      <description>The UK experienced a month of flying ants this summer with four peaks of activity, according to a scientific survey and social media.</description>

      <body>The UK experienced a month of flying ants this summer, scientists have said.Results from this year's flying ant survey show four peaks of ant emergence during a four week period and included data from social media for the first time.Last year's results dispelled the myth of a single flying ant day by revealing two peaks of activity over a fortnight.The results were presented by ecologist Professor Adam Hart during a 24 hour lecture as part of Biology Week.The flying ant survey is conducted by the Society of Biology and University of Gloucestershire."Last year we were surprised by two distinct flying ant days, so having such a long period of flying ant sightings this year was even more of a shock," said Prof Hart, ecologist from the University of Gloucestershire.Black garden ants (Lasius niger) are the most commonly seen flying ant in the UK when the summer skies fill with a mix of males and potential queens.The ants mate in the air and their nuptial, or mating flight, is the first step to founding a new colony.The first flying ant sightings this year were in late June - earlier than in 2012 - and continued into September.Like last year's survey, the results indicate that rather than a single 'flying ant day' there were multiple peaks in activity.Dr Rebecca Nesbit, survey coordinator from the Society of Biology explained that 2012 had two very distinct peaks, whereas 2013 had four main peaks. The 'ant season' was also longer, with the last flying ant day in 2013 two weeks after the last one in 2012."Neither year showed a single 'flying ant day' as anecdotes suggested we would find. It has raised interesting questions about whether individual ant nests are releasing flying ants on multiple days," Dr Nesbit told BBC Nature."The different patterns in 2012 and 2013 suggest flexibility in the ants' behaviour. It will be fascinating to see whether these patterns are seen again in following years, or whether we will see new patterns entirely," she said.The survey, which ran for the first time in 2012, encourages members of the public to submit their sightings of this summer spectacle to help scientists understand ant behaviour.This year the survey went one step further by using information from social media site Twitter alongside the submitted sightings.Christina Catlin-Groves from the University of Gloucestershire has been analysing the survey data and said: "Using Twitter has been really exciting for us; now a wealth of new data is available for monitoring the phenomenon."One of the main things it allowed the researchers to do was access data prior to the 2012 ant survey."The use of social media has really exciting potential for us and is something we hope to expand on for future years," Dr Nesbit told BBC Nature."The similarity between the time of day people were tweeting about flying ants and the times they reported seeing them in our survey was quite striking."Results suggest a peak flying time of 18:00 was remarkably consistent between years and that there were no distinct differences across the UK."It appears that different summer weathers lead to different patterns of flying ants, and with more years' worth of data we should be able to learn a lot more," she said.Biology Week is a series of events organised by the Society of Biology from 12 - 18 October.Join BBC Nature on Facebook and Twitter @BBCNature.</body>

      <body>A platypus that got stuck in a car engine in Australia has been safely released back into the wild, Australian conservation officials say.The female platypus wedged itself inside the engine bay of a car driving through a flooded river crossing south of Canberra late on Wednesday.It was driven more than 15km (9 miles) before the driver realised an animal was in the car.Officials described the incident as a "one-in-a-million" event.The driver, Cameron Blaseotto, said he heard scratching from under his car bonnet when he parked his car.He and his friend "originally thought a possum or something was going to jump out at both of us", he told Australian broadcaster ABC."We had a bit of an argument about who was going to open the engine bay," he added.They were surprised to discover a platypus stuck in the engine bay, and called the territory's Parks and Conservation Service."Our urban wildlife rangers get calls ranging from snakes in houses to quolls (a carnivorous marsupial) in trees, but this was definitely one of our most unusual calls," Regional Operations Manager Brett McNamara said."There's obviously many moving parts within an engine bay and given platypus have claws there is not much to hang onto," he said."How this animal was able to climb up inside, hang on, and then drive all the way back into Canberra is a truly remarkable story."Mr McNamara added that the platypus, who was in perfect health, was returned to her home and released on Thursday morning.Platypuses - egg-laying mammals with a duck-like bill - are native to Australia.</body>

      <title>Can science fiction ever get the science right</title>
      <description>How accurate is the science in modern science fiction?</description>

      <body>Alfonso Cuaron's new film Gravity promises to rekindle the debate over how "hard" - or accurate - science fiction should be. Should film-makers adhere to basic scientific principles, or should audiences just feel the magic instead, asks Peter Ray Allison.The relationship between science and science fiction has always been tempestuous.Gravity focuses on two astronauts stranded in space after the destruction of their space shuttle. Since Gravity's US release (it comes to the UK in November) many critics have praised the film for its scientific accuracy.But noted astrophysicist Dr Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, had several issues with the accuracy of Gravity's portrayal of space.Through a series of posts on Twitter, Tyson - who later emphasised that he "enjoyed the film very much" - highlighted various errors.He noted the Hubble space telescope (orbiting at 350 miles above sea level), the International Space Station (at 250 miles), and a Chinese space station could never be in line of sight of one another. On top of that, most satellites orbit west to east, yet in the film the satellite debris was seen drifting east to west.Tyson also noted how Sandra Bullock's hair did not float freely as it would in zero-gravity. This is arguably not so much an error in physics, but a reflection of the limitations of cinematic technology to accurately portray actors in zero-gravity. That is, of course, without sending them into space for the duration of the film.There has always been a drive for scientific accuracy within science fiction, especially within the "hard science fiction" literary sub-genre. But sci-fi, especially in film, tends to have a more flamboyant approach, where realism is often dispensed with in favour of visual flair.The Michael Bay film Armageddon is known for its woeful number of inaccuracies, from the space shuttles separating their rocket boosters and fuel tanks in close proximity to each other (risking a collision) and to objects falling on to the asteroid under a gravitational pull seemingly as strong as the Earth's. More than one interested observer tried to work out how big the bomb would have to be to blow up an asteroid in the way demanded in the movie. Answer: Very big indeed.Nasa is reported to have even used Armageddon as part of a test within their training programme, asking candidates to identify all the scientific impossibilities within the film.Despite the presence of physicist Prof Brian Cox as a scientific adviser on Danny Boyle's Sunshine, artistic licence seeped in. There's a communications "dead-zone" around the Sun - not something easily explicable using real world rules.Despite claims to the contrary, Red Planet was riddled with scientific implausibilities, from the compatibility between modern equipment and 30-year old Russian technology (imagine attempting to connect a modern PC with a Sinclair Spectrum), to the Martian "nematodes" which had been eating algae that had been sent from earth for the past 30 years. The nematodes should have been worms but looked closer to beetles. And there was no explanation as to how they had evolved to eat non-Martian algae nor what they had eaten before.The science across the film was so "creative" that Nasa refused to act as scientific adviser on the film.But perhaps the biggest example of scientific licence occurs in a plethora of space-based dramas."The most commonly lauded example of 'bad science', intentionally placed into science fiction, is that of sound," says Ed Trollope, spacecraft operations engineer at technology firm Telespazio VEGA Deutschland. "Because space is a vacuum, there is no sound, which means all those explosions and engine noises shouldn't be there."There's a simple cinematic reason for having the sound of an explosion when a spacecraft blows up - it feels right to the viewer. But other conventions are more difficult for scientists to accept."My pet peeve is inertia," says Trollope. "There are many good reasons for keeping your engines on in space, but 'maintaining speed' is not one of them. If you turn your engines off, you don't stop."Some do it slightly better than others. "I'd prefer not to single out a single film/book/series for this particular error, because it's so common - but I will laud the old television show Babylon 5, for doing a wonderful job of representing the mechanics of spaceflight inertia so nicely," explains Trollope.2001: A Space Odyssey's silent scenes of space craft, with their rotating Stanford torus design, were closer than many later examples to the reality of travelling in space."A classic case of scientific inaccuracy was the first edition of Ringworld by Larry Niven, a novel which won both the Hugo and Nebula awards in 1971," suggests science fiction author Charles Stross. "The author inadvertently set up a series of scenes which implied that the Earth spun on its axis in the wrong direction." Niven fixed it in the second printing.The Duncan Jones film Moon was lauded for a reasonably accurate portrayal of what lunar mining for Helium-3 could look like in the future. Helium-3 is rare on Earth but less rare on the Moon, and using an automated method with a human overseer might be possible. But the economics behind the mining is not explained.The alien signal in Contact is a prime example of what Seti (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) is looking for. This is perhaps not surprising as Contact was written by astronomer Carl Sagan. The use of mathematics in the transmission of the message seems reasonable and the time lag in the sending and receiving of the signal is also accurately represented in the film.Science fiction is not just expected to accurately portray science but also to anticipate future developments."Science fiction hits some predictive targets," says science fiction author Neal Asher, "but rather in the way that a clip fired from an assault rifle will hit some of the enemy hidden in the jungle, but mostly hits trees and leaves.""One of the past criticisms of science fiction has been that it's all 'zap-guns and rocket ships'," suggests Asher. "Now the science fiction writer can smugly point out the LaWs - the US navy laser system - knocking down drones, and then wax lyrical about the X Prize, Virgin Galactic and Elon Musk's SpaceX."Richard Blott, principal consultant at Space Enterprise Partnerships, recalls an early episode of Star Trek ("Spock's Brain", 1968) where the latest space ship is described as having an "ion drive"."Nowadays most new communications satellites have ion engines and they have powered missions to Vesta and Ceres," says Blott."In the end," Asher concludes, "science fiction is not there to make accurate predictions about the future, it is there to entertain and stimulate the imagination. There is absolutely no doubt that many of the imaginations it stimulates belong to scientists. To some extent it drives and directs science."Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <body>Science can only develop by ignoring national borders, says Lisa Jardine.Since its modern beginnings in the 17th Century, science has been the most global of pursuits. Information and experimentation have criss-crossed national borders, as the curious have tried to explain the properties of natural phenomena.Marie Curie, discoverer of radium and winner of two Nobel prizes, put the matter characteristically bluntly: "Science is essentially international. It is only through lack of a historical sense that national qualities have been attributed to it."Not that you would think so if you have followed the science news this week. As the Nobel prizes for 2013 have been announced, each nation's media have rushed to claim the winners as their own."Three Americans win joint Nobel prize for medicine," shouted the headline in the New York Times. "A German and two Americans win the Nobel prize for medicine," counter-claimed Der Spiegel.One of this year's winners is indeed German born and trained, though he has worked for many years in the United States.On Tuesday the prize for physics went, as expected, to Britain's (or should that be Scotland's) Peter Higgs.Of the five other physicists who could lay claim to having made crucial early theoretical breakthroughs in relation to the Higgs-Boson particle, it was Francois Englert of Belgium alone who shared the prize with Higgs.Predictably, every Belgian newspaper I consulted on Wednesday morning ran a banner headline along the lines of "Belgian wins Nobel prize for physics", relegating Higgs to the second or third paragraph.Higgs and Englert published their theories of how certain particles acquire mass independently in 1964 - Higgs working in Edinburgh, and Englert and his long-term colleague Robert Brout in Brussels.It has been characteristic of advances in science since the beginning that a single problem is worked on - and ultimately solved at about the same time - by individuals and teams in different countries, who read the same papers, correspond and meet intermittently at academic conferences.An example on a much more modest scale from the period closest to my own heart as a historian, the 17th Century, is the investigation of a phenomenon known today as Prince Rupert's drops. As it happens, this too linked scientists in Britain and the Low Countries.If a globule of molten glass is dropped into a bucket of cold water, it cools to form a tear-shaped drop of a size that fits into the palm of your hand with a long, slender tail.This tadpole-shaped drop has extraordinary properties. The main body of the tear is remarkably strong - you can stand on it, or hit it with a hammer, without it breaking.But if the tiniest fragment is broken from the tail, the entire drop shatters and explodes with a loud bang, disintegrating into dust. This combination of strength and weakness, and its potential explosive possibilities, demanded an explanation.Prince Rupert's drops seem first to have attracted scientific interest in Germany in the 1640s. By the 1650s they were being examined and discussed in France and the Netherlands, with a whole range of theories being produced concerning the drop's strange properties. One of the earliest recorded attempts at an explanation involved the Dutch polymath Sir Constantijn Huygens and the amateur scientist Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle.Cavendish was domiciled in Antwerp at the time, exiled from Britain during the Commonwealth period. In a letter to her following a visit, Huygens recorded a conversation they had about the drops - at the time known as "Dutch tears" - in her private chemistry laboratory. There, each week, she apparently "dirtied several white petticoats" worn as overalls to protect her clothing while she conducted experiments.Enclosing several specimens, Huygens begs her to investigate their properties. "The King of France is as yet unresolved in the question, notwithstanding he hath been curious to move it to an assembly of the best philosophers of Paris."The duchess replied a week later. She expressed her gratitude to Huygens for seeking her opinion. In her view, the cause of the explosion when the tip of the drop was broken was that there was a tiny quantity of volatile material trapped inside which reacted violently on contact with air.With a nice feminine touch, she observed that if liquid had somehow been inserted into the drops (actually, the drops contain no liquid) it would have required no greater skill than that employed to make fashionable glass earrings."Women wear at their ears for pendants as great wonders, glass bobs with narrow necks as these glasses have tails, and yet it is filled with several colours silks and coarse black cotton-wool, which to my sense is more difficult to put into these glass pendants, than liquor into these glass guns."The correspondence continued for some weeks, though neither party could come up with anything like an acceptable explanation.In 1661, the properties of the "glass bubbles" were demonstrated at a meeting of the recently formed Royal Society in London. Several of its founding members had recently returned from continental Europe at the Restoration of Charles II - including the king's German cousin Prince Rupert, who gave his name to the drops. So it is not surprising that specimens of what diarist Samuel Pepys called "Chymicall glasses" came with them."The king sent by Sir Paul Neile five little glass bubbles," the minutes of the meeting record, "in order to have the judgement of the society concerning them."Anxious to impress the king (whose financial support the society was actively seeking) the members responded immediately. More drops were produced and experimented on two days later, and a full report of the experiments given to the society at its weekly meeting by the president.These were shared with the French traveller Balthasar de Monconys when he attended the Royal Society. He made his own French translation of the report, and discussed the drops and their properties with the scientific community in Leiden when he visited shortly afterwards.It was my scientific hero Robert Hooke, the society's curator of experiments - the person in charge of those experiments recorded in 1661 - who made an important early contribution to explaining this strange phenomenon, based on the differential cooling of the glass itself after it was plunged into water, and drawing an analogy with the way the locked stones in brick arches collapse instantaneously and violently once the keystone is removed.Hooke used his new microscope to examine drops which had been shattered, but held intact with strong glue. His contributions to a theoretical explanation cover 11 closely-argued pages in his 1665 Micrographia.In the 19th Century the great Lord Kelvin added his contribution. But the behaviour of these "Dutch tears" was not fully explained until the 1920s. So multiple connections between at least four European nations contributed to the eventual properly scientific understanding of "Prince Rupert's drops".I might add that Margaret Cavendish's involvement in the story is not her only appearance in early modern science. Pepys described in his diary a sensational London social event in 1667, when the duchess paid a ceremonial visit to the Royal Society at the invitation of its president and fellows - the only woman to do so before the modern era. Among the experiments carried out for her were several involving Robert Boyle's famous "evacuating engine" or air pump.It is tempting for the historian to claim landmark events in science on behalf of the nation to which he or she belongs. I have come close to doing as much myself, when I hinted that Hooke might have been the first to provide an explanation for the behaviour of Prince Rupert's drops. Brian Cox begins his recent Science Britannica TV series by announcing: "In these films I want to explore Britain's pivotal role in creating modern science."But science has always ignored national borders, in pursuit of the fullest possible understanding of nature. Even at the height of the Anglo-Dutch wars in the mid-17th Century, correspondence full of information and data continued to be exchanged uncensored between Dutch scientists and the Royal Society in London.Higgs and Englert have been quick to point out that the crucial experimental work at CERN that confirmed their Nobel-prize winning theoretical breakthrough was the result of global teamwork, involving thousands of researchers and almost 100 nationalities.To be true to the benefits of a scientific future we have to honour its equally international past.Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Alzheimer's breakthrough: Cure or hype?</title>
      <description>How significant are reports of a turning point in Alzheimer's?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24478942</url>

      <body>If you regularly walk past a newspaper stand, then "Alzheimer's cure" or "Major Alzheimer's breakthrough" headlines will be a familiar sight. And here we are again.UK researchers have, for the first time, used a chemical to prevent the death of brain tissue in a neurodegenerative disease.The Times went with Cure for Alzheimer's "within reach" on its front page, the Independent had Scientists hail historic breakthrough in war against Alzheimer's, and my BBC News website article used the headline Alzheimer's find is "turning point".One major difference this time is that sensible, cautious scientists are suggesting the latest discovery could be one for the history books.Nearly every report contains this quote from Prof Roger Morris, at King's College London: "This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer's disease."So what is it about the latest study that generates a rare level of excitement? And is a cure really on the cards?The prime source of excitement is that a chemical has stopped the death of brain cells, in a living brain, that would have otherwise died due to a neurodegenerative disease.This is a first and a significant one. When I interviewed Prof Morris on Wednesday night, he used the word "landmark" repeatedly.In the Medical Research Council study at the University of Leicester, the mice had prion disease, similar to the human form of mad cow disease. Within eight weeks, their brains deteriorated so badly that memory and movement were noticeably affected. By the 12th week, the mice were dead.But when the same infected animals were given a "drug-like compound", they survived the 12 weeks with no sign of the brain dying. The chemical also caused side-effects including weight loss and diabetes.The second tier of excitement comes from the potential implications.The chemical helps the brain cope with producing broken proteins. In Parkinson's the alpha-synuclein protein goes wrong, in Alzheimer's it's amyloid and tau, in Huntington's it's the Huntingtin protein.The brain's response to all of these diseases is to shut down protein production, but this eventually kills brain cells. The chemical helps brain cells ignore the broken proteins, keep functioning and stay alive.In the past, research on neurodegenerative diseases has focused on what is unique to that condition. This approach looks at what is common to all of them and if it really does work, then it raises the prospect of a single drug to cure or prevent nearly all forms of neurodegeneration. Another reason for excitement.Lead researcher Prof Giovanna Mallucci said: "If it stops brain degeneration in its tracks, it will halt disease in people who have already got it. And if we can detect early disease, it will prevent a lot of degeneration."The hope is to arrest the process of brain cell death, and that's what's so exciting."It's worth emphasising the precise findings of the study - a toxic chemical, which the researchers will not even call a drug, halts the death of brain cells in mice with prion disease.Clearly this is not a cure, but it points the way to one. It gives drugs companies and scientists something to work with.That process will take time, probably more than a decade, with no guarantee of success at the end.And the recent history of medical research is littered with examples of drugs that looked promising in mice, but were a bitter disappointment when tested in people.This chemical works in a mouse brain of 75 million neurons. A more complex human brain built from 85 billion neurons is a far different challenge.Dr Simon Ridley, the head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, told the BBC patients would be facing a long wait."I'm afraid it's far longer than any of us would like," he said."I think there are many people who'd be desperate for any news of new treatments, which they would like to take today."I think at this stage we could be looking at a decade before we'll know whether this will be effective."This study is certainly exciting scientifically. But it might take until 2023 to see whether it truly deserves its place in the history books.</body>

      <title>Is altruism self-interest in disguise?</title>
      <description>Does it matter why we help others?</description>

      <body>Is altruism simply self-interest in disguise? And can a mathematical equation hope to answer the question?In 1968, an academic almost unknown in the UK walked into University College London and presented its staff with an equation so remarkable, that they offered him an honorary position and the keys to his own office.His name was George Price, and his equation addressed a problem that has vexed scientists since Charles Darwin published On The Origin of Species more than a century earlier. If we are selfish creatures, engaged in a battle for survival, why do we display altruism? Why do we show kindness to others even at a cost to ourselves?Price's equation explained how altruism could thrive, even amongst groups of selfish people.It built on the work of a number of other scientists, arguably beginning with JBS Haldane, a British biologist who developed a theory in the early 1950s. When asked if he would sacrifice his own life to save that of another, he said that he would, but only under certain conditions. "I would lay down my life for two brothers, or eight cousins."Haldane's reasoning was a simplistic explanation of a theory that has come to dominate evolutionary biology - that of "kin selection".Since he would share 50% of each brother's genetic makeup, and 12.5% of each cousin's, his genes would survive even if he were to die.It took until the early 1960s for another scientist, William Donald Hamilton, to popularise the theory. He wrote a simple equation to explain that an organism would demonstrate self-sacrificing behaviour if it would enhance the reproductive chances of those it was closely related to.In 1967 Price arrived in London from the United States, where he had been a scientist and journalist, but with no background in the field of evolutionary biology.He discovered Hamilton's theory in a public library and thought he could improve upon it. Working in seclusion, he rewrote the equation in a simpler but more wide-reaching way. It explained the relationship between different generations of a population, and could be used to show how the prevalence of particular traits would change over time.Although it was a fairly simple statement, it had never been expressed in clear mathematical terms, and the staff at the University College London recognised his insight as wildly original.A debate about the scientific roots of altruism still rages to this day, but kin selection remains a hugely influential theory, and Price's contribution is held in high regard by many."It underpins a lot of modern evolutionary biology research," says Andy Gardner, an evolutionary biologist at Oxford University, who uses the Price Equation in much of his work.Oren Harman, who wrote Price's biography in 2010, says the view is shared by plenty of people in the field."Although there are those who fail to see the precise use of the equation, others think of it as the most simple and brilliant description of the dynamics of natural selection."But Price began to find the implications of his work very difficult to deal with, according to Harman. If altruism was simply an attempt to ensure the survival of one's own genes, could it be considered altruism at all?Lee Dugatkin, professor of Biology at the University of Louisville, thinks it was this thought that triggered a major change in Price. "That was what got him going," he says. "He was so depressed when he found out that Hamilton was right."In the summer of 1970, Price became a devout Christian and embarked on a radical project - giving himself over to the service of others."He was going to go out to try and show that human beings are the only species that can beat out their own nature. And he was going to do that by becoming a pure selfless altruist," says Harman.Price began giving money to homeless people, and invited many of them to live with him in his flat near Oxford Circus. His increasingly erratic behaviour left him penniless. He left his flat and eventually moved into a squat in Kentish Town.It is not universally agreed that Price's equation triggered his downfall - he was undoubtedly suffering from some form of mental illness as well. And in the winter of 1975, Price took his own life.For Harman, the two are inextricably linked. "I think the fact that George killed himself due to his interpretation of the equation really focuses the problem to the utmost degree."Price's story is laced with tragedy, but need his scientific work imply a dark, depressing view of human nature?Samir Okasha, professor of the philosophy of science at Bristol University, thinks not. "The idea that what evolutionary theory shows is that altruism is self-interest in disguise is, to my mind, a questionable thing to say."Behaviour in some animal species is indeed genetically determined, he says, but with humans "that certainly isn't the case". He argues that culture sets us apart from animals in that respect, and points to the huge variance in social norms in different countries, and over short periods of time."We have seen rather dramatic change over, say, a 300-year period, which cannot be explained by genetics," he says.Harman also disagrees with Price's interpretation of his own work. "It is not a necessary logical conclusion. It was his own conclusion, the conclusion of a troubled mind, but it's what led him to a terrible realisation that there is no true kindness in the world."If we want to understand behaviour, biology is part of it - it has to be by definition. But that's never an entire and complete explanation for the complexity and grandeur of the human condition."Gardner thinks it is always possible to think of people as attempting to protect and reproduce their own genetic material. "But that's not necessarily always selfish," he says. "There's room for altruism in that logic."Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>NSA chief pledges more transparency</title>
      <description>US electronic spy agency chief speaks to the BBC</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24470450</url>

      <body>The US electronic spy agency is committed to being more transparent, a senior official has told the BBC.In a rare interview on a recent visit to London, National Security Agency (NSA) Deputy Director Chris Inglis spoke to the BBC about cyber-security.His comments came in the wake of revelations about the agency's work from former contractor Edward Snowden.Mr Snowden's leaks sparked a debate about secrecy and the scale of the agency's powers.In the interview, Mr Inglis said there was a need to consider the balance between secrecy and transparency in order to have the public's confidence.With the world becoming more reliant on the internet, Mr Inglis outlined concerns over three threats in cyberspace: the theft of intellectual property and secrets; disruption of networks (for instance, attacks that have taken websites of American banks offline in recent months); and destructive acts such as those that targeted Saudi Aramco last year, destroying tens of thousands of computers."There is no failure of imagination in this space," he said of those seeking to exploit the internet.Dealing with threats requires more being done by both the private sector and the government to better defend networks and deter adversaries, he said.Responses to cyber attacks - such as those on American banks, which many commentators believe came from Iran - needed to be carefully thought through and might involve a range of tools, the NSA's number-two said."If at the end of the day we were to determine that those were attributable to another nation state, then surely we might think that is then the crossing of a red line," Mr Inglis said. "But the response should be proportionate," adding that it may come from the private sector rather than government.Dealing with commercial espionage in cyberspace, he said, might also involve a range of measures including private or public diplomatic pressure and the targeting of individuals for criminal prosecution.The job of the NSA, Mr Inglis said, was to exploit networks to collect intelligence in cyberspace and to defend certain networks - but not carry out destructive acts."NSA had a responsibility from way back, from our earliest days, to both break codes and make codes," he said. "We have a responsibility to do intelligence in a space we once called the telecommunications arena - now cyberspace - and the responsibility to make codes or to defend signals communications of interest."That's different than what most people conceive as offence or attack in this space."That task of destructive cyber attack, if ordered, lies with the US military's rapidly expanding Cyber Command.However, both the NSA and Cyber Command are led by the same man - General Keith Alexander - because the three fields of exploiting, defending and attacking are closely related."We realised a long time ago that the predicate for all those actions is first understanding how cyberspace works," Mr Inglis said. "Second: finding, fixing, holding in your mind's eye the thing that you would either defend, or exploit or attack. And then - and only then - do you make that final choice about what you are going to do about that."At least in the military component, the US has chosen to invest all those things in a single person such that that person may then orient and synchronise those activities in a way that they complement each other."Mr Inglis has worked for more than 25 years in the NSA, the last seven as deputy director, the highest-ranking civilian.There is no doubt that the last few months will have been the most difficult as the NSA - which was so secret people used to joke that its initials stood for "no such agency" - has been thrust into an uncomfortable spotlight by the leaks by Mr Snowden."I do think there needs to be more transparency," Mr Inglis told the BBC."We've had a discussion many times across the summer about the need to perhaps rebalance the balance between national security and civil liberties," he said."I don't think that is the case. I think that both of those must be given equal and full support. I don't think that we trade one for the other."But I do think we have to consider the balance between secrecy and transparency in order to have the public's confidence or [that of] those who stand in the shoes of the public and act on their behalf, say in the Congress," Mr Inglis added. "There needs to be greater transparency and we are committed to that."The revelations from Mr Snowden have indicated a scale of capability that has surprised even close observers of the NSA and its British partner GCHQ, and this has raised concerns over whether the capabilities are sufficiently accountable."I can appreciate that people are nervous," Mr Inglis said."And we ourselves at NSA need to respect that and therefore offer up whatever is necessary in terms of transparency to secure the confidence of our overseers and beyond them the American public - and for that matter allies."One of the tensions for the NSA over many years is the balance between its two roles of defending networks and exploiting them for intelligence.The most controversial revelation within the cyber security community was the claim that the NSA had been deliberately weakening some of the security protocols surrounding encryption, either by introducing back doors or by modifying international standards to ensure it could gain access to gather intelligence on its targets."What we have found over time is that our adversaries are using precisely the same communication systems, services, pathways as our citizens," Mr Inglis told the BBC."But in pursuing our adversaries we must also defend our citizens," he said. "We must not hold them at risk. And so we do try to crack the encryption used by terrorists and other adversaries in that system. We need to make sure that we do not hold at risk the encryption that is used by US citizens.""So that's rule one and we do in fact find ways to do precisely that," he added. "It is false to imagine or say that NSA broadly has the capability to decrypt most of the encryption that is used by any citizen in the world but in particular US citizens."The revelations by the Guardian newspaper that the NSA was collecting metadata about US communications raised concerns that the agency was getting involved in domestic surveillance.Mr Inglis argued that this collection operated under constraints."Beyond saying that I'm not Big Brother I think we are committed to demonstrating we are not Big Brother," he said, adding that this would involve illuminating the controls on the NSA's actions and performance statistics on those controls.Even beyond the revelations by Mr Snowden, the role of the NSA in cyberspace and the resulting questions of where responsibility lies for defence, intelligence gathering and attack mean the agency is unlikely to be able to retreat back into the secrecy that it enjoyed for so long.</body>

      <title>Bloodhound Diary: Building on the tides</title>
      <description>Precise engineering that factors in the tides</description>

      <body>A British team is developing a car that will be capable of reaching 1,000mph (1,610km/h). Powered by a rocket bolted to a Eurofighter-Typhoon jet engine, the vehicle will mount an assault on the land speed record. The vehicle will be run on Hakskeen Pan in Northern Cape, South Africa, in 2015 and 2016.Wing Commander Andy Green, world land-speed record holder, is writing a diary for the BBC News website about his experiences working on the Bloodhound project and the team's efforts to inspire national interest in science and engineering.It was exactly 30 years ago that Thrust 2 broke the World Land Speed Record - 633mph - and brought the record back to Britain.Until then, it seemed that the US had taken the record away from us for good, with all their new-fangled jet and rocket technology.Fortunately for Britain, a certain Richard Noble decided that we should get it back.When he set the record in 1983, he reminded us (and the rest of the world) that Britain was still a world-beater.Now, 30 years later, we're building something that would go past Thrust 2 like it's standing still - Bloodhound SSC, the world's first 1,000mph car.We have the best motorsports industry in the world (if you need proof, just have a look at where all the Formula 1 teams are based) and one of the best aerospace industries (see the RAF's world-class new Typhoon aircraft for further details).Bloodhound is going to be a product of both industries, with a bit of space technology thrown in.It's another world champion in the making.The car is being assembled at our Technical Centre in Bristol, and every time I see it, more parts have been added.It's also attracting attention from all over the globe: we've got more than 200 countries following it on the Bloodhound SSC website.One of the impressive things about the build is the precision involved.For example, we are aiming to assemble the fin to an accuracy of better than 1/12th of a degree.The whole car is being assembled with this kind of precision with the aid of a "surface table" - a super-flat, 7m-long slab of cast iron that weighs 10 tonnes.The accuracy of the build is regularly checked using a Hexagon laser, which will measure the position of any part of the car, in three dimensions, to one millionth of a metre.This has given us a bit of a problem, though, as the surface table (all 10 tonnes of it) keeps moving.After a lot of checking, it would appear that the surface table, and the whole of our Technical Centre, is actually floating.The ends of the table move up and down by a couple of millimetres or so with the tide. We're only a few hundred metres from the River Avon and the tide in the river makes the floor (and the surface table, and therefore our chassis) go up and down very slightly.If we're fitting new components, the first thing we have to do is re-level the chassis, so that the new bits go on perfectly straight.No-one said that building a 1,000mph car was going to be easy - but we didn't expect to be afloat while we were doing it!The last of the rear upper-chassis ribs have now been delivered.These are the big heavy ribs that will have to support the fin, while it's keeping the car straight.The fin has been stressed to take a 25kN (2.5 tonne) side load.I'm staggered by how much that is (we could lay the car on its side and park two normal road cars on the fin) and how little it is (at 1,000mph, the fin will develop 25kN of side load at a yaw angle of only 0.9 degrees).Sounds like my driving might have to be as accurate as the chassis build - although the 2.5 tonnes of correcting force should help.Don't forget that while the fin is doing its best to keep us pointy-end forwards, you can be right there (or at least your name can). If you want your name to travel at 1,000mph, then sign up here to our fin programme.There's more good news from the aerodynamics team this month.We've been worrying about something called the "yaw static margin" for a while now.The yaw static margin is the distance between the centre of gravity and the aerodynamic centre of the car. In other words, this is what keeps the car pointy-end forwards at high speeds.Ideally, we want the car to look like a dart, with the weight up front and big feathers at the back.We were worried that the static margin (a measure of how dart-like the car is) was smaller than we wanted. It turns out that we'd made two small errors in the calculation.One was in the aerodynamic model of the fin, which hadn't captured the latest changes to extend the trailing edge, so that made the centre of yaw move back a bit.The other change was finding an error in the (hugely complex) centre of gravity calculation, which moved it forward almost 300mm. That's a big gain, and suddenly the car is looking a lot more stable.This will make it easier to keep the car pointy-end forwards and, since that's my job as the driver, I'm delighted.While we're running the car on the desert, one of the key things we'll be checking is the wheel loads.These wheel loads are the result of the car's weight plus all the aerodynamic loads on the vehicle, so we're going to be checking all the aerodynamic forces (and pressures) very carefully.I've just seen a computer programme written by David Naumann, a PhD student at Swansea University. David's programme will compare the real-world pressures, from 120 pressure sensors on the car, with the predicted pressures from the Swansea computer model.This will allow us to check the car's performance very rapidly.We're planning to publish the programme before we start running, so that you can check the car's performance for yourself at home, every time we run.It will also let the 5,500 schools in our Education Programme follow the science as we test it. If your school hasn't signed up to our free programme yet, then join the Bloodhound Education Programme here. It's going to be quite an adventure.URT is now finishing off our carbon-fibre intake duct, which is essentially just a tube to feed air to the car's EJ200 jet engine.The intake was made in two halves and then bolted together to form the 2.2m-long tube. It's another part of the car that will see some big forces.At 1,000mph, the intake will be pressurised to 1.6 Bar (24lb per sq inch), which will try to force the two halves apart with a force of 290kN. That's 29 tonnes.Put another way, each bolt that holds the two halves together will take a load of 13.2kN, or 1.3 tonnes.So after parking two average-sized cars on the side of the fin, we could pick each of them up in turn with just one bolt from the intake.That would explain why the bolts cost about £20 each!If that wasn't enough to worry about, the intake has also been designed to withstand an engine "backfire" without collapsing.If the airflow into a jet engine breaks down, the jet can burp back the air it has been ingesting, known in the jet engine world as a "surge". This could briefly push the intake pressure up almost 3 Bar (44 psi), increasing the load on the intake to over 50 tonnes. That's the weight of four double-decker buses.The bad news is that this load would pretty much wreck the intake. The good news is that we're using the Typhoon's EJ200 engine, one of the world's best jet engines.In normal operation it just doesn't ever surge. I can floor the throttle pedal (which controls the jet engine) at a standstill, and the engine will give me as much power as possible, without any risk that it will surge.The intake doesn't have much to worry about - and neither do I.</body>

      <title>The Nasa probe keeping tabs on our turbulent Sun</title>
      <description>The news from Nasa's highly productive solar observatory</description>

      <body>Brett Sapper has the unique responsibility of controlling Nasa's eye on the Sun.From a modest office in the agency's Goddard Space Center, in Greenbelt, Maryland, Sapper is in charge of the day-to-day operations of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), a satellite equipped with high-speed cameras capable of registering the Sun's activity nearly without interruptions.Launched in 2010 from Cape Canaveral, SDO has already been able to beam back 140 million images of the Sun, and some estimates predict that it will end up transmitting as much as 50 times more scientific information than any other mission in Nasa's history.Researchers hope this massive amount of data will help them forecast the effects of our turbulent star's behaviour on Earth. Intense solar activity can knock out power grids, GPS navigations and radio communications.From SDO's mission operation centre and surrounded by computers showing event logs and colourful displays of the satellite, Sapper says his work is fascinating because he is able to control "a robot in space" that he can't see and is located 36,500km (22,600 miles) above the Earth.But he immediately adds a caveat: "We are like fire fighters. We want to be bored, because if it's exciting it means there's a big problem."Up to now, according to this electrical engineer, there have not been any moments of fear, and he has been able to swiftly work with eight other scientists to control the mission's daily operations.They send commands and instructions to the satellite to tell it where to move, get all the "housekeeping information" back and also control two satellite dishes located at the White Sands Facility, in New Mexico, that are entirely dedicated to tracking the SDO while it collects scientific information."We do all that from here instead of having to call someone and have him do it for us", says Sapper. "That's something new here at Goddard and we are the only mission that does that: control the ground station from the mission operation centre".The satellite has got three instruments used by scientists to analyse not only the stellar surface, but also the star's interior. The possibility of looking inside the Sun is of vital importance to heliophysicists as they aim to decipher the very source of solar activity - the solar dynamo. This refers to the plasma currents that generate the Sun's unpredictable magnetic field.Scientists are now able to peer into the Sun by analysing the star's own acoustic waves, which are generated by its boiling turbulence. Using one of SDO's instruments, researchers are capable of turning those waves into clear pictures of the Sun's inner structures, just as geologists analyse the Earth's interior by studying earthquakes.Of course, Sapper and his colleagues at the mission operation centre cannot do all that work by themselves. In Goddard, his team only controls the technical aspects of the satellite and the antennas, whereas the science is done mainly by laboratories and universities across the country.One of Brett Sapper's colleagues at Goddard is helioseismologist William Dean Pesnell, whose job consists of interacting with the science groups. In other words, Pesnell is responsible for transforming Sapper's technical work into concrete results that may shed light on the solar dynamics that have an impact on the Earth's environment."We look at our satellite 24 hours a day and we get the data very quickly, so we can use it for immediate space weather purposes," says Dr Pesnell.This is important because the Sun's unpredictable behaviour could wreak havoc on the Earth: Nasa cites a 2008 report by the National Academy of Sciences, according to which a century-class solar storm could cause 20 times more economic damage than hurricane Katrina, considered the costliest US hurricane on record.It is therefore relevant for Dr Pesnell and his scientific team to try to understand what the Sun will do next."The goal of all our research is to predict what the magnetic field is going to do," he says."We aim to tell people: 'a flare is going to happen and if that is a concern to you, you should take steps to protect yourself'."But in order to accomplish their goal, both Sapper and Pesnell still have a lot of work ahead of them. SDO set out on a five-year mission, but mission scientists hope Nasa will extend the spacecraft's life by a few more years after 2015.After all, they know that a priceless treasure is at stake: the desire to understand the behaviour of our explosive star.</body>

      <title>NHS Savile abuse probe widened</title>
      <description>The probe into Jimmy Savile's abuse of NHS patients has been extended to include more hospitals, says the health secretary.</description>

      <body>The investigation into Jimmy Savile's alleged abuse of patients at NHS hospitals has been extended to other hospitals, the health secretary says.The inquiry, currently focused on Broadmoor, Stoke Mandeville and Leeds General hospitals, as well as a further 10 trusts, will be expanded to include "other hospitals", Jeremy Hunt said.The hospitals were not named. A final report will be published in 2014.The late DJ is believed to have abused hundreds of victims.The former BBC presenter of Top Of The Pops and Jim'll Fix It, who also worked as a Radio 1 DJ and received a knighthood in 1990, died aged 84 in October 2011 - a year before the allegations were broadcast in an ITV documentary.Revelations that the famed fundraiser had sexually abused children prompted hundreds of victims to come forward, including those who said they were attacked on BBC premises and at a number of other institutions.Savile had a bedroom at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, an office and living quarters at Broadmoor, and widespread access to Leeds General Infirmary.Mr Hunt said: "It is vital that the final NHS investigation report is thorough and complete and reflects all the evidence about Jimmy Savile's pattern of offending."A Scotland Yard investigation into Savile's alleged crimes - one of three strands of Operation Yewtree - is due to report in the new year.The BBC understands it will put the number of alleged victims at over 500.The Department of Health investigation into the three hospitals is being overseen by barrister - and former deputy chairman of the Financial Ombudsman Service - Kate Lampard.In a written ministerial statement, Mr Hunt said: "The Metropolitan Police Service, working with Kate Lampard, has established there was further relevant information regarding Jimmy Savile."The Department of Health asked the Metropolitan Police Service, through an agreed information sharing process, to review information it held to ascertain if it included material related to health and care settings."The revelations about Savile have led to a number of inquiries.Firstly, the police investigation, Operation Yewtree, which has three strands.One is looking specifically at the actions of Savile, and the second strand concerns allegations against "Savile and others".The third strand relates to complaints against other people unconnected to the Savile investigations, made by people who came forward after widespread coverage of the scandal.The BBC has also launched three reviews, including the Pollard Review, which has already reported the findings of its investigation into the dropping of a Newsnight report into claims Savile was a paedophile; and a review by Dame Janet Smith into culture and practices during Savile's career and current policies.The director of public prosecutions is also reviewing decisions not to prosecute Savile in 2009.</body>

      <body>UK police investigating Madeleine McCann's disappearance have released two e-fits of a man they want to speak to as a matter of "vital importance".They will feature in a BBC Crimewatch appeal later over her disappearance on 3 May, 2007, in Praia da Luz, Portugal.Police said the man "may or may not be key" but had been placed in the area.The images are based on evidence from two witnesses who saw him on the night three-year-old Madeleine, from Rothley, Leicestershire, went missing.The witnesses said the man was white, 20 to 40 years old and of medium build. He had short brown hair, was clean-shaven and of medium height, they added.Det Ch Insp Andy Redwood, the senior Metropolitan Police investigating officer, said: "Whilst this man may or may not be the key to unlocking this investigation, tracing and speaking to him is of vital importance to us."We have witnesses placing him in the resort area around the time of Madeleine's disappearance."This is far from our only line of inquiry and there will be e-fits released of other sightings as well, who we are equally keen to trace."These people were seen on the day of Madeleine's disappearance and the days leading up to it."Madeleine went missing from a holiday flat in Praia da Luz, Algarve, as her parents dined with friends at a nearby restaurant.A Portuguese investigation into the case was dropped in 2008, but Scotland Yard began a review of the case in May 2011.On Sunday the Met said the timeline and "accepted version of events" surrounding Madeleine's disappearance had significantly changed, without giving further details.A detailed reconstruction lasting close to 25 minutes and covering events leading up to and surrounding Madeleine's disappearance will also feature on Monday's Crimewatch.Police say the appeal is based on "substantive" new material including mobile phone records.A short clip released in advance by police shows actors playing Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, leaving their holiday apartment for the nearby tapas restaurant.They are then seen seated outdoors at a large poolside table, greeting friends as they come to join them for dinner.Speaking about the review-turned-investigation, Det Ch Insp Redwood said detectives had been able to "make massive steps forward" by drawing together all the material gathered to date and reviewing it as a whole.He said his team had sought to "try and draw everything back to zero... take everything back to the beginning and then reanalyse and reassess everything, accepting nothing".He added: "Praia da Luz is a popular holiday destination for many nationalities so our requests for help need to be repeated in many different countries."He said he would travel to the Netherlands, Germany and Ireland to seek public support there, and would repeat the appeals in Portugal - "a key country for us to trace any outstanding witnesses".In Germany, a special edition of the crime programme Aktenzeichen XY - Ungeloest which is translated as "File XY - Unsolved", will be aired on Wednesday night and will feature an appeal for information from Mr and Mrs McCann.Det Ch Insp Redwood went on to urge anyone, including from the local community, who was in or around Praia da Luz on Thursday, 3 May 2007, to speak to police if they had not already done so."We still have a lot of material to investigate and much work to do," he added.Meanwhile former Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre head Jim Gamble - who carried out a review into the case in 2010 - said the appeal offered "an opportunity for everyone to help"."It doesn't matter that you were not in Praia da Luz - you may watch something, you may see an e-fit, you may see some other information, they may talk about telephone numbers and something will click with you," he told BBC News."And that you will not know unless you watch."Mr and Mrs McCann are expected to make a live appeal from the studio during the programme.Ahead of its broadcast, Mrs McCann said: "We're not the ones that have done something wrong here."It's the person who's gone into that apartment and taken a little girl away from her family."Meanwhile Robert Murat, the first official suspect in the case but long since cleared of any involvement, told the BBC he hoped the new appeal would produce results."It's gone on and on and every time something new comes up, you know, it brings hope and then it seems to fade away and disappear. So I'm hoping that's not going to be the case again," he said.The Crimewatch appeal will be shown in the UK on BBC One on Monday from 21:00 BST. It will also be broadcast in the Netherlands and Germany.</body>

      <body>WH Smith has taken its UK site completely offline until all abuse-themed e-books are removed from its product listings.The move comes after last week's revelations that Amazon, WH Smith, Barnes and Noble, and other retailers were selling pornographic e-books featuring incest, rape and bestiality on their sites.WH Smith said it was "disgusted" by such titles and found them "unacceptable".It takes e-book content from Kobo.com.In a statement Kobo said it was "working quickly to review its catalogue and remove the content, authors and publishers in question"."We are also evaluating new procedures to help ensure that this type of content will not become available... in the future," it said.Meanwhile visitors to the WHSmith.co.uk website were greeted by a holding page statement.The retailer said it had taken the site offline "to best protect our customers and the public"."Our website will become live again once all self published e-books have been removed and we are totally sure that there are no offending titles available", it said."We sincerely apologise for any offence caused."While Kobo said some publishers and authors had violated its self-publishing policies, it maintained that its goal was "not to negatively impact the freedom of expression and the work of the amazing self-published community that has been created at Kobo.com."Over the weekend US retailing giant Barnes and Noble said offending titles were "in violation" of its policy on content offered in the NOOK Bookstore and were in the process of being removed."When there are violations to the content policy that are brought to our attention, either through our internal process or from a customer or external source, we have a rapid response team in place to appropriately categorise or remove the content in accordance with our policy," it said.Self-published e-books have grown massively in popularity along with the growth in digital e-readers and tablet computers, but retailers have been struggling to filter explicit content that breaches their website guidelines.On Friday, technology news site The Kernel revealed how Amazon, Barnes and Noble, WH Smith, Waterstones and Foyles were listing what it called "breathtakingly obscene" books on their websites.But Fiona Allen, spokeswoman for Waterstones, told the BBC: "None of the e-books mentioned in current reporting are now or ever have been available in Waterstones shops or listed on Waterstones' website."She admitted that Waterstones was concerned about some print titles and was investigating those, but that all such printed book data was supplied by Nielsen, a data provider.</body>

      <title>UK to relax visa rules for Chinese</title>
      <description>The UK government will relax visa rules for Chinese nationals coming to the UK, Chancellor George Osborne announces during his China trade trip.</description>

      <body>Visa applications for Chinese visitors entering the UK will be simplified, Chancellor George Osborne has announced during his trade trip to China.Under the plan, Chinese nationals visiting the EU will not need to submit separate UK visa applications if they book with selected travel agents.Mr Osborne is trying to persuade more Chinese companies to invest in the UK.But he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that his trip was also about changing British attitudes to China."Many people think of China as a sweat shop on the Pearl River. Yet it is at the forefront of medicine, computing and technology. It's a very rapidly changing country."Earlier, Mr Osborne told an audience of students that his visit was about "much more than a collection of business deals"."What I really want it to be about is strengthening the understanding between our two nations, deepening our friendship, working out where by working together we can improve the lives of all our citizens," he said in a speech to university students in Beijing."Yes, of course, we have differences, different political systems, we attach value to different things, and we shouldn't be afraid of pointing out where we disagree."But let us not do it in a way that is not respectful of each other and tries to understand each other, and let us try to overcome our differences and work together in peaceful co-operation."Because ultimately we want the same thing - a better life for our citizens."Adam Marshall, director of policy at business lobby group the British Chambers of Commerce, said UK businesses would "breathe a collective sigh of relief" at the plans to simplify Chinese visa applications."For too long, Britain has courted Chinese investment and tourism without facilitating the entry of Chinese visitors with the same vigour. A responsive visa system is crucial to demonstrating that the UK is open to trade and investment," he added.During his week-long trip, Mr Osborne has already unveiled a deal in which a Chinese firm took a 20% stake in a new business park in Manchester.And on Sunday came details of the visa changes.Currently, Chinese visitors can apply for a single visa to visit much of Europe but a separate one is required to travel to the UK.It is thought that the extra paperwork is deterring many Chinese visitors from including the UK in a trip to Europe.A mobile visa scheme that already operates in Beijing and Shanghai will be expanded as part of the changes.Under the mobile service, which was first tested by executives at Wanda, the company that bought Sunseeker yachts, officials go out to applicants to collect their paperwork and biometric data.The process can take less than five minutes.A 24-hour "super priority" visa service will also be available from next summer. The moves will be welcomed by UK businesses who want to benefit from Chinese tourists.In his speech, Mr Osborne said: "Let me make this clear to you and to the whole of China, there is no limit to the number of Chinese who could study in Britain."There is no limit to the number of Chinese tourists who can visit. No limit on the amount of business we can do together."According to the government, last year 210,000 visas were issued to Chinese nationals and they contributed about £300m to the UK economy.</body>

      <body>Four men are being questioned over an alleged terror plot after they were arrested in a series of raids by armed police officers across London.The men - arrested at about 19:10 BST on Sunday in Whitechapel, Bayswater and Peckham - are being held on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.Searches are continuing at six addresses and on two vehicles.Whitehall officials said the alleged plot was "potentially very serious".But they said it did not appear to be on anything like the scale of earlier major plots, such as the airline liquid bomb plot or the Birmingham rucksack bomb plot, which all resulted in convictions.The men were taken to a south London police station.Two men, both aged 25, were arrested in a car in Mansell Street, Whitechapel, east London, after police fired "Hatton rounds" - ammunition designed to blow out tyres and blow open doors with minimal collateral damage.A 28-year-old man was arrested at premises in Westbourne Grove, Bayswater, west London, and the fourth man, aged 29, was arrested in Peckham Hill Street, Peckham, south-east London.BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said the decision to make arrests was taken on Sunday by a joint committee of senior officers from MI5 and the Met Police's Counter Terrorism Command.As always, they faced a dilemma over whether to hold off longer to gather more evidence but then risk danger to the public, he said.The alleged plot had been monitored for some time, he added.Alistair Gillies, 38, who saw one of the arrests taking place, told the BBC: "I was just going out to try and get something to eat and walking back up Westbourne Grove towards Bayswater and I noticed that a police car had pulled across the road."There was probably in the region of about two dozen officers. The majority of them appeared to be plain clothes but they had on baseball caps with the checkerboard and police marking, apart from that, they were dressed in plain clothes."He added: "It didn't look like they had just pulled a car over or had just picked someone up. It looked like there was a great deal of planning and a great deal of resources had been put on to tackling this situation."</body>

      <body>Opponents of the development of a type of genetically modified (GM) rice enriched with vitamin A are "wicked", the environment secretary has said.In an interview with the Independent, Owen Paterson said they could be condemning millions of people in the developing world to a premature death.Mr Paterson backed a letter from international scientists calling for the rapid development of "golden rice".But campaigners say the benefits claimed for the rice are misleading.Mr Paterson told the newspaper: "It's just disgusting that little children are allowed to go blind and die because of a hang-up by a small number of people about this technology."I feel really strongly about it. I think what they do is absolutely wicked. There is no other word for it."Mr Paterson did not specify any particular groups in his interview but also said opponents of GM technology were "casting a dark shadow over attempts to feed the world".BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said Mr Paterson was known as a strong supporter of GM crops but his language seemed certain to raise hackles with those who took a different view.A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokeswoman said it was Mr Paterson's strong personal view.People in the developed usually world get enough vitamin A from their diet by eating foods like cheese, yoghurts and eggs.But deficiency is a common problem in developing countries, and is estimated to affect between 140 million and 250 million children under the age of five.Vitamin A is needed for healthy skin and eyes and to help strengthen the immune system so that the body can fight infections. Deficiency can lead to blindness, illness and death.Supplements are available and the World Health Organisation advocates routine administration of vitamin A in countries where deficiency is a problem.High doses of vitamin A can be harmful, however, particularly in pregnancyMeanwhile, in a letter to US journal Science, a group of leading academics has accused Western non-governmental organisations of fuelling opposition to the development of GM technologies.They wrote: "If ever there was a clear-cut cause for outrage, it is the concerted campaign by Greenpeace and other non-governmental organisations, as well as by individuals, against golden rice."Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth have said there are more effective solutions to vitamin A deficiency.Mr Paterson also used the interview to defend the government's handling of the badger cull - aimed at preventing the spread of bovine TB - against criticism from animal welfare groups.He said: "I cannot understand anyone wanting to tolerate this disgusting disease."I find it incomprehensible that these badger groups don't see that this is a horrendous disease for the badgers themselves."</body>

      <title>Taylor challenges UK jail sentence</title>
      <description>Liberian ex-President Charles Taylor asks to serve his 50-year war crimes sentence in Rwanda, rather than the UK, where he is due to be transferred.</description>

      <body>Ex-Liberian President Charles Taylor has asked to serve his 50-year sentence for war crimes in Rwanda, rather than the UK.In a letter sent to the court that convicted him, he says it would be easier - and less expensive - for his family to visit him in Africa.He also said he feared being attacked in a British prison.Taylor was convicted of aiding rebels who committed atrocities in Sierra Leone during its civil war.Last week, a UK minister confirmed that Taylor would be transferred to a British prison.He was convicted by the UN-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL), but his trial was held in The Hague in case it sparked renewed unrest in West Africa.The Netherlands only agreed to host the trial if he was imprisoned elsewhere.In a letter seen by the BBC, Taylor wrote:"My position is that serving my sentence in Rwanda, in my home continent of Africa, would be substantially more humane not only on my own account, but also on account of the impact on my family."He noted that the court's statutes said access for prisoners' relatives should be taken into account when deciding where they should serve their sentence.He said that it would be cheaper and easier to travel to Rwanda - and that Liberian nationals could obtain visas at the airport, unlike in the UK.Taylor, 65, was convicted on 11 crimes including terrorism, rape, murder and the use of child soldiers by rebel groups in neighbouring Sierra Leone during the 1991-2002 conflict, in which some 50,000 people died.He was found to have supplied weapons to the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels in exchange for so-called blood diamonds.The rebels were notorious for hacking off the limbs of civilians to terrorise the population.Taylor has always insisted he is innocent and his only contact with the rebels was to urge them to stop fighting.He is the first former head of state convicted by an international war crimes court since World War II.In his three-page letter, dated 10 October, Taylor continued: "My name is now associated with horrendous atrocities. Prison inmates, whether from the region or not, are likely to be inclined to inflict their own brand of justice by attacking me."He pointed out that "a significant number of individuals from Sierra Leonean background are in detention in prisons in the UK" and noted that in 2011, Bosnian war criminal Radislav Krstic was attacked in a British jail by three Muslim men, apparently in revenge for his role in the Bosnian conflict.Taylor argued that the UK authorities "may also simply be unaware of the groups that might be particularly motivated to attack me in prison"."In short, incarceration in the United Kingdom will likely - and very soon - lead to me being seriously injured or killed."Some other people convicted by the SCSL are already serving their sentences in Rwanda.Last week, UK Justice Minister Jeremy Wright noted that the British offer to host Taylor had enabled his trial to proceed in The Hague.He told parliament: "The conviction of Charles Taylor is a landmark moment for international justice.""It clearly demonstrates that those who commit atrocities will be held to account and that no matter their position they will not enjoy impunity."Taylor's appeal against his conviction was rejected last month and he remains in The Hague, awaiting transfer.</body>

      <description>A Muslim free school in Derby, which is threatened with closure, says it will support female staff who do not wish to wear head coverings.</description>

      <body>A Muslim free school in Derby has said it will support female staff who do not want to wear head coverings.It follows a letter warning the Al-Madinah School it faced closure unless discrimination against female staff and pupils stopped.Education Minister Lord Nash laid out 17 issues for the school to consider, which included an end to "unacceptable" teaching standards.The letter said if steps were not taken by Tuesday, funding would be pulled.Parent-governor Abdullah Shahjan told BBC Radio Derby: "We are amending policies to make sure we support staff, who if for their cultural, ethical, or faith do not wish to cover their hair."Another governor Fasal Hussain said: "We are very open, very flexible."However, with regard to Lord Nash's letter and female staff wearing head scarves he added: "We would have appreciated some consultation."We have never received any complaints from our staff."During an earlier interview on Newsnight, Mr Shahjan said: "The very first question we ask everybody is 'Would you be prepared to cover your hair if you came into the school as part of the uniform policy?'."To this date, of all those who have come none has ever refused."Head of Islamic studies at the school, Mohammad Burhaan, told Newsnight: "This is the code of dress we have adopted."If you look at an air hostess, for example, a female wears a different code of dress."We are not saying they are discriminated against, that's a choice made by the business."He added: "We are not saying by wearing a head scarf you are changing your religious identity at all... this is the code of dress we would like our female staff to adopt and this is the decision as an organisation we have made."Is it possible to review that - yes it is."The government has told the school to write to all female members of staff telling them they do not have to wear a hijab if it is in conflict with their religion, or beliefs.In the letter outlining concerns, Lord Nash wrote: "The trust has manifestly breached the conditions of its funding agreement by:"I will not tolerate breaches of the commitments you gave when entering into the funding agreement."He has urged the school's trust to take five "urgent steps" by 15 October, including providing written confirmation that "you have ceased any practices and procedures that have as their reason, cause or effect that women and girls are treated less favourably than men and boys".The school has been given a deadline of 22 October to address nine further action points and must provide a plan setting out a clear management structure by the start of November.</body>

      <title>Most women jailed due to men - Pryce</title>
      <description>Most women in Holloway prison are there because of something the men in their life have done, recently jailed Vicky Pryce tells the BBC.</description>

      <body>Most women in Holloway prison are there because of something the men in their life have done, recently jailed Vicky Pryce has told the BBC.The former wife of ex-minister Chris Huhne was sentenced to eight months for perverting the course of justice after taking speeding points for him."I did something, I paid the price," she told Radio 4's Today programme.The economist - who had claimed her husband coerced her - has written a book about the economics of prison.Her royalties from the book will go to the charity Working Chance, which helps women with criminal convictions find work.Pryce, who was recently stripped of her Companion of the Order of the Bath, served two months in the north London prison earlier this year.Huhne, the former energy secretary, was also jailed for the same offence.He left Pryce in 2010 as his affair with PR adviser Carina Trimingham was about to be exposed.During the former couple's trial, the court heard Pryce had revealed the speeding points scandal to newspapers in 2011 to seek revenge.Asked whether she agreed with Chris Huhne's assessment that they had fallen victim to the Murdoch press, she said: "I don't begrudge anyone in terms of what's happened - or any of the journalists frankly - in my view one has to just look forward."I did something, I paid the price of it and that is it."On the prospect of going to prison, Ms Pryce said she knew it was "something I simply had to survive and perhaps learn from it obviously, and see what goes on".The worst aspect of prison life was "losing my liberty, but mostly worrying about my children - that they would be worried about me and how do I react to ensure that they feel that 'actually I'm ok'."And of course that meant that I also had to stay strong."On the claim in her book that many women in Holloway were there mostly because of something their husbands, brothers and fathers had done, she said: "Clearly they knew what they were doing but it didn't mean that they necessarily wanted to do what they did."Vulnerable women who often have lost their self esteem - they could be prostitutes, they could be people who are stealing to feed their, but also their other-half's, drug habits."More than 50% of women who enter jail have been physically, sexually, or emotionally abused. And those are statistics quoted by everybody."Of course you are [responsible for your actions] and they were. The thing to remember is that they were very vulnerable at the time they were doing it and they remain vulnerable."The interesting thing is that jail doesn't do anything to take that away from them and they leave prison after a while, go back into society and they find themselves in exactly the same position and they re-offend."She said there had been surprises, such as Holloway's reception area which meant she hadn't felt "threatened" by entering it. "It felt that somebody worried about you," she said.On how well the prison system was coping, she said: "There's been a huge increase in the numbers of prisoners, although crime is going down."The causality doesn't work that way. The causality works in a way that says in fact crime has been reducing because of things to do with technology - making it difficult to break into houses, difficult to break into cars - and all that sort of stuff, and yet the numbers have been going up very, very significantly."Women in particular, the numbers have gone up by 27% between 2000 and 2010, while crime has been coming down."It makes no sense at all. The costs are enormous. There are so many cheaper ways to deal with this whole issue, which is what the Prisonomics book is all about."</body>

      <title>Letting agents 'block black tenants'</title>
      <description>Letting agents in London are prepared to discriminate against would-be tenants on the grounds of race, a BBC undercover investigation reveals.</description>

      <body>Letting agents in London are prepared to discriminate against would-be tenants on the grounds of race, a BBC undercover investigation has revealed.Under the Equality Act 2010, it is illegal for businesses to refuse to provide a service based on ethnicity.But 10 firms told a reporter posing as a landlord they would not let to African-Caribbean people at his request.A black researcher was denied viewings, yet his white counterpart was welcomed.BBC London was initially tipped off certain letting agents were willing to discriminate against African-Caribbean people on behalf of landlords, with the alleged misdoing rife in parts of west London.To expose the practices, a plush three-bedroom flat in north Kensington was acquired. Letting agents from 10 firms were invited to assess its rental value.All 10 were recorded on secret camera saying they would be prepared not to show the flat to African-Caribbean people - and many detailed how they had done it before.The lettings manager at A to Z Property Services, in Dollis Hill, said: "We cannot be shown discriminating against a community. But obviously we've got our ways around that."99% of my landlords don't want Afro-Caribbeans or any troublesome people."The lettings manager at National Estate Agents, Willesden, said: "When someone [African-Caribbean] comes in, we won't advise them of this property."Even if it does get [asked about] we make up an excuse, to be honest with you."When a black researcher asked to view the property, the National agent told him: "I'm sorry, that one's gone."The property was still on the market - and a white researcher got offered a viewing.The A to Z agent told the black researcher he would call him to arrange a viewing. Despite a second inquiry, the agent never got back in touch.The agent had previously explained how he could deter unwanted tenants, saying: "We don't say no there and then. We just don't call them back (laughter)."Once again, the white researcher received an appointment with no fuss.Figures shared with the BBC suggest perception of discrimination remains widespread.A survey of 750 adults by the Runnymede Trust found 29% of black people seeking private housing had experienced discrimination - compared to 1% of white respondents.Rob Berkeley, director of Runnymede, said: "It's shocking that in 2013 outright racism is stopping people from finding a home."Many people think the days of landlords hanging 'No Blacks' signs outside properties are long gone - but discrimination clearly still exists."Despite repeated approaches, National Estate Agents made no comment.When confronted in his office, the A to Z Property Services agent said it was "pointless taking on a property" if the landlord "doesn't like" the client's ethnicity.He continued: "We have plenty of Afro-Caribbean clients - I can show you our files."We've got nothing to hide. We don't discriminate against anybody."The investigation comes 45 years after race relations laws banning discrimination in housing first came in.After viewing the BBC's evidence, equality lawyer Arpita Dutt said: "These individuals know what they're doing and know what they're doing is wrong."Equally, they know how to get round it."There's no defence that 'I did it because somebody told me to' - it's absolutely unlawful and in this case there was clear discrimination."Don Foster MP, who was the housing minister between 2012 and 2013, said: "I was horrified. Discrimination has no place in London, it has no place in the rest of the country. We've got firm legislation against it."What it will rely on is people who've been the victim of discrimination coming forward."But BBC London has learned that, although 36 people told the Property Ombudsman they were the victim of racial discrimination in the past three years, not one single complaint was upheld.Only two allegations resulted in a full investigation.Mr Foster said existing enforcement was robust and the government was making membership of industry redress schemes mandatory for letting agents.During its investigation the BBC spoke to letting agents who condemned the practices exposed.Nicola Humphries, of Maida Vale Properties, said: "I'm appalled by the behaviour of some agents in the industry."There are some agents who will say anything and do anything to close a deal."We need to change the culture - but like any sales business it's a cut throat world and maintaining integrity is not easy."Inside Out London is broadcast on BBC One at 19:30 BST and nationwide on the iPlayer for seven days thereafter</body>

      <body>Police are investigating claims that officers hired a van - then returned it with bags of cannabis in the back.The drugs were only discovered after a van hire company worker picked up the vehicle from Coatbridge police station in North Lanarkshire and drove it back to his base.It is thought officers forgot to remove the bags before the van was collected.Police said an investigation was being carried out into reports that productions had been left in the van.The officers had hired the vehicle from Mitchell's Hire Drive in Rutherglen, near Glasgow.No-one from the company was available to speak to BBC Scotland on Monday morning.But worker John McKinnon, 33, told the Daily Record newspaper how he had unwittingly driven the cannabis - which had been packed inside black bin bags - some 12 miles back to the firm's office on Sunday morning.He was quoted as saying: "They gave me the keys in a sealed blue bag, walked me out to the van, opened the gates and away I went."There was a strong smell of cannabis in the cabin but it was only when I got back to the office and opened up the back that I realised what was in it."Staff immediately contacted the police, who were said to have re-hired the van in order to remove the vehicle and the drugs.A spokeswoman for Police Scotland said: "We can confirm we are investigating a report that a vehicle, hired by Police Scotland, has been returned to the hire company, allegedly with what is believed to be police productions inside."Enquiries are at early stage to establish the circumstances and it would be inappropriate to comment further."</body>

      <body>Original signed canvasses by British street artist Banksy have been sold from a stall in New York's Central Park for $60 (£38) each.The elusive artist posted a video on his website showing a man selling what appeared to be fake Banksys.Many of the pieces, estimated to be worth up to £20,000 each, remained unsold at the end of the day.Banksy is in New York for a month-long residency during which he has promised a new piece of street art every day.Entitled Better Out Than In, the public art show has its own website on to which pictures and videos of the art works have been posted.The latest video was accompanied with the words, "Yesterday I set up a stall in the park selling 100% authentic original signed Banksy canvases. For $60 each."The video shows an unknown older man making his first sale mid-afternoon, to a woman who buys two small canvasses for her children after negotiating a 50% discount.Another woman from New Zealand is seen buying two of the paintings, before a man from Chicago buys four.He tells the stall holder he has recently moved house and needs something for the walls.The day's takings came to a grand total of $420 (£263).Underneath the video Banksy added: "Please note: This was a one off. The stall will not be there again today."In a recent interview conducted via email with New York publication the Village Voice, the guerilla artist - whose identity is still a secret - revealed the thinking behind his month-long trip to the city."I know street art can feel increasingly like the marketing wing of an art career, so I wanted to make some art without the price tag attached," he said."There is no gallery show or book or film. It's pointless. Which hopefully means something."Each day in October will see a new piece of either an "elaborate graffiti, large scale street sculpture, video installation or substandard performance art".So far they have included The Sirens of the Lambs, a slaughterhouse delivery truck filled with stuffed animal toys which toured the meatpacking district, and more traditional Banksy art such as a heart-shaped balloon covered in bandages on a Brooklyn wall.</body>

      <body>The M1 motorway has fully reopened following a security alert that caused major traffic disruption on Monday morning.The motorway was closed in both directions for more than eight hours between the Lisburn/Saintfield turn-off and Stockman's Lane.The M1 re-opened country-bound just before 10:30 BST, and the remainder opened a short time later.It followed an alert on the Black's Road off-slip, west Belfast.A diversion was in place via Stockman's Lane and the Saintfield Road junction at Lisburn.Apart from long delays at both ends of the closure, during rush hour the alert also caused severe tailbacks leaving the M1 at Moira as drivers took an alternative route via the A26 through Nutts Corner.There was also a tailback of city-bound traffic back to Lurgan and country-bound to the Broadway roundabout.The alert had a knock-on effect on traffic coming into Belfast on the Lisburn road, Andersonstown Road, the Hillhall Road, Upper Malone Road and Milltown Road.Speaking from the M1 at about 07:00 BST, BBC Northern Ireland's Barra Best said the roads were busier than usual as hundreds of vehicles were being forced off the motorway due to the alert."Right in front of me buses, lorries, lots of cars having to make the diversion through Lisburn, instead of making their journey down through the motorway to Belfast," he said.This was the latest in a series of alerts in the past week that have caused major travel disruption.Traffic on part of the M1 was badly disrupted on Saturday following the discovery of a suspicious object.Police later described the object as "an elaborate hoax".A section of the motorway was also closed on Monday last week because of a security alert.</body>

      <body>Relatives of Claudy bomb victims have said they will continue their fight for justice after police confirmed they were suspending their investigation.Nine people were killed when three bombs exploded in the County Londonderry village in July 1972.On Friday, the PSNI told relatives of the victims their inquiries would not resume unless new information or evidence was received.One woman injured in the bombing said she still wanted to find out the truth.Ulster Unionist councillor Mary Hamilton said: "They are hoping, maybe, that we get fed up and forget about it, but to this day I carry the injuries that I had."I have shrapnel in both my legs and I suffer every day with it."It makes me think, here we are ten miles down the road, Bloody Sunday got so much money spent on them and the people of Claudy are just forgotten about."Both Protestants and Catholics were killed in the Claudy blasts.The youngest victim was eight-year-old Kathryn Eakin who was cleaning the windows of her family's grocery store when the first bomb exploded.On Sunday, Ulster Unionist assembly member Tom Elliott, who was at Friday's meeting, said the families felt let down by the police."It came like a bolt out of the blue to the victims and indeed to me and others who were there as well," Mr Elliott said."We didn't see any of that coming, had no hint of it beforehand at all."I have to say it has left the victims deeply frustrated and angry - the families do feel very let down."TUV leader Jim Allister said in a statement it was "astounding and utterly unacceptable that the police investigation has been abandoned"."Their haste to move on and forget about Claudy is symptomatic of a reluctance to investigate anything capable of disturbing the peace process," he added.Police have called on anyone who knows anything to come forward.In 2010, a Northern Ireland police ombudsman's report said detectives had concluded that the late Father James Chesney, who was later moved to the Republic of Ireland, was a suspect.It said the police, the state and the Catholic Church had covered up Fr Chesney's suspected role in the bombing.No action was ever taken against Fr Chesney, who died in 1980.</body>

      <body>A day of events marking the 100th anniversary of Britain's worst mining disaster is taking place in Senghenydd.Hundreds are turning out in the streets of the Caerphilly county village where an explosion killed 439 miners and a rescuer at the Universal Colliery on 14 October, 1913.A new memorial has been unveiled to mark the event and other mining tragedies in Wales.Relatives of the men and boys who died will be among those attending.The day of ceremony is marking the explosion which happened just after 8am on 14 October, 1913.It had been caused by a build up of firedamp (methane) gas being ignited.The blast disturbed coal dust on the mine floor, raising clouds that then also caught alight, spreading the destruction further.The fire was mainly confined to the west side of the mine, with the east side blocked with noxious gases. The result was over 400 men trapped underground.It was not the first time tragedy had hit the village which is a few miles along the Aber Valley from Caerphilly.An explosion at the colliery in 1901 killed 81 men and there was criticism that the pit owners did not learn lessons from it.A report following that explosion recommended certain safety procedures be followed. An extended deadline of September 1913 to implement the safety measure was missed by the mine bosses.Just six weeks later, 439 miners and one rescuer died when another blast ripped through the colliery.There had been 950 men down Universal's three pits that day.Over the fortnight that followed those trapped were helped to safety with the last 18 men rescued more than two weeks later.Funerals for those who died took place over the next month.One hundred years later, the Wales National Mining Memorial was unveiled to remember the Senghenydd disaster and 150 other mining tragedies in Wales including the most recent, when four men died at Gleision in the Swansea Valley in 2011.The memorial is a bronze statue of a rescue worker helping a miner.The day of events in Senghenydd started with the sounding of the original Universal Colliery pit hooter at 08:10 BST, exactly as it did a century ago when it sounded to alert the village to what had happened in the pit.As part of the memorial event, a walled garden was also opened with tiles inscribed with the details of those killed in the two Senghenydd disasters as well as a "path of memory," which marks the other colliery tragedies in Wales.Patron Roy Noble paid tribute to "the men who paid the ultimate sacrifice in their quest for coal" and added it was a "tragic end to the stepping stones leading to disaster".A hoooter marked the end of the service.The Aber Valley Heritage Group has been behind fundraising for the memorial.Jack Humphreys, group chairman, said: "It has been a hundred years since the disaster at the Universal Colliery, but the impact that the explosion had on this small mining community is still felt today."We hope the event is a fitting tribute to the victims of the explosions in Senghenydd and mining disasters across Wales."He told BBC Radio Wales: "It's very important for local people and people nationally. It's surprising the number of people who have come from far and wide to be with us this morning."There will be many people here today who have had family connections with those who were killed in the disasters of 1901 and 1913."Hilary Barbrook, a local florist from Caerphilly, lost both her grandfathers at Senghenydd."We've spoken for years over the tragedy that has happened in this pit, but it's 100 years and it's nice that we're going to honour the people who died," she said."The village was grown around the pit because beforehand it was farm land and when they sunk the pit, they built the houses around it so everyone was involved."My grandmother had a lot of work, she had eight children and was eight months pregnant with the last one when my grandfather died."She used to take in washing, ironing, clean houses.

      <body>The operator of the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical site is to begin talks with union bosses in a bid to avert a planned 48-hour strike.Members of the Unite union are planning to walk out on Sunday in a row over the treatment of a union convener.Ineos, operator of the site, said negotiations would start later at arbitration service Acas, in Glasgow.Unite said it had been "working tirelessly" over the weekend to secure the talks.Ineos has warned that the threatened strike "could effectively shut much of Scotland" by disrupting fuel supply.The strike could potentially disrupt the flow of Brent crude from the North Sea.The Scottish and UK governments have been drawing up contingency plans and had called for more talks between the two sides.Announcing the talks on Sunday night, Ineos Grangemouth chairman Calum MacLean said: "We have always been prepared to go to Acas if this helps to resolve a strike that Grangemouth petrochemical plant and refinery cannot afford."We hope to be able to resolve the dispute and address the financial issues that threaten the survival of the entire site."Previously, the company labelled the union action as "completely irresponsible" while the union accused Ineos of "gunboat irresponsible diplomacy".Unite Scottish Secretary Pat Rafferty said: "We welcome Ineos's change of heart to join us at Acas."We've repeatedly urged the company to sit down with us at the conciliation service to resolve the issues surrounding the unfair treatment of our convenor and the future of Grangemouth."Over the weekend we have been working tirelessly to secure these talks and hope that the company will engage in them in an open constructive manner."UK Energy Secretary Ed Davey said the talks were a "very welcome and encouraging step."He added: "I have worked hard with both sides to persuade them to attend talks with Acas and I am extremely pleased that this is now happening."Acas has the expertise to help both parties reach a sustainable solution for the company, the workforce and the whole economy."A spokeswoman for the Scottish government said contingency planning had been under way since the strike was announced.She said: "Ministers and officials have redoubled efforts to encourage Unite and Ineos to enter talks and we welcome the fact that they are now going to talk this afternoon."It is important that both sides have time and space to progress discussions, resolve the issues between them and move away from strike action."Ineos has said it will do all it can to "minimise the harm" of a strike.The North Sea's Forties pipeline system could be affected because the Kinneil oil processing terminal - where oil from the Forties field comes ashore - relies on Grangemouth for its steam and power.The dispute centres on union convener Stephen Deans, who was involved in the row over the selection of a Labour candidate in Falkirk.Labour cleared Unite after an investigation of trying to rig the selection of a party candidate - claims that led to a major row between the union and Ed Miliband.Mr Deans, who is chairman of both Labour's local constituency party and Unite in Scotland, was suspended by Ineos then reinstated.Ineos said an investigation by "a third party" into Mr Deans' conduct was due to be completed by 25 October.It recently launched a survival plan for Grangemouth, warning that the site would close by 2017 without investment and reduced costs. The company said the plant was losing £10m a month.The Grangemouth refinery processes 210,000 barrels of oil per day and provides most of Scotland's fuel. It is owned jointly by Ineos and PetroChina.</body>

      <body>Police investigating the death of a man who was hit by an HGV and then dragged underneath it for three miles have traced the vehicle's driver.Robert Finlayson, 22, was found dead on a road in Lanarkshire on 23 September.Officers and Mr Finlayson's mother Angela had appealed for the driver of the Mercedes Actros to come forward.The driver has now been found, as has the driver of a car which struck Mr Finlayson after he had been carried under the Mercedes.Neither motorist has been charged by police.Insp Calum Maider of Motherwell Road Policing Unit said he was still looking for the driver of another vehicle which is also thought to have struck Mr Finlayson.He said: "We have now traced the driver of a Mercedes Actros heavy goods vehicle which was travelling on the B7078 and struck Mr Finlayson. This vehicle is now the subject of a forensic and mechanical examination. The driver will be interviewed in due course."We have also traced and interviewed the driver of Suzuki Ignis which struck Mr Finlayson after he had been carried under the Mercedes. However there is still a vehicle outstanding."A silver coloured Renault Traffic Crew cab Sport Van, or Vauxhall Movano which is similar in style, was travelling between the Suzuki Ignus and the Mercedes Actros and I am keen to trace the driver."He may be unaware that he has struck Mr Finlayson and it is important that he comes forward."Anyone with further information regarding Mr Finlayson's death, and in particular the driver of the vehicle still being sought, has been asked to telephone the non-emergency number 101.Mr Finlayson, from Hamilton, was seen on CCTV at about 04:10, standing on the north side of the over bridge of the M74 motorway Junction 10 and then heading north on the northbound carriageway of the B7078, where it appears he was attempting to hitchhike.The road was busier than normal because of a diversion from the motorway.More than 40 vehicles, many of them heavy goods vehicles delivering to large retail outlets, were diverted onto the B7078 between 04:00 and 04:30.Several northbound vehicles were seen moving onto the opposite lane to pass Mr Finlayson safely, but police said he was then struck by a vehicle and carried underneath it for three miles to Blackwood, where his body was found.Officers said the the driver of the Mercedes Actros may not have known his vehicle had struck Mr Finlayson.</body>

      <description>A woman convicted of murder 20 years ago believes new evidence being examined by the Criminal Cases Review Commission will clear her name.</description>

      <body>A woman convicted of murder 20 years ago believes new evidence being examined by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) will clear her name.Susan May, 68, served 12 years in prison for the murder of her aunt, Hilda Marchbank, at her home in Royton, Greater Manchester, in 1993.The prosecution's case hinged on a "blood-stained handprint" at the scene.But a fingerprint expert has said there is "overwhelming evidence" the marks were not made in blood.Ms May, who was the first person in the UK to be released at her earliest parole date without admitting guilt, has had two failed appeals. Her campaign to clear her name is backed by 100 MPs and peers.Now the CCRC, set up to review possible miscarriages of justice, has agreed to investigate whether her case should be referred back to the Court of Appeal for a rare third time.It is looking into a report - commissioned by campaigners - by fingerprint analyst Arie Zeelenberg, former head of the Dutch national police fingerprint service.He examined high resolution photographs - which were not seen by the jury - of the marks on the wall.His report concludes: "There is no evidence that the finger marks... attributed to Susan May were placed in blood."In fact there is overwhelming evidence that they were not comprised of blood but instead of sweat and a minor residue of another unknown substance."The original trial jury was told Ms May's fingerprint was found in a "blood-stained hand print". One police officer told the court it was made by "quite a lot" of blood when she allegedly beat her aunt about the face and suffocated her with a pillow.The jury was shown photographs of the bedroom wall after it had been treated with chemicals including iodine.The pictures examined by Mr Zeelenberg, which came to light when they were requested from Greater Manchester Police (GMP) by the CCRC in the past year, show that prior to treatment they [the prints] were "almost invisible" to the naked eye."They are clearly very faint marks, hardly attributable to having been made the night before with hands covered in blood so that it ran down the wall," Friends Of Susan May (FOSM) campaigner Geoff Goodwin said.Ms May said: "To date there is no [conclusive] scientific proof that the marks were in blood despite prosecution claims."I sincerely hope now that the commission will see fit to refer my case back to the Court of Appeal because it undermines the whole prosecution case."Campaigners have also asked the CCRC to consider critical reviews of the police investigation into Mrs Marchbank's murder written by the former deputy head of Hampshire CID, Des Thomas.In one report, commissioned by the campaign, he states he found "anomalies" in the police inquiry that "may point to an investigation, the principle purpose of which was to prove, by the selective use and non-disclosure of evidence, the hypothesis that Susan May was guilty of murdering her aunt".The police chief in charge of the original investigation was previously said by the CCRC to have given "inconsistent accounts" and "apparently mistaken recollections", impacting on his credibility.Evidence the jury never heard includes a witness claiming a red car was outside Mrs Marchbank's house with its engine running at around the time of the murder.A transcript of the police actions log also shows that an anonymous call was made to police the following morning naming a well-known convicted burglar as the killer.Ms May said: "All this new evidence points to the fact that my conviction is unsafe. If the jury heard the case as it is now, with some witnesses discredited and without the main plank of their case - the so-called blood marks - they couldn't come to the same conclusion."The CCRC said it was considering Mr Zeelenberg's report and seeking the opinion of other experts.A spokesman said: "This is one of a number of lines of enquiry we are pursuing."We continue to work as quickly as we can and we are making good progress with the investigation."A Greater Manchester Police (GMP) spokesman said: "As this appeal is ongoing it would not be appropriate to comment."</body>

      <body>Two men who pleaded guilty to more than 50 "appalling" child sex offences will not face trial over 14 other allegations, prosecutors have said.Anthony Marsh and Lee Davis, both from South Yorkshire, have admitted abusing boys as young as 13.The Crown Prosecution Service said a trial on the additional charges was not in the victims' "best interests" and asked for the charges to lie on file.Marsh, 53, and Davis, 39, will be sentenced on 2 December.Last month Marsh, from Hatfield, and Davis, from Conisbrough, appeared at Sheffield Crown Court where they pleaded guilty to a string of offences.Marsh, also known as Tony Taylor and Tony Smith, admitted 34 charges, including having sexual activity with a child and possessing and distributing indecent images of children.Davis, also known as James Parkin, pleaded guilty to 20 charges, including rape, sexual activity with a child, and taking indecent photographs of a child.Both admitted a joint charge of conspiracy to commit sexual activity with children.The offences, which date back to 2005, involved boys aged between 13 and 17 years old, from South Yorkshire, East Yorkshire, the North East, North West and the Midlands.Det Insp Delphine Waring, of South Yorkshire Police, said: "Marsh and Davis committed many appalling crimes against young, vulnerable boys over many years."They searched various websites trawling for impressionable, young, vulnerable boys and, having engaged in conversation, then made arrangements to meet them.District Senior Crown Prosecutor Chris Hartley said Marsh and Davis both faced possible life sentences."We've spoken to the remaining victims and explained the current position. We've listened to their views and found that a trial for these offences would not be in their best interest. They have agreed with our decision."As both of the men pleaded guilty to conspiracy to share the details of the victims, and Davis also pleaded guilty to rape, the judge has the option to sentence both of them to a maximum of life imprisonment."</body>

      <title>18,000 Poland fans 'to boost Wembley'</title>

      <body>England left-back Leighton Baines has defended the Football Association's decision to sell 18,000 tickets to Poland fans for Tuesday's decisive World Cup qualifier at Wembley.The FA hope doubling the 9,000 seats Poland are entitled to will prevent away fans from buying home tickets.It was a move used for recent games with Scotland and Republic of Ireland.Baines said: "If away fans add to the atmosphere the home fans produce, it just adds to the occasion."England lead Group H on 19 points and will guarantee a place at Brazil 2014 if they follow Friday's 4-1 win over Montenegro with another victory.A draw or defeat would open the door for Ukraine, who are second on 18 points, to top the group, providing they win their final qualifier against pointless San Marino.That eventuality would see England head into a two-leg play-off against one of the other seven best runners-up from the European qualifying groups.Poland held Roy Hodgson's side to a 1-1 draw in Warsaw earlier in the qualifying campaign.Wembley has not been filled to its 90,000 capacity during England's qualifying campaign, with attendances fluctuating from under 70,000 during their first home fixture against Ukraine, to almost 87,000 for the win over San Marino.Poland are entitled to 10% of the capacity but the FA took the decision to offer Polish fans 18,000 tickets in an attempt to stop them buying seats among home support.Baines will win his 21st cap after Chelsea's Ashley Cole was ruled out with a rib injury and does not expect the enhanced away following to intimidate England's players."It could work in that manner, but to put a more positive spin on it you'd rather play in a stadium with a good atmosphere rather than it be a half-empty stadium," added the Everton defender."I remember when we played Ghana - and I don't know how many there were there - they were amazing and it just made it better."If it adds to the atmosphere, it's great."It is understood the FA took the decision to increase the away allocation after discussions with police."With high demand for tickets from the large Polish community in England the FA took the decision, based on safety grounds, to ensure Polish fans were allocated space in a specific area of the ground rather than attempting to buy tickets in home areas," said and FA Spokesman."This is the same process that was employed for the successful Scotland and Republic of Ireland fixtures earlier this year."</body>

      <body>Surrey have appointed South African Graham Ford as their new head coach on a three-year deal.The 52-year-old will start work at his new club in February when his contract with the Sri Lanka national team comes to an end.Ford has previously enjoyed spells coaching Natal, South Africa and Kent."I have, for a long while, been an admirer of Surrey and see it as a great privilege to be actively involved in such a fine club," he said."I am delighted to once again be involved in English cricketing system. I look forward to the exciting times ahead."Surrey have been without a head coach since they parted company with team director Chris Adams and first-team coach Ian Salisbury in June.Executive director Alec Stewart had been overseeing first-team affairs, with bowling coach Stuart Barnes working with the side on a day-to-day basis.Surrey were relegated to Division Two of the County Championship this year after a campaign which new captain Graeme Smith missed the vast majority of through injury.Stewart will continue serving on the club board with the new title of director of cricket.The former England captain described Ford's appointment as "outstanding"."Graham has a tremendous reputation for improving players and teams," Stewart told BBC London 94.9."He has worked at international level and domestic level over here. People at Kent have spoken in glowing terms about him."He is definitely the right man, so Surrey should feel very, very lucky that we have got someone of his calibre."His work ethic is great and he has an idea of what he wants to do and the direction he wants the club to go in."</body>

      <body>England's David Lynn shot a final-round 63 to win the Portugal Masters and give him a first European Tour title since his KLM Open win nine years ago.The 39-year-old was eight under for his round to set a clubhouse target of 18 under that proved unbeatable.South Africa's Justin Walters finished just a shot behind in second place.Overnight leader Paul Waring of England shot a level-par round to tie for third with Scotland's Stephen Gallacher and Austrian Bernd Wiesberger.Jamie Donaldson of Wales was among those who shared sixth place at the Oceanico Victoria course in Vilamoura, with England's Ross Fisher a shot further back.Scotland's Scott Jamieson failed to back up his stunning third-round of 60, suffering three bogies on the back nine for a one-over par 72 to fade to a tie for 13th."It's emotional," said Lynn, from Stoke, who still has close ties with Trentham, the Staffordshire course where he grew up."To go nine years without a victory and come close so many times you start to question whether you can do it again."It feels fantastic. This one's special as it's been so long since a win and it's just a week before my 40th birthday."To get another win before I turn 40 is an early birthday present."Lynn banks a winner's cheque for €333,330 (£282,905), but that is still dwarfed by the $865,000 (£541,645) he earned for finishing runner-up to Rory McIlroy at the 2012 US PGA Championship - his most rewarding week's work to date.He started the fourth round in 16th place, but made nine birdies as he came from six shots off the pace,Having birdied the 17th, he then enjoyed a stroke of fortune on the 18th after his approach narrowly escaped the water, before safely two-putting - then enduring a long wait before knowing that his score had been good enough to win."I was half-heartedly watching on TV," he said. "You don't wish bad on other golfers out there but you do start to feel a bit selfish, hoping their putts don't go in."But I've had to bide my time, and now I've finally got my hands on a trophy again."</body>

      <title>Can science fiction ever get the science right</title>
      <description>Alfonso Cuaron's forthcoming film Gravity promises to rekindle the debate over how "hard" - or accurate - science fiction should be.</description>

      <body>Alfonso Cuaron's new film Gravity promises to rekindle the debate over how "hard" - or accurate - science fiction should be. Should film-makers adhere to basic scientific principles, or should audiences just feel the magic instead, asks Peter Ray Allison.The relationship between science and science fiction has always been tempestuous.Gravity focuses on two astronauts stranded in space after the destruction of their space shuttle. Since Gravity's US release (it comes to the UK in November) many critics have praised the film for its scientific accuracy.But noted astrophysicist Dr Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, had several issues with the accuracy of Gravity's portrayal of space.Through a series of posts on Twitter, Tyson - who later emphasised that he "enjoyed the film very much" - highlighted various errors.He noted the Hubble space telescope (orbiting at 350 miles above sea level), the International Space Station (at 250 miles), and a Chinese space station could never be in line of sight of one another. On top of that, most satellites orbit west to east, yet in the film the satellite debris was seen drifting east to west.Tyson also noted how Sandra Bullock's hair did not float freely as it would in zero-gravity. This is arguably not so much an error in physics, but a reflection of the limitations of cinematic technology to accurately portray actors in zero-gravity. That is, of course, without sending them into space for the duration of the film.There has always been a drive for scientific accuracy within science fiction, especially within the "hard science fiction" literary sub-genre. But sci-fi, especially in film, tends to have a more flamboyant approach, where realism is often dispensed with in favour of visual flair.The Michael Bay film Armageddon is known for its woeful number of inaccuracies, from the space shuttles separating their rocket boosters and fuel tanks in close proximity to each other (risking a collision) and to objects falling on to the asteroid under a gravitational pull seemingly as strong as the Earth's. More than one interested observer tried to work out how big the bomb would have to be to blow up an asteroid in the way demanded in the movie. Answer: Very big indeed.Nasa is reported to have even used Armageddon as part of a test within their training programme, asking candidates to identify all the scientific impossibilities within the film.Despite the presence of physicist Prof Brian Cox as a scientific adviser on Danny Boyle's Sunshine, artistic licence seeped in. There's a communications "dead-zone" around the Sun - not something easily explicable using real world rules.Despite claims to the contrary, Red Planet was riddled with scientific implausibilities, from the compatibility between modern equipment and 30-year old Russian technology (imagine attempting to connect a modern PC with a Sinclair Spectrum), to the Martian "nematodes" which had been eating algae that had been sent from earth for the past 30 years. The nematodes should have been worms but looked closer to beetles. And there was no explanation as to how they had evolved to eat non-Martian algae nor what they had eaten before.The science across the film was so "creative" that Nasa refused to act as scientific adviser on the film.But perhaps the biggest example of scientific licence occurs in a plethora of space-based dramas."The most commonly lauded example of 'bad science', intentionally placed into science fiction, is that of sound," says Ed Trollope, spacecraft operations engineer at technology firm Telespazio VEGA Deutschland. "Because space is a vacuum, there is no sound, which means all those explosions and engine noises shouldn't be there."There's a simple cinematic reason for having the sound of an explosion when a spacecraft blows up - it feels right to the viewer. But other conventions are more difficult for scientists to accept."My pet peeve is inertia," says Trollope. "There are many good reasons for keeping your engines on in space, but 'maintaining speed' is not one of them. If you turn your engines off, you don't stop."Some do it slightly better than others. "I'd prefer not to single out a single film/book/series for this particular error, because it's so common - but I will laud the old television show Babylon 5, for doing a wonderful job of representing the mechanics of spaceflight inertia so nicely," explains Trollope.2001: A Space Odyssey's silent scenes of space craft, with their rotating Stanford torus design, were closer than many later examples to the reality of travelling in space."A classic case of scientific inaccuracy was the first edition of Ringworld by Larry Niven, a novel which won both the Hugo and Nebula awards in 1971," suggests science fiction author Charles Stross. "The author inadvertently set up a series of scenes which implied that the Earth spun on its axis in the wrong direction." Niven fixed it in the second printing.The Duncan Jones film Moon was lauded for a reasonably accurate portrayal of what lunar mining for Helium-3 could look like in the future. Helium-3 is rare on Earth but less rare on the Moon, and using an automated method with a human overseer might be possible. But the economics behind the mining is not explained.The alien signal in Contact is a prime example of what Seti (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) is looking for. This is perhaps not surprising as Contact was written by astronomer Carl Sagan. The use of mathematics in the transmission of the message seems reasonable and the time lag in the sending and receiving of the signal is also accurately represented in the film.Science fiction is not just expected to accurately portray science but also to anticipate future developments."Science fiction hits some predictive targets," says science fiction author Neal Asher, "but rather in the way that a clip fired from an assault rifle will hit some of the enemy hidden in the jungle, but mostly hits trees and leaves.""One of the past criticisms of science fiction has been that it's all 'zap-guns and rocket ships'," suggests Asher. "Now the science fiction writer can smugly point out the LaWs - the US navy laser system - knocking down drones, and then wax lyrical about the X Prize, Virgin Galactic and Elon Musk's SpaceX."Richard Blott, principal consultant at Space Enterprise Partnerships, recalls an early episode of Star Trek ("Spock's Brain", 1968) where the latest space ship is described as having an "ion drive"."Nowadays most new communications satellites have ion engines and they have powered missions to Vesta and Ceres," says Blott."In the end," Asher concludes, "science fiction is not there to make accurate predictions about the future, it is there to entertain and stimulate the imagination. There is absolutely no doubt that many of the imaginations it stimulates belong to scientists. To some extent it drives and directs science."Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <body>Iceland is experiencing a book boom. This island nation of just over 300,000 people has more writers, more books published and more books read, per head, than anywhere else in the world.It is hard to avoid writers in Reykjavik. There is a phrase in Icelandic, "ad ganga med bok I maganum", everyone gives birth to a book. Literally, everyone "has a book in their stomach". One in 10 Icelanders will publish one."Does it get rather competitive?" I ask the young novelist, Kristin Eirikskdottir. "Yes. Especially as I live with my mother and partner, who are also full-time writers. But we try to publish in alternate years so we do not compete too much."Special saga tours - saga as in story, that is, not over-50s holidays - show us story-plaques on public buildings.Dating from the 13th Century, Icelandic sagas tell the stories of the country's Norse settlers, who began to arrive on the island in the late 9th Century.Sagas are written on napkins and coffee cups. Each geyser and waterfall we visit has a tale of ancient heroes and heroines attached. Our guide stands up mid-tour to recite his own poetry - our taxi driver's father and grandfather write biographies.Public benches have barcodes so you listen to a story on your smartphone as you sit.Reykjavik is rocking with writers. It is book festival time. Man Booker Prize winner Kiran Desai and Generation X author Douglas Coupland rub shoulders with Icelandic literary superstars Gerdur Kristny and Sjon. Sjon also pens lyrics for Bjork, Iceland's musical superstar."Writers are respected here," Agla Magnusdottir tells me. "They live well. Some even get a salary."Magnusdottir is head of the new Icelandic Literature Centre, which offers state support for literature and its translation."They write everything - modern sagas, poetry, children's books, literary and erotic fiction - but the biggest boom is in crime writing," she says.That is perhaps no surprise in this Nordic nation. But crime novel sales figures are staggering - double that of any of its Nordic neighbours.So what has led to this phenomenal book boom? I would say it is due to a crop of darn good writers, telling riveting tales with elegant economy and fantastic characters.Iceland's black lava riverbeds, its steaming, bubbling earth, with its towering volcanoes and fairytale streams also make it the perfect setting for stories.No wonder JRR Tolkien and Seamus Heaney were entranced and Unesco designates Reykjavik a City of Literature.Solvi Bjorn Siggurdsson, a tall, Icelandic-sweater-clad novelist, says writers owe a lot to the past."We are a nation of storytellers. When it was dark and cold we had nothing else to do," he says. "Thanks to the poetic eddas and medieval sagas, we have always been surrounded by stories. After independence from Denmark in 1944, literature helped define our identity."Siggurdsson pays homage to Iceland's Nobel Literature Laureate, Halldor Laxness, whose books are sold in petrol stations and tourist centres across the island. Locals name their cats after Laxness and make pilgrimages to his home."When Laxness won the Nobel prize in 1955 he put modern Icelandic literature on the map," Solvi tells me. "He gave us confidence to write."A combination of ash and the crash also put Iceland on the map.The financial crisis - or "kreppa" - of 2008, which helped trigger the world economic crash, came first. The ash cloud from one of Iceland's many active volcanoes created a second in 2010.Hallgrimur Helgason - comedian, painter and writer - tells me the kreppa brought Icelanders down to earth."It made us less complacent and gave artists a creative shot in the arm - as Thatcher did for Britain," he grins. "We address politics too - it is not all about sagas."But some fear a book kreppa, too. Iceland has so many writers there is huge pressure on publishers.This time of year sees the "jolabokaflod", or Christmas Book Flood, when most books are published.About now every household gets a book catalogue through the door. They pore over it like a furniture catalogue. Everyone receives books as Christmas presents - hardback and shrink-wrapped."Even now, when I go the hairdressers," Kristin Vidarsdottir, manager of the Unesco City of Literature project, says, "they do not want celebrity gossip from me but recommendations for Christmas books."But it is a lock of blue hair which alerts me to the presence of Iceland's most famous celebrity. The singer Bjork attends several of the festival events."It is great to see you supporting writers," I say to her."It is a small place. We have grown up together," she replies. "We support each other."If Bjork was, once upon a time, Iceland's biggest cultural brand, she is today joined by a whole bokaflod of authors.From Our Own Correspondent: Listen online or download the podcast.BBC Radio 4: Saturdays at 11:30 and some Thursdays at 11:00BBC World Service: Short editions Monday-Friday - see World Service programme schedule.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <body>Sister Linda Sim gave up taekwondo when she joined a convent. Years later, she's dusted off her black belt at a Singaporean hospice to teach children recovering from cancer.When she was much younger, Linda Sim wanted to join the army, but was told she was too small."Next I thought I could be a policewoman - to protect people," she says, but she didn't make the weight requirements for the police force, either.Instead, she discovered taekwondo in 1971, and it seemed to fulfil her need to help other people. "If I had a black belt I thought I could be a bodyguard and protect somebody." Within a few years, she achieved just that.Though the sport gave her great mental strength, she didn't find a practical use for her martial art for more than three decades.Much to the chagrin of her parents, Sim met the Franciscan Missionaries of the Divine Motherhood, and decided to join them by becoming a Catholic nun."Being the only daughter, my mum was very upset when I said I would give my life to God and be a missionary," she says. Her parents had hoped she would provide them with grandchildren.Since the group's headquarters were on the other side of the world in Britain, she would disappoint them further by leaving Singapore."I spent 17 years in England and three more in Africa, where I ran a hospital in Zimbabwe," she says.During her absence, a relationship developed between the Singapore Taekwondo Federation and Mount Alvernia hospital in the centre of the country.Ming Wong, secretary general of the federation explains that an employee of the hospital thought some of its patients - young children being treated for cancer - could benefit from the sport. They were "stuck inside playing snakes and ladders", she says, and the organisation agreed to provide training sessions for them.It was not until 2004, when Sim's mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, that she felt she had to return to Singapore.When she saw the classes taking place, she knew she wanted to be involved. "That was what I had to leave behind in order to be a sister, and so I thought 'now I'm reunited'," she says.Today she runs a weekly class for about 20 people, all of whom have brain tumours or childhood leukaemia. Most are young children, although three are now in their 20s, having trained under Sim for many years.One of the older students, Ng Wei Hau, was diagnosed with a brain tumour at the age of 12 and given just six months to live by his doctors. "When I first met him he was in a wheelchair. When he reached 21 he was walking with a frame, when he reached 23 he had a stick, and now he walks unaided," she says. Despite being partially deaf and blind, Wei Hau became a black belt last year under Sim's tutelage."These children try to do their best however they can, despite their sickness," says Wong. "I think because they want to live life for the fullest because they want to enjoy whatever time they have."The federation's charitable work is not just limited to children from the hospital. The organisation works with children's homes and other disadvantaged groups to offer free taekwondo classes to others who would not usually come into contact with the sport.For Sim, religion is central to her motivation. Whereas most sisters teach religious education in quite a traditional way, she thinks the taekwondo classes allow her to lead by example instead."For me I can actually be a presence and a witness to God's love without actually quoting scripture," she says. "It gives me a lot of peace and satisfaction. It's about evangelising without having to mention going to church."Video produced by Zarina Hussain.

      <title>Deputy Speaker hopefuls to woo MPs</title>
      <description>Conservative candidates to be Speaker John Bercow's deputy are to set out their stalls in a hustings with Labour MPs.</description>

      <body>Conservative candidates to be the new deputy to Commons Speaker John Bercow are to set out their stalls in a hustings with Labour MPs later.There has been a vacancy on Mr Bercow's team since Nigel Evans stood down to fight sex offence charges.As a Conservative, Mr Evans can only be replaced by another governing-party MP under Commons rules - although no Lib Dems are known to be applying.Deputy Speakers are elected by their fellow MPs in a secret ballot.The official process for nominating candidates does not begin until 10:00 BST on Tuesday, but seven Conservatives are understood to be mounting a campaign: David Amess, Henry Bellingham, Brian Binley, Simon Burns, Nadine Dorries, Eleanor Laing and Gary Streeter.Each has a contingent of Conservative supporters, reports BBC parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy, so the result will be determined by the candidates' ability to attract Labour votes.The meeting with Labour backbenchers, scheduled to take place in the House of Commons at 19:00 BST, will not be open to the public or press.But our correspondent adds that the candidates have been campaigning on their opposition to the MPs' expenses body, IPSA, the impartiality they will bring to chairing debates, and their team-working skills.The latter can be read as a coded reference to the well-known antagonism between former minister Simon Burns, who once referred to the Speaker as a "sanctimonious dwarf", he continues: "The thought of putting Burns in harness with Bercow tickles many a Tory."In 2009, deputy Speaker candidate Nadine Dorries described Mr Bercow as "oily" and suggested he was "mistrusted by up to half of the House".Each of the seven MPs will make a short speech to the Labour meeting, before facing questions from the floor.They will need to have secured at least six nominations from fellow MPs by 17:00 BST on Tuesday, and voting takes place between 11.30 BST and 14:00 on Wednesday.Mr Bercow, himself formerly a Conservative MP, has three deputies, and Commons rules dictate that the team of four should be equally drawn from governing-party and opposition MPs.Two Labour MPs, Lindsay Hoyle and Dawn Primarolo, retain their places on the team.Ex-deputy Mr Evans has been accused of two counts of indecent assault, five of sexual assault, and one of rape.He denies the allegations, telling MPs after he stood down as a deputy Speaker in September: "I now have the opportunity to robustly defend my innocence and seek acquittal."</body>

      <title>Labour backs parent-led schools</title>
      <description>Labour says it will support parents who want to set up new schools but the Conservatives say the opposition's policy on school choice has not changed.</description>

      <body>Labour is "on the side" of parents who want to set up schools and would not shut most existing free schools, the new shadow education secretary insists.Tristram Hunt told the BBC Labour backed "enterprise and innovation" when it came to increasing school places.He said a Labour government would push ahead with what it called parent-led academies in areas of educational need.Tory chairman Grant Shapps said Labour's policy was unchanged and it still opposed the "popular" schools.Free schools, set up by parents and other groups and operating outside local authority control, have been established under a policy pioneered by Education Secretary Michael Gove.More than 170 have been opened across England since September 2011.Labour has been accused by the government of sending out mixed messages about the party's support, opposing their roll-out nationally but backing schools locally.Mr Hunt, who has just taken over from Stephen Twigg as the party's education spokesman, said he regretted previously describing free schools as a "vanity project for yummy mummies". He made the comments in 2010 shortly after becoming an MP.Mr Hunt told BBC One's Andrew Marr programme Labour would not open new free schools "along the Michael Gove model", but that the bulk of existing free schools would be kept open as his party wanted to "keep the good free schools".Citing the case of the Al-Madinah free school in Derby, which was closed for a week earlier this month on the first day of an Ofsted inspection, Mr Hunt said Labour would not allow schools to become an "ideological experiment".Education Minister Lord Nash has warned the school would be closed unless "unacceptable" teaching standards improved.Its acting head teacher said there were areas the school needed to address and it was co-operating with Ofsted."What is going on with the Al-Madinah school is a terrifying example of the mistakes of Michael Gove's education policy," he said.New schools, he added, should only be opened in areas where there was a shortage of places, where "properly qualified" staff could be recruited and where institutions were financially accountable.Under Labour's plans, parent-led academies would enable parent groups and other organisations to set up schools outside local authority control, although local authorities would have greater powers to intervene when there were concerns about standards."If you are a group of parents, social entrepreneurs and teachers interested in setting up a school in areas where you need new school places, then the Labour government will be on your side."We are in favour of enterprise and innovation."But a Conservative Party spokesman said shadow chancellor Ed Balls had made it clear in a speech in June that the party would curb new schools in areas where they was an "excess" of places.Mr Balls had suggested a future Labour government would prioritise resources on areas where school places were in "short supply".Mr Shapps told the BBC: "This is the same old Labour policy. Free schools will only be allowed in specific circumstances in specific areas with a whole load of bureaucracy attached."Free schools have been driving up standards. They are hugely popular with parents and up to now Labour have fought tooth and nail against them including voting against them and what they said today has changed absolutely nothing."Journalist Toby Young, who helped set up a free school in west London, said Mr Hunt had been "less than candid" about Labour's policy as it was considering granting councils the power of veto over free schools in their boroughs.Writing in his blog for the Daily Telegraph, Mr Young - who has said he is considering of applying to be a Conservative candidate at the next election - said this would be a "retrograde step" since councils would be unlikely to approve new schools close to existing ones which were under-performing.Mr Hunt said there needed to be more focus on vocational education with support for further education colleges and apprenticeships in industry.</body>

      <title>'Massive' energy investment expected</title>
      <description>Britain's energy sector is close to securing tens of billions of pounds in investment from the Far East, Energy Secretary Ed Davey says.</description>

      <body>Britain's energy sector is close to securing tens of billions of pounds in investment from the Far East, Energy Secretary Ed Davey has said.He said a "massive" wave of investment in nuclear and other technology from China, Japan and Korea would help secure the UK's future power supply.A deal to build new reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset was close, he added.Labour has said the government is not doing enough, but Mr Davey called its record on energy investment "shocking".His comments come amid a fierce political row over household energy bills, with SSE becoming the first of the "big six" energy firms to announce a sharp increase in prices last week.Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Mr Davey said he had made "huge progress" during a recent visit to China - during which he spoke to all of the country's major energy suppliers about boosting two-way investment."The Chinese, along with the Japanese and the Koreans are very interested in the opportunities in the British nuclear sector. I think it is really possible we will see massive Chinese investment, not just in nuclear but across the board.""I think we will see massive Japanese and Korean investment. It is really critical we get that investment," he said.Recent reports have suggested China General Nuclear Power Group could take a 49% stake in the French-led consortium seeking to develop Hinkley Point.Under existing proposals, two new nuclear reactors would replace those set to stop operating in the middle of the next decade.Mr Davey indicated the UK was also "extremely close" to a deal with EDF - one of Britain's big six energy firms - to invest in Hinkley.The government has said the state will not directly subsidise the building of new nuclear plants but has insisted that new generating capacity is essential - alongside other forms of energy - to meet the UK's growing energy needs.Mr Davey told the programme that, when an agreement was finally reached, he was "convinced I will be able to look consumers in the eyes, look businesses in the eyes, and say we have a good deal".The energy secretary also played down suggestions of differences with Tory Chancellor George Osborne - who is currently in China on a trade mission - over energy policy, saying they were "stuck together" on the need to substantially increase levels of investment.Elsewhere in the programme, Mr Davey said he expected other firms to follow SSE and raise energy prices, but he made no apology for seeking to upgrade and modernise the UK's energy system.Energy companies have said one of the reasons they are having to hike prices is to pay for huge investment in the UK's generation and distribution infrastructure.The energy secretary said he had written to the largest firms to ask them what they were doing to simplify their bills, so consumers could understand what they were being charged.He said he expected answers from them by Monday.Ministers have dismissed Labour's pledge of a price freeze on energy bills after 2015, arguing the way to help consumers is to increase competition and make it easier for people to switch supplier in order to access the best possible tariff.Mr Davey told the programme Labour's warnings about a looming energy crisis rang hollow."The lights are going to stay on. Since this government came to power, we have been running to increase energy investment. Labour's energy investment record was frankly shocking."They were negligent with energy and climate change policy. We are the ones delivering the new power stations, the policies to deliver the billions of pounds of investment."Meanwhile, Labour said the government was building false expectations about the benefits of shale gas and was presenting it as an alternative to renewable energy.Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint told Sky News Labour was not opposed to fracking in Britain, but warned it was not yet known at what cost it could be produced."We are not setting our face against it if the conditions are right and the environment is right, but what we do disagree with is polarising shale against renewables that we need as well," she said.</body>

      <body>One hundred years ago, the UK's worst mining disaster happened when 440 people were killed by an explosion which ripped through the coal mine at Senghenydd, near Caerphilly.It was the morning of Tuesday 14 October 1913. The 950 miners working at the Universal Colliery had just started their shift.Among them was Thomas Jones, who was working on the Nine Feet seam.At 8.10am he heard "a roar or rumble… coming from some distance" and then a terrific and distinct bang. Then the roar went on, "but more vigorously than previously."Miner William Vizard was loading rubbish into one of the mine's trams (rail carts) when it happened."I shouted into the next heading because I knew the man that worked there and his two sons. Not a sound, nor a light. Well, I thought, something has happened. So I went on creeping out to the double-parting."When I got to the straight to go to the double-parting, I could hear a boy shouting for his father: 'Where's my father? I want my father.'"I went on down to the parting. There, I felt a horse down. Then I felt a man. Felt his legs. I felt his face. He had his scarf over his mouth."And he spoke to me. And we knew one another's voices. Of course, I knew him. 'It's an explosion,' he said."The blast was so strong, it lifted a two-ton lift cage hundreds of yards up one of the mineshafts into the headgear. Windows were smashed on Coronation Terrace, half a mile away and the blast was heard many miles beyond that.First on the scene at the pithead was Mr Shaw, the mine manager, who had been in the lamp room at the surface when the explosion occurred.According to the inquiry following the disaster:"He was joined by Mr Thomas, the overman, and together they got into the cage at the top of the upcast shaft, examined the air for a distance of 50 yards and found it foul with smoke and fumes."Signals were being sent from below, so, being joined by others, they descended the shaft. When half-way down, they saw the body of a man in a tram in the upcoming cage with his legs hanging on the crossbars. This man had been practically blown into the tub in the cage at the pit bottom."Underground, the doors on the west and east side were on fire, but the scene on the east side looked less severe.The explosion had been caused by a build up of firedamp (methane) gas. The blast had disturbed coal dust on the mine floor, raising clouds that then also caught alight, spreading the destruction further.The fire was mainly confined to the west side of the mine, with the east side blocked with noxious gases. The result was over 400 men trapped underground.Mr Thomas described how when he worked his way along towards the west "It was exactly like looking into a furnace."The first rescuers on the scene battled to control the fire, initially hampered by difficulties with water supplies and a lack of breathing apparatus on site."It was like a living hell," one of the rescue team told The South Wales Daily News. "The heat was simply intense. Scorching. It was like a street of fire."The blast had brought the whole community to the pithead."Within an hour, hundreds of men, women and children had assembled at the pit head, too eager and anxious for tears, and many inarticulate with fear of early confirmation of the doom of husbands and sons in the great underworld," the newspaper reported.As a clearer picture emerged, it was apparent that miners on the west side who were not killed by the explosion, were trapped behind a wall of fire, and were likely to be killed by the noxious gases.Miners from the east side were gradually returned to safety at the top.Rescuers battled on for days to recover the wounded and the dead. Six days later, the death toll had reached 439 mine workers and one member of the rescue team. Eighteen men came out alive.The official inquiry into the disaster heard 13 days of evidence, with 21,837 questions put to witnesses. It closed on 21 February, 1914.The report failed to identify a definite cause, however it was agreed the explosion involved highly-flammable firedamp gas found in the area being ignited.It was clear there had been several breaches of the safety measures introduced by the Coal Mines Act of 1911, including ventilation not meeting required standards, inadequate removal of coal dust from the roof and sides, the use of "open sparking" signalling equipment and inadequate fire provisions.Shockingly, it was not the first time such a tragedy had struck at Senghenydd - an explosion on 21 May 1901 saw 81 miners lose their lives and only one man saved.But lessons were not learned. The 1914 report stated: "I should have thought, in view of the fact that the colliery was such a gassy one, and it had already been devastated by an explosion, that the management would have made arrangements for a supply of water adequate to meet an emergency of the kind that actually occurred."It said: "Some of the breaches, compared with those to which I have already given especial prominence may appear trivial, but taken in the aggregate they point to a disquieting laxity in the management of the mine."Both the mine manager Edward Shaw and the owners, Lewis Merthyr Consolidated Collieries, were prosecuted. Shaw was fined £24, prompting a local newspaper headline "Miners' Lives at 1s 1½d". Today, that sum would equate to around five and a half pence.The mine owners were fined £10 with £5 5s costs for not fitting the required reversible ventilation fans.William Hyatt, a miner who survived the explosion, said: "My father always said there was more fuss if a horse was killed underground than if a man was killed. Men came cheap - they had to buy horses."The impact on the community was devastating. It left behind 205 widows, 542 children and 62 dependent parents.The Universal Colliery closed in 1928. A memorial to those who died in the two explosions was erected on the site in 1981. On the centenary of the disaster, the people of Senghenydd will unveil a new memorial to commemorate the event.</body>

      <title>What does China own in Britain?</title>
      <description>How much of UK plc does China own?</description>

      <body>As the world's second largest economy, the fastest growing economy in the G20 and with more than a trillion dollars sitting in various sovereign wealth funds, China has quite a bit of cash to invest.And as the chart below shows, in recent years it has begun loosening the purse strings - in 2005, the Chinese government and Chinese companies collectively invested about $17bn (£11bn) in global assets, according to The Heritage Foundation. Last year they invested almost $130bn.That sounds like a lot of money, but in the context of global world trade or the economic output of developed economies, it is small change. For example, the total amount of money invested by China into Britain over the past nine years amounts to just 0.7% of the UK's total GDP in 2012.And Britain is one of the more popular destinations for Chinese investment. It is in the top 10 nations globally and attracts more than double the investment of any other nation in Europe. Globally, Australia comes out top, but even here Chinese investment last year equated to just 0.6% of the country's annual GDP. In developing nations, Chinese investment is more significant. In Nigeria, for example, inflows from China equated to 2% of GDP in 2012.Almost half of all the money invested overseas by China and Chinese companies in the past nine years went into the energy and power sector. China's demand for energy is expected to triple by 2030 so countries with abundant natural resources will continue to attract the most money from China.While more Chinese money is invested in the energy sector than in any other in Britain, China holds a number of investments elsewhere, including in Barclays Bank, BP, Diageo and Thames Water. Most are minority stakes, but it does have a controlling interest in some household names. For example, Bright Foods owns a 60% stake in Weetabix, the Wanda conglomerate owns 92% of Sunseeker boats, while Geely Automobile owns Manganese Bronze, the company that makes London taxis.Some of the companies listed below are not British firms, but the investments shown refer to assets based in Britain. For example, last year China Investment Corporation paid Ferrovial $700m to buy a 10% stake in Heathrow airport, and paid $400m to Deutsche Bank to take a stake in the bank's London offices.There are four other UK companies that have received monies from China, but are not included in the list as the money went into divisions based overseas. The China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOCC) invested almost $1.5bn to take a 33% stake in Tullow Oil's Ugandan operations in 2011. In 2010, CNOCC spent $270m on a 5% stake in BG's energy interests in Australia.In 2008 and 2009, Aluminium Corporation of China (Chinalco) made two investments totalling $14.3bn in Rio Tinto to take a 12% stake in the mining giant's aluminium operations in Australia, and two years later paid another $1.4bn to Rio for a share of its steel business in Guinea.Finally, in 2008, oil trader Sinochem paid $470m for a stake in oil and gas exploration company Soco International for a stake in its oil business in Yemen.Download the full data from the Heritage Foundation.</body>

      <title>Cooking up a successful food business</title>
      <description>How driving to Asia inspired a successful ready meals business</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24434154</url>

      <body>Inspiration can often come from strange places. For UK ready meals boss Charlie Bigham it was being unable to sleep at the border between Iran and Pakistan.Mr Bigham was 28 years old at the time, and he and his then girlfriend were travelling from the UK to India by camper van."It was very, very hot, and we were in a really tough place," he says. "I couldn't sleep, so I just laid there restlessly thinking about what I was going to do for a living when we got back home."I decided there and then that I was going to set up a food business, and it was going to look a bit like this."Mr Bigham had previously worked as a management consultant in London, before he and his girlfriend quit their jobs to go travelling for nine months.His ambition was to set up his own company when they returned to the UK, and now he had his idea - he was going to establish a business that made upmarket ready meals.Mr Bigham was not going to let the fact that he had never worked in the food industry before put him off, and instead he decided he would quickly set about gaining the knowledge and skills he needed.And so upon his return to the UK he got a job at a delicatessen in London's fashionable Notting Hill area."I've always been really interested in food, but I had no food industry experience, so I knew I had to get some cheese under my fingernails, so to speak," he says.He ended up spending almost four months at the deli, and at the same time did lots of research, and working on recipes."It became clear that the idea of making meals which are then sold via shops was a very good idea for a business because it was a massive market, yet one which was very straightforward to start up in," says Mr Bigham."I knew we could start under the radar before any bigger rivals could crush us, and then build quite quickly."In November 1996, 11 months after his return from travelling, and now married to his girlfriend, Mr Bigham launched the business with £25,000 of savings, calling it simply "Charlie Bigham's".To begin with, it was just him and one chef based at a small facility in London's Park Royal business estate.Mr Bigham says: "We had just three product lines to start with - zesty Caribbean lamb, Cajun chicken with salsa, and salmon with a dill and cream sauce. I think we made just 20 meals in total in that first week."To get sales moving, Mr Bigham, now 47, says he simply started "knocking on people's doors"."I went round all the posh delis in London, and the big department stores with food halls. Everyone was approachable, and said, 'Yeah we'll give you a go'."I just had to be mildly persuasive, and I'm not a salesman."What greatly helped us, is that you have to remember that at the time, most ready - or convenience - meals, as I prefer to call them, were pretty dreadful."We were one of the first to make quality ones without anything artificial. This set us apart and made shops interested in stocking us."But while selling to posh stores in London was pleasing, Mr Bigham realised that in order to grow the business he needed to win a contract with one of the UK's supermarket groups. And so he cold-called Waitrose."I just picked up the phone and rang the Waitrose switchboard. I managed to persuade a lovely woman on the phone to put me through to a buyer. I got a meeting, and the buyer said she would give us a go."Charlie Bigham's meals have been stocked by Waitrose ever since, initially at 40 stores for a successful trial period, and then nationwide. Online supermarket Ocado, and Booths, the north of England supermarket chain, have since followed suit.The company now employs 200 people across two sites at the Park Royal business park, and has an annual turnover of £20m, which is now growing at 19% per annum.Mr Bigham says his former job as a management consultant helped him manage the company's growth over the past 17 years.But he is the first to admit that luck and good timing played a major role in his success."The only way you can ever set up a successful business is to be lucky," he says. "It is the thing you need more than anything else. Anyone who says otherwise is just lying."Mr Bigham says that most important piece of luck was all to do with timing."I set up a food business just as interest in food was blossoming in this country. Suddenly there was a wealth of TV chefs, and the national newspapers all added food sections at weekends."And the supermarkets were all being brave and looking outwards towards new suppliers. There was no planning or forethought about all this on my part, it was pure luck."Mr Bigham today gives himself the job title "chairman and creative director". This followed his decision back in 2010 to bring in someone else to handle the chief executive role."It has enabled me to focus on the bits of the business I'm really interested in - product development, and the big strategic picture - working out plans for the next three to five years," he says."The bit in the middle [the day-to-day financial decisions etc] I'm easily bored by, and is best done by someone else."Looking ahead, Mr Bigham says the company has no plans to start exporting, because the freshness, and therefore limited shelf life of his products, makes it too expensive.Nor does he ever intend to move production away from London to somewhere cheaper, because he says he is loyal to his hard-working staff."I'm proud of what we have done to date, but I'm in no way complacent. Owning your own business is a hugely privileged position to be in, because I work with people I have chosen - not many people can say that."</body>

      <title>Bathgate no more, Linwood no more</title>
      <description>The towns named in a political anthem to the 1980s</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-24509655</url>
      <date>1381674423</date>

      <body>"Bathgate no more. Linwood no more. Methil no more. Irvine no more..."The lyrics from The Proclaimers first hit song, quarter of a century ago, continue as an anthem to the 1980s.As the duo brought a two-year touring schedule to a close at Glasgow's new Hydro arena on Saturday night, they still resonate as part of Scotland's story about its modern self.They drew a parallel with the poetry and paintings of the 18th and 19th Highland Clearances. To the theme of "Lochaber no more", the Proclaimers added Skye, Sutherland and Lewis.So I've been on a journey across central Scotland and through the past quarter century to find out what happened next for the towns that were supposed to be "...no more".There are some who never recovered from the blight of unemployment in that decade. A generation was scarred by losing jobs, without skills to take on the new opportunities. There's evidence that the next generation who left school into the teeth of the Eighties recession continue to suffer some consequences still.But the main theme I've found is what is quite a positive story about resilience and flexibility.Scots are more skilled, and perhaps more resourceful. Having given up on supporting old industries, government has made a difference through building infrastructure for new ones. People have become much more mobile around the country.Whereas the Proclaimers were singing in 'Letter from America' about emigration and "all the blood that flowed away", the past 15 years have seen that flow reversed, with the arrival of immigrants, particularly from Poland and the Baltic states.As I heard from the duo, Charlie and Craig Reid, the song didn't say it was bad or good, but that it happens. "It was unthinkable there would be an influx of eastern Europeans before the Iron Curtain came down. That has changed Scotland for the good".The economy has continued to bring major plant closures, though on a lesser scale to the giant ones of the 1980s. Thirteen years ago, it included Motorola at Easter Inch, near Bathgate. More recently, it has been at the Hall's of Broxburn meat processing plant, ten miles from Bathgate.It's notable that the impact on single communities has been less clear and less harsh for the communities around them than when coal mines and the previous generation of industries closed. Workers have been more dispersed, and a combination of improved transport options and more flexible skills have taken them to jobs in other places and in other sectors.Charlie and Craig Reid, while giving up some rehearsal time ahead of their Glasgow gig, told me Letter from America now seems dated. They weren't to know that net emigration would be reversed, before the Iron Curtain came down.They know it speaks to a particular generation, and that it plays best when they are performing in Britain, Ireland and Canada. But Charlie Reid also reflects that his children's generation are in a weaker bargaining position with employers, backed by multi-national clout, than used to be the case, as they're "ground down" on pay and conditions, and struggle to turn part-time opportunities into full-time employment.The writers of the lyrics say the towns could as easily have been Kilmarnock, Cowdenbeath and Cumnock, but the ones they chose worked with the song. So that's where I went for my journey across Scotland, and across the past quarter century.The Leyland plant built trucks and tractors until work started to be moved elsewhere from 1982, and it finally closed in 1986. There was a work-in during that time, with a parallel dispute with the nearby Plessey workers, making telephone components.Jim Swan was convener of Leyland's joint shop stewards, and recalls: "It was difficult times; the pit closing, Plessey and us closing at the same time. It was devastating and the unemployment rate went up to 25 per cent in some areas."I always remember Gavin McCone, the civil servant, saying to me at that time: 'Mr Swan, I can't save your workers, but what I can do is set up an infrastructure which will try to get more inward investment and work which will probably employ your sons and daughters.' And that's what happened, but it took about 15 years to balance the economy out again."During that time, Silicon Glen brought thousands of electronics jobs to West Lothian, but many left again. This time, though, the big closures, such as Motorola at Easter Inch, had workforces which were dispersed, so the impact was not so severe on any one town.West Lothian now has the fastest population growth of any council area in Scotland, which explains why the old Leyland plant has a housing estate on it, where many commute to work at some distance. It's become part of greater Edinburgh.Harry Cartmill, representing Bathgate for Labour on the council, says the opening of the rail line to the capital in the same year that Leyland closed was the biggest single element of turning around the town. Only two years ago, the line west to Airdrie and on to Glasgow re-opened as well, making it more of a dormitory town for both cities.Where once they built Hillman cars at the Renfrewshire site, they now sell them. A lot of them. John McGuire, managing director of Phoenix Car Company, says there are 18 dealerships alongside an Asda superstore, restaurants and leisure.His father worked at Linwood, and when it closed, his first year of unemployment saw him age by more than 10 years "going from a relatively young man to a relatively old man""When I was wanting to start my own business, and we had an opportunity to buy land here, I wasn't sure if this was where I wanted to come, because of the damage done to the local community. But I'm very glad that I did."He reckons that there are now nearly 4000 jobs in the area, which is getting close to the number of jobs lost when the car plant closed."I wanted to employ people, because I saw the dignity that gave to people and I wanted to have my own business so that I'd be in control of my destiny and also that I'd look after a team of people and make sure they didn't have to go through what we saw happening in the Eighties in this country."The nearby village of Linwood hasn't fared so well. It won the unwanted Carbuncle Award for poor design, which provoked some in the community to treat it not as an insult but a challenge to improve. The Community Development Trust is keen to see change in the area done with people in the area, rather than to them.There's lots more to Methil, but it's been a rocky time. The Fife town's fabrication yard, under various ownership, was still building big oil platforms for the North Sea oil in the 1980s, but decline and closure was on the way. The fabrication was shut for seven years, until BiFab expanded from Burntisland, along the Fife coast.The company now has 800 people on site, and 1,100 if you include Burntisland and Arnish near Stornoway. It's hiring apprentices, but for welding skills, it had to go to Poland.It's working to capacity, much of that on a platform for Premier Oil's Solan field west of Shetland, scheduled for float-out next April. That will go in 140 metres of water, and while it will have 35 berths for offshore workers, the intention is to remove it after a year, and to operate it remotely.The big prospect, though, is in renewable energy. Samsung is constructing a huge, 7 megawatt wind turbine, just off the Methil quayside, and Scottish Enterprise, which owns the land, has a site cleared for the Korean giant to build turbines there - so long as the market conditions become clearer.BiFab's managing director John Robertson says the yard has built 42 jackets for offshore wind turbines. It has plans to invest in new production capacity up to 150 per year, if demand comes through.And as he said, there's a lot of uncertainty in the wind, while the industry awaits the guaranteed minimum prices that will underpin it in the UK government's Electricity Market Reforms, and a decision on how long that regime will last.He also said the uncertainty extended to the outcome of next year's independence referendum - a 'hurdle' that he wants to get over, so that the investment outlook becomes clearer.There was no signature plant or plant closure that defined Irvine's. And it's less clear that the town has found a way back from the hard times of the 1980s. The Irvine Bay regeneration plan aims to improve the new town and others nearby in North Ayrshire.The problem a quarter century ago was as much about young people leaving as businesses doing so. One of those to do so was Nicola Sturgeon, who grew up in Dreghorn, the village that became part of Irvine.She recalls a social life built around the path-breaking Magnum Centre and a political awareness that took her, as a teenager, into the Scottish National Party.She recalls the threat and reality of unemployment at that time feeling like it was "terminal" - there seemed no way back. And for her, there was only one thing she planned to do when she left school, which was studying law at Glasgow University.There is now more flexibility about people returning to work after redundancy. And what of her nephew who is around the age of the Deputy First Minister when she first heard the Proclaimers' Letter from America, and he's soon to leave school in Irvine?His interest in science may be well suited to the science opportunities in North Ayrshire's pharmaceutical industry.And while she thinks young people should have the opportunity to spread their wings and leave, she believes the important thing is to ensure they can come back to those opportunities.</body>

      <title>When Clough's clown stopped England</title>
      <description>Goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski relives time he stopped England</description>

      <body>A place at Brazil 2014 might be in their own hands but England have been here before, and the omens are against them.It is almost exactly 40 years since the Three Lions last needed to beat Poland in a make-or-break World Cup qualifier - and the man who stopped them then is back in town.Jan Tomaszewski will be watching at Wembley on Tuesday, where he entered footballing folklore with a virtuoso, if unorthodox, goalkeeping performance on 17 October 1973.Famously dubbed a "circus clown in gloves" by Brian Clough on TV before kick-off, his heroics helped Poland hold England in a game Sir Alf Ramsey's side needed to win to reach the 1974 World Cup finals.None of the England team were laughing at the end of a completely one-sided match that saw them take 36 shots to Poland's two, force 26 corners, hit the woodwork twice and have four efforts cleared off the line.But Tomaszewski has much happier memories."I have never watched the game again," he told BBC Sport. "But if you have a game like this, you always remember it in your heart. I can wake up in the middle of the night and remember every minute."Poland had gone top of a three-team group with one game to go after beating England in a bad-tempered match in Chorzow in June and Ramsey was coming under pressure from the press.Nobody was panicking, however. After all, England had been at every World Cup finals since they entered for the first time in 1950, had won the tournament less than eight years earlier, and had been one of the best teams at the 1970 finals in Mexico too."It was win or bust but I don't think anybody seriously thought England would fail," said Barry Davies, who was at Wembley commentating on the game for the BBC."This was still in the age when everybody felt we had an entitlement to be in the World Cup finals, and it was simply unthinkable that we wouldn't be there."Poland boss Kazimierz Gorski thought otherwise. He knew his players saw Wembley as an impenetrable fortress and, according to Tomaszewski, used that to inspire them.In the dressing room before kick-off, Gorski told his players: "Win against a weak team and there is no joy. You can play for 20 years and in 1,000 games and nobody will remember you. But tonight, in one game, against a team like England and at a place like this, you have the chance to put your names in the history books."They did."As we walked out, the England fans shouted 'animals' at us," Tomaszewski recalled. "It was referring to our win in Chorzow. To be honest we had played very violently there."Most of the 100,000 crowd were expecting England to get their revenge. So were some of the Poland side."I wasn't just afraid of England - I was terrified," Tomaszewski added. "They had beaten Austria 7-0 a month earlier and when I was in front of the royal box with the national anthems being played, I was just thinking 'I hope we are not the next Austria'."If it was not for the exploits of the then 25-year-old LKS Lodz keeper, it might indeed have ended up being a similar scoreline. But his first eccentric save, after two minutes, was almost his last."I was feeling the pressure and did not notice that Allan Clarke was standing two metres away from me when I rolled the ball out," Tomaszewski explained."I dived at his feet to make a save but he kicked me instead of the ball and I broke five tiny bones (his metacarpals) in my left wrist, like glass."They were frozen during the game and the adrenaline meant I did not feel the pain. Afterwards, one of my team-mates Adam Musial told me 'it was good that he kicked you because he woke you up'."Chance after England chance followed but, whether it was Tomaszewski's legs, arms or hands, he continued to keep the ball out, even if he dived the wrong way.When he was beaten, the posts or a team-mate came to his rescue, and the score was goalless at the break.Highlights of the game were being shown on BBC but the match was live on ITV and Clough, who had resigned as Derby boss just two days previously, was one of their pundits.At half-time he refused to back down on his description of Tomaszewski, and told the nation: "Keep calm. Put the kettle on, mother. Don't worry - the goals are going to come."In a sense, Clough was right; a goal did arrive early in the second half. Sadly for England, it was Poland who scored it."I had spent quite a lot of time watching the Poles in training before the game," said veteran commentator Davies."I could see how they were going to play. They knew they would be under pressure but they thought they had the pace to catch England on the break."That is exactly what happened. Norman Hunter, preferred to Bobby Moore in central defence, came across to pick up the ball on the left touchline near the halfway line but got his feet tangled up.Robert Gadocha was left free to surge towards the area before playing in Jan Domarski, who was arriving like a train to his right, to hit a low shot that skidded past Emlyn Hughes' challenge and went under Peter Shilton's dive.Hunter took the blame, and would describe the incident as "the worst moment of his career", but Shilton also accepted he should have done better."I tried to make the perfect save," he said. "Had I been more experienced, I'd have stuck a foot or knee out."Eight minutes later, England were given a glimmer of hope.Martin Peters burst down the right wing and went down inside the area under a challenge from Adam Musial. Peters later admitted to diving, in desperation for England's cause. It worked - Belgian referee Vital Loraux awarded a penalty.Shilton could not bear to watch as Allan Clarke stepped up to take the spot-kick, crouching on his haunches with his back to the opposition goal.But he had no need to worry. The Leeds striker had scored three of his nine goals for England from the spot, and a fourth was to follow."I was trying to read which side Clarke would shoot," said Tomaszewski. "But when the whistle went, he just came up to the ball as if he was training with kids and slotted it past me."He was so cool. If I could have done, I would have applauded him at the time for doing that under so much pressure."England still needed another goal, but they could not get it.Tomaszewski's favourite stop of a memorable night came in the last 10 minutes, again from Clarke, who turned away to celebrate in the belief he had scored the winner."He hit a beautiful shot and I did a blind save on my left-side," Tomaszewski explained. "I have to admit I did not save that ball, I was just in the right place at the right time and the ball bounced off me."England thought they had scored but they only had a corner. It was funny because when I looked up, Clarke was crouched down with his eyes wide open - he could not believe what had happened."In the 88th minute, Ramsey belatedly made a change, sending on Kevin Hector for the ineffective Martin Chivers.It almost worked - Hector had a header hacked off the line in the dying seconds - but Poland held on. The final score was 1-1, and England were out."There was a stunned silence in the stadium at the final whistle," recalled Davies. "It was more disbelief than anything else."Hunter trudged off the pitch looking utterly dejected, and there were more tears from several other players in a desolate England dressing room afterwards.Meanwhile, Poland's party was just beginning, but not for Tomaszewski."How did I celebrate? I was the only one who didn't," he said. "The team went out all night but I was in pain with my wrist and stayed in my hotel room to take medicine."In the morning, I saw the newspapers and felt extremely satisfied because I was on the front pages."They called me the 'man who stopped England' but it was not just me. It was Gorski and the 11 people he positioned on the pitch. Against England, I made mistakes but they were not punished because of my team-mates."Poland would go on to finish third at the 1974 World Cup, with Tomaszewski excelling.Wembley was just the start of a golden period in Poland's footballing history, but for Ramsey it was the beginning of the end. By the time the finals started the following June, England's only World Cup-winning manager had been sacked.Tomaszewski, who is now a 65-year-old politician, had the last laugh on his critic Clough too."Years later we met at the BBC in Manchester," he said. "Clough apologised for what he had said about me. We shook hands and I said thank you, because only great people can admit to mistakes."With thanks to Jan Krzesimowski, who acted as a translator for Jan Tomaszewski.</body>

      <body>The papers welcome the chancellor's trade mission to China - along with his announcement that visa rules for Chinese nationals coming to Britain are to be relaxed.The Daily Telegraph says the fact that both George Osborne and London Mayor Boris Johnson have travelled to China to court its rulers speaks volumes for that nation's diplomatic and commercial importance.For the Times, the UK has a long way to go before it properly exploits its relationship with China. There's no doubt, the paper says, that in the quest for Britain to make a living in the world, China is part of the future.Iran and the world powers begin formal negotiations over Tehran's nuclear programme in Geneva this week - and the Financial Times says the US and its allies will discover whether a new mood of compromise really inhabits Iran's corridors of power.It urges US and Iranian negotiators to be courageous, saying the world needs to see a sustained and strategic shift in the US-Iran relationship.The Independent says the auspices are better than they have been for many years. But, it warns, the hard part starts now.England's first chief inspector of adult social care tells the Independent she is preparing to recruit an army of ordinary people with personal experience of the care system to help conduct inspections.Andrea Sutcliffe says these are people who have an experience of care, either because they might be a user themselves or they might have cared for someone who has been in a residential home."We know that an awful lot of those folk are keen to share their experience and their insight", she says.Drink-driving among motorists aged over 75 has risen by a fifth in two years, according to a survey reported in the Daily Mail.The research was carried out by a car insurance company using figures from 42 of the 52 police forces in the UK.According to the paper, experts and government officials say drink-driving does not carry the same stigma among older motorists born before the breathalyser and brought up in an age when the practice was rife and not considered socially unacceptable.A number of papers report a call by Mary Berry, presenter of The Great British Bake Off, that all children should be taught to cook 10 meals before they leave school.According to the Daily Telegraph, she told the Cheltenham Literature Festival that cookery should not be taught in the "form it has been lately".Instead, teachers should "blow the science of it" and go back to showing young people "what's good for them, how to buy ingredients and how to make a few dishes that they can enjoy and don't cost too much".Finally, High Court judges are to lose one of their perks at the official residences they occupy when they are on circuit.According to the Times, Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling has decided to end their subscriptions to Sky television to save money. It says the move has provoked anger.One un-named judge tells the paper: "We have had a pay freeze and now this petty imposition, again without any consultation. It's the thin end of the wedge. Next will be our cars, drinks, entertaining and flowers."</body>

      <description>A Muslim free school in Derby, which is threatened with closure, says it will support female staff who do not wish to wear head coverings.</description>

      <body>A Muslim free school in Derby has said it will support female staff who do not want to wear head coverings.It follows a letter warning the Al-Madinah School it faced closure unless discrimination against female staff and pupils stopped.Education Minister Lord Nash laid out 17 issues for the school to consider, which included an end to "unacceptable" teaching standards.The letter said if steps were not taken by Tuesday, funding would be pulled.Parent-governor Abdullah Shahjan told BBC Radio Derby: "We are amending policies to make sure we support staff, who if for their cultural, ethical, or faith do not wish to cover their hair."Another governor Fasal Hussain said: "We are very open, very flexible."However, with regard to Lord Nash's letter and female staff wearing head scarves he added: "We would have appreciated some consultation."We have never received any complaints from our staff."During an earlier interview on Newsnight, Mr Shahjan said: "The very first question we ask everybody is 'Would you be prepared to cover your hair if you came into the school as part of the uniform policy?'."To this date, of all those who have come none has ever refused."Head of Islamic studies at the school, Mohammad Burhaan, told Newsnight: "This is the code of dress we have adopted."If you look at an air hostess, for example, a female wears a different code of dress."We are not saying they are discriminated against, that's a choice made by the business."He added: "We are not saying by wearing a head scarf you are changing your religious identity at all... this is the code of dress we would like our female staff to adopt and this is the decision as an organisation we have made."Is it possible to review that - yes it is."The government has told the school to write to all female members of staff telling them they do not have to wear a hijab if it is in conflict with their religion, or beliefs.In the letter outlining concerns, Lord Nash wrote: "The trust has manifestly breached the conditions of its funding agreement by:"I will not tolerate breaches of the commitments you gave when entering into the funding agreement."He has urged the school's trust to take five "urgent steps" by 15 October, including providing written confirmation that "you have ceased any practices and procedures that have as their reason, cause or effect that women and girls are treated less favourably than men and boys".The school has been given a deadline of 22 October to address nine further action points and must provide a plan setting out a clear management structure by the start of November.</body>

      <title>Labour backs parent-led schools</title>
      <description>Labour says it will support parents who want to set up new schools but the Conservatives say the opposition's policy on school choice has not changed.</description>

      <body>Labour is "on the side" of parents who want to set up schools and would not shut most existing free schools, the new shadow education secretary insists.Tristram Hunt told the BBC Labour backed "enterprise and innovation" when it came to increasing school places.He said a Labour government would push ahead with what it called parent-led academies in areas of educational need.Tory chairman Grant Shapps said Labour's policy was unchanged and it still opposed the "popular" schools.Free schools, set up by parents and other groups and operating outside local authority control, have been established under a policy pioneered by Education Secretary Michael Gove.More than 170 have been opened across England since September 2011.Labour has been accused by the government of sending out mixed messages about the party's support, opposing their roll-out nationally but backing schools locally.Mr Hunt, who has just taken over from Stephen Twigg as the party's education spokesman, said he regretted previously describing free schools as a "vanity project for yummy mummies". He made the comments in 2010 shortly after becoming an MP.Mr Hunt told BBC One's Andrew Marr programme Labour would not open new free schools "along the Michael Gove model", but that the bulk of existing free schools would be kept open as his party wanted to "keep the good free schools".Citing the case of the Al-Madinah free school in Derby, which was closed for a week earlier this month on the first day of an Ofsted inspection, Mr Hunt said Labour would not allow schools to become an "ideological experiment".Education Minister Lord Nash has warned the school would be closed unless "unacceptable" teaching standards improved.Its acting head teacher said there were areas the school needed to address and it was co-operating with Ofsted."What is going on with the Al-Madinah school is a terrifying example of the mistakes of Michael Gove's education policy," he said.New schools, he added, should only be opened in areas where there was a shortage of places, where "properly qualified" staff could be recruited and where institutions were financially accountable.Under Labour's plans, parent-led academies would enable parent groups and other organisations to set up schools outside local authority control, although local authorities would have greater powers to intervene when there were concerns about standards."If you are a group of parents, social entrepreneurs and teachers interested in setting up a school in areas where you need new school places, then the Labour government will be on your side."We are in favour of enterprise and innovation."But a Conservative Party spokesman said shadow chancellor Ed Balls had made it clear in a speech in June that the party would curb new schools in areas where they was an "excess" of places.Mr Balls had suggested a future Labour government would prioritise resources on areas where school places were in "short supply".Mr Shapps told the BBC: "This is the same old Labour policy. Free schools will only be allowed in specific circumstances in specific areas with a whole load of bureaucracy attached."Free schools have been driving up standards. They are hugely popular with parents and up to now Labour have fought tooth and nail against them including voting against them and what they said today has changed absolutely nothing."Journalist Toby Young, who helped set up a free school in west London, said Mr Hunt had been "less than candid" about Labour's policy as it was considering granting councils the power of veto over free schools in their boroughs.Writing in his blog for the Daily Telegraph, Mr Young - who has said he is considering of applying to be a Conservative candidate at the next election - said this would be a "retrograde step" since councils would be unlikely to approve new schools close to existing ones which were under-performing.Mr Hunt said there needed to be more focus on vocational education with support for further education colleges and apprenticeships in industry.</body>

      <body>A lollipop man has resigned after being threatened with suspension for high-fiving children who were crossing a road.Bob Slade, 65, helped children to cross a road leading to Manadon Vale Primary School, in Plymouth.Parent Barbara Laws said his actions were "not dangerous" and it was a "ridiculous" situation.Plymouth City Council said those on patrols can be "friendly", but their "full attention must be on the road".Ms Laws: "He had his hand out anyway to hold back the traffic and as the children crossed they would pat the hand that he was holding out."In my opinion that's not dangerous. I think if you spoke to any of the parents they wouldn't think it was dangerous - if we had we would have asked him to stop."Mr Slade could not be reached for comment but speaking to the Plymouth Herald, he said he had been doing the job for more than four years without a single accident.Ms Laws said he was "doing the job very well" and following his resignation no-one was patrolling the road."It was all down to a decision which we [parents] don't understand," she added.A council spokesperson said: "We take the safety of children very seriously and school crossing patrols exist to make sure children can cross roads as safely as possible."To do this they must hold out the lollipop with one arm and hold their other arm outstretched to signal that all traffic must stop - this is well established signalling that should be understood by all drivers."While patrols can be friendly, their full attention must be on the road and they must watch the traffic closely at all times."The authority added that it would be recruiting a replacement "as quickly as possible".</body>

      <body>A public meeting will take place in Belfast later at which people can give their views on how schools are funded.In June, the education minister proposed changes to the Common Funding Scheme, which determines how funds are allocated to Northern Ireland schools.The proposals had been brought forward by an independent panel of experts who examined the current scheme.They found it was outdated, too complicated and was failing pupils.The panel recommended a simpler funding formula and financial incentives so that smaller schools are better off if they join with schools nearby.A Department of Education spokesperson said: "When the minister set out the way ahead for how local schools are funded, he undertook to gather the views of everyone who might be affected, or with an interest, who wishes to have their say."Schools already have a mechanism for responding to the consultation, but, in keeping with the minister's views, we wanted to be able to engage with a wider audience."This public meeting in Belfast follows one held already in Omagh and enables those who wish to put their views across verbally to have their say."It forms part of the wider consultation process that has included an online response form, children's and young people's versions and focussed engagement with parents, children and young people."The meeting will take place at Belfast's Linenhall Library at 18:15 BST.The consultation closes on Friday 18 October.</body>

      <title>Disabled child support review urged</title>
      <description>The government is urged by the children's commissioner for England to undertake a review of the adequacy of support for disabled children.</description>

      <body>Ministers are being urged to review care provided for children with disabilities following research into the adequacy of support for families.Children's commissioner for England Maggie Atkinson called the findings "heart-rending" and "disturbing".The report suggested some families were unable to afford basic necessities for "a dignified life".The Department for Work and Pensions said the report contained "a small sample, presenting a partial picture".The study, carried out by the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) for the children's commissioner, found evidence that poverty meant some disabled children were not living lives that met international human rights standards.Ms Atkinson said the research findings were "not an easy read"."This is about voicelessness and powerlessness, as well as about making ends meet," she said. "It's very poignant and very difficult to hear the stories."Money issues are very real and very challenging, but parents are equally saying they have little or no say in the ways services are planned and provided, from transport to access to youth, or play or leisure which is properly adapted for one's disability."The research was based on interviews and group discussions with 78 disabled children and young people and 17 parents.It was co-led by a team of 11 disabled children and young people working with the university.A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions rejected some of the conclusions."In fact, independent reports show how we are world leaders in support for disabled people with the UK's spending on disability-related benefits a fifth higher than the EU average."The UK is also acknowledged as a world leader in supporting independent living for disabled people, having the best overall rating of 55 countries."We continue to spend around £50bn a year on disabled people and their services and our reforms will make sure the billions spent give more targeted support to those who need it most."Ms Atkinson acknowledged the government's response, but stressed some of the "personal stories" she had heard painted a different picture.She said: "I would like some of the officials who have no doubt written that statement to come and meet some of the young people, who will tell the very true story of living with a disability on a very low income, and then I would ask them to say that again."There is a mum quoted in the survey, who because her child needs an adapted home, including a multi-sensory environment... was persuaded to make sure that was available."She will be paying for it until November 2022."There is also a young woman going through everything that adolescence brings with it, who needs incontinence pads."The benefits pay for four-a-day, she needs 10. That is not human dignity and it is not human rights either."Despite the criticism, researchers found "many examples" of disabled children receiving good care and services which they said "demonstrate how low income does not have to be a barrier".But evidence was also found of inadequate services, compounding the problems of some low income families.The authors said that although families with disabled children often have rights to welfare payments and practical support, their basic incomes often do not cover the extra costs of raising and caring for a disabled child.The team analysed three United Nations treaty documents: the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on Persons with Disabilities and the International Covenant on Economic and Social Rights.Between them these treaties specify individuals' rights to food, clothes and heating, to live independently, to be able to decide where to live, to live in their local communities and to the support and services they need to be able to do that.The researchers found the lives lived by some disabled children and young people did not meet these basic rights."There were accounts of some disabled children, young people and their parents not being able to heat their homes properly or afford adequate clothing and food," said the paper."Some were not informed or involved in decisions about changes to where they lived."Some experienced delays in adaptations being made to their homes and some did not have enough space nor support for independent living."</body>

      <title>Fellowes Bard views 'misguided'</title>
      <description>Shakespeare's Globe Theatre has called Julian Fellowes' comments about needing a "Shakespearian scholarship" to understand the Bard's work "misguided".</description>

      <body>Shakespeare's Globe Theatre has called Julian Fellowes' comments about needing a "Shakespearian scholarship" to understand the Bard's work "misguided".The Downton Abbey creator said he adapted the language in his version of Romeo and Juliet to make it accessible.But Fiona Banks from Globe Education said no one should feel excluded from Shakespeare's original prose because of their level of education."Shakespeare's for everybody. We can all understand him," she said.Fellowes, who won a best screenplay Oscar in 2002 for Gosford Park, had been criticised by Shakespeare experts for rewriting certain passages and altering the language used in the Bard's work for his film.However he told the BBC earlier this week the film was never intended to be a straight adaptation of Shakespeare's original play."When people say we should have filmed the original, I don't attack them for that point of view, but to see the original in its absolutely unchanged form, you require a kind of Shakespearian scholarship and you need to understand the language and analyse it and so on," he said."I can do that because I had a very expensive education, I went to Cambridge. Not everyone did that and there are plenty of perfectly intelligent people out there who have not been trained in Shakespeare's language choices."Ms Banks, who is a senior education advisor at the Globe, told the BBC Fellowes' comments were "misguided"."To see Shakespeare in the original, in its absolutely unchanged form, we need nothing more than a performance space and a company of actors who are able to share his stories in a way that engages their audience," she said."Shakespeare's for everybody. If we've ever been in love, or fallen out with a friend or been jealous, we can understand him."Ms Banks added one of the reasons Shakespeare's plays were read so widely was because they dealt with fundamental human issues that affect everyone."Romeo and Juliet is a prime example of that," she said.Much of the work carried out by Shakespeare's Globe involves introducing young people to Shakespeare and his classic plays.Last year, the Globe ran a drama project which introduced the playwright to children as young as three."When I produce a piece of theatre for young people it is really important they feel Shakespeare is something they have a right to and can access, and could be - if they wanted - something they could return to throughout their lives," Ms Banks said."It would be very worrying if anyone read [Fellowes' comments] and felt excluded from Shakespeare's original language because of their level of education.She added Fellowes was a "brilliant" screenwriter and said adaptations had an important role to play in the contemporary production of literary texts."They have the potential to help us re-imagine and re-discover a wealth of wonderful literature. But they are not a prerequisite for their enjoyment by the non-Oxbridge educated members of the population," she said.</body>

      <body>There are fears some children with suspected autism are missing out on a specialist education because waiting times for diagnosis are increasing.In the Hywel Dda local health board area, 311 children have been diagnosed but a further 340 are still waiting to be assessed.Appropriate education provision is difficult without a correct diagnosis.In 2012, BBC Wales found some children were waiting longer than seven years for a diagnosis.According to figures obtained by BBC Wales Today almost 4,000 children in Wales have been diagnosed with autism - two thirds of those children are in mainstream education.But the programme, which will be broadcast on Friday at 18:30 BST on BBC One Wales, spoke to the National Autistic Society which said more than half of of those with autism had waited more than two years to be diagnosed.Nine-year-old Tom Fairburn, from Pembrokeshire, has a chromosome condition called 47 XYY syndrome, which means he has an extra Y chromosome. As a result Tom has learning difficulties.But when Tom was seven his mother, Samantha, suspected he had Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Nearly three years later, Tom is still waiting for a diagnosis.His mother said Tom's story was typical for the area."I think everybody is in the same position, I think everybody just wants their children to be seen," said Ms Fairburn.She called for better training and facilities in schools as well as better support from the education and health authorities."When he was in junior school I raised my concerns that there was no way he was going to cope in mainstream and then when they did open a unit it was basically just a classroom which they called a unit," Ms Fairburn said."They didn't have the facilities for children with special needs - no sensory room, no quiet areas and the space was quite small. Children with autism like space."Ms Fairburn called for teachers to receive more training on how to manage children with autism."I know autistic children are different but a lot of their ways are the same and I think a lot more training should be given - and to teachers in these units," she said."In his school I felt that they thought he was naughty and, to be honest, I think that they couldn't cope with him and they didn't want him in the school... I think Tom felt like that as well."Meleri Thomas, from the National Autistic Society Cymru, said more needed to be done to help children like Tom."It is quite worrying local authorities don't know exactly how many children are waiting for a diagnosis because if they don't know that then they can't know how to plan for provision and what kind of provision is needed," she said."The more forward planning they can do the better it would be in the longer term and for the children in their local authority areas."A spokesman from Pembrokeshire council said: "There has been considerable development of specialist provision in response to a substantial increase in need."We currently have specialist provision for 60 children which is more than in most authorities."We are working closely with parents of children with ASD to ensure that we develop both specialist provision and improve this capacity of mainstream schools to meet the needs of all children with ASD."A spokeswoman for Hywel Dda said it expects to take on more staff in January to cut waiting times."The health board is committed to reducing the waiting times for ASD diagnosis across the Hywel Dda area, focusing initially on Pembrokeshire and will be employing more staff to achieve this," she said."The health board is also working with the Welsh government on the refresh of the all Wales ASD strategy to ensure in future that the significant issues facing the service currently are addressed in a sustainable manner."More on this story will be broadcast on BBC Wales Today at 18:30 BST on Friday.</body>

      <description>Evangelical Christian groups intent on converting pupils are being allowed into state schools claims a report.</description>

      <body>Evangelical Christian groups intent on converting pupils are being allowed into state schools claims a report.The National Secular Society (NSS) says some groups are holding assemblies and bible clubs in schools in England.The NSS has written to the Education Secretary Michael Gove calling for national guidance on external visitors, particularly from religious groups.The government said it had not seen any evidence to support the claims and had not received any complaints.The report says there has been "a marked increase in the number of parents contacting the National Secular Society with concerns about external visitors to schools exposing their children to unwelcome and wholly inappropriate religious evangelism and proselytisation".It added: "We have investigated this and found an abundance of material showing that the parents' concerns were not isolated instances."The report says that in many cases, evangelical Christian organisations offer to provide religious education and school worship.It claims that the legal obligation on schools to provide religious education and a daily act of worship has provided "a foot in the door" to some organisations with evangelistic intentions.The report suggests that shortfalls in religious education provision, recently highlighted in a report from Ofsted, are leading head teachers to accept help from external religious groups and adds that some heads are "insufficiently discerning about the external groups they are allowing into their schools".The letter also asks the Department for Education to ensure that guidance to schools on visits from religious groups "makes clear that schools must not offer opportunities to groups seeking to evangelise".The NSS says its investigation was prompted after it was contacted by parents, some of whom had themselves written to the schools and to the Department for Education about their concerns.One parent said he had become aware "quite by chance" of regular visits by an evangelical group to his child's non-religious primary school in Sheffield.He complains that the group "adheres to a profoundly conservative and avowedly missionary agenda".Another complained that his child had been told the creation story from Genesis was "factual" during visits to a primary school in the West Midlands from a local minister.Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: "Religious education must be clearly delineated as such."A line is crossed when religious positions such as creationism are taught as scientific theories for example. Neither are schools places for proselytisation without the explicit and informed consent of parents."A spokeswoman for the DfE said if parents had concerns about visitors to their child's school they should make a formal complaint to the school."State schools cannot teach creationism as scientific fact," added the spokeswoman."They must offer a broad and balanced curriculum and meet their obligations under equalities legislation. Schools have a responsibility under law to ensure children are insulated from political activity and campaigning."Schools are required to safeguard the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils."Ofsted inspections include a focus on this to enable them to identify any inappropriate practice."Paul Bate of the Association of Christian Teachers and a former head of a faith school said: "Some schools, including faith schools, have a clear statement in their articles prohibiting staff from proselytising within the school."Indeed, the faith school where I was head had such a statement within their articles and the RE curriculum was based around the teaching of philosophy, ethics, and giving the students an understanding of all faiths - which included secularism."</body>

      <body>One of two teenage boys taken out of a school after refusing to shave off their beards is allowed to return to school on Monday.The 14-year-old Muslim pupils at Mount Carmel Roman Catholic High School in Accrington said it was part of their faith to keep their facial hair.Governors said one boy could return after talks with Muslim leaders, but the policy has not changed.The case of the second boy is unresolved.Lancashire County Council said the boys had been sent home on Tuesday, but could return to school once they had shaved.The teenagers had been placed in isolation for a month previously because they had failed to comply with rules about appearance.The two pupils were part of a group of students told in June they must remove their facial hair before they returned for the new term.A third Muslim student who had a moustache was also barred from the classroom, but he shaved and returned to his classes.Mount Carmel head teacher Xavier Bowers said in a statement: "[There] will be no change to the school rule which requires boys to be clean shaven."However, following discussions with leaders of the local community, exemptions will be made in certain clearly-defined circumstances."He also said the school had to comply to the European Convention of Human Rights, which states all schools must make reasonable adjustments to school uniform on genuine religious grounds.Mr Bowers said the Bishop of Salford advised governors to work with the Islamic community and "support boys who are genuinely and fully committed to their faith".He said: "With this in mind and in line with European Human Rights legislation, governors have taken the decision to only allow Muslim boys permission to grow a beard as a sign of their faith as long as they have started the Hafiz programme at a mosque."Hafiz is a programme involving attending a mosque for up to three hours a day to pray and learn the Quran.Lancashire county councillor for Accrington West Munsif Dad said: "I'm very glad that we are moving in the right direction and I'd like to thank the head teacher and governors for their understanding and co-operation."About a third of the 750 pupils at the school are Muslim.</body>

      <body>Tens of thousands of teenagers in England do not have at least a C-grade at GCSE in English and maths by the time they are 18, new figures suggest.And most who do not get a good grade in these key subjects by 16 then drop them.The figures are revealed in new government statistics.From now on, all teenagers will have to continue studying maths and English if they do not get at least a C-grade.The statistics, which have been published for the first time and are described as "experimental" by government officials, show that in 2009-10, about one in three young people (220,000) had not gained a grade A* to C in English by the age of 16.Of these, about 34,000 (15%), went on to re-take the GCSE after 16. About half of those then got at least a C.The figures are similar for maths.Schools minister David Laws said: "English and maths are what employers demand before all other subjects - if young people want to get on in life, they must be able to show they have good literacy and numeracy."These figures expose the vast number of young people allowed to give up these subjects after so nearly achieving the level employers demand."With just a bit more teaching, these students could have achieved the grades that would make all the difference to their job prospects."The figures come days after a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said literacy and numeracy rates of England's 16- to 24-year-olds were among the lowest in the developed world.Among 16-year-olds in England, only six in 10 achieve the government's minimum target of five good GCSEs including English and maths.Under changes introduced last month, teenagers now have to stay in some form of education or training until they are 17, although this may be work-based.This is due to rise to 18 in 2015.Ministers say they are writing to 12 local councils who are not tracking whether 16- to 18-year-olds are in education or training.New figures show that nationally, 88% of 16- and 17-year-olds were in education or training in June, up 1% on 2012.But the government said there were differences between areas and some councils were poor at tracking what many teenagers of this age group were doing.</body>

      <description>Ofsted inspectors have strongly criticised the standards of education and training in England's prisons.</description>

      <body>Ofsted inspectors have strongly criticised standards of education and training in England's prisons.The watchdog says it is unacceptable that not one prison has been rated "outstanding" for education in the past four years and only one in three is rated "good".At Wormwood Scrubs jail in London, Ofsted chiefs said if the figures related to schools there would be a "national outcry".Ministers say reforms are under way.In a speech at the prison, Matthew Coffey, national director of further education and skills at Ofsted, said the aim of training and education in jail should be to make people less likely to go back to crime when they got out."This year's annual lecture aims to focus on how we can reduce the high re-offending rates that are nearly 50% for adult prisoners and 72% for juveniles," he said."The aim is to reduce the number of re-offenders by focusing on rehabilitation in prisons through better employer engagement and better teaching and training."Levels of education among prisoners are generally much lower than in the population as a whole.Some studies suggest half of men in UK jails and nearly three-quarters of female prisoners have no qualifications at all, while about half have literacy skills below that of most eleven-year-olds. Many have been expelled from school.Mr Coffey said: "Far too many prisoners leave prison without employability skills, meaning they are less likely to find a job. Research shows that being in employment is one of the key factors that can reduce the risk of re-offending by between 30% and 50%. However, examples of good training provision in prisons were all too scarce."Clearly, reducing the number of those re-offending is in everyone's interests. Every prisoner costs the taxpayer the same as sending a child to Eton, around £34,000 per year. We must now focus on improvement of prisoners' vocational and employability skills to ensure we support them on their journey out of prison and into employment to break the cycle of re-offending."He added that there were "outstanding examples" of prisons working with employers, education providers and other bodies to help prisoners develop vocational skills, but that those examples, were "all too scarce".Education in prisons in England and Wales is provided by private bodies which bid for contracts.Prisons Minister Jeremy Wright said: "Re-offending rates have been too high for too long and we are introducing significant reforms to the way offenders are rehabilitated and managed in the community."We are committed to improving education in prison and are working with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Skills Funding Agency to develop prisoner learning."In most countries in the European Union, only about one in four adult prisoners takes part in education, according to a report for the EU published earlier this year, out of 640,000 inmates.In England and Wales, the proportion is higher, with an estimated 42% receiving some kind of prison education, which has to be provided by law.The EU report said prisons were all too often "environments for negative learning" when they could be offering people a second chance.According to the University and College Union, which represents many prison teachers and trainers, the "constant re-tendering" for education contracts brings problems, including a high turnover of staff and instability.They say because providers are paid by results, some teachers feel under pressure to limit courses to certain offenders and those in for longer terms.</body>

      <body>A head teacher whose appointment to a new free school was criticised has quit her post weeks after starting.Pimlico Primary, which opened in September, said Annaliese Briggs, 27, had left the job to "pursue other opportunities in primary education".Miss Briggs was appointed in April as the head while still studying for her postgraduate certificate in education.Labour councillors in Westminster said governors may be regretting appointing someone with "no teaching experience".The primary school opened at the site of Pimlico Academy in Lupus Street, central London, with 60 pupils and aims to have 420 pupils by 2019.Pimlico Primary is sponsored by Future Academies, a charity founded by Lord Nash and his wife Caroline.A statement from Pimlico Primary said: "Having successfully set up Pimlico Primary, Annaliese Briggs has decided to leave Future Academies to pursue other opportunities in primary education."A new principal of Pimlico Primary has been appointed. Coming from within the group, our new principal is already known to the pupils and families of Pimlico Primary, and brings over 10 years' experience in both early years and leadership."We are delighted that Annaliese will continue to support Pimlico Primary as it grows by becoming a governor."Miss Briggs is completing a school-centred initial teacher training (SCITT) course in Wandsworth and will qualify with a postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE).She previously said she has classroom experience from teaching primary school children in supplementary schools and had been chosen to lead the school for her curriculum expertise.Reacting to the news that Miss Briggs has stepped down, leader of the Labour group at Westminster Council Councillor Paul Dimoldenberg said: "Being the head of an inner-London school is a tough job which can sometimes be very stressful."By appointing someone with no teaching experience or experience in running a school, the Pimlico academy governors might now consider that this is a decision they now regret."I hope that Ms Briggs' commitment to education is undiminished and wish her well in her future career."The Department for Education said it was a matter for the school.</body>

      <description>Training teachers to deliver classes in body image improves the self-esteem of teenage girls, a UK study shows.</description>

      <body>The self-esteem of teenage girls could be improved by training teachers to deliver classes in body image, a UK study shows.In the pilot study, 261 teenage girls at three secondary schools were given a course of six lessons on body image.This had significant effects on their body image and self-esteem compared with the regular curriculum, say psychologists at King's College London.As many as one in three teenagers say they are dissatisfied with their body.Poor body image has been associated with depression, eating disorders, overuse of cosmetic surgery, obesity and unhealthy weight loss behaviours.Dr Helen Sharpe and colleagues at the Institute of Psychiatry developed a course on positive body image for teenage girls.The six-part programme focused on ideals of beauty, unhealthy interactions with peers - such as "fat talking", or making negative comments about weight - and practical measures for boosting mood and self-esteem.The course was delivered by teachers in three state-funded girls' schools.Dr Sharpe told the BBC: "We have tested whether a series of lessons being delivered by teachers to students in school are helpful in improving body esteem - we found this was the case."She said the research, published in The British Journal of Psychiatry, showed promise in being able to tackle problems caused by low body esteem, such as eating disorders."We're hopeful that as we continue with this research we'll be able to make the programme even more effective and that it could then go on to be effective in reducing disordered eating - things like binge eating and unhelpful weight loss," said Dr Sharpe.Interventions delivered by teachers would have wide reach and be of minimal cost, said the researchers.Some schools were relying on programmes that were not evidence-based and could be harmful, they added.Last year, MPs recommended that all schoolchildren should take part in compulsory body image and self-esteem lessons.An inquiry by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Body Image heard evidence that more than half of the public had a negative body image.Girls as young as five now worried about how they looked, the MPs' report said, while cosmetic surgery rates had increased by nearly 20% since 2008.</body>

      <description>Some children are not being given enough food at a county's schools leading them to snack and lose concentration in lessons, an assembly member warns.</description>

      <body>Some pupils are not being given enough food at Powys primary schools causing them to snack and lose concentration in lessons, an assembly member has warned.Montgomeryshire AM Russell George said parents and governors had told him 11-year-olds were being given the same portion sizes as four-year-olds.He claimed second helpings had also been banned and he intended to raise the issue with Powys council's leader.The authority said its meals met Welsh government requirements.Mr George said the issue was brought to his attention by a number of people across the county who he said felt the "extreme" school meals policy was leading to more snacking and bad dietary choices.He said the policy dictated that all primary school children received the same portion of food, regardless of age.And he said he had been told that second helpings of lunch had been stopped as the council tried to reduce waste."Parents are telling me that their children are coming home hungry, which then causes them to snack before their evening meal, all of which isn't lending itself to children leading healthy lifestyles," said the Conservative AM."Children of 10 and 11 years of age are clearly going to require different levels of nutrition to those of four and five-year-olds... this isn't rocket science."One chair of governors at a primary school in the county claimed more parents were switching their children to packed lunches because they no longer felt the school meals were offering value for money.He said he became concerned after noticing his own 10-year-old son was coming home from school hungry and that a number of other parents had raised the issue with him."I then raised it at a governor's meeting and was told that catering staff had been told that as of the start of this term additional food was not to be given," he said."I have spoken to the principal catering officer at the council and he said the rationale behind this was that he felt some schools were over-producing food."Also I think the thought is that by giving children seconds they're not going to have the balanced meal they should be getting."But what follows from that is that if you get wastage down to zero you have pupils going hungry as the portion sizes are the same for four to 11-year-olds."He said teachers were concerned that it was leading to poorer concentration from some pupils."The council's saying that all the pupils should get the same portion sizes as everyone pays the same but I think it's leading to some parents feeling that they are no longer getting value for money and are giving their children packed lunches instead," he added.A spokesperson for Powys council said dishes on school menus met the requirements of the Welsh government's Appetite for Life scheme, which aims to improve the nutritional standards of food and drink served in schools across Wales."As part of this scheme, there are recommended guidelines regarding the size of the portions. These portions have been analysed to ensure they meet the nutritional standards set out in the scheme," the spokesperson said."When planning school meals, the number of pupils who have school meals is always taken into consideration to ensure that school cooks do not over produce food and remain within their budgets."However, there will always be cases where food is left on the servery as pupils can choose whether they want a particular food on a school menu."If there is food left over, we have now advised school cooks to give out second helpings if there are pupils who want it."But we cannot overproduce food so that second helpings can be provided as this has a cost implication and also second portions are not taken into consideration when the menus are nutritionally analysed."A Welsh government spokesperson said: "We would never want to see children having school meals going hungry."We've given primary schools guidance on portion sizes which cater for changing nutritional requirements as children get older. So a child in year six would have a larger portion than a child in reception."</body>

      <description>A lack of regulation of England's universities means students are at risk of attending failing institutions, the Higher Education Commission says.</description>

      <body>A lack of regulation of England's universities means students are at risk of attending failing institutions, the Higher Education Commission (HEC) says.The HEC says current checks are not adequate for a sector that has a new funding system in the wake of higher tuition fees introduced last year.It says the situation could threaten the UK's higher education reputation.The government says a "robust but proportionate" regulatory system is needed.The HEC - an independent body made up of leaders from the education sector, business and the three main political parties - conducted its research over an eight-month period and concludes that current regulation is too "piecemeal".The commission says that the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce), which distributes the teaching grant to universities, was previously able to attach regulatory conditions to the grant.But now that the teaching grant has been reduced and is being replaced with increased student tuition fees since 2012, the ability to regulate universities through Hefce has been reduced in turn.Its report - Regulating Higher Education - says all degree providers in England should be "captured" by proper regulation.It says: "It [higher education] is a valuable part of our national infrastructure and we must therefore ensure that students investing thousands of pounds in their futures are receiving top quality provision, and that the institutions they are attending are financially viable."The HEC study expresses particular concern about newly established higher education providers, saying "more providers are entering the market... and online providers gaining traction"."Regulation as it sits is not adequately prepared for the diversity of these current and future developments."New market entrants are not facing the scrutiny they should, takeovers and complex corporate structures are being used to evade fundamental protections for students, and institutions are facing more pressure than ever to recruit students and crucially, therefore, bring in funding."The report continues: "In this new, reformed higher education landscape, the chances of an institution failing are increased. An institution failing would damage both students and the highly-valued brand of UK higher education."The HEC calls on the government for urgent legislation to tackle the problems.It suggests an overarching regulatory body - the Council for Higher Education (CHE) - should be created, incorporating the current body Hefce, the Office for Fair Access (Offa), the Student Loans Company and a new body called the Office for Competition and Institutional Diversity.The commission also calls for better information about the various degree providers now operating in the UK and says all of these should be subject to a new regulatory framework, with kitemarks for those meeting approved standards.It also proposes an insurance scheme, paid into by every institution, to safeguard students should an institution or course fail.Professor of government at Hull University and HEC inquiry co-chairman Lord Norton of Louth said: "Regulation is fundamental to the health and success of our HE sector and will make or break the effectiveness of the institutions that have made the UK a world leader in higher education."In the context of current reforms, the absence of legislation to provide a coherent regulatory architecture for the rapidly changing and increasingly dynamic sector is creating major headaches for its players."It is a situation crying out for urgent rectification by government, a refrain that was a constant throughout the course of the inquiry from those who gave evidence."Fellow co-chairman and former vice chancellor of Lincoln University Prof Roger King said: "Our proposals seek to build upon the existing regulatory strengths displayed by the sector and to ensure that more external and formalised external regulatory arrangements work with these."Above all, however, we need to urgently address the outstanding requirement for a more systematic and less piecemeal approach to the external regulation of the sector. This can only be achieved by early legislation by government."A spokeswoman for the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills said: "It is essential that there is a robust but proportionate regulatory system in place to protect students and the reputation of the wider sector."At the same time though a balance must be struck to protect institutional autonomy and academic freedom. These elements are key to the success of our university system."When the time comes for legislation we want to get it absolutely right."Prof Les Ebdon, director of Offa, said: "I believe that fair access is too important to be rolled up within the wider concerns of a multi-focused regulatory body."An independent director, with a sole focus on access, can challenge institutions to set themselves stretching widening participation targets and ensure that fair access remains high on the agenda, both for institutions and policy-makers."</body>

      <description>Oxford University's vice-chancellor questions the long-term sustainability of the £9,000 fixed upper limit for tuition fees.</description>

      <body>Oxford University's vice-chancellor has questioned the long-term sustainability of the £9,000 fixed upper limit for tuition fees.Andrew Hamilton told a university gathering the real cost of an Oxford undergraduate course was £16,000.He asked how a "market" in higher education could operate if everything "regardless of content and quality, is the same price".The university faced an annual funding gap of £70m, said Prof Hamilton.He argued that different types of institutions should be able to charge different levels of fees."Given the great diversity of the institutions in our higher education system, the notion of different universities charging significantly different amounts, doesn't feel inherently unnatural."It is the current situation that seems out of kilter. What matters surely is that an institution's charges are clearly aligned with what it offers and that they are demonstrably not a barrier to student access."A university spokesman said that the speech was not proposing that students would have to pay fees of £16,000 per year to bridge the shortfall.But Prof Hamilton suggested a "system of tuition charges more closely related to the true cost", with the "strongest guarantees" of support for poorer students.Prof Hamilton argued that there needed to be a more sustainable funding model for universities where £9,000 did not cover their costs.He had heard that some universities were "doing very nicely thank you" with fees of £9,000."That may or may not be the case for them, but one thing I am quite sure about is that it doesn't add up for Oxford, where the new regime of increased tuition charges for students, but greatly reduced government spending on teaching, have done little to change the basic financial equation."Along with ideas such as increasing philanthropic donations, he floated the idea of raising funds through issuing bonds to investors.The raising of tuition fees to £9,000 was a highly controversial measure, prompting violent protests and occupations, in the biggest upsurge of student activism for decades.Academics at the University of Oxford passed a symbolic motion of no confidence in Universities Minister David Willetts and his higher education funding reforms.But with the funding changes in place, the speech on Tuesday by Prof Hamilton shows there are still far-reaching financial questions for such leading institutions.How can they compete on an international stage with better-funded rivals?Harvard University's financial figures, released last month, showed the US university has an endowment that has grown to $32.7bn (£20.3bn).A fundraising drive by Harvard, launched last month, aims to raise an additional $6.5bn (£4bn).Last year, Oxford hailed the donation of £75m as "the largest such benefaction for undergraduate financial support in European university history".Responding to the speech, Sally Hunt, general secretary of the UCU lecturers' union said: "Prof Hamilton should perhaps be applauded for going after one of the rawest nerves in politics to try and get higher education funding back in the spotlight - something we fear no party will be keen to do this side of the general election."However, higher university fees are not what this country needs."Prof Hamilton is correct to say our universities need more funding - we invest just 1.4% of GDP on higher education, compared to an international average of 1.7%."However, he is wrong to argue that students should pick up tab when we already have the most expensive fees in Europe."</body>

      <description>The tough struggle to modernise Kurdistan's education system</description>

      <body>Prof Dlawer Ala'Aldeen had tomatoes, stones and apples thrown at him. He faced countless demonstrations.The reason for this hostility, facing the microbiologist from the University of Nottingham, was his controversial attempt to reform the university system in his birthplace of Kurdistan.Prof Ala'Aldeen was the architect of plans to improve the quality and to internationalise higher education in Iraqi Kurdistan.He says he was up against "deeply entrenched interests, people, institutions and long stagnant cultures".The region, autonomous for two decades in the wake of the Gulf War, had inherited a post-Saddam university system that Prof Ala'Aldeen has described as "grossly outdated" and designed for a closed, centralised country.In 2009 Prof Ala'Aldeen was given a secondment away from his job as professor of clinical microbiology at Nottingham University in the UK.He stepped from academic life in the English midlands into the role of Kurdistan's higher education minister, a post he held until last year.Prime Minister Barham Salih, a good friend, chose him for his knowledge of the higher education system and the series of critical articles on education and governance he had written in the years up to his appointment.Barham Salih's election manifesto had included significant support for higher education and training to support Kurdistan's large population of under 20 year olds.There were already plans for more scholarships to send talented students to study overseas.Within a week of being appointed, Prof Ala'Aldeen had written up a radical vision document and it was quickly endorsed by the cabinet.Higher education in Kurdistan was suffering a major crisis of quality, capacity and infrastructure.There was a consensus in support of reform and it helped that Prof Ala'Aldeen had been very critical of the government in the past.The reforms, which planned to improve the quality and accreditation of university teachers, brought considerable opposition from student and teacher organisations as well as businesses linked with the burgeoning market in private universities.Several new private universities were threatened with closure, much to the anger of their staff and prospective students who had paid fees for their courses."Many teachers had been licensed prematurely. There were 11 private universities when I started with 18 more waiting to be opened. These mushrooming private colleges were relying on the same pool of resources as the public universities which lacked staff and facilities," Prof Ala'Aldeen says.The problem of staffing was particularly acute in medicine, pharmacy and dentistry and in postgraduate studies.But Prof Ala'Aldeen faced protests and opposition.He was accused of trying to transplant the UK system onto Kurdistan, something he vehemently denies since he was educated and worked in his home region, before coming to study in the UK."I knew the system from the inside and studied what had happened in similar countries. I wanted to apply international principles of quality, but tailor-made to Kurdish traditions," he says.He responded by redoubling his efforts to communicate the purpose of the reforms, which also included curriculum development, moving beyond a single teacher delivering a lecture to a class, the introduction of an electronic admissions system and reforming the teaching of PhDs.In the end, the government closed three private universities as well as five health-related colleges, three pharmacy colleges and two dentistry ones."If we had allowed the system to keep evolving as it was it would have taken at least a generation to fix it - a generation would have been wasted. We knew we had to act fast. It was a risky policy, but it would have been far riskier to do nothing," he says.The speed of his action was criticised as were aspects of the efforts to improve teaching standards, such as student feedback being used to measure teacher performance and pay. There was also opposition to teachers being asked to engage in professional development once a week.Prof Brendan O'Leary, director of the programme in ethnic conflict at the University of Pennsylvania, says that a longer process might have worked better.But he says it was against a background when unprecedented changes were happening in Kurdish society as the region opened up to foreign investment."The Kurdistan region is going through a difficult and fast-paced transformation."Ideally a long and rich discussion is needed to agree new institutional conditions to enable higher education to flourish in a region emerging from decades of destruction, war, genocide, internal fighting, academic isolation and lack of resources."University and institutional reforms are more likely to succeed if all the stakeholders have clear ideas on what to do, when, and at what pace. One should not be surprised if people with vested interests fear reforms," said Prof O'Leary.Thomas Hill, assistant professor at New York University Center for Global Affairs, adds: "I do not believe there is consensus even now that the reforms the former minister wanted to implement would have been in the best interest of the Kurdistan region."There are many, many people with very conservative views within the higher education sector in the Kurdistan region and many did not and do not like the progressive path the former minister was plotting."There were areas in which vested interests remained unmoved. Prof Ala'Aldeen could not increase the independence of universities.The government continues to choose university leaders and universities have been totally dependent on government funding.Prof Ala'Aldeen put together draft legislation on institutional autonomy, but says the challenge to the status quo was too great to push it through.He is in close touch with the current government and is pleased that the reforms to improve quality have been maintained, despite the fact that there is still not consensus in favour of them, and says the scholarship programme is already making a difference."Almost 3,000 students have studied abroad, the majority in the UK. Half of these are or will be back by the end of this year. They will provide leadership and bring a breath of fresh air. They will link their institutions to the outside world and break Kurdistan's academic isolation."Although Kurdistan has its own particular circumstances, Prof Ala'Aldeen says that the problems facing the university system are not unique - and that the model for modernisation could be applied elsewhere in the Middle East."The problems are generic and the solutions can be implemented anywhere in the world."Commentators on Kurdistan's politics agree. Prof O'Leary says: "The Kurdistan region, Iraq and several other states in the Middle East are going through dramatic changes, and in some cases, deeply regrettable authoritarian restorations."Most institutions are highly politicised in these societies. If the Kurdistan region can successfully reform its education system, including higher education, it can provide a model for the wider Middle East."</body>

      <title>Harvard plans to boldly go with 'Spocs'</title>
      <description>Harvard develops the next big thing for online learning. Is this the real deal?</description>

      <body>Keep up, keep up. If you've only just caught on to the concept of online university courses called Moocs, then you're in danger of falling behind again.Harvard, one of the world's most influential universities, is moving on to Spocs - which stands for small private online courses. Nothing to do with Star Trek and sombre Vulcans, but plenty to do with ambitions "to boldly go".And could these be the real deal? The academic chairing Harvard's online experiments says we are already "post-Mooc".Moocs - massive open online courses - have been something of a hurricane in universities, making a lot of noise and promising to rip everything up.Pioneered by some of the most prestigious US universities, they have been re-packaging course units into online lessons and making them available to anyone with an internet connection.But it's still not clear whether this is a passing storm or something that will fundamentally change how higher education is delivered.Last week the UK joined the fray, with more than 20 universities launching an online platform called FutureLearn, which will challenge the dominant players on the east and west US coasts.The biggest success for online courses and their greatest problem are the same - the huge numbers attracted.It demonstrates the scale of the unmet demand for higher education, but at the same time it's not clear how tens of thousands of students on a course could ever satisfactorily be taught, assessed and accredited. Most of these signs-up will sign off without completing courses.At Harvard, more people have signed up for Moocs in a single year than have attended the university in its entire 377-year history. That's a great success story in opening up education, but what do you do with all those hungry minds?Enter the Spoc. And the clue is in the "small, private" part of the name. These courses are still free and delivered through the internet, but access is restricted to much smaller numbers, tens or hundreds, rather than tens of thousands.It means a selection process for applicants and the capacity for a more customised experience. Looking further down the track, it wouldn't be difficult to imagine fees and course credits.Harvard and University of California, Berkeley, part of the edX online alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are among the universities beginning to experiment with this more refined model.Next week a popular and highly topical course in US national security strategy will begin at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Alongside the campus students in Cambridge, Massachusetts, there will be a parallel Spoc version with a limit of about 500 online students.Students wanting to get into this online classroom have to submit a written assignment about the US government's response to the conflict in Syria, along with details of their academic credentials.Even though this online course won't have a formal academic credit at the end, it's going to require eight hours of work a week and a capacity to tackle questions about "Iran's nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria's civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information".These Spoc students might include Harvard students who couldn't get into the campus course, alongside those who might be studying from home or at work.Harvard isn't abandoning Moocs, but rather like Russian dolls sitting inside each other, a single course might now be delivered to a large open Mooc audience, to a much smaller number of Spoc students and then down to an even smaller number enrolled at the bricks-and-mortar campus.It's taking the limited and expensive resource of a Harvard course and amplifying it for widening rings of audiences.Prof Robert Lue chairs the committee of academics that runs Harvard's online experiments, under the banner of HarvardX.He describes the current online learning experiments as a "remarkable moment of possibility".And he sees the move towards more flexible and refined formats such as Spocs as an "almost inevitable evolution"."The Mooc represents just the first version of what we can do with online education," says Prof Lue. And this first version has now been overtaken. "We're already in a post-Mooc era.""What has become very clear is that the engagement you get from a very large group with a wide-ranging set of priorities can be radically different from what you get from a more focused group," says Prof Lue.It also paves the way to tackling one of the biggest problems for Moocs. How can they provide formally-recognised qualifications?The smaller class size will allow "much more rigorous assessment and greater validation of identity and that will be more closely tied to what kind of certification might be possible," he says."It's safe to say that in the quite near term there will be announcements of experiments in this area."There are voices of caution about over-hyped expectations for online learning.A report published last week by the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggested there remained many uncertainties over Moocs.The lack of a clear business model was described as a "burning issue".The edX project is in the fortunate position of being given $60m by Harvard and MIT, but few universities have the resources to give away so much expensively-produced content and staff time.Prof Lue suggests that the really tough questions raised by Moocs are not only about online learning but about what it means for the rest of the traditional campus."What is it that a student gets out of being on campus and being in the classroom?"If students on campus prefer learning online, what does it mean for the funding model for universities? What happens if a recorded online lecture is preferable to a mediocre live talk? How do universities show their "added value"?Prof Lue argues that the significance of Spocs is that online learning is now moving beyond trying to replicate classroom courses and is trying to produce something that is more flexible and more effective.Universities that ignore such developments, or think that Moocs can just be showreels for conventional courses, are putting themselves at risk, he suggests."The really big questions for university are about what students get from the classroom, what works, what could be done better.""Institutions that sit back and watch, they may be in trouble. One can imagine a large institution where there isn't much difference between online and classroom - and then you'd be silly not to realise there's a problem."</body>

      <body>The UK's biggest online university project has been launched, with more than 20 universities offering free courses.Students will be able to follow courses on mobile phones as well as computers.The UK's project, called FutureLearn, sees UK universities entering the global market in so-called Moocs - massive open online courses.It could "revolutionise conventional models of formal education", says universities minister David Willetts.Mr Willetts, speaking at the British Library, said that the expansion of access to higher education was no longer necessarily about "bricks and mortar".He said that the FutureLearn partnership would help to serve the unmet demand for university courses, particularly overseas.The launch of FutureLearn sees 21 UK universities, plus Trinity College Dublin and Monash University in Australia, offering courses that are taught and assessed on the internet.The UK universities include Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham, Warwick, Bristol, Reading, Southampton and the Open University, which has headed the project.The British Library, British Museum and British Council will make material available to students.There are 20 short courses announced, with eight starting this year.In this experimental phase, students taking these courses will carry out multiple choice questions, without any formal qualifications.But universities are hoping that many people will be attracted by the chance to follow university-level courses without any travel or cost and at a time that suits them.It will also provide taster courses for youngsters considering their university options.When the University of Edinburgh offered Moocs through a US network it had more than 300,000 students signing up. The University of London international programme had more than 200,000 registrations.FutureLearn will see the UK taking a much bigger step into the rapidly expanding online university market - with claims that higher education is now facing its own online revolution.They are anticipating that each Mooc course will attract 20,000 students.Universities also see the project as a way of recruiting students to degree courses. Martin Bean, vice chancellor of the Open University, described it as a "digital storefront".But Mr Bean says he expects some universities to begin thinking about how to offer formal credits for Moocs.Reading University is going to offer a Mooc course about basic computer programming."Offering free taster courses online is a no-brainer," says David Bell, the university's vice-chancellor."Universities shouldn't be afraid to open up teaching and research, either in the UK or beyond. Learning never stops and as the economy's demand for higher skills rises, universities should be in the vanguard when it comes to providing new opportunities."Making courses accessible online, on mobiles and tablets means that people can fit their studying around their lives, rather than their lives around study."Southampton University is offering a course in web science, Leicester University's course looks at England at the time of Richard III and the University of Warwick has a psychology course.FutureLearn's chief executive Simon Nelson says it will offer a "fresh approach" with all its courses designed to work across all kinds of online platforms, so that a student could begin a course on a laptop at home and then continue on a mobile phone while commuting.He also promises a less isolated experience for students learning at home. He says that it can be a "solitary experience", but that FutureLearn will try to create a supportive online community, with "very strong social architecture".This will allow students to discuss their courses and ask questions, using social networking-style comment pages alongside the lesson content.This consortium will also draw upon the experience in distance learning of the Open University."Time and again we have seen the disruptive impact the internet can have on industries - driving innovation and enhancing the customer experience. I have no doubt Moocs will do the same for education," says Mr Bean.There were also suggestions from the Department for Education last week that Moocs could be used for vocational courses for students in further education colleges and sixth forms in England.Moocs have already had a major impact in the US, launching last year and spearheaded by alliances of top institutions, including Harvard, MIT and Stanford.Coursera, set up by Stanford academics in California and backed by venture capital, has signed up more than four million students in its first 18 months for courses provided by more than 80 universities.These projects have revealed a high level of demand for courses, but also exposed the difficulty in retaining students, with very high levels of drop-out rates.It has sparked a debate about the cost of higher education and what students are paying for when so much information and so many high-quality university materials are available online.These US online courses have begun to develop ways of giving students formal credits, such as students paying to take invigilated exams.Among the Mooc pioneers has been the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which set up the edX online platform with Harvard.On Tuesday, MIT announced a series of new online courses which will have an identity verification system using webcams and with plans for certification for courses.But there have also been questions asked about the long-term financial viability of online university courses.Last week, William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, challenged whether many universities could afford to invest in the type of free online courses offered by wealthy institutions such as Harvard and MIT.He suggested that online courses might work better as part of a "blended" course, where students spend some time together in the classroom as well as studying online.Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said that online universities represented an overdue technological advance."The models of higher education that marched triumphantly across the globe in the second half of the 20th Century require radical and urgent transformation. My fear is that the nature of change is incremental and the pace of change too slow."The establishment of FutureLearn represents an important step in realising this change and seizing the opportunities technology offers in creating a broader, deeper and more exciting education system."Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: "I encourage all our institutions to explore the opportunities offered by new modes of technology, such as Moocs. This will keep the UK ahead in the global race to deliver education in worldwide markets."</body>

      <title>Gordon Brown's Syrian refugee school plan</title>
      <description>Syria's refugee crisis is also threatening to become a long-term education disaster.</description>

      <body>Syria's refugee crisis is threatening to become a long-term education disaster. There will soon be 500,000 refugee children in Lebanon, with few having access to school. But Gordon Brown, former UK prime minister and UN special envoy for global education, says that lessons could be in place in weeks."A few days ago, global education campaigner Malala Yousafzai was able to speak over Skype to Zahra and Om Kolhtoum Katou, teenage Syrian twins exiled in Baalbeck in East Lebanon.As they talked, the three girls realised that they shared something in common. All three are victims of violence that threatened to destroy their youth and their future, and all three cannot do what most other girls and boys do every morning: leave the home in which they grew up and go to school.Now there is a plan that could help the biggest single group of Syrian child refugees - 300,000 of those exiled to Lebanon - which could see them in school and being fed within weeks.It has been prepared by Kevin Watkins of the Overseas Development Institute for the charity, A World at School, which campaigns to get an education for the millions of children without access to school.But this plan can only be put into practice - and this seems unlikely today - if the international community, which is financing just 2% of schooling needs in humanitarian crises, offers an additional $500m (£319m).The plan involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double or even triple shift system; hiring Syrian refugees as teachers in Arabic in community colleges; providing school meals to tackle hunger as we tackle illiteracy.This strategy is also rooted in the realistic presumption that the plight of the Syrian children is more than a short-term emergency: their exile could last years. It has the active support of the Lebanese government, but it is an open question as to whether the world community will put up the funds.Children are always the most neglected and forgotten victims of conflict. Already deprived of food and shelter, boys and girls are also denied their right to education, condemned to forfeit a childhood that, once lost, can never be re-run or re-lived.The one million Syrian children, who make up half of that country's refugees, are simply the most recent victims of this monumental gap in our global system. They are among 28 million children worldwide now being denied their right to schooling in conflict zones and under broken-down regimes.Soon small, unstable Lebanon will have absorbed 500,000 Syrian boys and girls. Already in just a few months, the refugees have grown in number to an astonishing 25% of Lebanon's child population.But today, and for the foreseeable future, there are school places for only a small fraction of them - just 30,000. If they suffer the typical exile of children in conflict they could spend 10 years in camps and without schooling.The traumas engulfing Syrian children underscores an enduring global failure. One hundred years ago, through support for the Red Cross, the world decided it would meet people's basic health needs, even in theatres of war.Forty years ago Médecins Sans Frontières established that healthcare should be available across the most dangerous and violent of war zones.Today, the concept of "Education Without Borders" still remains an unfamiliar idea, a concept yet to be built into our system of humanitarian relief.Yet the cost of inaction for young people deprived of an education, destroyed by anger, restlessness, and desperation and sentenced to tents and camps often for years, will haunt us for generations.Because these millions of young unemployed will become the adult unemployable, and many will graduate not into jobs but into violence.On 23 September in New York, organisations that have for years fought valiantly to deliver education in emergencies will build on pioneering work by UNICEF, UNHCR, UN Refugees and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) to bring to life the Education Without Borders initiative for Lebanon's Syrian refugees.In New York, young people from conflict zones around the world, joined by Malala and backed up by a petition presented to the UN Secretary General, will lead an appeal for funds.It will show that while we cannot do everything we can do something, that hope can survive even amid horror and that good can yet triumph over the worst evils, even in the most troubled and desperate parts of the world."</body>

      <title>Zombie apocalypse: The future of universities?</title>
      <description>A US university is going to create an online course based on the TV drama the Walking Dead.</description>

      <body>Can zombies be the stuff of serious academic study? And could they be shuffling towards a new type of future for higher education?In what is being claimed as the biggest ever experiment in "edutainment", a US television company is forming a partnership with a top-ranking Californian university to produce online courses linked to a hit TV show.This blurring of the digital boundaries between academic study and the entertainment industry will see a course being launched next month based on the post-apocalypse drama series the Walking Dead.Television shows might have spin-off video games or merchandising, but this drama about surviving disaster and social collapse is now going to have its own university course.Academics from the University of California, Irvine, who are setting up the online courses, say these will be academically rigorous and tackle serious scientific issues, related to events in the show.A physicist will look at the "science behind decay"; the public health department will use the series to study questions such as "What can we learn from past epidemics?" and maths lecturers will show how "post-calculus maths can be used to model population and epidemic dynamics".Showbiz lessonsThe show is made by AMC, which also produced cult series such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Killing, and AMC vice-president Theresa Beyer says this showbiz-academic partnership will create a "legitimate educational experience".She says AMC will be the "first entertainment group to make the foray into the online education arena" and wants the course to "drive a deep, sustained connection with the show".The TV series has an audience of 10 million and student numbers for the online course are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands. If this experiment proves successful, the online platform provider, Instructure, suggests there could be further TV show and university hybrids.It's not difficult to imagine an advertising course being built around a series such as Mad Men, suggests Josh Coates, Instructure's chief executive.This partnership also marks another development in the rapidly-expanding world of MOOCs - the massive open online courses - an acronym sufficiently established to have made it into the Oxford online dictionary last week.Millions of students have signed up for online courses in the past year, suggesting the scale of demand for higher education.And millions of students have failed to complete those courses suggesting the scale of the challenge of online learning.Dumbing down?This eight-module course will begin in mid-October and will be accessible without charge to anyone with an internet connection.There will be online tests and discussion groups, but students taking the course will not get any formal qualifications or credits towards a degree, so it's going to be for students who want to follow the course in their own time.But isn't there a risk of dumbing down? The University of California, Irvine, has Nobel prize-winning researchers, it contributes $4.3bn (£2.77bn; 3.3bn euro) to the local economy, does it want to have zombies on its prospectus?"When we entered this partnership it was really important to make each of the modules as academically strong as they would be in our classes at UC Irvine," says Melissa Loble, associate dean of distance learning at the university."The lessons will be academically rigorous and rich and still have connections to the show."Joanne Christopherson, social science lecturer, says that it's taking another step forward from how universities already use contemporary media examples."In all of my classes I have to bring in current issues to keep it interesting. Not just because they're young adults coming out of high school, but because it's important to make these classic theories relevant to them. What we're doing is using this series as an example through the whole course."Apocalypse studiesJosh Coates, head of Instructure, which provides the Canvas online platform, says it will present science and social science issues, using the hook of a TV show."This is real curriculum about infectious diseases, public health, nutrition, psychology and sociology. The fact that the context is this fictional world of an apocalypse is incidental.""This is very topical. We have terrorist attacks, we have Katrina, Fukushima, all these things happen in our world today, which create small vignettes of a local apocalypse. This is an opportunity to educate people about the science of these disasters."Mr Coates says a significant part of this experiment will be to see if it can crack one of the biggest weaknesses of MOOCs, the high drop-out rate. Will the pulling power of television keep people switched on to learning?"Can we get more students through because it's linked to a TV show they really like?" he says.He describes the link between the university and the TV industry as the "cross-pollination" that comes with the internet."The internet tears down walls of tradition and the isolation of different areas of research and interest," he says.Personal learningFor the university, it's a shop window putting their brand in front of a global audience. It also allows them to refine the process of putting courses online."The first MOOCs had great videos and great quizzes, but didn't help students really interact with one another," says Melissa Loble."The next step for MOOCs is to figure how to make them personal without it being overwhelming for the institution trying to deliver that."These are the type of practical questions that come with the huge numbers of online students.Dr Christopherson says that scale of the demand for MOOCs has been a "wake-up call" for universities.But it remains a challenge to provide an online structure that can allow so many students to follow a course without feeling anonymous and disconnected.William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, says there also remains a longer term question about the funding model for MOOCs.And he suggests that universities which have begun to invest in them might become wary at the extent of the drop-out rate.They might work better as part of a "blended" course, where there is a taught, classroom element as well as online study, he says.Spoiler alertAlan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, also has reservations about the value of TV-related online courses.Without formal assessment and personal content, he says it remains to be seen how this delivers more than a good television documentary."The student must be able to sift the evidence."For genuine learning, personal contact really matters," he says.Prof Smithers says such links with a popular TV show might work as a way of attracting students, but the academic element needs to outweigh the entertainment.But don't expect the march of the MOOCs to stop any time soon. And Mr Coates says he wants people to look back at the Walking Dead course as a watershed when education and entertainment connected.With the online course available globally and when different series are being shown at different stages in different countries, this could also be the first university course that has to come with its own spoiler alert.</body>

      <body>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most likely place to have studied.The Times Higher Education magazine ranked the universities attended by chief executive officers of Fortune Global 500 companies.There are four US universities in the top 10, with three from France, two from Japan and one from South Korea.The highest ranked UK university is Oxford in 21st place.This league table, described as the Alma Mater Index, shows which universities around the world taught the bosses of some of the world's biggest companies.One in 20 had a degree from a single institution, Harvard.This included Margaret C Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Jeffrey R Immelt of General Electric and Vittorio Colao of Vodafone.This academic powerhouse regularly appears at the top of university league tables, including the rich list, with an endowment worth $31bn (£20bn' 23.5bn euro).But the top 10 for producing business leaders does not contain all the usual names that appear at the top of university rankings.Oxford and Cambridge are absent, but the University of Pennsylvania in the US and Keio University in Japan are included, along with three French universities, headed by the Ecole Polytechnique.It means that in this top 10 cradles of global CEOs, there are two institutions from Paris, two from the Boston area and two from Tokyo.Across the top 100, universities from the US dominate, followed by universities in China, Japan, France and Germany. There are more CEOs who went to university in Asia than in Europe.In terms of national comparisons, UK universities produced the sixth highest number of global chief executives, with Oxford in 21st place and Cambridge in 45th place.But even though Harvard might have taught the biggest number of bosses from the top 500 companies, it was not attended by any of the heads of the biggest 10 companies, who were from a more diverse range of universities.Royal Dutch Shell is headed by a graduate of Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Wal-Mart is headed by a student of Georgia Tech and Exxon Mobil has a chief executive from the University of Texas, Austin.Three of the leaders of these biggest companies went to university in China and the head of Volkswagen went to university in Stuttgart.</body>

      <title>The scientists who escaped the Nazis</title>
      <description>A first-hand memory of the scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany</description>

      <body>When Gustav Born's family were advised in early 1933 that it was time to leave Nazi-controlled Germany, it was from a good authority.The advice was from Albert Einstein, who told his friend and fellow scientist Max Born to "leave immediately" with his family while they were still able to travel.They packed their bags and headed across the border, first to Italy and then to England, where they arrived as part of what must have been the best-qualified refugee trail in history.Gustav Born was 11 at the time, living in Gottingen, Lower Saxony, where his father, Max, was director of one of the world's leading centres for physics research.The Borns were Jewish, and when Hitler took power, Max Born and his Jewish colleagues were prevented from working at the university. This pioneering, elite group of theoretical scientists were turned into asylum seekers.Gustav now lives in London, a few days short of his 92nd birthday, and he looks back with great clarity on the remarkable flight of these German academics. The conversation is like opening a 1930s Mitteleuropa time capsule.He is now one of the last living links to these academic refugees, who between them went on to win 16 Nobel prizes - his father received the award for his work in quantum mechanics.Did these scientists realise the extent of the threat from the Nazis?"Yes, I think my father probably did. Among his Jewish colleagues, some did, but some didn't believe for some time. But the scale of what the Nazis were doing became apparent in the first three to six months."Gustav remembers that the ugly mood of anti-Semitism had even reached the playground, with some children not allowed to play with him.There were also positive examples of human nature, such as the academics who stood by their Jewish colleagues. The Nobel prize winner Max von Laue showed great support, says Gustav.The physicist Max Planck went to see Hitler in person to challenge the exclusion of Jewish scientists, but Hitler "foamed at the mouth and wouldn't let him talk any more".It was still tough to leave. Max Born had to give up running an institute, his wife was heartbroken at the prospect of emigrating."They hated to be uprooted in this crude and dangerous way."When the Borns left, they were not under any illusions that this would be a temporary departure. "Nazification" was happening rapidly and there were political murders."My parents were pretty sure this was a one-way journey."While the Borns were watching the swastikas appearing in Gottingen, a much more tweedily humanitarian response was being marshalled by university staff in Britain.The economist William Beveridge had set up the Academic Assistance Council, with the aim of rescuing Jewish and politically vulnerable academics.It was an organisation that would help 1,500 academics escape Germany and continue their research work in safety in Britain.It was quickly backed by academics whose names now read like a row of text books - J B S Haldane, John Maynard Keynes, Ernest Rutherford, G M Trevelyan and the poet A E Housman.Albert Einstein supported this high-brow escape committee with a highly-charged speech in the Albert Hall in London in October 1933.He set out an epic defence of Western liberal values of "tolerance and justice" against the "temptations of hatred and oppression", at a time of deepening extremism and economic and political turmoil."It is in times of economic distress such as we experience everywhere today, one sees very clearly the strength of the moral forces that live in a people."He told his audience that it was "the liberty of the individual that has brought us every advance of knowledge and invention - liberty without which life to a self-respecting man is not worth living".The council launched its "rescue operation", arranging for academics to come to Britain and providing practical support in the form of grants, accommodation and most importantly jobs.This was a remarkably talented group being cast aside by the Nazis. As well as the trawl of Nobel prizes, there were 18 future knighthoods and over 100 fellows of the Royal Society or British Academy.According to the Association of Jewish Refugees there were about 70,000 Jewish refugees who came to Britain before the outbreak of war in 1939.Max Born and his family went first to Cambridge and then to Edinburgh University. He paid his way by writing a science text book that became a school standard.There were others who moved on to the United States. Mathematician Richard Courant went to New York where one of the foremost centres for applied maths, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is named after him.Losing such intellectual powerhouses was a self-inflicted wound for the Nazi war effort.In the race to develop atomic weapons, German refugees played a key role in making sure that it was the United States that won.Even though Max Born refused on moral grounds to work on atomic weapons research, Robert Oppenheimer, the US-born "father of the atomic bomb", had been Born's PhD student at Gottingen.There were signs at one stage that the Nazis might have realised their mistake.In 1934, Max Born and his family were visited in Cambridge by Werner Heisenberg, another Nobel prize winner and old colleague who had continued working at Gottingen.Heisenberg brought a message from the Nazi government inviting Max Born to return to continue his scientific work in Germany. The invitation left Born "beside himself with fury", his son recalls.But Max Born and his wife did eventually go back to Germany, after the war was over and after he had retired. He died there in 1970 and is buried in the same cemetery in Gottingen as Max Planck and Max von Laue.Gustav, who became a professor of pharmacology at King's College London, says that his parents were committed to trying to rebuild Germany in a way that would prevent the return of such political extremism.What lessons should be learned from all this?Gustav Born remains a strong supporter of the campaign to rescue academics, which is now marking its 80th year.It has become the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara) and its current chair, Anne Lonsdale, says that after 80 years the organisation "would love to be out of a job", but the problems in Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq and Syria mean that academics still need help in places where "civil society no longer functions".There is an "urgent need for scholars from across the Middle East to get to exile in a place of safety", she said.The stories of refugees from the Nazis, with grainy photos of faces with lines like old railway maps of Europe, might seem like something from a lost world.But Gustav Born says that Cara's ongoing work shows that it is as relevant as ever. It is also a reminder not to make hasty judgements about refugees and what they might be able to achieve.His descriptions of that academic world of the 1930s are also a last glimpse of a highly cultured society. His father, remembered for his science research, played Bach on the piano every day. These were internationalists, their ideas and research moving across national and political boundaries.Such a world proved fragile in the face of the Nazis. And Gustav Born says people can too often overlook that Germany had still been a young country in the 1930s, little more than 60 years old, and that it hadn't built the institutions able to resist its own "militaristic and nationalistic" tendencies.He is very much aware that he is now one of the few remaining people who can talk first-hand about such a legacy."I'm sad that it almost ends with me."I want them not to forget that things like this, the suppression of a country by a gang of murderous crooks and the victimisation of people of good nature and good intention, it could happen again."</body>

      <body>The tinderbox mix of high youth unemployment, lack of education and the threat of extremism is turning access to school into a "security issue", says Irina Bokova, director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation.The volatile prospect of millions of uneducated, illiterate youngsters in developing countries, under pressure from the financial downturn, has brought an unprecedented political significance to the campaign to give every child a primary school education, she says.Ms Bokova was speaking ahead of a speech later this week at the United Nations from Malala Yousafzai, who will call for all children to have the right to go to school.The Pakistani schoolgirl, who will make her speech in New York on her 16th birthday, defied the bullets of the Taliban in defence of her right to an education.But behind the optimism of Malala's campaign and the creation of an annual "Malala Day" is a much more complex global story, with failure as well as success.In 2000, in the warm glow of a new millennium, world leaders pledged that universal primary education would be achieved by 2015. No child would miss out on the basics of schooling.After an initial surge, progress stalled and achieving the target in the next 18 months now seems unlikely."By 2015, it's impossible," says Ms Bokova, the Paris-based head of Unesco.But she says that rather than being a cause of pessimism, the pursuit of the target has brought "huge progress". There were 108 million children out of school when the pledge was made; the most recent figures suggest this has fallen to 57 million."If the right strategies are in place, and you put your head where your heart is, then things can be improved. In Afghanistan in 2000 only 4% of girls were in school, now there are more than 70%."Ms Bokova says that another positive outcome has been a much stronger recognition of the importance of measuring the quality of education, rather than simply counting heads going into a classroom.Among the more sobering discoveries has been that many pupils have spent years in school but remained functionally illiterate.So in the autumn, Unesco is planning to produce a new set of global metrics to measure what's actually being learned in primary classrooms around the world. "It will give a global understanding of what quality education means," says Ms Bokova.It remains unclear whether there will be more targets after 2015, but anything that emerges will be more about quality of education, rather than simply volume of places.Ms Bokova says the financial crisis delivered a major blow to achieving the goal of universal primary education. Donor countries pulled the plug and left an "alarming gap" in funding.In sub-Saharan Africa there remains a shortage of 1.7 million teachers.But despite this gloom, she says that the financial crisis has given education a "paradoxical" political importance.Youth unemployment is a major threat in many countries and education and training are seen as vital investments."Education is now becoming in some cases a security issue," she says, with examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq and across the Middle East, where there is huge pressure to provide education to promote stability and democracy and to avoid extremism."The same is true of big emerging powers. In Brazil, the government recognises that the education system is one of the biggest challenges as it moves forward to a competitive economy and an inclusive society."The social tensions of deepening inequality and a lack of social mobility are also shaped by decisions about education systems, she says.Economic and political stability are now inextricably linked to improving education, says the Bulgarian-born Unesco director general."Education is becoming the key issue now in discussions about overcoming the economic crisis."But how are we going to make this happen? Budgets and international aid are shrinking."We try to convince countries that if they want to invest in coming out of the crisis, then invest in education."Another barrier to getting all children to school is a lack of fair access, particularly for girls.Ms Bokova says it's not acceptable for countries to hide behind ideas of "cultural differences" or "tradition" as a reason for discriminating against girls.Malala Yousafzai has become a powerful emblem."One event can spark a huge reaction and understanding and I think it was the case with Malala," she says."It was a stunning example of courage and a desire to learn."And she says that getting more girls into school is the single most important goal."It's not just a human right, it's what is needed to have normal societies. If a girl goes to school, she is less likely to have an early marriage, she will have healthier children, she'll find it easier to earn an income, she's less likely to be subjected to violence, less likely to have an early pregnancy."There are so many advantages, healthier communities, less violence, more economic growth. It has such an incredible multiplying effect."This is the best thing that could happen to humanity."The pledge for education for all has also highlighted where the problem is most acute.A meeting organised by the UN in April brought together eight countries - Bangladesh, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen - which between them have about half the children in the world who are missing out on school.It was an unprecedented attempt to systematically work out what has been going wrong.A minister from the DR Congo said that about 60% of those missing out on school did so because of the cost of school fees with the other 40% blamed on armed conflict.In Ethiopia the problem was identified as being focused on rural communities and lack of access for girls. In South Sudan it was a lack of trained teachers and a low level of school participation among girls.In Nigeria, which has the most children out of school, the difficulty was not necessarily about money, but was caused by low participation among girls in some areas and problems with "infrastructure" about providing teachers. Weaknesses in state authorities delivering the plans of the national government were also blamed.The country has also seen brutal attacks on schools. Secondary schools in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe were ordered to close this week after a massacre in which suspected Islamist extremists killed 22 students.Ms Bokova says that there is now a willingness among such countries to recognise what needs to be changed.Despite the failure to make the 2015 deadline, she says the attempt has shown the international community what can be achieved. Countries such as India and Ethiopia have taken substantial steps forward.This has disproved the feeling that "education is too complex, too costly and it takes too long to show results".But there is no escaping the harsh truth that millions of children, born a decade after the world promised universal primary education, still won't have even the most basic access to school.It's been possible to launch hundreds of satellites and put a spacecraft on Mars, but not to put children into classrooms a few hours south of Heathrow."In many cases we have failed, but it shouldn't discourage us. We're winning the argument."</body>

      <body>Rapper Coolio has surprised a group of students by cooking them a meal and performing in their front room.The impromptu performance of his 1995 hit Gangsta's Paradise came after the students met the American star at a gig in Preston.Before performing, he prepared a three-course meal after taking the students to a supermarket to buy ingredients.A film of the performance made by one of the students has received around one million views on YouTube.Fashion student Olivia Johnson-Aley, from Liverpool said it was "such a crazy and surreal moment, I had to film it"."It is amazing how many people have already watched it," she said. "We have been getting calls from media in the UK and America ever since."The 50-year-old hip-hop star had been performing at Macs Bar in Preston when he met the students and offered to cook them a meal.Law student Melissa Bryan, 21, from the Isle of Man said the rapper said he would "cook for us and he was true to his word".She said his "delicious" menu comprised of Coolio's Caprese Salad, Chicken á la Daaaamn, and Peach Crumble.Miss Bryan said that the food was "great and the sing-along was even better"."I was three when Gangsta's Paradise was released but it is a classic."We all knew the words off by heart. Every student does."Coolio, who has sold more than 17 million albums worldwide, has sold more than six million copies of Gangsta's Paradise since its release.Lorcan O'Mahony, who accompanied the rapper on his guitar, said he had "conveniently left" it in the room when he heard the rapper was coming to the house."After dinner, I asked if he would perform Gangsta's Paradise and we all got involved."It is something I will never forget."He added that he had "only learnt the chords a few hours earlier".The rapper eventually left the house at 03:00 BST to catch a flight.</body>

      <title>England lags on young adult literacy</title>
      <description>Young adults in England and Northern Ireland have performed poorly in international tests of literacy and numeracy.</description>

      <body>Young adults in England have scored among the lowest results in the industrialised world in international literacy and numeracy tests.A major study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows how England's 16 to 24-year-olds are falling behind their Asian and European counterparts.England is 22nd for literacy and 21st for numeracy out of 24 countries.The OECD's Andreas Schleicher warned of a shrinking pool of skilled workers.Unlike other developed countries, the study also showed that young people in England are no better at these tests than older people, in the 55 to 65 age range.When this is weighted with other factors, such as the socio-economic background of people taking the test, it shows that England is the only country in the survey where results are going backwards - with the older cohort better than the younger.The study shows that there are 8.5 million adults in England and Northern Ireland with the numeracy levels of a 10-year-old."This shocking report shows England has some of the least literate and numerate young adults in the developed world," said Skills Minister Matthew Hancock."These are Labour's children, educated under a Labour government and force-fed a diet of dumbing down and low expectations."Ministers in England have announced a new maths qualification for 16 to 18 year olds as part of a drive to improve numeracy and its requirement that maths should be studied until the age 18 for those who do not have a good GCSE in the subject.The newly-appointed shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt defended Labour's record."Labour drove up standards in maths and English across our schools, evident in the huge improvements we saw in GCSE results between 1997 and 2010."He said a future Labour government would "ensure all young people study maths and English to 18" and would not allow "unqualified teachers to teach in our classrooms on a permanent basis".Young adults in Northern Ireland performed better in the OECD tests than in England, but they were also in the bottom half of these rankings.The highest-performing countries among this younger age group were Japan, Finland and the Netherlands. The country with the lowest numeracy skills was the United States, plummeting from once being one of the strongest education systems.This landmark study from the OECD set out to measure the level of skills within the adult population - testing actual ability in literacy, numeracy and digital skills, rather than looking at qualifications.It involved 166,000 adults taking tests in 24 education systems, representing populations of 724 million people. From the UK, adults in England and Northern Ireland participated.The study looked at the level of skills across the adult population, between the ages of 16 and 65. England and Northern Ireland are below average for both literacy and numeracy, in league tables headed by Japan and Finland.But for most industrialised countries the younger population are much better at such tests than the older generations.Mr Schleicher pointed to the examples of Finland and South Korea where there had been huge progress in recent decades.A statement from the Finnish embassy highlighted that this was about a long term commitment to improving schools."This demonstrates that there is a longer trend in the Finnish education success, it is not just something that has happened in recent years."However, for England, when the results are separated from Northern Ireland, there was a different and unusual pattern, with almost no advance in test results between the 55 to 65-year-olds and those aged 16 to 24.This younger group will have many more qualifications, but the test results show that these younger people have no greater ability than those approaching retirement who left schools with much lower qualifications in the 1960s and 1970s.The grandchildren are not any better at these core skills than their grandparents.Mr Schleicher says it might suggest evidence of grade inflation and it shows that better qualifications do not necessarily mean better skills."When you look at this snapshot you do have to conclude that these young people are not any better skilled when it comes to those foundation skills than people in the older generation," he said.He warned of the serious economic implications of a failure to provide a skilled workforce.The influential OECD expert showed how there was an increasing demand in the jobs market for those with higher skills - and a static or falling jobs market for those with lower skills.England and Northern Ireland have particularly high levels of adults with the lowest skill level in literacy and numeracy.The economic and social rewards for having high skills are particularly strong in England and Northern Ireland, says the research, with significant advantages in health, job opportunities and income.The global economic race is strongly linked to educational performance and the OECD report shows how the UK's share of the highest skilled workers is falling.An even sharper decline is faced by the United States, an education superpower of a previous generation. Last year the OECD warned that the US was almost the only developed country facing educational "downward mobility", where the younger population is less well educated than the older generation.This latest study shows that the US once had 42% of the world's highest-skilled adults but this had now fallen to 28%.Mr Schleicher set out the scale of the difference in ability, saying that many secondary school pupils in Japan were ahead of graduates in England.Neil Carberry, the CBI's director for employment and skills, said the UK's economic future depended on improving the skills of the workforce."This survey simply emphasises that the UK cannot afford to stand still on skills."Ian Brinkley, director at the Work Foundation think tank, said the study showed the UK faced a "relative decline in the economy's skills base"."We face a major generational challenge."</body>

      <body>Rachel Reeves will replace Liam Byrne as shadow work and pensions secretary, as Labour leader Ed Miliband reshuffles his top team.In other changes, shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy has been moved from his post to the international development brief.Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg is replaced by TV historian Tristram Hunt.But Andy Burnham will keep his current position as shadow health secretary.The two new members of the shadow cabinet, Tristram Hunt and Chris Leslie, as well as Ms Reeves, all entered the Commons at the 2010 general election - although Mr Leslie had a previous stint as an MP from 1997 to 2005.BBC News Channel chief political correspondent Norman Smith said senior Labour figures were keen to promote the message that their reshuffle was designed to bring in new talent.They note that nearly a third of the shadow cabinet are now from the 2010 intake, and more than 40% are women.Ex-shadow cabinet members Mr Twigg and Mr Byrne take on more junior roles as shadow minister for political and constitutional reform and shadow minister for higher education.Mr Twigg, Mr Byrne and Mr Murphy all served as ministers under former PM Tony Blair, and their demotion is fuelling speculation of a "purge of the Blairites", Norman Smith added.But aides to Mr Miliband have denied trying to remove any faction of the party, he said.In other changes Mary Creagh leaves the environment, food and rural affairs brief to become shadow transport secretary.Previous incumbent Maria Eagle had been a strong defender of HS2, the proposed high-speed rail link.Her departure from that role is likely to be seen as adding to the likelihood of a Labour rethink on support for the scheme.In a blog post, Mr Murphy pledged to apply "just as much commitment and energy" to his new brief on international development as his previous defence job, and also said he would now play a "bigger role" in the campaign to persuade people in Scotland to vote against independence in the forthcoming referendum.Vernon Coaker moves from his job as shadow Northern Ireland secretary to shadow defence secretary, replacing Mr Murphy.In other moves, Emma Reynolds replaces Jack Dromey as shadow housing minister.Ivan Lewis takes over the Northern Ireland brief from Mr Coaker, having previously been shadow international development secretary.Gloria de Piero becomes shadow minister for women and equalities - a shadow cabinet post that was previously held by Yvette Cooper, who continues in her main role as shadow home secretary.</body>

      <description>A Muslim free school in Derby is warned to "urgently" improve "unacceptable" standards or face closure.</description>

      <body>A Muslim free school in Derby will be closed unless "unacceptable" teaching standards improve and discrimination against female staff and pupils stops.In a letter to the chair of the Al-Madinah Education Trust, Education Minister Lord Nash laid out 17 issues.These included forcing female teachers to cover their hair and failing to carry out background checks on staff.The interim principal said its pupils were treated equally. The school's trust said it was seeking legal advice.Dr Stuart Wilson, the acting head teacher, said there were areas the school needed to address and it was co-operating with Ofsted.When asked if staff and children are treated equally at the school, Dr Wilson replied: "Yes, they are treated equally and fairly."The Al-Madinah School Education Trust said in a statement on the school's website that "the letter had come out of the blue" and while it intended to co-operate fully with the Department for Education, it would also be speaking to the school's solicitors.Lord Nash's letter stated if urgent steps were not taken by 15 October, funding will be pulled.The school was closed for a week on the first the day of an Ofsted inspection on 1 October citing "health and safety issues".Ofsted released its statement to "clarify media reports" about why the school had closed.In it, HM Inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw said: "Inspectors discovered that staff records showing whether they were cleared to supervise children were either missing or incomplete."The school remained closed until yesterday [Monday] when inspectors made a return visit to satisfy themselves that the necessary safeguarding arrangements were in place and that there were sufficient numbers of adults with the necessary clearance for the school to function safely."A full Ofsted report is expected soon, he added.Addressing chair Shazia Parveen, Lord Nash wrote: "The trust has manifestly breached the conditions of its funding agreement by:"I will not tolerate breaches of the commitments you gave when entering into the funding agreement," he added.He has urged the school's trust to take five "urgent steps" by 15 October, including providing written confirmation that "you have ceased any practices and procedures that have as their reason, cause or effect that women and girls are treated less favourably than men and boys".The school has been given a deadline of 22 October for nine further action points and must provide a plan setting out a clear management structure by the start of November.</body>

      <description>Classroom support staff say they are increasingly being asked to stand in for fully qualified teachers, claims a union.</description>

      <body>Classroom support staff say they are increasingly being asked to stand in for fully qualified teachers, a union is claiming.A third (32%) of support staff in UK state schools polled by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) said they took classes for absent teachers.Over a fifth (22%) said they took more classes in 2012-13 than in 2011-12.A Department for Education (DfE) spokeswoman said: "The rules are clear - they should not be teaching."The DfE said teaching assistants and other classroom support staff played a vital role in the classroom, short of teaching whole classes of children."The government's recent review of school efficiency showed that, when properly trained and deployed, teaching assistants play an important role in helping to improve learning," the spokeswoman said."It is for school leaders to use the expertise of all staff to ensure any disruption to pupils is minimal and that taxpayers get value for money."The ATL polled more than 1,400 of its members working as support staff in state schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.A spokeswoman for the union said the rules allow classroom assistants to teach small groups of children under the supervision of a qualified teacher, but they should not teach whole classes or prepare teaching material.Higher level teaching assistants may contribute to lesson planning and deliver lessons to whole classes to assist an assigned teacher, while cover supervisors are employed to supervise classes while pupils complete work set by a teacher.A quarter (25.4%) of the teaching assistants and learning support workers surveyed and almost half (49.1%) of higher level teaching assistants said they were asked to cover lessons.Of the 400 who said they stood in for the regular class teacher, 60% said they did the same work as fully qualified teachers, claims the union, while a third (31%) of these staff said they had been used to take classes for three or more consecutive days.The union quotes a higher level teaching assistant at a secondary school in England: "I prepare, teach and mark at least four lessons for two year-7, bottom-set classes, and a year-8 set for at least three hours a week. It is teaching on the cheap."A cover supervisor said: "I have even been asked to give copies of lessons I have prepared to members of teaching staff."A primary school teaching assistant added: "It is unfair that many teaching assistants are teaching classes in the absence of a teacher, and doing the same job as a teacher for much less money."ATL general secretary Dr Mary Bousted said: "Schools are selling children short by using teaching assistants to teach classes when the regular teacher is unavailable."We are totally opposed to this exploitation of support staff who are being used as a cheap option to teachers."It is grossly unfair on them and on the children and their parents who rightly expect their children to be taught by qualified teachers."</body>

      <body>The brain has a critical window for language development between the ages of two and four, brain scans suggest.Environmental influences have their biggest impact before the age of four, as the brain's wiring develops to process new words, say UK and US scientists.The research in The Journal of Neuroscience suggests disorders causing language delay should be tackled early.It also explains why young children are good at learning two languages.The scientists, based at King's College London, and Brown University, Rhode Island, studied 108 children with normal brain development between the ages of one and six.They used brain scans to look at myelin - the insulation that develops from birth within the circuitry of the brain.To their surprise, they found the distribution of myelin is fixed from the age of four, suggesting the brain is most plastic in very early life.Any environmental influences on brain development will be strongest in infanthood, they predict.This explains why immersing children in a bilingual environment before the age of four gives them the best chance of becoming fluent in both languages, the research suggests.It also suggests that there is a critical time during development when environmental influence on cognitive skills may be greatest.Dr Jonathan O'Muircheartaigh, from King's College London, led the study.He told the BBC: "Since our work seems to indicate that brain circuits associated with language are more flexible before the age of four, early intervention for children with delayed language attainment should be initiated before this critical age."This may be relevant to many developmental disorders, such as autism, since delayed language is a common early trait."Early childhood is a time when language skills develop very rapidly.Babies have a vocabulary of up to 50 words at 12 months but by the age of six this has expanded to about 5,000 words.Language skills are localised in the frontal areas of the left-hand side of the brain.The researchers therefore expected more myelin to develop in the left-hand side of the brain, as the children learned more language.In fact, they found it remained constant, but had a stronger influence on language ability before the age of four, suggesting there is a crucial window for interventions in developmental disorders."This work is important as it is the first to investigate the relationship between brain structure and language across early childhood and demonstrate how this relationship changes with age," said Dr Sean Deoni from Brown University, a co-researcher on the study."This is important since language is commonly altered or delayed in many developmental disorders, such as autism."Commenting on the study, Prof Dorothy Bishop of the department of Developmental Neuropsychology at the University of Oxford said the research added important new information about early development of connections in brain regions important for cognitive functions."There is suggestive evidence of links with language development but it is too early to be confident about functional implications of the findings," she said."Ideally we would need a longitudinal study following children over time to track how structural brain changes relate to language function."The study was funded by the National Institutes for Mental Health (US) and the Wellcome Trust (UK).</body>

      <body>The mother of Baby Peter, Tracey Connelly, should be released from jail, the Parole Board has said.She was jailed indefinitely, with a recommended minimum term of five years, in May 2009, for causing or allowing her son's death in north London.A Parole Board panel recommended her release from prison following a second review of her case.The board said arrangements and the date of the release were a matter for Justice Secretary Chris Grayling.A spokesman for Mr Grayling said the Parole Board's decision was final.A statement from the board said: "We can confirm that a three-member panel of the board has directed the release of Tracey Connelly."Tracey Connelly first became eligible for parole in August 2012 and at that time a Parole Board panel made no recommendation to release."Peter died on 3 August 2007 at home in Haringey after months of abuse.He had more than 50 injuries, despite being on the at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers, police and health professionals over eight months.Connelly was jailed with her boyfriend Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen, who were convicted at trial of the same offence.Barker was jailed for life with a minimum of 10 years for raping a two-year-old girl and given a 12-year term to run concurrently for his "major role" in Peter's death.Owen was jailed indefinitely with a minimum three-year term but later won an appeal to lower it to a fixed six-year term.He was freed in August 2011 but was then recalled to prison in April this year.When making its decision, the Parole Board will take into account the nature of the offence, the prisoner's offending history, the prisoner's progress in prison and any statements made on behalf of the victim.Reports from psychologists, probation officers and prison officers are also taken into account.Connelly will remain on licence for the rest of her life and if she breaches any of the conditions, she would most likely be recalled to custody.Conditions can include curfews, restrictions on movements and frequent meetings with an offender manager, said a Ministry of Justice spokesman.</body>

      <body>A gay couple have said they went to England to adopt because of confusion over the law in Northern Ireland.The Court of Appeal ruled that legislation which prevented gay, lesbian and unmarried couples from adopting children in NI was unlawful.It was the only part of the UK where the policy existed.However, Stormont's health minister plans to go to the Supreme Court to try to overturn that decision and get the ban reinstated.John Davis and Jason Scorer, who live in County Antrim, had hoped to adopt children from Northern Ireland, but with uncertainty over the legal position they were advised to consider other options."We were very lucky that our original social worker in Northern Ireland had done a lot of homework before she came, to say that we could not move things any further forward," said John, who has lived in Northern Ireland for 20 years."The problem is a lot of people may not be aware there is another option."They contacted adoption and fostering charity PACT (Parents and Children Together).It helped the couple, who are in a civil partnership, go through the process in England with the aim of giving children from there a home in Northern Ireland."There are children waiting in the system (in Northern Ireland) to find families but, unfortunately, we were not allowed to go down that route," said Jason."And that is to the hardship of the children who are here."They adopted two boys at the start of the summer and they started primary school last month."They are getting loved, they are getting looked after and they are getting cared for," said John.They say they know of other gay couples from Northern Ireland who are now considering going through the adoption process elsewhere in the UK, because the issue is still being debated in the courts.The Department of Health at Stormont confirmed that Health Minister Edwin Poots has now applied to the Supreme Court for leave to appeal against the Court of Appeal's decision that the ban was discriminatory.And he insisted the issue was about stability not sexuality."Unlike other parts of the UK... we have a strong list of adoptive parents who want to take on adopted children," said Mr Poots."I think we should be cautious about changing the system which actually provides the stability those children need."It is not a human right to adopt a child for either a mixed-sex couple or a same-sex couple."Gay and lesbian groups, as well as organisations like BAAF (British Association for Adoption and Fostering), have criticised the minister's decision to continue fighting the issue in the courts.But he said surveys had shown support for his position."What I look at it is where the Northern Ireland public are on these issues and what is in the best interests of the children," he said."There is a lot of public opposition to it."In Belfast, there were people with strong views on both sides of the argument.Those against gay couples having the right to adopt argued that children needed both male and female role models and some claimed it was against their religious beliefs.However, many said that the only important thing was providing a stable home for a child, irrespective of whether the couple were married or their sexuality."You could argue all day about the gay thing - whether it is right that someone who is gay should be gay," says John Davis."But I believe it goes back to the loving, caring environment and stability that you can give these children, that they have not had up to this point."</body>

      <title>Murdered Keanu 'failed' by agencies</title>
      <description>A serious case review into the murder of two-year-old Keanu Williams finds police, social services and health workers "failed" to prevent his death.</description>

      <body>There were "a number of significant missed opportunities" to save a two-year-old boy from being beaten to death by his mother, a report has found.Rebecca Shuttleworth is serving a life sentence for murdering Keanu Williams.The toddler was found with 37 injuries including a fractured skull and torn abdomen, in Ward End, Birmingham.A serious case review said social care workers, the police and health professionals had "collectively failed to prevent Keanu's death".Shuttleworth, 25, was spoken to in prison by members of the serious case review team, telling them she was "surprised" social workers allowed her to keep custody of Keanu.The report states: "She expressed some surprise that Keanu had not been removed from her care when born."As Rebecca Shuttleworth is intending to appeal her sentence, although it is unclear if that is possible, she was not able to talk more about services which might have prevented Keanu's death."The report found different agencies had "become confused" as their strategy discussions had focused on the medical and forensic aspect of his injuries, the report said.It concluded that although Keanu's death on 9 January 2011 could not have been predicted, the agencies involved could have seen that he was "likely to suffer significant harm".The toddler should have been subject to a child protection plan "on at least two occasions" to address issues of neglect and physical harm, the report said.Jane Held, from the Birmingham Safeguarding Children Board, said Keanu died because there were "failings across every agency"."No-one walked in his shoes, staff were distracted by his mother's needs and by taking what she had told them at face value," she said.Ms Held said there had been "double-figure sackings" since Keanu's death, but added: "It is unfortunately an appalling situation."We are unequivocally sorry about the fact that unacceptable failures in 2011 and from the start of Keanu's life meant that we did not prevent his death and we failed to protect him, and that is something that I think all the board feel incredibly distressed about."Shuttleworth, of Cottingham Road, Manchester, was convicted of murder and four counts of child cruelty after a five-month trial. She was ordered to serve at least 18 years.Keanu was born in Torbay, Devon, and the report also found Torbay's Children's Services should have been aware of the risks even before his birth.It states: "There was enough information available to raise concerns that the unborn child was likely to be at risk of suffering significant harm."The authority also later received two anonymous reports of concerns about Rebecca Shuttleworth's care of Keanu which should have led to a reassessment of his safety.It concluded: "If a child protection plan had been in place, there would have been more robust arrangements to safeguard and promote Keanu's interests."Torbay Council's director of children's services, Richard Williams, said: "This is an extremely sad case and I would like to reassure everyone that we take the recommendations in this review very seriously and have acted upon them all."The serious case review makes eight recommendations:The report was told there has been an "end-to-end" review of the child protection system since Keanu's death, as it became clear there had been poor performance and a general lack of compliance with child protection procedures.In a comment that echoes those made after the death of starved four-year-old Daniel Pelka, the report says that Keanu had become "invisible".The serious case review into the death of Keanu Williams is the twenty-third to be published in Birmingham since the Local Safeguarding Board's inception in 2006.Peter Hay, from Birmingham City Council said admitted that its track record over recent years was "poor" and said the council was "unequivocally sorry"."Keanu's death is another tragic reminder of the consequences of failing children's services," he said.Edward Timpson, the government minister for children and families, said he has issued the council with a "final warning"."There is no quick fix, however I have been very clear with Birmingham that unless I see rapid improvement further action will follow," he added.Ofsted will return to Birmingham in autumn to determine what progress has been made, the minister said.The National Children's Bureau said it was "particularly worrying" that the review found that no conversations were held with Keanu to find out what he was feeling.Dr Hilary Emery, from the children's charity, said no child at risk should ever be "only seen and not heard"."We urgently need to review how best to support children within the child protection system - especially the very young ones - to ensure their voices are listened to at every opportunity," he said.West Midlands Police said their officers need to "challenge social workers and doctors" in future.Assistant Chief Constable Sharon Rowe said: "Of course it's a collective failure and we paid a key role in that."Ultimate accountability rests with Keanu's mother who was convicted of his murder - let's not forget that."Fay Baillie, director of nursing for NHS England in Birmingham, Solihull and the Black Country said: "I don't think children in Birmingham will ever be completely safe."We are always going to have deceptive mothers and families, however we can aim to make it as safe as possible by working together and improving education."</body>

      <description>How ex-prisoner Frank went from drug smuggling to a 'stable life'</description>

      <body>As Ofsted inspectors deliver a critical verdict of the education prisoners receive in England's jails, one ex-inmate describes how he finally learnt a vital lesson.Expelled from school at 12, Frank Harris says it was the thought of how he would be remembered by his own children that helped him see education as a way to change his life.The 53-year-old Londoner says he was in and out of prisons for more than 30 years before he found his "way out" through education and wants other people involved in crime to see it is not too late for them either."I wasn't getting any younger. I was thinking, 'What will my four kids do if I dropped down [dead]?'"If they said I was in and out of prison - that I wasted my time on earth. Now they can say I made mistakes, but I tried to do something different. That pushes me on."I'm still enjoying my education and still have something to give back."Frank is in the second year of a degree in criminology and criminal justice. He counsels and mentors others who have been involved in crime and has worked with the police on tackling gang culture.But in 2004 he was facing his longest prison stretch ever - four years for smuggling cocaine from Amsterdam - after what he says was a "lifetime of crime"."I knew I'd be coming out, that I needed to do something, to make a change instead of hanging around with people," he said."I found I enjoyed learning. I had been interested before in lots of things but never had the kind of environment for it to be cool to learn."In prison, he did basic skills lessons before getting A-grades in GCSE English and maths."People saying well done, that inspired me to say I enjoyed doing this education and it was positive. I saw I could change my life, learning and achieving things. I saw education as a way out and that it could be the key to set me free."After leaving jail, Frank says he was very tempted to go back to his old way of life but instead decided to stay in touch with a charity that had supported him inside - the Prisoners' Education Trust - and the St Giles Trust."Normally, I was getting picked up by one of my friends [when I got out of jail], and before I got back to London, I would be stoned and wouldn't get home for two days."The crucial thing this time was there was link. This group had offices you can get in touch with when you get out."Frank says he was on the verge of getting involved with crime again when, he says: "Something told me, 'Don't take the left path, take a right,' and instead, I went down to the offices."He went on take a qualification in counselling to help homeless and vulnerable people and to work for the charity Turning Point.He now counsels others, he says, "to try to stop them taking my path".Like many people in Britain's jails, Frank did badly at school. He had no academic qualifications before studying in prison in his 40s.Expelled at 12, he says he was "delinquent" for 18 months, before being sent to a reform "boarding school", where he says there was no proper teaching."The classroom was a work room and the teachers - who were really PE teachers - used to say, 'Finish that English off, then you can finish making your chair.'"Boys would be banging about while others were doing written work."Frank says things then went further downhill."I'd come home every two weeks - my family would not know me, I had no friends. I'd go around by myself and began breaking in to cars, doing rubbish stuff because I was lonely, bored."Shortly after that, Frank says, he began to get custodial sentences for theft and fraud and "that was it for 30 years".He says he was never involved with violent or sexual crimes, but witnessed violence."People were getting shot in a car next to me; people getting stabbed, but I never picked up a knife in anger. I was smoking crack but I always felt I was on the outside looking in; like I was not meant to be there."Now I know that reason was to say to young men and women, 'You don't have to go that way - it's such a waste.' I'm here to tell that story."If you find yourself on the that road, if you are in prison, there's a way out and it's education."Now I'm a proper father, a proper son, a proper grandfather. I'm stable and I have a family that's stable."</body>

      <title>Corruption and bribery in the classroom</title>
      <description>Bribery and corruption in the classroom</description>

      <body>Corruption in education is a serious blight that undermines the quality and availability of schools and universities around the world, according to an international report.Anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International have published a global survey showing that about one in six students has had to pay a bribe for education services.In parts of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia this might be requiring parents to pay a fee for a school place that should be free.In Eastern Europe, it might be paying to gain an advantage in university admissions.The Berlin-based campaign group is best known for its annual "global corruption barometer", which measures levels of dishonest payments in more than 100 countries, based on more than 114,000 household interviews.This year's survey also asked questions about people's first-hand experiences and perceptions of dishonesty in education.In some countries these perceptions are distinctively negative. The report says that almost three-quarters of people in Cameroon and Russia see their education systems as "corrupt or highly corrupt".The findings show a huge range of malpractice.In Pakistan, there are warnings of thousands of "shadow schools" without any real students, but drawing public funding to pay for "ghost teachers"."Leakages" in the funding of schools in Kenya had the equivalent value of losing more than 11 million text books, says the report. A study of 180 schools in Tanzania showed that more than a third of intended funds had failed to reach the school.In Greece there are warnings about nepotism in jobs and promotions in higher education.In Vietnam there is a problem with bribery for places in the most sought-after schools.The report quotes figures from the United Nations showing 110 countries where fees are levied, despite in theory having free education enshrined in law. The report describes "myriad pretexts" to impose charges on parents.So why should education be so vulnerable to corruption?Parents want the best for their children, says the report, and they can be exploited by unscrupulous officials controlling access to places.It also involves a great deal of public money filtering down from central government to local school authorities. In Nigeria, the report says, $21m (£13m) intended for schools was lost in two years.But it's not only a problem for the developing world or those providing the basics of schooling.The massive expansion in demand for university education has created rich opportunities for illicit charges.Students need degree-level qualifications more than ever and are under great pressure to get university places and to leave with good grades, opening up fertile territory for corruption and cheating.Eastern European and former Soviet states are highlighted as having had particular difficulties.In Georgia, there have been reforms to stop corruption in university admissions. This hadn't simply been "cash-filled envelopes", but included a complex system of having to buy tutoring, Transparency International found.There could also be more practical types of illicit charges, with suggestions that in Romania access to university accommodation depended on bribery.The demand for qualifications has also generated its own industry in fake universities.In the United States, the report estimates, there are about a thousand "degree mills" in operation, selling bogus qualifications.This isn't only harmless self-delusion, says the report, as these bought qualifications are used to gain graduate jobs, including in one case working in a nuclear power plant.It also highlights the case of Colby Nolan, a student who ostensibly gained an MBA degree in 2004, until his owner revealed that the graduate was a six-year-old cat. He had gained the equivalent of an upper second class degree.The growth of higher education as a globalised, multi-billion dollar business has also spawned a parallel opportunity for fraud, says Philip Altbach, director of the Center for International Higher Education in the Lynch School of Education at Boston College.He has described the "spectre of corruption haunting" the move towards a more internationalised higher education system.And he has called for more co-ordinated international efforts to set standards and share information.The Transparency International study says that corruption has a corrosive effect on education, raising the cost and lowering the quality."Many people wouldn't realise the extent of corruption in education, right through from the financing of education through to academic corruption," says report editor, Gareth Sweeney."In some countries it's such a serious problem that it could undermine the credibility of their education systems."There is some good news as the report highlights efforts to tackle bribery.In Chile, anti-corruption lessons have been introduced to the school curriculum and in Bangladesh there is an "integrity pledge" taken by officials.The proliferation of mobile phones in Africa is being used to allow people to expose concerns about bribery in schools.Legal advice centres have also been developed in a number of countries to help community groups make legal challenges against school corruption.There are also international efforts to improve the monitoring and tracking of education funds.But corruption is still there leaching away education budgets. It's a particularly bleak problem when there are still tens of millions of children without any access to school."Corruption is an obstacle to a fundamental human right to education," says Mr Sweeney.While there are campaigners calling for education for all, such as Malala Yousafzai in Pakistan, this report also warns of the barriers being created for the poorest communities by demands for corrupt payments.Teachers take bribes to offset poor wages or irregular payments and that in turn raises questions about the lack of funding coming from higher up the chain.Mr Sweeney says that there should be a way of measuring good governance in any future global education targets."Even when formal school fees are abolished, many households are still being forced to pay informal fees. How is a family supposed to be able to afford these costs, when they cannot afford their daily meals?," says Pauline Rose, director of Unesco's Global Monitoring Report, which tracks progress towards primary education for all."Until these hidden costs are eradicated, we will not be able to call education free, and universal primary education will continue to remain a distant goal for the poorest."</body>

      <title>University boss: Head teacher, mayor or chief executive?</title>
      <description>What does a university vice-chancellor do?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24462298</url>

      <body>Sir David Bell is vice-chancellor of the University of Reading. So what does he do all day?Does it make him a high-powered head teacher, responsible for the university's academic prowess?Or does it make him chief executive of a multi-million pound enterprise, plotting its future business strategy?Sitting in his office at the beginning of a new academic year, it's a reminder of how many big decisions are lying ahead of the UK's university leaders.On the most practical level, he says, it's like running a small town, with its own housing, doctors, libraries, nursery, shops, bars, sports facilities, hundreds of acres of parkland and campus security.There is an ambassadorial role of seeing and being seen.But it's easy to overlook how much universities have grown in terms of local economic significance. It's a long way from being an academic cottage industry.The vice-chancellor in many university towns is now the biggest local employer, apart from the NHS.There are 4,000 people directly employed by Reading University and many more depend on its spending power. The university and its staff and students are worth an estimated £1.78m every single day to the local economy.Universities like Reading were often set up with money from local big businesses - and now they've become the local big spenders themselves.Reading University is a member of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), as well as belonging to academic groups.Even after students finish their courses, the impact continues, with an estimated 19,000 of the university's graduates continuing to live and work in the area.There is an international dimension, as the UK's universities look to expand overseas, not least because of the need for a reliable source of extra income.Reading already has an outpost in South Africa and is planning to open a campus in Malaysia. They decided not to go ahead with plans for China.Sir David, a former Ofsted chief inspector, says the university needs to make plans to offset the volatility of relying on undergraduate student numbers.The word that Sir David uses to describe his responsibilities is "stewardship".The university is heading towards the 100th anniversary of its charter and as the current captain of the ship he wants to make sure it continues safely into the future.He says he "feels the weight" of this legacy and has the words of a previous vice-chancellor on his office wall: "Universities are living things - they feel, think and do.""There's a danger in being purely a chief executive. At the heart, it's about teaching and research," he says.He says he spends as much time as he can with the academics.In terms of running the organisation, there is the weekly equivalent of a cabinet meeting of senior staff."You sometimes feel vulnerable, you're carrying financial risks. These are big decisions about opening campuses overseas. But you have to make the best decisions at the time with the information available."There is also a responsibility for 17,000 young lives.He says he has been meeting and greeting new arrivals at the university. Watching parents saying goodbye to their children has brought home to him the importance of this moment."This is a big deal. We've got to look after them. It's often their first experience away from home."The funding of universities is increasingly dependent on attracting undergraduates and their tuition fees. And the unpredictability is a problem for long-term planning."I can't imagine there's a vice-chancellor in the land who isn't thinking about it."It raises questions about how mainstream, provincial universities, with a tradition of doing a bit of everything, can make themselves distinctive. Not just compared with other UK universities but also international rivals.The emergence of online university courses - so-called Moocs - makes the powerhouses of US universities only a mouse click away.The uncertainty over undergraduate numbers has given universities an incentive to find other sources of income, such as shifting towards graduate courses and executive training.The Henley Business School, a slice of the City on the Reading campus, has its own mock trading rooms.Postgraduates are now 45% of the students on Reading's campus.But how should a modern university present itself? Is it meant to be clad in ivy or silicon?On a warm autumn afternoon, the Reading campus looks like something from an American college movie, with youngsters practising American football on leafy sports fields.It's a long way from roll-up cigarettes and Oxfam overcoats.There has been a surge of new university buildings to attract young students. In Reading they've put £400m into new accommodation.Sir David says universities have had to respond to "changing patterns of affluence and what young people expect"."I don't take too precious a view of that."But if universities spend too much, they can be accused of being cash rich.When earlier this year the university bought a unique Samuel Beckett manuscript to add to its archive there was some carping about the price tag of £962,500. A US university would have told everyone it cost twice as much and put it all over the website to show they were serious players.Sir David says that despite the upheavals in funding and technology and the push towards a more competitive system he expects more to stay the same than will change."We're in turbulent times," he says, but remains confident that the university will still be recognisable in two decades."There is something powerful in having great seats of learning."</body>

      <title>The state school sixth formers twinned with Eton</title>

      <body>From a busy junction at Stratford High Street in East London, there is a great view of a symbol of one of the UK's most glittering recent successes - the Olympic Park - and the modern station created to go with it.And close by is an unusual school which is striving to bring together the old and the new traditions of England - much like the spectacular opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics.The London Academy of Excellence is a government-funded sixth-form serving the East End of the capital which is trying to bridge the gap between private and state schools.It opened its doors as London basked in the glow of the Olympics last year.In an unusual partnership, pupils there share lessons, sport and teachers with a local community school and several independent fee-paying schools including Eton, Brighton College and Highgate.It is easy to miss the London Academy of Excellence. Its modern building looks like any other shiny office block, perched on the edge of a busy road.It is as far from the green playing fields and quads of Eton and Brighton College as you could imagine - but pupils at these and the other schools involved are sharing more than lessons and aspirations.Through a buddy system, they are getting to know each other during visits and getting a window on each other's lives.Yousef, 17, was one of the first group of sixth-formers to join the academy."I was attracted by the links with Eton and the other schools," he said."This has built a bridge between us and independent schools. It's taught us a lot. It's illustrated that we have far more in common than difference."I get to visit Eton House boys with tailcoats. That was a bit of an experience, out of the ordinary, but behind that we saw a lot of similarities between us."Do the teenagers feel envious when they see the very different surroundings of pupils at the other schools?Curtis, 17, says no."One buddy took us on a tour and I studied a lesson of history with them. There was a similar-sized classroom, a similar way of teaching and talking. I felt at home there," he said."I did not feel envious. I am not that kind of individual. But who would not want to study at Eton?"Some of the sixth-formers say they feel lucky, because they do not have to pay for their education."We have this free. They are paying vast amounts to go to a college similar to ours", says Clinton.Ellie says the students at the other schools seemed really pleased to meet them."They were just as interested in us as we were in them. My buddy was asking so many questions about what we do."Most of their education takes place in the bright modern, business-like surroundings of their academy, in a converted office block.Their "uniform" is a "smart, professional dress code".The walls are white, the furniture bright. Big bold canvases with faces of famous intellectuals, scientists, artists and writers decorate the walls, dotted with their words of inspiration.In front of one of them is the academy's headmaster Robert Wilne, an energetic man, who bubbles over with enthusiasm for his pupils' success, their futures - and the aims of this experimental school."There are many schools doing interesting partnerships," he said."But this is a third way for independent schools, aside from giving bursaries or sponsoring academies."It is an experiment. I would love another city to look at it."It's a genuine, deep-seated partnership between eight schools that are woven in to the DNA of this academy."It's not window dressing or surface gloss."It is an experiment praised by the head of England's schools inspectorate Sir Michael Wilshaw, who in the summer accused many independent schools of living in "splendid isolation" from the state sector.He drew criticism from some in the private school sector this week too, for saying some schools' links with state schools were small, like crumbs from their tables.Some responded angrily, saying that their schools saved taxpayers money by educating children outside of the state sector.Both Labour and coalition governments have called for more links between private and state sector schools.All the academy's funding is from the government, says Mr Wilne and there is no direct funding from private schools.But there is support "in kind" and through links. Some of the governors are from the independent schools in the partnership."We draw on their various expertise and resources," says the headmaster."So if I want a scheme of work [curriculum plan] for maths, I go to to Highgate and ask for that. The head of economics at Brighton College is de facto head of economics here."They have been down and given feedback and mentoring support."Mr Wilne hopes the school will help social mobility."Education is the fuel of social mobility, education changes lives," he says."This 360 degree education we are offering here should fuel that mobility. Students will get the grades that will unlock doors to top universities and they are taking up extra-curricular activities and sports."They are interested in meeting others and they are not going to be daunted by meeting Etonians in the future."Sport, it seems, has also proved to be a good ice-breaker between students at the various schools."We enjoy visiting them as much as the sport," says Yousef.Curtis says he is enjoying trying out new sports."There is so much sport available. We do rowing. In my secondary school, we did rowing on a rowing machine, now we get to go on the water."With the first full exam season under its belt, the academy is now into its second year. The pioneer year looks to be a hard act to follow, having achieved 70% of their AS-levels at grades of A or B.Three students, including Ellie, spent part of the summer in the USA on a summer school after being encouraged to apply."I always wanted to go to university but did not aspire to the top ones," she said.The students say the school has widened their horizons, with encouragement to do so often coming in the shape of one of the many emails pumped out by their headmaster telling them of various opportunities."I get worried if I don't get an email from the head," one teenager says.They are getting help with their university applications and personal statements from one of the visiting teachers from the private sector.Student Harmanpreet says: "Our old head was always saying it's not about where you come from but where you are going."We know we are from a deprived area but LAE has shown us where we want to go."</body>

      <title>Freshers' fun? Not for the cleaners</title>
      <description>Fun for students but not the university cleaners</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24275092</url>
      <date>1380759129</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70229000/jpg/_70229425_166281571.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Students are returning for the new university term. There will be parties, long beery nights and bleary late mornings. It's the binge-fest of freshers' week.But for cleaners at one London university, it is the "worst week of the year" when there is "double work".The students and the cleaners share the university campus; they both work here, but to very different timetables. The cleaners are on the way to work before some of the students will be on the way home.University cleaners start work from 04:00, travelling through the dark streets on buses from the edges of the capital.Mostly Spanish speakers from South and Central America, many will have begun their journey more than an hour earlier.While the new term means freshers' parties for students, there's a different kind of freshening going on for the cleaners.They will have cleaned the toilets, emptied the bins, swept the floor, wiped the desks, while the students and their teachers will have been asleep. It's a double life for this university.As the first students begin to come through the doors in the morning, holding on to their textbooks and takeaway coffees, the cleaners have already finished their shifts.But they haven't finished working. Many will have multiple jobs, a few hours at a time, criss-crossing London by bus because the Tube fares are too expensive and they're not paid for the travelling in between.One university cleaner, who wants to remain anonymous, describes his daily timetable and gives his perspective on university life.He leaves his home at 03:00 for the first of three cleaning jobs. He works shifts from 04:00 - 06:00 and then 06:00 - 16:30 in central London and then finishes with a two-hour shift in south London, between 17:30 and 19:30.Then he goes home to his three children and gets ready to start work again the next morning.He works five days a week, but he says he has colleagues who work like this six or seven days a week."Sometimes I don't want to wake up. But I can't afford to miss a single day."It's dirty. People leave their rubbish on the floor. You think they would appreciate you, but you get into the lift and they turn away from you."That affects me. When you're trying to clean the toilets, people get cross. There's a lack of respect - it's very hard."Is it because we're cleaners? Because we're foreigners and we don't speak the language?"It's easy for families to break up, he says. Children without parents around can get into trouble. With no spare cash, people have to borrow and quickly get into high-interest borrowing. Long hours are worked to pay high London rents.And before making any assumptions about who gets caught up in this cycle, he says he works alongside cleaners who in their own countries had been a lawyer, a psychologist and a teacher. He is a graduate himself, before coming to the UK more than a decade ago.What's the worst part of cleaning?He says it's the toilets. And he can't understand how people can leave the bathrooms in such a bad way.Just as crushing is the sense of not being valued, particularly in an educational institution, where students debate ideas of equality, labour rights and social justice."I thought people would behave well, they would have courtesy, good manners."Instead, he says, even when he has been taking out a bin from below someone's desk they've refused to acknowledge him.These might be corridors of learning. But someone still has to clean them.Not speaking much English, competing at the most precarious end of the temporary labour market, cleaners are vulnerable to being exploited. It's part of the reason that he doesn't want to be identified.A previous contractor owed the cleaners money for three months, he says.They can't take their concerns to the university, because they work for an international outsourcing company. And there have been long-running campaigns over pay and conditions.But without being part of the university staff, the cleaners still share the same buildings, a parallel set of footsteps in the libraries, the lecture halls, the classrooms, unseen during the hours before dawn.He says they see the photos of families on the desks each day, they prepare the rooms. Without any sign of self-pity, he says: "Some of these tables are cleaned with tears."It's a tale of two cities invisible to one another.</body>

      <title>Angry Birds fires into the classroom</title>
      <description>Do video games have a place in the classroom?</description>

      <body>From Angry Birds to Minecraft, computer games are invading the classroom. But this is not going on behind the teacher's back anymore: it is part of the lesson plan.The average young person will have spent 10,000 hours gaming by the time they are 21 years old, research suggests.This has been mainly for entertainment, providing light relief from the maths textbooks and science experiments taking place in classrooms. But gaming is taking up more time of a child's life.For a child in the US with perfect attendance, 10,080 hours will be spent in school from fifth grade (age 10) to high school graduation, according to game designer Jane McGonigal.In the UK, computer games offering "stealth learning" have been used by many schools. But the big developers have generally, so far at least, not been keen to get involved.Angry Birds creator Rovio has brought Angry Birds Playground, a schools initiative devised with the University of Helsinki in Finland, into the kindergarten classroom of children, aimed at six-year-olds.With the initiative already in use in Finland, Rovio has now entered into an agreement with schools in China."With small children, the Finnish approach to education is very much play-orientated," says Sanna Lukander, vice president of book publishing at Rovio Entertainment."These characters and their world seemed to inspire children. You can't not think about how you might motivate children to do more than play."Finland is rated as having the best education system in the developed world.And it is not just the same edition of Angry Birds re-packaged: it is using the now-famous characters in new education-based games and a "full 360-degree approach to learning" involving books, teachers and digital devices.But what is it that children can learn from computer games which can really help with the hard learning needed in the classroom?"Games have a larger effect on learning than traditional materials in particular areas, like language acquisition, science, mathematics and social studies," says games scholar Professor Constance Steinkuehler, a former White House analyst."It's not just making the game, it's then about going back and assessing it - is it having the impact and educating in the way you hoped?"If you're talking about games in the classroom, games aren't the only vehicle for learning. You have a teacher, you have peer interaction and a structure of activities, that all plays a role, whether it's productive or whether it's rubbish."It's just like giving a textbook - you can have a fabulous one you can do great stuff with or not."And Rovio is keen to point out that it is not just the games having an impact in the classroom."Angry Birds Playground is not an educational game, it's an educational environment," says Ms Lukander."We couldn't put Angry Birds stickers on learning and just export it. It's a lot of careful RandD and research. It's been in the works for two and a half years."What this means is more than just using a slingshot to launch birds at pigs.Rovio has already worked with the publishers Penguin, National Geographic, Nasa, the National Geographic and others on educational books. It is not even branding itself as a games company but as a media company,But it is not the only media company in educational games.At the more avant garde end of games aimed at educating children, there are shooting games attempting to make chewing vegetables seem cool right through to combating sexually transmitted infections with a choice of superhero characters like Willy the Kid.Yes, really.More widely, Minecraft, the virtual world game, is being used in classrooms in all sorts of innovative ways."Minecraft is one of the most important games for learning right now," says Prof Steinkuehler."What kids are doing with Minecraft is mind-blowing. It's just amazing."In a classroom at Reykjavik University in Iceland, just like many others, Minecraft is used as a 3D graphical interface to help young people understand the basics of telling a computer what to do.According to MinecraftEdu, which is working with around 1,000 schools, the game is being used in every subject area across all school age groups, providing digital building blocks of what a lesson can demonstrate and teach.But interestingly, Minecraft is blocked by a number of school firewalls.And there are those who think games in the classroom do more harm than good."Gaming in the classroom might be frivolous at worst or entertaining at best," says teacher and author Dr Gary Stager.Current systems of education, Dr Stager argues, are seen as "unpleasant, tortuous and create a league table of winners and losers". But games in the classroom are not the way to fix it."The games developed for education tend to be a lot less fun, interesting and merely test prior knowledge," he says."Worst of all, they're coercive. Adults are taking something kids love - games - and using them in a coercive fashion to deliver curriculum."But the technology companies working with children see the move towards gaming and technology as inevitable. LeapFrog's LeapPad2 tablet device was one of the best-selling toys last year."Children already live in a multi-screen environment," says Sally Plumridge, LeapFrog's international marketing director."The whole world they work in is much more interactive. Bringing gaming into their lives really allows them to develop those cognitive skills.""There's still a need to learn in a traditional way; however, the way that traditional learning extends into new technologies just gives a different dimension to education and a more practical dimension."Children develop in role play and looking what their parents do. From a very early age, they see their parents with tablets and phones."Their instincts in that world of what to do and when to do it are much more enhanced than our own. We're learning it and they're growing up with it."Perhaps that is why so many parents look to their children for help when their phone stops working - they've spent 10,000 hours on these devices before they turn 21.</body>

      <title>IMF chief warns of recession risk</title>
      <description>The head of the International Monetary Fund warns a US default could spark a global recession, as the deadlock in Congress continues.</description>

      <body>The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, has warned that a US default could tip the world into recession.In a US TV interview she said a default would result in "massive disruption the world over".The US Treasury will start to run short of funds on Thursday if no agreement is reached for it to raise its debt limit.Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate held direct talks for the first time in weeks on Saturday.But there is little sign of any breakthrough, correspondents say.In an interview with ABC's Meet the Press Christine Lagarde said America must now raise the debt ceiling before Thursday's deadline."If there is that degree of disruption, that lack of certainty, that lack of trust in the US signature, it would mean massive disruption the world over and we would be at risk of tipping yet again into recession," she said.The president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, has also expressed his concern over the situation.He warned that the United States is just "days away from a very dangerous moment" because of the government's borrowing crisis.Mr Kim urged US policymakers to reach a deal to raise the government's debt ceiling before Thursday's deadline.He warned this could be a "disastrous event" for the world."The closer we get to the deadline the greater the impact will be for the developing world."Inaction could result in interest rates rising, confidence falling and growth slowing," said Mr Kim, speaking at the World Bank's annual meeting in Washington."If this comes to pass it could be a disastrous event for the developing world and that will in turn greatly hurt the developed economies as well," he added.If the US does run short of cash, this could cause it to default on its debts, a development which would be likely to have a severe effect on financial markets around the world.The BBC's Andrew Walker said that finance ministers from other countries think the US probably won't default, but they are uneasy and want the crisis resolved very soon.Republicans and Democrats failed to come to an agreement on Saturday, but Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat, said the aim was to reach a deal on extending the debt limit before markets reopen on Monday.The White House rejected a deal for a short-term increase to the borrowing limit."It wouldn't be wise, as some suggest, to just kick the debt ceiling can down the road for a couple of months, and flirt with a first-ever intentional default right in the middle of the holiday shopping season," said President Barack Obama.The US government has been in partial shutdown since Congress missed a 1 October deadline to pass a budget, with politicians being unable to agree funding for current spending.This has resulted in hundreds of thousands of federal employees being sent home and government offices closing.Republicans refused to approve the new budget unless President Obama agreed to delay or eliminate the funding of the healthcare reform law of 2010.US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has estimated that each week the government is shut down, 0.25% is shaved off economic growth, which was already expected to be a sluggish this quarter.Mr Lew has also has warned that letting talks over the debt ceiling go down to the wire "could be very dangerous".The current debt limit of $16.699 trillion was reached in May.Since then the US Treasury has been using what are called extraordinary measures to keep paying the bills, but those measures run out on 17 October.Every week, the Treasury also has to refinance $100bn worth of debt in the form of US government bonds known as treasuries.The US also has to pay interest on its huge debt burden.An inability to pay that interest, or pay back debt if required, would put the US into default.On Saturday, Jamie Dimon, boss of the American bank JP Morgan said the possible repercussions did not bear thinking about."You don't want to know [what would happen]," he said."It would ripple through the world economy in a way that you couldn't possibly understand."</body>

      <title>Eurozone industrial output picks up</title>
      <description>Factories in the eurozone beat forecasts in August, as official figures for industrial output show the strongest growth for two years.</description>

      <body>Industrial output in the eurozone grew at the strongest pace for more than two years in August, figures have shown.Factories in the 17-country bloc saw output rise by 1% in the month, which was better than analysts' forecasts.The figures showed that the highest increase was registered in Portugal, where output grew by 8.2%.Europe's economic powerhouse, Germany, saw output rise 1.8%, while French output increased by 0.2% following three consecutive months of decline.However, output in Italy fell by 0.3%. This was the second decline in a row, as Italy's economy continued to falter.Germany, France and Italy make up two-thirds of the overall production figure for the eurozone.Chris Williamson, chief economist at the researchers Markit, said that while the figures were encouraging there was still cause for concern over the strength of the bloc's recovery.While production had rebounded in August, he noted that this "merely brings output back to June's level, which was still some 12.5% below its pre-crisis peak".However, he added that the upturn is "an encouraging sign that the sector is slowly recovering"."Policymakers will be encouraged by the ongoing recovery trend, but will be reminded of the huge surplus of capacity that persists compared to before the crisis struck."In August, the eurozone emerged from an 18-month recession, after reporting growth of 0.3%.However, economists have cautioned that growth and manufacturing figures will remain choppy, and that the recovery from recession is far from secure.Earlier this month, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi said that the economic recovery in the eurozone remained "weak, fragile, uneven".</body>

      <body>The 2013 Nobel Prize in economics has been awarded to Eugene Fama, Lars Peter Hansen and Robert Shiller.It was awarded for their "empirical analysis of asset prices", according to the awarding committee.The committee said the trio's separate pieces of work had "laid the foundation for the current understanding of asset prices".The prize is worth 8m Swedish krona (£775,000; $1.2m), which will be shared equally among the three winners.Eugene Fama from the University of Chicago was praised for demonstrating that share prices are extremely difficult to predict in the short run, with new information quickly incorporated into prices.The committee said Mr Fama's findings had had "a profound impact" on subsequent research, and also changed market practice.Lars Peter Hansen, also from the University of Chicago, was awarded the prize for his development of a statistical method that was able to test theories on asset pricing.Robert Shiller, from Yale University, was included for his 1980s discovery that stock prices fluctuate much more than corporate dividends.The Nobel committees have now announced all six of their annual awards for 2013.The economics award was added to the existing Nobel award in 1968 by Sweden's central bank as a memorial to Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel.Mr Nobel created the other five prizes for medicine, chemistry, physics, literature and peace in 1895.</body>

      <title>UK to relax visa rules for Chinese</title>
      <description>The UK government will relax visa rules for Chinese nationals coming to the UK, Chancellor George Osborne announces during his China trade trip.</description>

      <body>Visa applications for Chinese visitors entering the UK will be simplified, Chancellor George Osborne has announced during his trade trip to China.Under the plan, Chinese nationals visiting the EU will not need to submit separate UK visa applications if they book with selected travel agents.Mr Osborne is trying to persuade more Chinese companies to invest in the UK.But he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that his trip was also about changing British attitudes to China."Many people think of China as a sweat shop on the Pearl River. Yet it is at the forefront of medicine, computing and technology. It's a very rapidly changing country."Earlier, Mr Osborne told an audience of students that his visit was about "much more than a collection of business deals"."What I really want it to be about is strengthening the understanding between our two nations, deepening our friendship, working out where by working together we can improve the lives of all our citizens," he said in a speech to university students in Beijing."Yes, of course, we have differences, different political systems, we attach value to different things, and we shouldn't be afraid of pointing out where we disagree."But let us not do it in a way that is not respectful of each other and tries to understand each other, and let us try to overcome our differences and work together in peaceful co-operation."Because ultimately we want the same thing - a better life for our citizens."Adam Marshall, director of policy at business lobby group the British Chambers of Commerce, said UK businesses would "breathe a collective sigh of relief" at the plans to simplify Chinese visa applications."For too long, Britain has courted Chinese investment and tourism without facilitating the entry of Chinese visitors with the same vigour. A responsive visa system is crucial to demonstrating that the UK is open to trade and investment," he added.During his week-long trip, Mr Osborne has already unveiled a deal in which a Chinese firm took a 20% stake in a new business park in Manchester.And on Sunday came details of the visa changes.Currently, Chinese visitors can apply for a single visa to visit much of Europe but a separate one is required to travel to the UK.It is thought that the extra paperwork is deterring many Chinese visitors from including the UK in a trip to Europe.A mobile visa scheme that already operates in Beijing and Shanghai will be expanded as part of the changes.Under the mobile service, which was first tested by executives at Wanda, the company that bought Sunseeker yachts, officials go out to applicants to collect their paperwork and biometric data.The process can take less than five minutes.A 24-hour "super priority" visa service will also be available from next summer. The moves will be welcomed by UK businesses who want to benefit from Chinese tourists.In his speech, Mr Osborne said: "Let me make this clear to you and to the whole of China, there is no limit to the number of Chinese who could study in Britain."There is no limit to the number of Chinese tourists who can visit. No limit on the amount of business we can do together."According to the government, last year 210,000 visas were issued to Chinese nationals and they contributed about £300m to the UK economy.</body>

      <body>WH Smith has taken its UK site completely offline until all abuse-themed e-books are removed from its product listings.The move comes after last week's revelations that Amazon, WH Smith, Barnes and Noble, and other retailers were selling pornographic e-books featuring incest, rape and bestiality on their sites.WH Smith said it was "disgusted" by such titles and found them "unacceptable".It takes e-book content from Kobo.com.In a statement Kobo said it was "working quickly to review its catalogue and remove the content, authors and publishers in question"."We are also evaluating new procedures to help ensure that this type of content will not become available... in the future," it said.Meanwhile visitors to the WHSmith.co.uk website were greeted by a holding page statement.The retailer said it had taken the site offline "to best protect our customers and the public"."Our website will become live again once all self published e-books have been removed and we are totally sure that there are no offending titles available", it said."We sincerely apologise for any offence caused."While Kobo said some publishers and authors had violated its self-publishing policies, it maintained that its goal was "not to negatively impact the freedom of expression and the work of the amazing self-published community that has been created at Kobo.com."Over the weekend US retailing giant Barnes and Noble said offending titles were "in violation" of its policy on content offered in the NOOK Bookstore and were in the process of being removed."When there are violations to the content policy that are brought to our attention, either through our internal process or from a customer or external source, we have a rapid response team in place to appropriately categorise or remove the content in accordance with our policy," it said.Self-published e-books have grown massively in popularity along with the growth in digital e-readers and tablet computers, but retailers have been struggling to filter explicit content that breaches their website guidelines.On Friday, technology news site The Kernel revealed how Amazon, Barnes and Noble, WH Smith, Waterstones and Foyles were listing what it called "breathtakingly obscene" books on their websites.But Fiona Allen, spokeswoman for Waterstones, told the BBC: "None of the e-books mentioned in current reporting are now or ever have been available in Waterstones shops or listed on Waterstones' website."She admitted that Waterstones was concerned about some print titles and was investigating those, but that all such printed book data was supplied by Nielsen, a data provider.</body>

      <body>Google is facing a backlash over plans to put people's faces and comments about products and places into adverts.The "shared endorsements" policy change starts on 11 November and covers the comments, "follows" and other actions people do on Google+.One protest involves people swapping their profile pictures for that of Google boss Eric Schmidt so his image rather than their own appears on ads.Google said it had made it easy for people to opt out of the system.The search giant started alerting people about the upcoming policy change via banners on its main webpage and in a page explaining the change to its "policies and principles".Google also gave examples of how the "shared endorsement" system might work. This showed people's faces and comments appearing below Street View images of a bagel shop and search results for products and places.Many people protested about the change to Google, and some altered their image profiles on the Google+ social network in response.So far, Google has not issued an official comment about the protests over "shared endorsements". However, in its explanatory pages it said it was easy to opt out of the system by clicking a box on the Google+ account settings page.It warned that if people did not want to be part of the programme some of their comments and follows may no longer be visible to others they know on Google+.Social network Facebook faced strong criticism over a similar system called "sponsored stories" it rolled out in 2011.Legal action following the criticism eventually led to Facebook paying out $20m to compensate people whose images it used without permission.</body>

      <body>David Cameron has announced a consultation aimed at helping small businesses get paid on time.The prime minister's move follows YouGov research showing 85% of small firms had experienced late payment over the last two years, despite an existing government-backed scheme.Collectively, small and medium-sized firms are owed £30.2bn, data from electronic transfer firm BACs suggests."I am clear that more needs to be done," said Mr Cameron."It's not right that suppliers are not getting paid on time for the work they do and the services they provide and I know that late payment can have devastating effects on our small and medium-sized businesses," added Mr Cameron.The consultation comes after many criticised the effectiveness of the Prompt Payment Code, which was was established in December 2008 in order to help small suppliers get paid on time.About 1,500 firms have signed up to it, but the Federation of Small Business (FSB) says some signatories have still managed to stretch settlement periods to as long as 120 days.This is far longer than the limit set by an EU directive, which says business-to-business payments should be made within 60 days and public sector bills should be paid within 30 days.John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, welcomed the consultation."Being paid late or given extended terms can severely hamper many small firms. They simply don't have the same cash-flow buffer as large businesses," he added.EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, also praised the plan to launch a consultation."Payment terms can be a major issue for smaller firms, particularly given the financing constraints and uncertainty they face," said Lee Hopley, chief EEF economist.The government's consultation will be launched later this year and will ask for views on a number of areas including:</body>

      <body>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has said it could fine banks who mis-sold complex loan insurance products.The deals were meant to give borrowers security against rising interest rates but with rates at an historic low many businesses saw their payments soar.A redress scheme set up by the FCA to review 30,000 cases in July 2012 has resulted in only 32 businesses receiving compensation to date.The products were sold to protect borrowers from interest rate increases.But with interest rates at an historic low many businesses have seen their payments soar.Many companies claimed that they were pressurised into buying these products by various major banks.They said they were told by banks that they could only have their loan on the condition they took out the swap deal as well, and that in some cases they were given very little time to make a decision.The only way to end the contract was to pay a huge fee.Michael Whelan has run Kites Nursery in south Wales with his wife Catherine for five years. He said he had no knowledge of this type of product."I didn't even know what a swap was. It's something that would never have crossed my mind even to know that it existed," he said.Figures from Barclays initially suggested they would have to pay £12,500 to extricate themselves from the deal. Michael says in the end they were quoted £100,000.He said his life has been put on hold for the last five years."I take tablets, antidepressants, beta blockers... diazepam. I have to sleep, because I can't sleep with the worry."Barclays says it has suspended Kites Nursery's interest rate swap payments."After four months, Kites Nursery have responded to our invitation to give an account of the sale from their perspective," the bank added."Under the oversight of the independent reviewer, we are now progressing the case as fast as we can. If we made mistakes, we will put them right."BBC Panorama has spoken to a whistle-blower who had worked in banking for 40 years. He did not want to be identified but said that the scandal was driven by big bonuses."They were selling complicated instruments to people who didn't understand them," he said."The sale of swaps was very aggressive and distorted because your bonus was linked to how much profit you generated."The senior management were pushing these things. You can get double your salary as a bonus, your boss got a bonus, and his bosses got bonuses."Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said the mis-selling of these products was a cultural problem."In some cases the banks were selling more complicated products than they needed to because they made more profit from it."I think there was a particular period - and if we look at the period 2005 to 2008 - where I think the moral compass was lost in banking."He said that the FCA would consider fining banks after the redress scheme had closed."There will be cases where we may need to take further action. We're not talking about that at the moment because we're focussed on getting people their money back," he said.Panorama: Britain's New Banking Scandal, BBC One, Monday 14 October at 20:30 BST and then available in the UK on the BBC iPlayer.</body>

      <body>Global furniture giant Ikea has reported a rise in full-year sales and says it managed to gain market share in almost all its markets.Global sales jumped 3.1% to 27.9bn euros ($37.8bn; £23.6bn) in the 12 months to the end of August, Ikea said.Like-for-like sales, which strip out the impact of new stores, rose 1.8% in the same period.The chain, which is the world's largest furniture retailer, has said it wants to double sales to 50bn euros by 2020.Ikea, which has its headquarters in Sweden, said some of the strongest growth was in Russia and China, and that it had also made significant progress in North America during the year."While southern Europe continued being affected by the current economic situation, the Ikea group continued gaining market shares in almost all markets," Ikea said in a statement.Ikea said its stores were visited by 690 million people in the year.The privately owned firm, famed for its flat-pack furniture and huge warehouse-like stores, now has 303 stores globally.</body>

      <body>Opponents of the development of a type of genetically modified (GM) rice enriched with vitamin A are "wicked", the environment secretary has said.In an interview with the Independent, Owen Paterson said they could be condemning millions of people in the developing world to a premature death.Mr Paterson backed a letter from international scientists calling for the rapid development of "golden rice".But campaigners say the benefits claimed for the rice are misleading.Mr Paterson told the newspaper: "It's just disgusting that little children are allowed to go blind and die because of a hang-up by a small number of people about this technology."I feel really strongly about it. I think what they do is absolutely wicked. There is no other word for it."Mr Paterson did not specify any particular groups in his interview but also said opponents of GM technology were "casting a dark shadow over attempts to feed the world".BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said Mr Paterson was known as a strong supporter of GM crops but his language seemed certain to raise hackles with those who took a different view.A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokeswoman said it was Mr Paterson's strong personal view.People in the developed usually world get enough vitamin A from their diet by eating foods like cheese, yoghurts and eggs.But deficiency is a common problem in developing countries, and is estimated to affect between 140 million and 250 million children under the age of five.Vitamin A is needed for healthy skin and eyes and to help strengthen the immune system so that the body can fight infections. Deficiency can lead to blindness, illness and death.Supplements are available and the World Health Organisation advocates routine administration of vitamin A in countries where deficiency is a problem.High doses of vitamin A can be harmful, however, particularly in pregnancyMeanwhile, in a letter to US journal Science, a group of leading academics has accused Western non-governmental organisations of fuelling opposition to the development of GM technologies.They wrote: "If ever there was a clear-cut cause for outrage, it is the concerted campaign by Greenpeace and other non-governmental organisations, as well as by individuals, against golden rice."Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth have said there are more effective solutions to vitamin A deficiency.Mr Paterson also used the interview to defend the government's handling of the badger cull - aimed at preventing the spread of bovine TB - against criticism from animal welfare groups.He said: "I cannot understand anyone wanting to tolerate this disgusting disease."I find it incomprehensible that these badger groups don't see that this is a horrendous disease for the badgers themselves."</body>

      <body>Consumer prices in China rose more than forecast in September, fuelled mainly by a surge in food prices.Prices rose 3.1% during the month, from a year earlier, up from 2.6% in August, the National Bureau of Statistics said.The bureau said that food prices rose 6.1% from a year ago due to the impact of national holidays, as well as droughts and floods in some regions.Some analysts said that rising prices had reduced the chance of any major monetary policy moves by Beijing."The rise of consumer price index (CPI) inflation leaves little room for policy easing," said Zhiwei Zhang, an economist with Nomura.He added that prices were likely to rise further and that there was a risk the rate of inflation could even be above the government's 3.5% target for some months in 2014.China, the world's second-largest economy, has been trying to recover from a recent slump which has seen its growth rate slow for two quarters in a row.Its economy expanded by 7.5% in the April-to-June quarter from a year earlier - down from a growth rate of 7.7% in the previous three months.There have been concerns that its growth rate may slow further in the coming months, not least because of a slowdown in demand for Chinese exports from key markets such as the US and Europe.While there have been some indications in recent weeks that its growth may be on the mend, data released over the weekend triggered concerns over whether the recovery was sustainable.China's exports, a key driver of its growth, fell 0.3% in September from a year earlier, indicating that external demand continues to remain fragile.Zhou Hao, an economist with ANZ in Shanghai, said the weak export numbers show that "the economy faces some downward pressures".Meanwhile, imports rose a more-than-forecast 7.4% from a year ago.</body>

      <body>India's inflation rate rose to a seven-month high in September, limiting the room for authorities to ease monetary policy as they look to spur growth.The Wholesale Price Index, India's main gauge of inflation, rose 6.46% from a year earlier, up from 6.1% in August.Rising consumer prices have been a concern for policymakers, preventing them from taking aggressive measures to boost India's slowing economy.Analysts say the central bank could raise interest rates as a result."This will not give much comfort for Reserve Bank of India (RBI)... and sets [the economy] up for a rate hike in the upcoming policy review at the end of the month," said Badrish Kulhalli, a fixed-income fund manager at HDFC Standard Life Insurance.India's central bank raised its key interest rates last month to 7.5% from 7.25%, in an attempt by the bank to keep price rises in check.The data comes after India, Asia's third-largest economy, has seen its growth rate decline.Its economy grew at an annual rate of 5% in the 2012-13 financial year, the slowest pace in 10 years.There are concerns that its growth rate may dip further, amid a slowdown in the manufacturing sector and declining foreign investment in the country,That has triggered calls for the central bank to ease some of its policies, in an effort to spur a fresh wave of economic growth.However, rising consumer prices and the rupee's recent weakness have caused the central bank to tighten its policies instead.Analysts said the continued rise in the consumer prices might prompt the RBI to stick to its current policy."Inflation numbers are a complete letdown," said Deven Choksey, managing director of KR Choksey Securities Ltd."Markets are disappointed as traders have been expecting the Reserve Bank of India to go on a rate reduction programme, and that is where low inflation would have helped."</body>

      <body>The operator of the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical site is to begin talks with union bosses in a bid to avert a planned 48-hour strike.Members of the Unite union are planning to walk out on Sunday in a row over the treatment of a union convener.Ineos, operator of the site, said negotiations would start later at arbitration service Acas, in Glasgow.Unite said it had been "working tirelessly" over the weekend to secure the talks.Ineos has warned that the threatened strike "could effectively shut much of Scotland" by disrupting fuel supply.The strike could potentially disrupt the flow of Brent crude from the North Sea.The Scottish and UK governments have been drawing up contingency plans and had called for more talks between the two sides.Announcing the talks on Sunday night, Ineos Grangemouth chairman Calum MacLean said: "We have always been prepared to go to Acas if this helps to resolve a strike that Grangemouth petrochemical plant and refinery cannot afford."We hope to be able to resolve the dispute and address the financial issues that threaten the survival of the entire site."Previously, the company labelled the union action as "completely irresponsible" while the union accused Ineos of "gunboat irresponsible diplomacy".Unite Scottish Secretary Pat Rafferty said: "We welcome Ineos's change of heart to join us at Acas."We've repeatedly urged the company to sit down with us at the conciliation service to resolve the issues surrounding the unfair treatment of our convenor and the future of Grangemouth."Over the weekend we have been working tirelessly to secure these talks and hope that the company will engage in them in an open constructive manner."UK Energy Secretary Ed Davey said the talks were a "very welcome and encouraging step."He added: "I have worked hard with both sides to persuade them to attend talks with Acas and I am extremely pleased that this is now happening."Acas has the expertise to help both parties reach a sustainable solution for the company, the workforce and the whole economy."A spokeswoman for the Scottish government said contingency planning had been under way since the strike was announced.She said: "Ministers and officials have redoubled efforts to encourage Unite and Ineos to enter talks and we welcome the fact that they are now going to talk this afternoon."It is important that both sides have time and space to progress discussions, resolve the issues between them and move away from strike action."Ineos has said it will do all it can to "minimise the harm" of a strike.The North Sea's Forties pipeline system could be affected because the Kinneil oil processing terminal - where oil from the Forties field comes ashore - relies on Grangemouth for its steam and power.The dispute centres on union convener Stephen Deans, who was involved in the row over the selection of a Labour candidate in Falkirk.Labour cleared Unite after an investigation of trying to rig the selection of a party candidate - claims that led to a major row between the union and Ed Miliband.Mr Deans, who is chairman of both Labour's local constituency party and Unite in Scotland, was suspended by Ineos then reinstated.Ineos said an investigation by "a third party" into Mr Deans' conduct was due to be completed by 25 October.It recently launched a survival plan for Grangemouth, warning that the site would close by 2017 without investment and reduced costs. The company said the plant was losing £10m a month.The Grangemouth refinery processes 210,000 barrels of oil per day and provides most of Scotland's fuel. It is owned jointly by Ineos and PetroChina.</body>

      <body>The risk of a housing bubble in the UK is "extremely slim", according to one of the country's leading economic forecasters, the EY Item Club.In its quarterly report on the economy, the Item Club said government schemes such as Help to Buy will help boost house prices by 3.5% this year.It also forecast that house prices will rise 6.6% next year.Business Secretary Vince Cable is one of those concerned about the effects of the Help to Buy scheme.Last month he said there were already signs of "serious housing inflationary pressures" in parts of the country.And in an interview with the Financial Times on Monday, the chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, Antonio Horta-Osorio expressed his concerns.He said that new home building needed to be encouraged by easing planning restrictions, to avoid a "substantial" increase in house prices.But Peter Spencer, the Item Club's chief economic adviser, said government efforts to revive the mortgage market had been "well-timed and targeted"."Despite the recent criticism of these initiatives, the chances of seeing another housing market bubble are extremely slim," he said."House prices and transactions are only just recovering from the credit crunch and will be paltry in comparison to those of a decade ago."Household finances are also in much better shape, with debt to income ratios now at sustainable levels."Under the second phase of the Help to Buy scheme, now in place, borrowers across the UK can put down a deposit of as little as 5% of the property price.The government provides a seven-year taxpayer guarantee to the lender covering 15% of the loan value. It is available for properties sold for up to £600,000 in the UK.The Item Club forecasts investment in new housing will rise by 7.5% next year and an additional 10% in 2015.It has also raised its forecast for economic growth this year to 1.4%, up from 1.1%. And next year it expects growth of 2.4%, up from its previous forecast of 2.2%.</body>

      <title>'Massive' energy investment expected</title>
      <description>Britain's energy sector is close to securing tens of billions of pounds in investment from the Far East, Energy Secretary Ed Davey says.</description>

      <body>Britain's energy sector is close to securing tens of billions of pounds in investment from the Far East, Energy Secretary Ed Davey has said.He said a "massive" wave of investment in nuclear and other technology from China, Japan and Korea would help secure the UK's future power supply.A deal to build new reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset was close, he added.Labour has said the government is not doing enough, but Mr Davey called its record on energy investment "shocking".His comments come amid a fierce political row over household energy bills, with SSE becoming the first of the "big six" energy firms to announce a sharp increase in prices last week.Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Mr Davey said he had made "huge progress" during a recent visit to China - during which he spoke to all of the country's major energy suppliers about boosting two-way investment."The Chinese, along with the Japanese and the Koreans are very interested in the opportunities in the British nuclear sector. I think it is really possible we will see massive Chinese investment, not just in nuclear but across the board.""I think we will see massive Japanese and Korean investment. It is really critical we get that investment," he said.Recent reports have suggested China General Nuclear Power Group could take a 49% stake in the French-led consortium seeking to develop Hinkley Point.Under existing proposals, two new nuclear reactors would replace those set to stop operating in the middle of the next decade.Mr Davey indicated the UK was also "extremely close" to a deal with EDF - one of Britain's big six energy firms - to invest in Hinkley.The government has said the state will not directly subsidise the building of new nuclear plants but has insisted that new generating capacity is essential - alongside other forms of energy - to meet the UK's growing energy needs.Mr Davey told the programme that, when an agreement was finally reached, he was "convinced I will be able to look consumers in the eyes, look businesses in the eyes, and say we have a good deal".The energy secretary also played down suggestions of differences with Tory Chancellor George Osborne - who is currently in China on a trade mission - over energy policy, saying they were "stuck together" on the need to substantially increase levels of investment.Elsewhere in the programme, Mr Davey said he expected other firms to follow SSE and raise energy prices, but he made no apology for seeking to upgrade and modernise the UK's energy system.Energy companies have said one of the reasons they are having to hike prices is to pay for huge investment in the UK's generation and distribution infrastructure.The energy secretary said he had written to the largest firms to ask them what they were doing to simplify their bills, so consumers could understand what they were being charged.He said he expected answers from them by Monday.Ministers have dismissed Labour's pledge of a price freeze on energy bills after 2015, arguing the way to help consumers is to increase competition and make it easier for people to switch supplier in order to access the best possible tariff.Mr Davey told the programme Labour's warnings about a looming energy crisis rang hollow."The lights are going to stay on. Since this government came to power, we have been running to increase energy investment. Labour's energy investment record was frankly shocking."They were negligent with energy and climate change policy. We are the ones delivering the new power stations, the policies to deliver the billions of pounds of investment."Meanwhile, Labour said the government was building false expectations about the benefits of shale gas and was presenting it as an alternative to renewable energy.Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint told Sky News Labour was not opposed to fracking in Britain, but warned it was not yet known at what cost it could be produced."We are not setting our face against it if the conditions are right and the environment is right, but what we do disagree with is polarising shale against renewables that we need as well," she said.</body>

      <body>Workers in the UK are less happy than those in France, Germany, the US, Canada and Australia, said a report by recruitment agency Randstad.The study estimated 9.9m British workers are unsatisfied with their jobs.Randstad said the disillusionment increased turnover and absenteeism, and could account for problems of low productivity.The survey involved 45,000 employees from 32 countries.People at the start and end of their career are the happiest, it found.In the UK, 67% of workers reported they were fulfilled, compared to 68% in France and Germany, 73% in the Netherlands, and 74% in Belgium.The trend was replicated outside of Europe, with 70% of workers in Australia reporting they were satisfied, 73% in New Zealand, 74% in the US and 77% in Canada.Mark Bull, chief executive at Randstad, said: "We are issuing a rallying call to employers to join us in action to address the state of fulfilment at work in the UK."Job satisfaction diminishes in the middle of people's careers when they are aged between 35 and 44, research found.Mr Bull said the research showed a mid-career crisis was a "very real phenomenon"."Those who are midway through their career often reflect on the professional path they have taken and where that path is leading them," he said."And this leaves many with a feeling of anxiety that they are not fulfilled in what they do and nor are they fulfilling their potential."Mr Bull advised employers to ensure they were hiring older workers as well as "passionate young people".</body>

      <title>No driving licence until 19?</title>
      <description>New research for the government suggests that young drivers shouldn't be able to qualify for a full licence until they are 19 years old.</description>

      <body>Teenagers, get ready to be outraged.Some new research put together for the government suggests that young drivers shouldn't be able to qualify for a full licence until they are 19 years old.In effect, it's proposing that 17 year olds have to spend at least a year learning how to drive before taking their test. After they pass they'll then have to spend another year on "probation", with some chunky restrictions on what they can do.For example, no driving between 22:00 and 05:00 unless you have someone over 30 years old in the car. Why? Because 30-year-olds are more sensible.It stops people filling their Vauxhall Viva with boisterous teenagers. You'll have to drive around with a green "P" plate on the car.Can you imagine police patrols trying to work out at a glance whether someone's 30 years old or not?It also suggests a ban on carrying passengers under 30 years old for all novice drivers aged under 30.Controversial stuff. Having said all that, though, there is plenty in this work by the Transport Research Laboratory that that I'm sure will be welcomed by most campaigners - and parents, frankly.Things like:- road skills being taught in schools as part of the national curriculum- letting learner drivers practise on the motorway- making learners drive for a minimum of 100 supervised hours during the day and 20 at night. They'd have to fill in a log book to show they'd done it, although I suppose that's not hard to fake, is it?Anyway, why does all this matter? Three reasons.1. Driving is one of the biggest killers of young people in Britain. They're involved in around 20% of the worst accidents yet only drive around 5% of all miles. (I had a nasty accident three days after I passed my test because I was driving like a fool).2. Some of these suggestions could happen. The government's going to consult on all this stuff soon and there could be a new law in a year or two.3. If you cut accidents amongst young people, firstly you save tragedy and heartache for thousands of families; secondly insurance premiums might even come down. So more young people can get mobile.The AA has already waded in. Its president, Edmund King, says: "There are many proposals in the report with merit and which are advocated by the AA. Road safety on the national curriculum is something we have long campaigned for and I am pleased to see it being recommended here."Likewise we would also support learner drivers being allowed on motorways with their instructor. However, at the extreme end this report could be seen as just recommending taking novice drivers off the road by regulation and restriction rather than helping them develop the right attitudes and skills to provide them with the mobility they need".The government's publishing its young drivers Green Paper this month (hopefully). Expect plenty of interesting suggestions and ideas in that.Are you a teenager? What do you think? @richardwestcott</body>

      <title>Prompt payment scheme 'not working'</title>
      <description>A government-backed scheme to ensure small companies get paid on time isn't working, the BBC has found.</description>

      <body>A government-backed scheme to ensure small companies get paid on time is not working, the BBC has found.The Prompt Payment Code was established in December 2008 to help small suppliers recover the £30.2bn owed to them by some of the UK's largest companies.Around 1,500 firms have signed up to it - a number of them in the FTSE 100.But business leader and former trade minister Lord Digby Jones is among those who think the code is a failure.The Prompt Payment Code was launched to encourage the big businesses to pay their suppliers faster.Signatories promise to abide by the terms set out in their contract - and not to change them retrospectively.Suppliers are also guaranteed the right to complain if they are unhappy.The scheme is supposed to be further strengthened by the European directive on late payments, which says business to business payments should be made within 60 days and public sector bills should be paid within 30 days.Smaller companies often face cash-flow problems if bills are not paid on time. Typically, they face extra costs - such as extending a bank loan to tide them over.The construction sector is particularly badly hit by late payment.Steve Paul, who runs a plastering business in Staffordshire, said: "We are currently working on very tight margins and then not to get paid on time just causes you so much pressure, stress and aggravation and again we have a supply chain - we have to pay our guys who are working on site."Some contractors are dragging payment terms to 45, 60 even 120 days. When you've got to pay all that money up front and try and run a business it's nigh on impossible."At one point they were owed £1.2m, causing cash-flow problems so severe that the company had to cease trading, Mr Paul said.Lord Jones says he has known large companies to deliberately try to extend their payment terms as a business strategy."I have sat in on board meetings of big companies who have said 'we are paying on 60 days, let's see if we can push it out to 90'. I have said: 'If you are going to do it please don't do it to small businesses.' It is really damaging."The Federation of Small Business (FSB) says some signatories to the code have managed to stretch settlement periods to as long as 120 days - far longer than the limit set by the European Directive.Mike Cherry of the FSB said: "We know around four in 10 businesses that are paid late will go on to pay their own suppliers late or struggle to pay their staff. It cannot be right that small businesses are in effect being asked to lend to their large customers."This can only have a negative impact on growth and investment."Lord Jones said the Prompt Payment Code was ineffective."I think the code certainly has not worked. It was a nice statement of intent. At the end of the day, have you heard of any big business being shamed into changing?"Lord Jones added that as a result, small companies cannot afford to take people on - or invest in new equipment."Somewhere, someone is paying an additional cost because the company at the top is basically borrowing off the small business rather than borrowing off the bank," he said.However Philip King, of the Institute of Credit Management - which operates the code - insisted it was having a positive effect."There is evidence that companies that are signatories pay better than companies that are not," he said. "And there is also research which shows companies that are signatories have improved their performance over the past four years."The Department for Business Innovation and Skills said: "It is not acceptable for businesses to fail to pay their suppliers on time and we are playing our part to help tackle the problem."This is a vital issue for small businesses and more can and will be done by government to help businesses tackle it."</body>

      <title>Block on cold calls 'not working'</title>

      <body>Millions of people are signed up to a system designed to stop unsolicited sales and marketing calls, but some are still receiving up to 10 calls a month, consumer group Which? says.It said it had heard about people being called by many different companies.Companies are legally required not to call domestic numbers registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS).The organisation that runs the service said that it acted on every complaint.Firms should also avoid selling or marketing goods and services to those on TPS list.Sheila Clark, who is 84 and has Alzheimer's disease, said she was being called up by firms on a daily basis, despite being registered with the TPS.In June, nearly £100 was debited from her bank account after one call from a firm advertising a call-blocking device.Mrs Clark's son, Paul King, who has power of attorney over her financial affairs, spotted the transaction."She has been signed up to the Telephone Preference Service for around two years, but still cold calls are being made to her regularly," he said."On this occasion, a company called telecombill.co.uk took £92.35 out of her account, but this device didn't arrive and despite repeated calls, we were unable to get the money back."An agent at telecombill.co.uk, based in Coleraine in Northern Ireland, told the BBC that the money was taken out as a security deposit for the call blocking device. He also said that the company had called Mrs Clark by mistake because of a computer error. The firm has now refunded the money.The consumers' association Which? has received other complaints about people being cold-called at home by many different companies, despite being signed up to the TPS.Alex Neill, from Which?, said: "When we looked at the Telephone Preference Service, which is supposed to stop them, we found that when you register, you are still getting 10 calls a month, which is 10 too many."The TPS is run by the Direct Marketing Association and has about 19 million people on its register. The head of the service, John Mitchison, said that it was frustrating that calls were still being made to registered users, but he stressed that the service did not have any enforcement powers."We hold the database of telephone numbers and we take complaints if people still receive calls," he said."We act on every complaint by contacting the company concerned and reminding them of their legal obligations. We then pass all the information on to the Information Commissioner's Office, which can issue fines of up to £500,000 to those people who ignore the regulations."The Information Commissioner's Office and Ofcom, the communications regulator, have launched an action plan to tackle the issue of nuisance calls.They are assessing how well the TPS is working and aim to improve the way in which those behind nuisance calls are traced. They are due to publish a report early next year.For now, the TPS advises anyone receiving a cold call at home to be vigilant with personal information and to report any companies suspected of breaking the rules.</body>

      <title>Royal Mail shares soar on debut</title>
      <description>Shares in Royal Mail close at 455p on their first day of conditional trading - up 38% on their initial 330p offer price.</description>

      <body>Royal Mail shares rose 38% to 455p in their first day of conditional dealings on the London Stock Exchange.The hugely oversubscribed sale was priced at 330p a share, valuing the 500-year-old firm at £3.3bn. At one point, the price hit 459.75p.Private investors received 227 shares each. In all, more than 225 million shares were traded on Friday.Business Secretary Vince Cable told Channel Four News he could have charged a higher price for Royal Mail shares.Asked if he could have raised the sale price when he saw the level of demand for shares, Mr Cable said: "I could have done and I could have joined the speculators and spivs."I'm not interested in doing that," he said.The shares are listed officially next Tuesday, but City institutions began conditional dealings on Friday.Some 10 million shares were traded in the first 30 seconds when the market opened. Stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown reported that its website was having "intermittent problems" due to the "unprecedented interest" in Royal Mail.Tom McPhail, the firm's head of pensions research, said it was "extremely sorry for the delays", but was making "significant progress in clearing the backlog" and hoped to have all systems running normally again soon."We have experienced demand this morning which has gone off the scale," he said."We now have six times the normal number of staff working on our dealing lines. We know we are not the only broker affected by such problems this morning."The price rise is likely to fuel debate over whether the sale of Royal Mail has been undervalued. Mr Cable has insisted that the taxpayer has not been short-changed by the privatisation.But the general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, Billy Hayes, described the sell-off as "a tragedy" and predicted that it would make "not one scintilla of difference" to employees' intention to vote for strike action next Wednesday.Mr Hayes told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "This is a sham, really. The company has been undervalued."It's basically David Cameron rewarding his mates in the City. Vince Cable, one of the cleverest men in British politics, has made one of the stupidest decisions he is ever likely to make as a politician."Mr Cable told the Today programme that the bulk of the shares had gone to "long-term stable investors" in the UK.He said any volatility in the Royal Mail share price over the next week or so was of little consequence. "What matters is where the price eventually settles in three or six months' time".Mr Cable said: "You get an enormous amount of froth and speculation in the aftermath of a big IPO [initial public offering] of this kind."The bulk of the shares have gone to long-term institutional investors, stable investors, some overseas investors, but mainly British pension funds and insurance companies who are there for the long term."The objective of the exercise, which fits in with what we want for the Royal Mail, is to make sure it has stable, long-term investors."Voting in the strike ballot will close on 16 October. Under the current rules on industrial action, the earliest possible date for a strike is 23 October.In the flotation prospectus, Royal Mail warned that labour unrest posed a potential risk for the share price.Mr Cable said a strike was not in the interests of Royal Mail.City analysts said the price rise was driven by big institutional investors' demand for the stock. Matt Basi, head of UK sales trading at CMC Markets, said investment funds were "queuing up to make big purchases".Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, called the surge in Royal Mail shares a "dazzling stock market debut".But he said factors such as the threat of industrial action, a lack of adequate capital and unclear growth strategy could weigh down the stock price in the future.</body>

      <title>Ireland 'to exit bailout this year'</title>

      <body>The Republic of Ireland is on track to exit its international bailout programme by December, Prime Minister Enda Kenny says.He told the Fine Gael party conference in Limerick that although "fragile times" lay ahead "the economic emergency will be over".The 85bn euro (£73bn) bailout was forced on the country after its biggest banks collapsed in 2010.Ireland sought help after a property crash left its banks under-capitalised."Tonight I can confirm that Ireland is on track to exit the EU/IMF bailout on December 15. And we won't go back," said Mr Kenny."It won't mean that our financial troubles are over. Yes, there are still fragile times ahead. There's still a long way to go. But at last, the era of the bailout will be no more. The economic emergency will be over.Addressing those most affected by the years of austerity, the Taoiseach (prime minister) said their "huge sacrifice" was paying off.He cautioned that the national budget due to be unveiled on Tuesday would be "tough", with another 2.5bn euros (£2bn) in tax rises and spending cuts.But he said it would leave Ireland with a 4.8% deficit next year, well ahead of the required 5.1% target.He added that the government would publish a new medium term economic strategy by the end of this year.If Ireland does exit the scheme by December, it will be the first of the four countries bailed out by the eurozone to wean itself off emergency aid.The eurozone has also bailed out Portugal, Cyprus and Greece.In July, ratings agency Standard and Poor's upgraded its credit outlook for the Republic of Ireland from "stable" to "positive", arguing that the country's debts were falling faster than expected.In April, eurozone finance ministers rewarded the country's efforts by giving Ireland more time to repay its bailout loans.</body>

      <title>Obama open to short-term debt rise</title>
      <description>President Obama is willing to sign a short-term increase to the borrowing limit that is free from Republican budget demands, his spokesman says.</description>

      <body>US President Barack Obama is willing to sign a "clean" short-term increase to the US borrowing limit that is free from Republican budget and policy demands, his spokesman has said.Jay Carney's remarks came amid talks aimed at ending the twin fiscal crises threatening the US and world economies.The US is in the 11th day of a partial government shutdown.But the Statue of Liberty, the Grand Canyon and Mount Rushmore, closed by the shutdown, will now re-open.The funding will be provided by the states of New York, Arizona and South Dakota, however, with other national parks and monuments remaining closed due to the deadlock in Washington.As the well as the shutdown, the US is heading towards default if it does not raise its debt limit by 17 October."If the Congress were to pass a clean debt ceiling of short duration to avoid default, the president would sign that," Mr Carney said, following rounds of talks among Mr Obama and Senate and House Republicans.But Mr Carney reiterated the White House would not accept a debt ceiling rise with conditions attached, saying the right thing to do was to "remove that gun from the table".And the White House spokesman said there was still "no acceptable reason to keep the government shut down".The partial government shutdown, which has sent home hundreds of thousands of government workers on unpaid leave, began on 1 October after Republicans refused to pass a new budget unless Mr Obama and the Democrats agreed to delay Mr Obama's signature healthcare reform law of 2010 or eliminate its funding.The White House has repeatedly said it would not undermine the law, known as Obamacare, nor negotiate over larger budget matters, until Republicans vote to end the threat of default and reopen the government.Mr Carney also condemned a proposal floated by the House Republicans for a six-week debt limit increase in exchange for broader budget negotiations.He said it would "put us right back where we are today in just six weeks, on the verge of Thanksgiving and the obviously important shopping season leading up to the holidays, and that would create enormous uncertainty for our economy... We don't think that's the right way to go".The Democratic-controlled Senate is set to vote on Saturday on a 15-month extension of the debt ceiling, which would remove the issue from next year's congressional campaigns.Meanwhile, Senate Republicans left a meeting at the White House on Friday which they described as constructive.Republican Senator Susan Collins said after leaving the White House on Friday that Mr Obama had expressed interest in elements of her plan to fix both crises, but "did not endorse it".Ms Collins's plan, one of several being considered by Republicans in the Senate, includes a repeal of a tax on medical devices, which was designed to help fund insurance subsidies in Mr Obama's healthcare law."He obviously did not agree with my descriptions of the negative impact of the tax," Ms Collins said."But he clearly also recognises that it is not the heart of Obamacare in any way, and that as long as the revenue is replaced, as I proposed, that it does not hurt his signature programme."Other Republicans seemed to share Ms Collins's optimism but did not hint a deal was near."Everybody is talking to everybody now, and I'm encouraged by that," Senator Mike Johanns said.As the shutdown entered its 11th day, Mr Obama met a group of small business owners at the White House who told of financial woes caused by the shutdown."They shared stories with the President about contracts cancelled or put on hold, furloughed workers and the potential for shift and staff reductions should the shutdown continue," the White House said in a statement.On Capitol Hill, industry and government officials told a Senate panel that the shutdown's economic impact would intensify with each passing day.Marion Blakey, chief executive of the Aerospace Industries Association, told the committee the shutdown had already virtually stopped certification of new aircraft, equipment and training simulators, because the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had placed more than 90% of its employees who work on such issues on unpaid leave.And National Transportation Safety Board chairwoman Deborah Hersman said her agency was no longer sending investigators to accident sites, including a fatal bus crash that killed six people in Tennessee, an oil spill site in North Dakota, and a small aeroplane crash in Arizona that killed four.About 15,000 workers in the private sector have already been laid-off as a result of the shutdown, the labour department has said.On Friday, it was announced the Statue of Liberty and the Grand Canyon, two world-renowned national parks that had been closed since the government shutdown, are to open soon.Operation of the parks will be funded by the states of New York and Arizona, respectively."We will not allow this international symbol of freedom to remain closed because of the dysfunction and gridlock of Washington," New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, said in a statement.Arizona Governor Jan Brewer, a Republican, said: ""I'm gratified the Obama administration agreed to reverse its policy and allow Arizona to reopen Grand Canyon, Arizona's most treasured landmark and a crucial driver of revenue to the state."A survey suggests the majority of Americans blame the Republicans for the partial shutdown.A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll suggests 53% of Americans fault Republicans for the crisis, compared with 31% who say the Democrats are responsible.</body>

      <title>How useful are MBAs to a new company?</title>
      <description>For many would-be entrepreneurs, getting a Master of Business Administration (MBA) qualification is seen as essential. But is that really the case?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24335894</url>

      <body>For many would-be entrepreneurs, getting a Master of Business Administration (MBA) qualification is seen as essential.Yet with the most prestigious MBA courses in the US costing more than $100,000 (£62,000) in tuition fees alone, they don't come come cheaply.But does the celebrated qualification, and its teaching of a wide range of business skills, give its holders a big advantage when they set up their first firms?Or would people be better off if they instead simply went straight to setting up in business and learning on the job?Eoin Bara, owner of Dublin-based design agency V7, was pleased to be able to call on the assistance of someone with an MBA.Back in 2012, the company was facing a problem - it was growing too fast.With big clients including Intel and Goldman Sachs, V7 went from two to 12 employees in six months.Mr Bara says he didn't know how to manage this growth.So he decided to ask an MBA-qualified management consultant to come in and take an objective look at the company, and guide them on what they needed to do next.The MBA was able to show where the company was making losses, how they could make better use of their time, and how to plan for the future."We got more clarity on the day-to-day, which allowed us to focus on the future," says Mr Bara. "We didn't use to focus on the future at all."While author and journalist Philip Delves Broughton acknowledges the benefits of an MBA, he also thinks the cost can be a serious impediment.Mr Broughton wrote the book Ahead of the Curve, which outlines his experience on the MBA programme at Harvard Business School."One of the worst things you can do as an entrepreneur, starting young and getting going, is saddle yourself with a load of debt," he says."That's a disaster, because it really hobbles you," he adds, referring to tuition fees of more than $55,000 (£34,000) per year for his two-year programme at Harvard.The high cost of an MBA was a major reason why American tech entrepreneur Brenden Mulligan dropped out of his course at Northwestern University in Illinois.Mr Mulligan is the co-founder of Cluster, a mobile phone app which enables people to share photo albums.He calculates that he was spending $150 (£90) per hour on the MBA, and does not think it was worth it. He left roughly halfway through the course having spent around $45,000 (£28,000)."I just didn't get much of a return to investment on that money compared to other ways I've spent money supporting myself being an entrepreneur," explains Mr Mulligan, who is now based in San Francisco.He suggests budding tech entrepreneurs actually get experience in their field by joining or doing an internship at a small start-up first, rather than sign up for an MBA course.By contrast, London-based business investor Reshma Sohoni is firmly in the pro-MBA camp.Ms Sohoni, co-founder of technology start-up investment fund Seedcamp, says that if a new business is to do well, having someone on board with an MBA is crucial."Any organisation that's really gotten anywhere has MBA talent," says Ms Sohoni, who has an MBA herself.Ms Sohoni finds that from her experience, people with MBAs have a better sense of how to make a business more commercial, and have a much better understanding of running a business in general.It is something that some other entrepreneurs with MBAs agree with, including Andrew Carroll, who co-founded the e-receipts company Paperless Receipts.Having completed his MBA at the Cass Business School in London, Mr Carroll, 34, says he has a good understanding of a broad range of business concepts."I wouldn't be able to do what I'm doing now without having it, because it gives you a lot of knowledge about everything," he says."So I can now sit happily in a meeting with a hedge fund manager or with a marketing director or a finance director. I may not know everything they talk about but I'll know most of it."For entrepreneur Tobias van Amstel, 29, experience is more than important than having an MBA.The Dutchman is based in London, where he co-founded Signkick, an online booking platform for advertising on billboards."I would advise everybody just to get started and fail at your first company and learn as much as you can and then start your second company," he says."That was actually the best education I could think of to start Signkick," he says of his first business, a hotel booking website."The things I learnt there were so much more valuable than what any education could have taught me."But despite much encouragement for young people with ideas to just start their own enterprises, American entrepreneur and seed investor Alex Hoye, 44, is sceptical.He spent several years working at Disney and McKinsey before doing an MBA at Harvard in the early 1990s, and is now based in London."I think there's a huge value to not learning everything the hard way," he suggests.Mr Hoye believes prior experience is hugely important for entrepreneurs, and this can be gained either through work or through an MBA programme."I'm against the popular notion that one should just get out and do it," he says. "I disagree. I think you can learn a lot of the hard knocks by working with pros, or getting an MBA."He thinks the practice of going over case studies during an MBA is especially helpful in recognising patterns and successful business practices.But despite these useful skills, Mr Hoye does question the high cost."To be honest, there's a very good chance I would give it a miss if I were 26 now," he says.</body>

      <title>My Business Asia: Touring Taiwan</title>
      <description>The BBC's Cindy Sui talks to Yen Tseng about his student exchange programme bringing Chinese travellers and students to experience his take on Taiwan.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24427027</url>
      <date>1381276427</date>

      <body>What makes an entrepreneur? The BBC's Cindy Sui hears from Yen Tseng, a Taiwanese Canadian who, with his elder brother, founded a travel business called iBeengo. It takes tourists off the beaten track and helps them experience Taiwan the local way.Yen Tseng got the idea to start a travel business about a year ago because he loved to travel. He was born in Taiwan and attended middle school there, but went to Canada for his early, secondary and university education. By the age of 25, he had travelled to 25 countries.But starting this business in Taiwan wasn't an easy decision for him and his brother Ronnie, 30. Both are highly educated and their family had expectations of them. "The biggest risk is still the fact that we didn't take the nine-to-five job and we didn't take a stable salary."Initially, Yen and his brother wanted to help people take the pain out of travelling - so with a loan of one million New Taiwan dollars ($34,000; £21,000) from their parents, they created iBeengo in September 2012. It allows travellers to pick and choose the itinerary they want and create custom-made tours.Most of their clients are Chinese independent student travellers curious about Taiwan who see visiting the island as a lifelong dream. Many are women because they like to get out there and explore, but also want the safety of being in a tour with a local guide, Yen says.What makes iBeengo's tours different from those of big travel agencies is that they allow travellers to sleep in if they want, skip parts of the tour and rejoin the group later, take their time at each location, and request locations off the itinerary."People don't actually like bus tours. Bus tours are like food on a flight, there's no choice. What we do is buffet style; you come here, pick out what you want, and go at the pace you like," said Yen.Some of the places iBeengo takes tourists to are popular scenic attractions, and they also offer free walking tours for interested tourists.Wearing their eye-catching bright green iBeengo t-shirts, Yen, his brother, and college-student volunteers point out locally known trivia, such as the stall that sells the best Taiwanese fried chicken patty at a night market, the locations where popular Taiwanese films were shot, or the childhood hangout of a Taiwanese pop singer.In its first year, iBeengo has taken 400 tourists around Taiwan. Yen says they try to keep their average tour size to fewer than 15 people and aim for an ideal ratio of one tour guide to five tourists, much less than the traditional ratio of one guide to 30 travellers.What makes starting up a business relatively low cost for Yen is that he and Ronnie hooked up with a start-up incubator which rents office space to young companies cheaply. They pay only NT$3,000 per person per month.Advertising in person also helps them cut costs. They fly to China to drop off brochures at universities and advertise on Chinese websites to reach out to their target customers - young Chinese people.IBeengo for the moment is mainly a travel exchange programme for students, but the brothers are hoping to raise the US$200,000 (£125,000) to register their company as a fully functioning tourism business for all.In the future the brothers plan to operate tours around Japan and further afield. But for now, they are enjoying helping tourists from mainland China - Taiwan's former rivals during the war decades ago - get to know the island and see not only its scenic beauty but unique character."Just the fact that our customers are going home and telling their friends about us and their friends are coming to us asking us to organise tours for them, that gives us a lot of satisfaction," Yen said.</body>

      <title>Turning around the world's oldest travel firm</title>
      <description>A profile of Harriet Green, the boss of Thomas Cook, and how she is trying to turnaround the fortunes of Thomas Cook.</description>

      <body>It is safe to say that Harriet Green, the boss of Thomas Cook, is not lacking in confidence - or the desire to take on a big challenge.Ms Green was appointed chief executive of the UK-based travel company in July 2012, after she cold-called the chairman and told him she was the right person to lead the troubled group's recovery.At that time Thomas Cook, the world's oldest travel business, was struggling with losses caused by a general fall in tourism numbers as a result of the global recession, and unrest in the Middle East hitting its package holidays to Egypt and Tunisia. The company was also saddled with debts of more than £1bn.Ms Green, 51, was convincing enough to be given the job, despite having no previous experience of working in a travel company.She says her strength of purpose can be traced back to coping with the death of her father when she was 14."You know I lost a parent in my early teens, and for a child that is the worst that can happen," she says. "And if you can cope with that, pretty much everything else - except a very similar situation of loss - is unlikely to derail you."Staff engagementMs Green, who was previously boss of electronic components distributor Premier Farnell for six years, says her first job at Thomas Cook was to boost staff confidence, and get them on side."You need to be really working on the psychology of the business, building belief, beginning to rebuild a culture, giving people a self, a sense of renewed self-esteem," she says.Ms Green emailed all 35,000 employees, asking them to share with her "everything you think and feel about what we need to do in this company".More than 8,000 workers replied, sharing "chapter and verse" with her.And while Ms Green continued to formulate her detailed plan for the turnaround, she says she was aware that she had to calm her own go-getting, no-nonsense attitude."Thomas Cook was quite unwell and so... I moderated my style and approach," she says."I was much less edgy, much less aggressive. I was still very focused on time and the issues, but [at the same time] creating this environment where people could believe."However, Ms Green did show early steel when she replaced most of the previous Thomas Cook board.Ms Green said the core turnaround focus was then very simple - "managing our cash better and reducing cost".In March of this year, she unveiled her strategy. The company intends to save £350m by 2015, largely through cutting the number of its physical stores, and focusing instead on internet sales. At the same time, non-core parts of the business will be sold.More than 2,500 jobs are going, and 199 shops out of 1,069 in the UK are shutting.Transport union TSSA, which represents many Thomas Cook staff, was angry at the job losses, but says they were the result of "the over expansion and bad decisions" of Thomas Cook's previous regime.In May the company completed a £1.6bn capital refinancing, which helped to halve its net debt. Then in August it announced that its nine-month losses had fallen to £470m from £667m a year earlier.Meanwhile, on Monday, 7 October the company announced the sale of two businesses in Egypt and Lebanon. The two units in question - Thomas Cook Egypt and Thomas Cook Lebanon - offer outbound travel to Egyptian and Lebanese customers.The markets have so far welcomed Ms Green's efforts, and Thomas Cook's share price has soared. In May of last year, before she joined, the shares were trading at 21 pence each. They finished last month at 153.13p.TSSA is also hopeful that the company is now moving in the right direction.Manuel Cortes, its general secretary, says: "We believe that Thomas Cook staff are its biggest asset and that the company is now back on track. We are confident that it can once again be a successful company and a great British brand."Ms Green herself says she should be judged after five years in the job.As Ms Green continues her work at Thomas Cook, she says successful chief executives have a wide range of skills, which she terms "a rich DNA toolkit".While she highlights traits such as resilience, agility, and ability to lead speedy change, she says the most important factor is the need to be good with people, something she sees in herself.Ms Green says: "It is my experience that [chief executives] that really enjoy people - either love to develop them, or coach them or support them, or engage with their work - are much more successful than those who really are great on strategy, love the numbers, but don't really love the people aspect."I think there is an authenticity that comes through, and if you don't love the people that you work with, that begins to show. So I think it's hard to be a successful [chief executive] if you don't really like working, developing [and] supporting other people."Ms Green adds that the DNA needed to make a good chief executive is "not gender specific". However, she does agree that more needs to be done to see more female bosses of large companies."There are gender issues associated with why there are so few of us female [chief executives], but I think that's a different issue about role-modelling, education, the media that we can all help with," she says.Regarding the future of Thomas Cook, which traces its history back to 1841, Ms Green has eyes on East Asia."Thomas Cook is not yet in the East, which I think is an amazing opportunity," she says. "Helping Chinese and Korean customers to explore Europe would be amazing."Yet despite the big plans for Thomas Cook's future, Ms Green says she won't stay forever."I generally think [chief executives] spend far too long in the same business," she says. "I think you should... make the business great, stay around a little while to enjoy that, and then probably move on to the next thing."</body>

      <title>Rangers stress no decision over chair</title>
      <description>Rangers amend a statement about the prospect of Dave King becoming chairman to comply with Stock Exchange rules.</description>

      <body>Rangers have stressed that no decision has been made about former Ibrox director Dave King joining the League One club's football board.The club released a statement from King at the weekend in which he expressed his desire to become chairman.Rangers chief executive Craig Mather also said that he thought the South Africa-based Scot would be an asset.But Rangers have now said they have been advised to amend the statement to comply with Stock Exchange rules.They said that this had come "at the insistence" of Rangers' nominated adviser, Daniel Stewart."RIFC was advised by its nominated adviser that there were regulatory implications arising from these statements and, accordingly, an amendment was subsequently made," the club stated."The board needs to make it clear, for regulatory reasons, that the board of directors referred to above is The Rangers Football Club Limited, the wholly owned subsidiary of The Rangers International Football Club PLC."Although we welcome the support of Dave King, no decision has been made to appoint him as a director."There are regulatory matters which would need to be resolved prior to any such appointment."That news coincides with a hearing being held at the Court of Session in Edinburgh to consider a move by a group of shareholders to include on the agenda of the club's annual meeting on 24 October a motion for four new directors to be appointed to the board.The group wants Malcolm Murray, who was club chairman until April, Paul Murray, who was a director until last year, director of Loch Lomond Golf Club Scott Murdoch and Alex Wilson, a former HR director with BT, to be appointed.Monday's court judgement will affect whether the annual meeting can go ahead as planned or will be delayed because new director proposals will be heard.The possibility of King returning to the board at Ibrox follows talks between himself, Mather and finance director Brian Stockbridge in South Africa.King lost the £20m he invested during Sir David Murray's spell as owner after Rangers went into liquidation last year.However, he believes that having agreed to pay South Africa's revenue service £44m over tax issues, with criminal charges against him being dropped, any impediment to him being appointed to the board has been removed.However, the appointment would not only have to be ratified by adviser Stewart under AIM Stock Exchange rules but must also satisfy the Scottish Football Association's "fit and proper person" rules before he could become a director.Speculation about another financial crisis at Rangers followed this month's announcement that the club, now playing in the third tier of Scottish football, had lost £14m in the last financial year.King's statement said that he had discussed with Mather and Stockbridge the commencement of "a new round of funding to ensure that it is available in an orderly and cost-effective manner when required" and expressed his wish to lead that exercise.However, Rangers have sought to clarify that there is no immediate need for a cash injection."The directors also expect that in the medium-term future, possibly coinciding with the return to top league football in Scotland, it may be in the best interests of the company to raise further capital," said the club's latest statement."However, there is no requirement for short-term funding and, as such, neither the company nor RIFC are actively seeking finance."Nonetheless, we are committed to exploring a future involvement by Mr King in the club."</body>

      <title>Bennett fears for Welsh regions</title>
      <description>Former Wales and Lions fly-half Phil Bennett says the Welsh regions could go bust without European rugby next season.</description>

      <body>Wales legend Phil Bennett fears his country's regions could go bust if they are left without European competition.English and French clubs will quit the Heineken Cup next year and have proposed a rival Rugby Champions Cup.No agreement has yet been reached as to whether Rabodirect Pro12 teams - involving sides from Wales, Ireland, Scotland and Italy - will be included if the new competition goes ahead."Without the European Cup the regions could fold," Bennett warned."It's now time that the Welsh Rugby Union got together with the regions and say, 'this mustn't happen - you've got to be strong'."The WRU have to have money coming in, they've handled their monies remarkably well - they've brought the debt down greatly - but at the end of the day we must have strong regional rugby in Wales."We can have the... Pro12 which is great, but I can see the English and French clubs have got a point that most of the teams qualify and go straight into Europe."Believe me, to see the games against Munster we've [Scarlets] had at Stradey Park and Parc y Scarlets, Clermont and all these stars there, without European rugby we're going to die."Former fly-half Bennett, who won 29 caps for Wales and eight for the British and Irish Lions between 1969 and 1978, also fears that the greater financial strength of English and French clubs, married to the row over the future of Europe's cross-border tournament, is affecting the thinking of players who are close to the end of their contracts."There are a load of players up for contract at the end of the season. Typical example: Northampton, loads of money - all the English clubs are loaded - they pinch our star player George North," said the 64-year-old."Guys like Jonathan Davies, our centre, who made the big furore on the Lions tour and got in instead of [Brian] O'Driscoll, he's out of contract this season."Jonathan needs to be paid well and he wants to be in a side that's challenging for trophies."So it's a big season for the Welsh Rugby Union to get their act together for the regions, all of us to get together and even at the grassroots level where we're struggling we've got to be united."As a small nation, united we're strong but split us apart and we're useless, so I'm hoping for the best."Knowing the English clubs like I do... it's going to be hard, some hard bargaining done at the table."But if the competition is to be a success I think it needs the Celtic nations in it to have the flavour that it has now."I think a deal will be done. I think it'll go down to the very last minute and I think the English clubs and the French clubs will come out of it very well, but I think the Celtic nations have to realise it's a bit lop-sided at the moment."</body>

      <body>Manchester City have announced plans to increase the capacity of their ground from 48,000 to about 61,000.The Premier League club will add a third tier behind the goals of the Etihad Stadium's North and South stands, subject to planning approval.Tiers will include about 6,750 seats, with fans able to join a season ticket waiting list for the seats next week.The club aim to submit the plans next month and hope work will start on the project in February.City said the work would not impact season ticket holders attending home matches. The tiers are expected to be completed for the beginning of the 2015/16 season.The team has played its home fixtures at the stadium since 2003.A club spokesman said: "Should the club's exciting plans receive planning approval, City's home, which this year celebrates its 10th birthday, is set to be even more visually dramatic".The stadium initially had a capacity of 38,000 when it was built for the Commonwealth Games, which were held in Manchester in 2002.The planned expansion would see the stadium become the second largest in the Premier League, behind neighbours Manchester United's Old Trafford home which holds more than 75,000.</body>

      <body>As the world's second largest economy, the fastest growing economy in the G20 and with more than a trillion dollars sitting in various sovereign wealth funds, China has quite a bit of cash to invest.And as the chart below shows, in recent years it has begun loosening the purse strings - in 2005, the Chinese government and Chinese companies collectively invested about $17bn (£11bn) in global assets, according to The Heritage Foundation. Last year they invested almost $130bn.That sounds like a lot of money, but in the context of global world trade or the economic output of developed economies, it is small change. For example, the total amount of money invested by China into Britain over the past nine years amounts to just 0.7% of the UK's total GDP in 2012.And Britain is one of the more popular destinations for Chinese investment. It is in the top 10 nations globally and attracts more than double the investment of any other nation in Europe. Globally, Australia comes out top, but even here Chinese investment last year equated to just 0.6% of the country's annual GDP. In developing nations, Chinese investment is more significant. In Nigeria, for example, inflows from China equated to 2% of GDP in 2012.Almost half of all the money invested overseas by China and Chinese companies in the past nine years went into the energy and power sector. China's demand for energy is expected to triple by 2030 so countries with abundant natural resources will continue to attract the most money from China.While more Chinese money is invested in the energy sector than in any other in Britain, China holds a number of investments elsewhere, including in Barclays Bank, BP, Diageo and Thames Water. Most are minority stakes, but it does have a controlling interest in some household names. For example, Bright Foods owns a 60% stake in Weetabix, the Wanda conglomerate owns 92% of Sunseeker boats, while Geely Automobile owns Manganese Bronze, the company that makes London taxis.Some of the companies listed below are not British firms, but the investments shown refer to assets based in Britain. For example, last year China Investment Corporation paid Ferrovial $700m to buy a 10% stake in Heathrow airport, and paid $400m to Deutsche Bank to take a stake in the bank's London offices.There are four other UK companies that have received monies from China, but are not included in the list as the money went into divisions based overseas. The China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOCC) invested almost $1.5bn to take a 33% stake in Tullow Oil's Ugandan operations in 2011. In 2010, CNOCC spent $270m on a 5% stake in BG's energy interests in Australia.In 2008 and 2009, Aluminium Corporation of China (Chinalco) made two investments totalling $14.3bn in Rio Tinto to take a 12% stake in the mining giant's aluminium operations in Australia, and two years later paid another $1.4bn to Rio for a share of its steel business in Guinea.Finally, in 2008, oil trader Sinochem paid $470m for a stake in oil and gas exploration company Soco International for a stake in its oil business in Yemen.Download the full data from the Heritage Foundation.</body>

      <title>Cooking up a successful food business</title>
      <description>How driving to Asia inspired a ready meals business</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24434154</url>

      <body>Inspiration can often come from strange places. For UK ready meals boss Charlie Bigham it was being unable to sleep at the border between Iran and Pakistan.Mr Bigham was 28 years old at the time, and he and his then girlfriend were travelling from the UK to India by camper van."It was very, very hot, and we were in a really tough place," he says. "I couldn't sleep, so I just laid there restlessly thinking about what I was going to do for a living when we got back home."I decided there and then that I was going to set up a food business, and it was going to look a bit like this."Mr Bigham had previously worked as a management consultant in London, before he and his girlfriend quit their jobs to go travelling for nine months.His ambition was to set up his own company when they returned to the UK, and now he had his idea - he was going to establish a business that made upmarket ready meals.Mr Bigham was not going to let the fact that he had never worked in the food industry before put him off, and instead he decided he would quickly set about gaining the knowledge and skills he needed.And so upon his return to the UK he got a job at a delicatessen in London's fashionable Notting Hill area."I've always been really interested in food, but I had no food industry experience, so I knew I had to get some cheese under my fingernails, so to speak," he says.He ended up spending almost four months at the deli, and at the same time did lots of research, and working on recipes."It became clear that the idea of making meals which are then sold via shops was a very good idea for a business because it was a massive market, yet one which was very straightforward to start up in," says Mr Bigham."I knew we could start under the radar before any bigger rivals could crush us, and then build quite quickly."In November 1996, 11 months after his return from travelling, and now married to his girlfriend, Mr Bigham launched the business with £25,000 of savings, calling it simply "Charlie Bigham's".To begin with, it was just him and one chef based at a small facility in London's Park Royal business estate.Mr Bigham says: "We had just three product lines to start with - zesty Caribbean lamb, Cajun chicken with salsa, and salmon with a dill and cream sauce. I think we made just 20 meals in total in that first week."To get sales moving, Mr Bigham, now 47, says he simply started "knocking on people's doors"."I went round all the posh delis in London, and the big department stores with food halls. Everyone was approachable, and said, 'Yeah we'll give you a go'."I just had to be mildly persuasive, and I'm not a salesman."What greatly helped us, is that you have to remember that at the time, most ready - or convenience - meals, as I prefer to call them, were pretty dreadful."We were one of the first to make quality ones without anything artificial. This set us apart and made shops interested in stocking us."But while selling to posh stores in London was pleasing, Mr Bigham realised that in order to grow the business he needed to win a contract with one of the UK's supermarket groups. And so he cold-called Waitrose."I just picked up the phone and rang the Waitrose switchboard. I managed to persuade a lovely woman on the phone to put me through to a buyer. I got a meeting, and the buyer said she would give us a go."Charlie Bigham's meals have been stocked by Waitrose ever since, initially at 40 stores for a successful trial period, and then nationwide. Online supermarket Ocado, and Booths, the north of England supermarket chain, have since followed suit.The company now employs 200 people across two sites at the Park Royal business park, and has an annual turnover of £20m, which is now growing at 19% per annum.Mr Bigham says his former job as a management consultant helped him manage the company's growth over the past 17 years.But he is the first to admit that luck and good timing played a major role in his success."The only way you can ever set up a successful business is to be lucky," he says. "It is the thing you need more than anything else. Anyone who says otherwise is just lying."Mr Bigham says that most important piece of luck was all to do with timing."I set up a food business just as interest in food was blossoming in this country. Suddenly there was a wealth of TV chefs, and the national newspapers all added food sections at weekends."And the supermarkets were all being brave and looking outwards towards new suppliers. There was no planning or forethought about all this on my part, it was pure luck."Mr Bigham today gives himself the job title "chairman and creative director". This followed his decision back in 2010 to bring in someone else to handle the chief executive role."It has enabled me to focus on the bits of the business I'm really interested in - product development, and the big strategic picture - working out plans for the next three to five years," he says."The bit in the middle [the day-to-day financial decisions etc] I'm easily bored by, and is best done by someone else."Looking ahead, Mr Bigham says the company has no plans to start exporting, because the freshness, and therefore limited shelf life of his products, makes it too expensive.Nor does he ever intend to move production away from London to somewhere cheaper, because he says he is loyal to his hard-working staff."I'm proud of what we have done to date, but I'm in no way complacent. Owning your own business is a hugely privileged position to be in, because I work with people I have chosen - not many people can say that."</body>

      <title>Plight of India's abandoned widows</title>
      <description>Growing number of elderly Indian women struggle to survive</description>

      <body>The Hindu temple town of Vrindavan, a few hours south-east of Delhi, is known by another name locally: it's called the city of widows.While most come here to find religion, many come because they have nowhere else to go. Others are just dumped here by families who no longer want to pay for their care.Almost all of them are widowed women.Sixty-five-year-old Shakti Dasi from Agartala in north-eastern India is one. She came here eight years ago when her husband died.Her sons no longer want her, she says."It's a struggle to survive, but I can manage on very little. Like everyone else, I too hoped that my children would grow up to take care of me, but they didn't. So I had no choice but to come here."India is home to an estimated 40 million widows - approximately 10% of all women.Ageing women are more vulnerable than men. Without any financial security or welfare infrastructure, many of them are abandoned in Vrindavan- where they live off charity while they wait to die.Shakti Dasi and other widows like her chant prayer songs twice a day, four times a week to earn 20 cents and a bowl of rice.Considered inauspicious, widows are ostracised by many and have few sources of income.Helping these women with their finances are non-profit organisations such as Maitri."The social welfare system in India is practically non-existent," says Winnie Singh, the founder of Maitri.All widows over the age of 60 are eligible for a small government pension worth less than $5 (£3) a month.But most are illiterate and do not have bank accounts to access even that."How can someone getting 300 rupees, or less than $5, survive?" says Ms Singh."How are they going to hire a room to live, buy rations etc? Even if you give them a below-the-poverty-line card, that doesn't give them anything free."Overall, India remains a young country. The elderly account for just 9% of the population.But the number of old people is rising steadily. The UN warns it could triple, reaching 300 million within the next 40 years.In a nation without social security and state healthcare, there is growing anxiety about how India will care for its elderly.Nearly 90% of the country's workforce is in the informal sector. They are mainly self-employed, low-income workers who do not have any access to pension schemes.So that puts them in a particularly vulnerable position where they could easily sink below the poverty line in their old age.Many doubt whether the country's current infrastructure can keep up."One step could be, can you establish a subsidy mechanism for screening or providing some medication for these people? That could have a certain cost," says Amit Mookim, head of healthcare at KPMG."Then, is there a mechanism to take care of certain procedures, operations or surgeries which is then contracted to private players? That is another cost."Then there is the end-of-life care for which the infrastructure doesn't exist - so how much infrastructure can you build?"Experts feel that the lack of a nationwide social security system poses a serious risk to the economy.In Vrindavan, some non-profit organisations are tackling the problem of food and healthcare at a micro level.At Maitri's centre, about 500 widows converge at midday for a free hot meal.They are given health advice and free medicines as well.With families struggling to care for their elders at home, the plight of these women is likely to become increasingly common.But for now, neither the government nor the private sector have any simple solutions to offer.And for some, like Shakti Dasi, it may already be too late.</body>

      <description>Why focusing on small details matters to big firms</description>

      <body>Jan Smits is standing in his hotel room staring at his watch and he's not very happy.But Mr Smits is no ordinary guest. He's the Asia, Middle East and Africa chief executive of International Hotels Group (IHG), the world's largest hotel chain.On a trip to India to see how young graduates are trained within the company he has just realised that the time taken to prepare the hotel rooms for bedtime - the so-called turndown service - is not standardised.At the Crowne Plaza New Delhi Rohini the process of turning down the duvet cover and closing the curtains took five minutes, but it should only take two minutes.It seems surprising that someone so senior, a member of the firm's executive committee, is concerned about this kind of small detail which one would assume would fall squarely under the remit of housekeeping.But for IHG, like all businesses, time equals money. If a regular process such as this takes longer than it should, then repeated 678,000 times for each of its rooms worldwide, the extra time spent would be significant and ultimately costly.But it's not only crucial for financial reasons, but so that a guest, whether they are staying at a Crowne Plaza in India or America, has the same experience each time.Mr Smits says IHG uses so-called "standard operating procedures" to ensure this level of standardisation. These outline every single step involved in any regular process, such as a turndown or checking a guest into the hotel, to ensure it is both efficient and consistently creates the same end result."From my experience here tonight there's just a little bit more room to make sure it's exactly the same across all the Crowne Plazas. We're very close but it can't be very close. it needs to be the same each time to create a great brand," he says.While it may appear obsessive, experts argue paying attention to these kinds of details is not only important, but is a crucial part of a firm's success, particularly customer-facing ones.That's because creating a standard and consistent experience can be a good way of making customers loyal to a particular brand."Ultimately it drives customer loyalty and repeat business. As long as it's an enjoyable experience people tend to go to what they know even when they're in another country," says Bridget McVerry, a principal at management consultancy Oliver Wyman where she focuses on the retail sector.She points to fast food chain McDonald's as an example. "You know what you're going to get and not just from a product point of view, but from the overall experience," she says.Recent research by Oliver Wyman in the US found that differences in customer experience were the reason behind one quarter to one third of the variation in sales and profits of individual shops within a chain. Improving the consistency of the customer experience drove sales improvements of 10% or more.And it's not just a good way of creating loyal customers, it can help create loyal employees: retail chains which focused on providing a consistent customer experience - where employees knew what they were supposed to do and were given the training and tools to do it - had staff turnover rates 50% or more below industry norms.Given the very real difference the research shows that focusing on the customer experience can have, Ms McVerry believes that it's something chief executives should be involved with, at least initially in terms of defining what she calls their "mantra'"- the experience that the business wants to deliver to its customers.Of course, the more branches a firm has the harder it can be to ensure customers have the same experience each time they visit.Coffee chain Starbucks has more than 19,000 stores worldwide, including 730 in the UK, and while Ian Cranna, vice president of marketing at Starbucks UK, admits that being consistent can be hard, he says customer feedback indicates it is important."One of the things they value most about Starbucks is the friendly, personal service and the consistent high quality coffee. They are just not willing to take a risk on a poor experience or product when they have just a few moments on their morning commute or school run," he tells the BBC.To ensure that customers' experiences are the same, whether they order their coffee in London or Manchester, Mr Cranna says all new Starbucks staff are trained in its cultures and values before they are let anywhere near a coffee machine. These cultures and values - which include making the coffee shops a "third place" for customers away from home and work - are the same in each of the 60 countries in which it operates."The culture and values are fundamentally important, with straightforward functional training alone it would be very hard to maintain the high quality consistent experience we strive to offer," he says.As IHG's Mr Smits says: "The devil is in the detail. You have to be very disciplined and empower your leaders to make it happen."Escape from the Boardroom is a five-part series broadcast on BBC World News on Saturdays at 02:10 and 15:10, and Sundays at 09:10 and 21:10 (all times GMT).</body>

      <body>Road warrior Ramadhan Myolele, 38, is the face of the booming, informal trade between Africa and China.Every two to three weeks, the businessman leaves his home in the town of Morogoro in Tanzania and boards a plane bound for Hong Kong.He buys tens of thousands of dollars' worth of electronics on every trip.Often carrying wads of cash, he bargains fiercely with wholesalers to buy new or used Chinese-made phones to sell back home."If you want to be a big boss, you must be physically in each and every place," he says, as he carefully packs hundreds of mobile phones in several enormous suitcases."Because you can understand which is required to sell there, and which is required to sell somewhere else."Mr Myolele says he owns two stores in Tanzania, one wholesale and one retail.He has been travelling to Hong Kong since 2005.Before, he used to personally source for electronics in Dubai.The managing director of Wagala Investments plans to hand carry and check-in the luggage on his return flight.On this trip, he has purchased $40,000 (£25,000) worth of products."Yes the business is very good, I went to buy here and I sell there, and I get a profit compared to when I go and buy somewhere else, that's why I proceed to buy in Hong Kong," he says."I'm just taking Chinese models, different types of Chinese models."Mr Myolele declines to tell me at what price he plans to sell the phones.But other African traders say they can sell them for double or even triple the price for a healthy profit.One out of five mobiles currently used in sub-Saharan Africa are estimated to have physically passed through Chungking Mansions at some point.It is a 17-storey tower block located in the heart of the city's tourist district. When Mr Myolele arrives in Hong Kong, it is his first, and sometimes only, stop.Chungking Mansions first opened in the early 1960s and now, it is possibly the most globalised building of its kind in the world.Inside, more than 100 nationalities gather every day to shop, eat, stay at cut-price hotels and bargain for the electronics that have powered Africa's technology revolution.About 10,000 people are estimated to walk through the building each day, with about 4,000 travellers staying overnight in private guesthouses.Trade between China and Africa is booming, despite general economic weakness in the rest of the world.Bilateral trade reached $200bn (£125bn) last year and could almost double by 2015, according to Standard Chartered Bank.Much has been made of the often controversial Chinese presence in Africa.But intrepid African traders are also making the journey to China.On the first-floor mezzanine where Mr Myolele is packing his suitcases, Ibrahim Zidwemba, from Burkina Faso, is finalising a deal.He will be spending $28,000 (£17,000) on phones on this trip.He tends to make the journey to Hong Kong four times every year.Mr Zidwemba, 29, also used to source in Dubai."But now the market there is very high. That is why I choose to come to Hong Kong because here the market is very cheap."The quality is very good, you can get so much profit. That's why I come here to Hong Kong to buy."You know, everybody likes profit. If you have profit, you come," he says, laughing.Traders come to Chungking Mansions because accommodation is cheap, costing as little as $12 (£7.50) a night.There are plenty of wholesalers selling everything from clothing to flat-screen television sets inside.And the entire building is welcoming toward practising Muslims, with plenty of restaurants that cater to religious dietary restrictions.The entire business trip can be completed cheaply and quickly, usually without even leaving the building.Chungking Mansions used to have a more seedy reputation, but the association of owners, led by chairwoman Lam Wai Lung, has been trying to improve its image.Ms Lam, who arrived in Hong Kong from mainland China in 1979, made her fortune by setting up hotels and guesthouses inside the building.She reckons that African traders now account for 20% of all guesthouse customers."They started coming in big numbers in only the last five or six years," she says."Of course, African business people had been coming before but not in such great numbers. They used to come to buy clothing, very few traders bought electronics."Now, what we are seeing that is that they all come to buy electronics and mobile phones. Their purchasing patterns have completely changed."African traders now tend to travel directly to mainland China to buy clothing.For electronics, they say they have greater trust in their suppliers in Hong Kong, where products are of higher quality.It is an informal market, and exact statistics are hard by come by.But with trade between China and Africa booming, Chungking Mansions will continue to be an important stop on the new silk road.</body>

      <title>The strange life of John McAfee</title>
      <description>The strange life of millionaire John McAfee</description>

      <body>Who is the real John McAfee? He's the man who went on the run after his neighbour was found dead, face-up, with a bullet in his head. He's the man who jump-started the multibillion-dollar anti-virus industry. And now he thinks he can make you invisible on the internet.Within tech circles he's long been a legend. But for most people, McAfee came to prominence last year when he fled his Central American home - teeth stained, hair dyed, in disguise - rather than let himself be questioned by authorities he accused of being corrupt.He tells the BBC he had "no connection whatsoever" with his neighbour's death. Police say he remains a "person of interest".Back in the US, after posting footage of young female "friends" stroking his naked tattooed torso, he now plans to neutralise the NSA's cyber-surveillance system.It might suggest a crazed, perhaps even deranged, personality. One journalist who has interviewed McAfee many times described him a "master manipulator" who lies and deceives."I've been called paranoid, schizophrenic, the wild child of Silicon Valley," McAfee acknowledges.But he has a different perspective: "I'm an entrepreneur. I always have been. I am curious and I enjoy solving problems."I think that it's when we step out of the road, step outside the box, become our own person and we walk fearlessly down paths other people wouldn't look at, that true progress comes. And sometimes true beauty as well."We're missing that. We're missing the people who have the courage to walk into the wilderness just to see what's there."This is how Amy Emshwiller, the teenage ex-prostitute he lived with in Belize, describes him: "He's sweet, generous. He likes to like adventures. He's serious and usually he has a dark sense of humour. He's generally a sweet guy. He just doesn't like to be [expletive] with."So, who is the real John McAfee?To have any chance of knowing and gaining an informed opinion of what really motivated his erratic-sounding behaviour after the killing of Gregory Faull, you must travel deep into the 68-year-old's past.Despite his Southern accent, the bleached-blond and goateed businessman is in fact half-British - the son of an Englishwoman who met an American soldier stationed in the UK during World War II."I feel as much British as I do American," McAfee says. "There's not much difference between our countries."They moved to Virginia when he was young, where he had a troubled childhood. His father was an abusive alcoholic who, when McAfee was aged 15, shot himself dead. In the following years, McAfee says, he too began drinking heavily and taking drugs, but still managed to maintain a promising academic career.That came to an end in the late 1960s when Northeast State Louisiana State College terminated his PhD in mathematics after it was revealed that he had slept with an undergraduate he was mentoring.They later married and McAfee turned his skills to a series of programming jobs with some of the biggest tech organisations of the time including Nasa, General Electric, Siemens, Univac and Xerox, all the while continuing to indulge in his addictions."Most of my bosses also used drugs of some kind," he says. "I was in the tech field, after all, we were the leading edge in technology and the leading age in personal experimentation."I had to hide it from my mother and sometimes from my wife. But in the work environment - depending on where you worked - in some companies drugs were taken openly at lunchtime in people's offices. It was a bizarre time."Matters came to a head in the early 1980s after his wife left him, his most recent employer, Omex, let him go and the scale of his drug dependency forced him to seek help."It was 1984, the last time that I took drugs, drank alcohol or sold drugs for that matter," he says."I simply stopped. I started going to an organisation called Alcoholics Anonymous... and that was my last taste of that world."However, it is still with me. My body is covered with tattoos from that period. And I'm afraid some of my ideas and concepts and attitudes that were moulded during that time are still with me. That's why people think, perhaps, I'm a little bit off the wall."Despite his troubles, McAfee managed to land a job at defence contractor Lockheed Martin, where he worked on a classified voice-recognition program.There he came across an unusual bit of self-replicating code designed to copy itself on to any floppy disk inserted into affected computers. When examined, it contained the message: "Welcome to the dungeon. Beware of this VIRUS.""When I first read about the Pakistani Brain virus, I'd never heard of a virus before, neither had anyone in technology," remembers McAfee. "It fascinated me."He worked out a way to disinfect the computers and then spread the cure via the bulletin board system, a precursor to the web.The challenge inspired him to set up a business of his own: McAfee Associates - a firm that would later be sold, years after he had left, to Intel for more than $7.6bn (£4.7bn)."I knew the field would become extremely large because people being who they are, there will always be hackers," he says."It's why we have graffiti on the walls of the inner city. People like to deface things. They like to disrupt things."So, given that fact, computer viruses were not going to go away and were only going to get worse. I just did what I could to be at the forefront of that industry for as long as I could."Despite this, he says, he has never himself used any of the products made by the firm that continues to bear his name."I'm constantly under attack, yet I use no software protection."I protect myself by constantly changing my IP [internet protocol] address, by not attaching my name to any device I use, and by not going on to sites where you might pick up a virus."Porn sites, for example, I just don't go there."Secondly, I practise safe computing. If someone sends me an email with a link, I'm not going there until I can call the person to verify that they sent me the email."It sounds absurd to live that way, but I would rather trust my own devices and thoughts than someone else's software."After selling his stake in the business in 1994, McAfee went on to found and sell other companies, including an instant messaging system, a firewall provider and a ranch from which he offered flights in "trikes" - low-flying, engine-powered cabins suspended from hang-gliders.Then he headed south.In 2008, at an age others might be thinking of putting up their feet, McAfee moved to the jungle of Belize with the stated intention of trying to cure another kind of infection."I came across a concept called quorum sensing, which is the technique that bacteria use to communicate with each other."Up until about 10 years ago we didn't even know that bacteria did communicate, but we find out they have a very sophisticated communication system. I wanted to explore and investigate that to see if we could come up with new antibiotics."He picked the area, he says, because the plants that grew along the country's Rio Nuevo river contained compounds that inhibit bacteria from sending chemical signals to each other and thus thwart their ability to co-ordinate an attack.Things didn't go as planned.The first sign of trouble was when journalists invited to his Carmelita, Orange Walk, base wrote stories that made clear they did not know what to make of the operation.Then a falling-out with the microbiologist he was working with, Allison Adonizio, put the project at risk when she quit.Dr Adonizio, who is now based in Philadelphia, did not want to be interviewed.In April 2012, matters came to a head when the Belize police force's Gang Suppression Unit raided the research facility.McAfee says the officers claimed they suspected it was being used to make the illegal psycho-stimulant methamphetamine.They shot his dog, he says, confiscated both his passport and licensed weapons on the property, and briefly imprisoned him before dropping the charges."Under no circumstances did they really believe it was a meth lab," he states."Everybody knew it was a biotech lab because I had hired half of the people in the village to work there. They all knew what I was doing."It's a pirate haven. It's an extremely corrupt and dangerous place."I knew this and my friends all advised me against it. I just thought I was smart enough to sidestep it. Unfortunately, I was not."I was there for a year and the local politician sent a representative and asked for $2m for a campaign donation. I said no. Two weeks later they raided my compound."McAfee says when he was asked a second time for the cash he went on a publicity blitz, posting messages online, and speaking to local and international press about the incident. It became political.The Belize Times - published by the leading opposition party - suggested the "barbaric assault" on McAfee was a "global black eye" for the nation and a threat to its tourist industry."I do wish that I were smarter socially," reflects McAfee."I think I have the ability to solve mathematical equations and programming issues very easily, but I am a little bit naive in some social situations. And certainly in Belize I was way naive."At the time of the raid, McAfee had begun an affair with a 16-year-old ex-prostitute he had met on Belize Independence Day."I was partying, I was drinking, and I went into this bar and the owner said a friend wants to meet me and likes me," remembers Amy Emshwiller, who still lives in Belize."[He said] can I have your number, and then two weeks later he called me."She says he was unaware she was less than a quarter of his age."He didn't know how old I was. I lied to him saying I was 18, and he thought it was OK."I let him fall in love first before I told him my age."When I told him he was so [expletive] shocked that he didn't know what to do. He was baffled. And he was like: 'I still love you, I don't know what to do. I'm in love with a young girl.' That's how that happened."McAfee's long-term American girlfriend left him. And like many things in his life, the new affair proved complicated.One night Emshwiller took McAfee's gun. She aimed it at his head, squeezed her eyes shut and pulled the trigger. She missed.He continued the relationship."Amy, for one - and many girls in Belize - has a horrific story of abuse that if I told you, you could not believe it," McAfee explains."Of course she's not going to be well. Of course she's going to have issues."When she tried to shoot me in the head what I saw was a frightened child."What I saw was a confused girl who had been so abused - physically, sexually, emotionally - beyond any description."What are you going to do? Throw her out? That doesn't help her."All she did was burst my eardrum. I'm deaf in one ear now, but I don't have a bullet in my head. Forgiveness is one of the graces that we have as human beings. Can I be faulted for indulging in it?"Emshwiller confirms the event but says she wanted to scare, not kill, him after he had said he wanted another girl. She adds it was not the only such incident provoked by her jealousy."One time before, I held him in the corner and I put a knife at his throat," she says."And he just said: 'Go ahead. Kill me.' And I couldn't do it. I just dropped the knife and walked out."Following the raid, McAfee and Emshwiller moved to his villa at San Pedro - a town on Belize's biggest island, Ambergris Caye - where they agreed to have an open relationship.There they were visited by Chad Essley, a cartoonist, who began collaborating on a book about McAfee's life."I didn't quite realise that his lifestyle would be this older guy surrounded by young girls and bodyguards with guns," he says."Many of these girls were former prostitutes or had very rough lives."It was expressly forbidden to go out in the town and drink - the smell of alcohol, he could not be around it. He didn't want any of the girls doing any drugs at all."I interviewed each of these girls, got their background. They were incredibly sad. They were definitely in a better sort of situation being around John."Meanwhile next door, Gregory Faull, an Orlando sports bar owner who had recently divorced and decided to live in his Belize holiday home, was becoming increasingly irate at his neighbour's activities.On Thursday, 8 November 2012, McAfee made the local headlines when he donated 40 stun guns, handcuffs and batons to the local police at a press conference.Mayor Daniel Guerrero thanked him, stating: "Crime is affecting the tourism industry as we have been listed on travel advisories; it is time to stop this. Let us protect our industry and turn San Pedro into the safe haven once more."That night the local TV bulletin declared that "the hatchet was formally buried", suggesting the rift between McAfee and Belize's authorities had ended.Early on Sunday morning, Mr Faull was found dead in a pool of his blood by his housekeeper. Police called to the scene found a single 9mm shell nearby. They said a mobile phone and laptop were missing but there were no visible signs of a forced entry.The head of the police's Gang Suppression Unit told a local newspaper that his officers wanted to speak to McAfee as part of the investigation, but when they called at his house he did not appear to be in.An article posted the following day by Wired magazine revealed why.McAfee told the publication he had seen the officers approaching and had hidden in the sand of his property putting a cardboard box over his head.He recalls that his caretaker had told him of Mr Faull's murder, and now he feared for his own life."The first thing that came to my mind was, 'Oh, my Lord. The government is finally trying to rid themselves of me,' he says."The government does from time to time."I had certainly been a huge thorn in their side, and they had simply got the wrong white man."Seriously, this is what went through my mind. My friends sort of calmed me down, and later said that's absurd. At the time I did not think so."McAfee acknowledges that he and Mr Faull had been at odds, but plays down the idea they hated each other or that he suspected him of being the person who had fed two of Emshwiller's dogs a poisoned tortilla."The entire five years I was there, I'd said maybe 15 words to him," he says."He did not like my dogs and the past two occasions I had seen him walking on the beach he complained. But so did everybody."There was no ongoing argument. Yeah, he was mad about my dogs. Maybe as I'm beginning to think now, maybe he was the one who poisoned them. At the time I certainly did not believe that."In fact, as ABC News later revealed, Mr Faull had filed a complaint to Mayor Guerrero about McAfee the previous month.It said McAfee's dog had attacked a tourist; that his security guards had "terrified" other residents by walking around with shotguns and shining lights in their eyes, and that taxis and other traffic had been arriving at his property "at all hours", causing a disturbance."I did not find that out until weeks after I came back to the States," says McAfee when pressed about this."Belize is not like America where you file a complaint and then the police come out and chase things out. You file a complaint and it goes into a drawer."McAfee then went on the run, saying he feared he would be "silenced" if he was caught and thrown in jail.It made headlines worldwide, in no small part due to the fact that he was posting updates to a blog and giving frequent interviews - actions he says were designed to ensure he couldn't be made to disappear if he had been caught."I disguised myself as a ragged salesman," he recalls."All it takes is some dirty clothes and not bathing for a few days and not combing my hair."You know, people saw my photograph everywhere because all of the police and army had it for that month and a half I was underground. I just made sure I looked different than that."Questioned about the affair, Dean Barrow, Belize's prime minister, made it clear McAfee was not an official murder suspect, and had only been classed instead a "person of interest"."I don't want to be unkind to the gentleman, but I believe he is extremely paranoid, even bonkers," the politician added.During this time McAfee continued to see Emshwiller."When he was on the run I went for lunches with him and then he would call and say: 'Come to this place, or go there,' she recalls."How to come, when to come. Not to go out, or stay home, or go to a different location. He would tell me that so nobody would get me."She adds that she regrets she did not go with him when he finally decided to escape the country.The next major development came on 3 December when a reporter and photographer from Vice magazine revealed they were documenting McAfee's life on the run.In what proved a frustrating twist for the tech guru, they then unwittingly revealed he had crossed the border to Guatemala - a fact revealed by a photo uploaded to the Vice website by staff at its headquarters, who failed to wipe its location data."I had gone out of my way to arrange the escape and I was breathing easily and looking forward to a few days of relaxation," remembers McAfee."We immediately had to go on the run again because we were in Guatemala illegally at this point. But it was no-one's real fault. It was just the fault of the moment."A few days later McAfee was arrested. There was initially speculation he would be sent back to Belize, but a week later he was allowed to fly to Miami a free man."After it was over I asked myself, 'Good Lord, I must have been afraid,'" he says."But I really can't remember. I remember merely trying to solve the problems that occurred as they occurred."McAfee has offered a $25,000 bounty for information relating to Mr Faull's death, but says an attempt to contact the victim's family proved unsuccessful.The family has called the reward a "hollow gesture" and suggested if McAfee really wanted to help he would have met with the Belize police.A spokesman for the country's government said its authorities still wanted to speak to the businessman."Mr McAfee's claims and his behaviour have been extreme," he told the BBC."The investigation is ongoing and McAfee remains a person of interest. If McAfee were to respond to questioning it would make a difference to the progress of the investigation - but this is currently out of the hands of the government of Belize."So long as the crime remains unsolved, it is inevitable the entrepreneur will always face suspicion. But he says he can live with that."There's always going to be someone who likes you and someone who dislikes you," he says."Someone who thinks you're a hero and some that think you're a villain. You know I just do what I can in situations like this to continue to state that I'm totally innocent."That doesn't mean he is trying to forget his time in Belize.In addition to the graphic novel, he is working with a Canadian firm to make both a documentary and a movie about his time there.He adds that George Jung - the imprisoned cocaine drugs lord portrayed by Johnny Depp in the film Blow - has been picked to write his biography.While those projects brew, McAfee has returned to Silicon Valley, announcing the forthcoming launch of a $100 gadget that he promises can make you invisible on the net."If you cannot see it, you cannot hack it, you cannot look at it, you cannot spy on anything happening inside it," he explains.He says the D-Central units will fit in people's pockets and allow their phones, tablets and PCs to communicate with other owners' devices within a three-block radius.He adds they can also connect to the net anonymously via a node - a separate piece of equipment attached to the network - either directly or with their encrypted data relayed relayed via other D-Central boxes.Each will frequently change their network identifier - a long number used by devices as an ID - making them hard to track, he explains.He suggests it will appeal to college students who want to copy music anonymously and to businesses wanting to prevent the theft of corporate secrets.He's also well aware that in the light of Edward Snowden's leaks about surveillance techniques used by the US and UK governments, part of the appeal will be thwarting their efforts."You know from their own paranoia and desire to stay in power, they are watching everything they can," he says.Will the tech work? Will he really frustrate the authorities once again?At this point, like so much of John McAfee's life, it's impossible to be sure of all the facts and it's ultimately up to you whether you take him at his word.</body>

      <body>The operator of the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical site is to begin talks with union bosses in a bid to avert a planned 48-hour strike.Members of the Unite union are planning to walk out on Sunday in a row over the treatment of a union convener.Ineos, operator of the site, said negotiations would start later at arbitration service Acas, in Glasgow.Unite said it had been "working tirelessly" over the weekend to secure the talks.Ineos has warned that the threatened strike "could effectively shut much of Scotland" by disrupting fuel supply.The strike could potentially disrupt the flow of Brent crude from the North Sea.The Scottish and UK governments have been drawing up contingency plans and had called for more talks between the two sides.Announcing the talks on Sunday night, Ineos Grangemouth chairman Calum MacLean said: "We have always been prepared to go to Acas if this helps to resolve a strike that Grangemouth petrochemical plant and refinery cannot afford."We hope to be able to resolve the dispute and address the financial issues that threaten the survival of the entire site."Previously, the company labelled the union action as "completely irresponsible" while the union accused Ineos of "gunboat irresponsible diplomacy".Unite Scottish Secretary Pat Rafferty said: "We welcome Ineos's change of heart to join us at Acas."We've repeatedly urged the company to sit down with us at the conciliation service to resolve the issues surrounding the unfair treatment of our convenor and the future of Grangemouth."Over the weekend we have been working tirelessly to secure these talks and hope that the company will engage in them in an open constructive manner."UK Energy Secretary Ed Davey said the talks were a "very welcome and encouraging step."He added: "I have worked hard with both sides to persuade them to attend talks with Acas and I am extremely pleased that this is now happening."Acas has the expertise to help both parties reach a sustainable solution for the company, the workforce and the whole economy."A spokeswoman for the Scottish government said contingency planning had been under way since the strike was announced.She said: "Ministers and officials have redoubled efforts to encourage Unite and Ineos to enter talks and we welcome the fact that they are now going to talk this afternoon."It is important that both sides have time and space to progress discussions, resolve the issues between them and move away from strike action."Ineos has said it will do all it can to "minimise the harm" of a strike.The North Sea's Forties pipeline system could be affected because the Kinneil oil processing terminal - where oil from the Forties field comes ashore - relies on Grangemouth for its steam and power.The dispute centres on union convener Stephen Deans, who was involved in the row over the selection of a Labour candidate in Falkirk.Labour cleared Unite after an investigation of trying to rig the selection of a party candidate - claims that led to a major row between the union and Ed Miliband.Mr Deans, who is chairman of both Labour's local constituency party and Unite in Scotland, was suspended by Ineos then reinstated.Ineos said an investigation by "a third party" into Mr Deans' conduct was due to be completed by 25 October.It recently launched a survival plan for Grangemouth, warning that the site would close by 2017 without investment and reduced costs. The company said the plant was losing £10m a month.The Grangemouth refinery processes 210,000 barrels of oil per day and provides most of Scotland's fuel. It is owned jointly by Ineos and PetroChina.</body>

      <body>Police investigating the death of a man who was hit by an HGV and then dragged underneath it for three miles have traced the vehicle's driver.Robert Finlayson, 22, was found dead on a road in Lanarkshire on 23 September.Officers and Mr Finlayson's mother Angela had appealed for the driver of the Mercedes Actros to come forward.The driver has now been found, as has the driver of a car which struck Mr Finlayson after he had been carried under the Mercedes.Neither motorist has been charged by police.Insp Calum Maider of Motherwell Road Policing Unit said he was still looking for the driver of another vehicle which is also thought to have struck Mr Finlayson.He said: "We have now traced the driver of a Mercedes Actros heavy goods vehicle which was travelling on the B7078 and struck Mr Finlayson. This vehicle is now the subject of a forensic and mechanical examination. The driver will be interviewed in due course."We have also traced and interviewed the driver of Suzuki Ignis which struck Mr Finlayson after he had been carried under the Mercedes. However there is still a vehicle outstanding."A silver coloured Renault Traffic Crew cab Sport Van, or Vauxhall Movano which is similar in style, was travelling between the Suzuki Ignus and the Mercedes Actros and I am keen to trace the driver."He may be unaware that he has struck Mr Finlayson and it is important that he comes forward."Anyone with further information regarding Mr Finlayson's death, and in particular the driver of the vehicle still being sought, has been asked to telephone the non-emergency number 101.Mr Finlayson, from Hamilton, was seen on CCTV at about 04:10, standing on the north side of the over bridge of the M74 motorway Junction 10 and then heading north on the northbound carriageway of the B7078, where it appears he was attempting to hitchhike.The road was busier than normal because of a diversion from the motorway.More than 40 vehicles, many of them heavy goods vehicles delivering to large retail outlets, were diverted onto the B7078 between 04:00 and 04:30.Several northbound vehicles were seen moving onto the opposite lane to pass Mr Finlayson safely, but police said he was then struck by a vehicle and carried underneath it for three miles to Blackwood, where his body was found.Officers said the the driver of the Mercedes Actros may not have known his vehicle had struck Mr Finlayson.</body>

      <body>Police are investigating claims that officers hired a van - then returned it with bags of cannabis in the back.The drugs were only discovered after a van hire company worker picked up the vehicle from Coatbridge police station in North Lanarkshire and drove it back to his base.It is thought officers forgot to remove the bags before the van was collected.Police said an investigation was being carried out into reports that productions had been left in the van.The officers had hired the vehicle from Mitchell's Hire Drive in Rutherglen, near Glasgow.No-one from the company was available to speak to BBC Scotland on Monday morning.But worker John McKinnon, 33, told the Daily Record newspaper how he had unwittingly driven the cannabis - which had been packed inside black bin bags - some 12 miles back to the firm's office on Sunday morning.He was quoted as saying: "They gave me the keys in a sealed blue bag, walked me out to the van, opened the gates and away I went."There was a strong smell of cannabis in the cabin but it was only when I got back to the office and opened up the back that I realised what was in it."Staff immediately contacted the police, who were said to have re-hired the van in order to remove the vehicle and the drugs.A spokeswoman for Police Scotland said: "We can confirm we are investigating a report that a vehicle, hired by Police Scotland, has been returned to the hire company, allegedly with what is believed to be police productions inside."Enquiries are at early stage to establish the circumstances and it would be inappropriate to comment further."</body>

      <body>A Church of Scotland minister who lost his mother and other close relatives in a suicide attack on a church in Pakistan has said he forgives their killers.The Reverend Aftab Gohar's 79-year-old mother, nephew, niece, two uncles and other friends and relatives were among 122 killed in the attack last month.It happened just after Sunday service at a Christian church in Peshawar.Mr Gohar said: "It is wrong what these people did but I forgive them."The minister of Abbotsgrange Church in Grangemouth was speaking after returning from a visit to his old family church in Peshawar where the massacre took place on 22 September.It is thought to be the deadliest ever attack on Pakistan's Christians.Two Islamist militant groups with Taliban links later said they ordered the attack to hit back at US drone strikes.The kirk minister said: "We pray that they may one day develop the wisdom to understand that it is not right to kill children and other innocent people."There were 125 children in Sunday school that day. My sister was teaching there. Forgiving is what we learn from the Lord Jesus Christ. That is why I forgive."Mr Gohar, who is due to resume full duties at his Grangemouth church on Sunday, stressed that most Muslims had been "respectful and kindly" in the 130 years of the Christian Church's existence in Pakistan - and displayed those same qualities after the tragedy.He continued: "The majority of Muslims helped, taking victims to hospital or helping to prepare graves or prepare food for the injured as well as for the friends and relatives caring for them."The idea that all Muslims hate Christians is simply not true."Mr Gohar said he still feared for friends and relatives in the area, adding that there was an urgent need for more medical help for many of those who were seriously injured.His 23-year-old niece Farah Javed is paralysed from the waist down and needs treatment not available to her in a public hospital.The Gohar family has already had to find "considerable sums" to pay for medical treatment for relatives.The Very Reverend Dr Andrew McLellan, convener of the Church of Scotland World Mission Council, said: "It is very moving to hear the words of the Reverend Aftab Gohar."These heartless killings happened in Pakistan, but forgiveness makes the whole world better."The Church of Scotland is richer for having a minister of the stature of Aftab among us."He and his family are entitled to count on the love and prayers of us all."</body>

      <title>Rangers stress no decision over chair</title>
      <description>Rangers amend a statement about the prospect of Dave King becoming chairman to comply with Stock Exchange rules.</description>

      <body>Rangers have stressed that no decision has been made about former Ibrox director Dave King joining the League One club's football board.The club released a statement from King at the weekend in which he expressed his desire to become chairman.Rangers chief executive Craig Mather also said that he thought the South Africa-based Scot would be an asset.But Rangers have now said they have been advised to amend the statement to comply with Stock Exchange rules.They said that this had come "at the insistence" of Rangers' nominated adviser, Daniel Stewart."RIFC was advised by its nominated adviser that there were regulatory implications arising from these statements and, accordingly, an amendment was subsequently made," the club stated."The board needs to make it clear, for regulatory reasons, that the board of directors referred to above is The Rangers Football Club Limited, the wholly owned subsidiary of The Rangers International Football Club PLC."Although we welcome the support of Dave King, no decision has been made to appoint him as a director."There are regulatory matters which would need to be resolved prior to any such appointment."That news coincides with a hearing being held at the Court of Session in Edinburgh to consider a move by a group of shareholders to include on the agenda of the club's annual meeting on 24 October a motion for four new directors to be appointed to the board.The group wants Malcolm Murray, who was club chairman until April, Paul Murray, who was a director until last year, director of Loch Lomond Golf Club Scott Murdoch and Alex Wilson, a former HR director with BT, to be appointed.Monday's court judgement will affect whether the annual meeting can go ahead as planned or will be delayed because new director proposals will be heard.The possibility of King returning to the board at Ibrox follows talks between himself, Mather and finance director Brian Stockbridge in South Africa.King lost the £20m he invested during Sir David Murray's spell as owner after Rangers went into liquidation last year.However, he believes that having agreed to pay South Africa's revenue service £44m over tax issues, with criminal charges against him being dropped, any impediment to him being appointed to the board has been removed.However, the appointment would not only have to be ratified by adviser Stewart under AIM Stock Exchange rules but must also satisfy the Scottish Football Association's "fit and proper person" rules before he could become a director.Speculation about another financial crisis at Rangers followed this month's announcement that the club, now playing in the third tier of Scottish football, had lost £14m in the last financial year.King's statement said that he had discussed with Mather and Stockbridge the commencement of "a new round of funding to ensure that it is available in an orderly and cost-effective manner when required" and expressed his wish to lead that exercise.However, Rangers have sought to clarify that there is no immediate need for a cash injection."The directors also expect that in the medium-term future, possibly coinciding with the return to top league football in Scotland, it may be in the best interests of the company to raise further capital," said the club's latest statement."However, there is no requirement for short-term funding and, as such, neither the company nor RIFC are actively seeking finance."Nonetheless, we are committed to exploring a future involvement by Mr King in the club."</body>

      <body>The public spending watchdog has said that political instability at Argyll and Bute Council has made the local authority's problems worse.Audit Scotland said working relationships between councillors - and between some councillors and officers - were strained.Its report was compiled before a new administration was formed last month.This ended several months of uncertainty at the council. It has had three different leaders since May 2012.The council, which covers one of the largest geographical areas in Scotland, had no depute leader and no clear administration from May until September of this year.Audit Scotland's report said the political instability at Argyll and Bute meant there was a lack of collective strategic leadership by councillors.It said: "The council's current political management arrangements are contributing to the problems rather than helping the council do business effectively."Working relationships between councillors and between a few councillors and officers are strained and the challenges facing the council are affecting the capacity of senior managers."The problems are not yet affecting frontline services, but they are beginning to inhibit progress with strategic planning and there is a risk that services may suffer in the future if the current difficulties are not addressed."In 2011, Argyll and Bute Council abandoned a controversial plan to shut several rural primary schools.The following year the council's communications team was not fully resourced, following the suspension of the communications manager and the resignations of two additional team members.This meant senior officers were required to take direct responsibility for managing communications issues, at a time when there was significant local media interest in a number of council decisions and over the period of the May 2012 elections.The report said this was one of the factors that had affected senior management capacity.A new communications manager has now been appointed.Argyll and Bute Council has not yet publicly responded to the report.</body>

      <body>The economic recovery in Scotland is gaining momentum, a nationwide survey of purchasing managers has suggested.The Bank of Scotland's latest PMI monitor matched August's survey-record rates of growth in both output and new business.Employment also continued to rise, with a stronger performance reported among service industries than the manufacturing sector.However, food, fuel and labour costs all rose during the month.September's rise in new business - the 10th in successive months - was supported by further growth in new export orders for manufacturers.A strong housing market was another factor driving the upturn, according to survey respondents.The PMI monitor for September recorded sharp increases in business activity in the services sector, with the most marked pace of growth being seen in travel, tourism and leisure.The increase in activity built on solid jobs growth observed at services firms during August.September's survey also pointed to a "sharp and accelerated increase" in new business at Scottish service providers.There was a further slowdown in the rate of growth of manufacturing output north of the border, but it remained "at a level consistent with a solid pace of expansion overall".Scottish manufacturers hired more staff during the month, continuing a trend observed in each month since February.New order intakes rose for the ninth successive month in September, but the rate of growth eased sharply from the marked pace observed in July and August.Goods producers north of the border also registered improved export sales in September.Meanwhile, higher food, fuel and labour costs helped to lift input price inflation to well above the UK average.However, the survey found businesses largely refrained from passing on increased costs to clients.Bank of Scotland chief economist Donald MacRae said: "The PMIs of the last six months suggest the Scottish economy not only grew in quarter two this year but saw that growth accelerate in quarter three."The recovery is gaining momentum."Enterprise Minister Fergus Ewing welcomed the survey results.He said: "This was the 12th consecutive month of private sector output expansion, with growth seen in both services and manufacturing."We are seeing ongoing signs of recovery and Scotland continues to outperform the UK on our employment rate, youth unemployment rate and annual output growth."We will continue to build on that momentum, supporting an investment-led recovery, taking action to boost jobs, create more economic opportunities and enhance business confidence."</body>

      <title>Thalidomide: Were more affected?</title>
      <description>Research at the University of Aberdeen appears to suggest the drug Thalidomide may have caused more deformities than was first thought.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24472269</url>

      <body>New scientific research appears to suggest the drug Thalidomide may have caused a wider range of deformities than previously thought. A new group of "Thalidomiders" now believe they should get compensation for their disabilities.Gary Grayson, from Ipswich, shows me the very first pair of wooden legs he had to wear as a child. They are painted pink, but are heavy and ungainly.The feet are not hinged and there is a complicated harness of steel and leather."They used to call me peg leg and wooden leg. They didn't have a lot of imagination!" he says about some of his former schoolmates.He was born in 1961 with extensive deformities to his lower limbs. His mother says that staff at the hospital reacted with horror."When I was born she heard the nurse gasp and leave the room."Before he was two years old he was admitted to hospital and had both his lower legs amputated. He was walking on artificial limbs within months.His mother has signed an affidavit stating that she took Thalidomide, but he has never received any compensation for his injuries.Thalidomide was originally marketed as a sedative, but from the late 1950s was prescribed to women around the world to combat morning sickness.By 1961 it was clear that it was causing serious birth defects and by late 1961 it was withdrawn in the UK.Ten thousand children were born worldwide with terrible disabilities. It is thought many more died in the womb.After a 10-year legal battle in 1973 the British distributors Distillers agreed to pay compensation in the UK.The Thalidomide Trust was set up and more than 400 children were admitted to the group as beneficiaries.The German manufacturers Grunenthal have never admitted liability to the British victims nor have they contributed to the Thalidomide Trust.A statement from Grunenthal said: "Thalidomide is part of our history and always will be and we have accepted a responsibility to offer help. We have no legal responsibility to compensate individuals affected.Gary Grayson's parents applied to the Thalidomide Trust but doctors said his injuries weren't typical of Thalidomide.He did not let his disability hold him back and did well at school before joining the Ministry of Defence.The 52-year-old's work took him around the world, he rode motorbikes, married and had children. He's now an information security specialist."In my younger years I did not see myself as a victim," he says.But now he has researched deeper into his own medical history and believes the proof is there.He said: "Compensation in today's world, must naturally follow."His case has been taken up by several law firms under the banner of the Thalidomiders legal group, which is representing a number of other clients in the UK.The legal action has temporarily stalled over funding and insurance, but elsewhere in the world other cases continue.As those affected get older, their health is failing.Today in Spain 185 people affected by Thalidomide are taking Grunenthal to court. They have never received compensation from the German company and are now seeking more than £175m in damages.In Australia last year the distributors of the drug agreed to pay damages to fifty-year-old Lynette Rowe. More cases are expected to be settled later this year.In Britain the legal picture is complex.The Thalidomide Trust receives money from both the UK Government and Diageo the company which acquired Distillers. Since 2006 Diageo has put in an average of £7.5 million per year and has committed to do so until 2037.The Trust has only admitted one new beneficiary in the last year and applies strict criteria for inclusion.Those who feel they were harmed by the drug, but do not qualify for the Trust turn to legal action in the hope of getting compensation.Their cases may be assisted by new research being carried out at the University of Aberdeen by Dr Neil Vargesson.His work involves observing the effect of Thalidomide on the development of chick and fish embryos.He has in the past written expert reports for two of the solicitors acting for the new cases.In the 1960s, experts decided that babies were damaged by the drug during a very short period in pregnancy - between 20 and 36 days after conception.Dr Vargesson says questions can be raised about this time-sensitive window and the way the medicine reacted on each individual."The time-sensitive window was based on interviews with parents of severely affected children and relates to outward damage and severe internal damage."He concludes that: "Given the range of damage in Thalidomide survivors and given animal studies that show in one litter each foetus is damaged differently it's clear to me the drug acts differently in each individual and embryo."That would mean that it is possible Thalidomide caused a wider range of damage than was first thought.But he admits that: "We will never know the true range, it's so difficult to go back 55 years and say well let's have a look at these people, because most of them, we don't even know who those people are."His work though is highly controversial. Other experts in the field disagree with his conclusions.Gary Grayson is busy with his career in IT and does all his own DIY.But he can see a time in the future when his health may deteriorate and he'll need more help.For that reason he is determined to continue with his legal action, but also for a much more personal reason too."It would mean the world to me, to be able to ring my mother and say they've admitted they've made a mistake."</body>

      <body>A new £6.7m distillery is to be established in Fife following a tie-up between Indian drinks group Kyndal and Perthshire distiller John Fergus and Co.The two firms have entered into a joint venture for a micro distillery and bonded warehouse in Glenrothes which could be operational by 2015.The facility will focus on exporting to markets in India, Africa and the Far East and create 15 new jobs.It expects to generate exports worth £3.6m over the next three years.The project is being supported by a £1.6m grant from the Scottish government's Food Processing Marketing and Co-operation Scheme (FPMC).Scottish Enterprise is also providing a £240,000 Regional Selective Assistance grant to support employment at the new distillery.The news was announced by Minister for External Affairs Humza Yousaf during a visit to India to promote business links between the two countries.Mr Yousaf said: "This project is proof yet again that there are strong and positive economic reasons for setting up business in Scotland."It is also another reason to celebrate our strong relationship with the Indian business community and an example of why we should seek out more collaborations."The joint venture move comes as talks drag on between India and the European Union on a free trade deal which could lead to cuts in tariffs across a wide range of products and services, including Scotch whisky.India currently levies a 150% duty on whisky imports.Kyndal Group managing director Siddharth Banerji commented: "Kyndal Group is an emerging markets player."Developments towards rationalisation in import duty structures would open up a large market for Scotch whisky, and Kyndal in partnership with John Fergus and Co would like to maximize this huge opportunity."Together, we would launch high-quality premium Scotch and ad-mix brands in these markets."Kyndal Group was set up in 2002 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Whyte and Mackay.Following the buyout of Whyte and Mackay by India 's UB Group, Mr Banerji led a management buyout of Kyndal India in 2006.The company employs more than 100 people in India, with sales offices and warehouses across the country.</body>

      <body>Moray Council's decision to shut seven of its 15 libraries is being reviewed by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission.The local authority last month voted to axe the Burghead, Cullen, Dufftown, Findochty, Hopeman, Portknockie and Rothes facilities, to save more than £350,000.The commission is reviewing the decision process.Its findings could be used in any future challenge.The closure decision came in the face of a recommendation from an equality impact assessment to retain the facilities at Burghead, Cullen and Dufftown.This was to ensure access for the elderly, families with young children, and people with a disability.The Save Moray Libraries campaign insists the case for retaining the libraries is overwhelming, but the council - which acknowledged the strength of opposition to the closures - said cuts had to be made.</body>

      <body>Network Rail has confirmed that it is to carry out a programme of works to renew and strengthen parts of the Stirling - Alloa - Kincardine line.The company said the route has been heavily used by coal trains supplying the Longannet power station.In July, it was announced that the power station may continue to operate until 2025.Network Rail said the planned work on the line would also improve its ability to withstand severe weather.A Network Rail spokesman said: "The S-A-K line is a key route for coal trains travelling to Longannet and it has seen increasing levels of usage since it opened in 2008. That usage is also set to continue for longer with the extension of the lifetime of the power station."We intend to carry out a rolling programme of works to renew some sections of the line that require formation treatment to support the ongoing tonnages of coal traffic. We will also be carrying out drainage works to future-proof the route against the wetter and more severe winters we have been experiencing."We are currently working with the train and freight operators, and other stakeholders, to plan these works and the full scope, timings and costs of the project have still to be finalised."</body>

      <body>Police have been criticised for their handling of a suicide case in Edinburgh after investigators found they "mismanaged" the inquiry.John McNeill, the independent police investigations and review commissioner, has made recommendations for the future handling of potential suicide cases.It follows the discovery of a woman's body in Clermiston in June 2013.Her body was found the day after officers had rejected claims by her family that she appeared suicidal.In a summary of his findings, the commissioner made six separate recommendations to the Chief Constable of Police Scotland.They range from calling for an investigation into the actions of the police officers dealing with the missing person inquiry, to a recommendation that the Police Scotland Mental Health and Place of Safety standard operating procedure (SOP) is updated to provide additional guidance to officers dealing with people reported to be suicidal.The independent investigation looked into the handling of the 36-year-old woman's disappearance.Her body was found by a dog walker in Clermiston Woods.Police had received a call from the woman's estranged husband the previous evening to say he was worried that his wife appeared to want to kill herself.Officers were aware she had recently tried to commit suicide, the PIRC investigation found.They visited the woman's home in Edinburgh but concluded the call was malicious after interviewing her and her 16-year-old son.She was not seen alive again after leaving her home later that evening.A missing person inquiry was launched after a suicide note was found at her home the following day.The PIRC investigation found the case was not immediately treated as a high priority because officers judged the note did not contain any obvious suicidal tendencies and could have been fabricated.The woman's phone was active when she was first reported missing but the battery had died by the time officers tried to trace it, "hampering" the investigation.The PIRC report said: "Police officers erred in their assessment of the circumstances and this impacted upon their decision-making, which included that the call appeared to have been malicious"The missing person inquiry was mismanaged. The missing person inquiry should have been immediately graded a high priority."Communications data to locate the woman's phone should have been sought on an emergency basis early in the inquiry. Delays in obtaining and interpreting this data hampered the investigation."A search for the woman should have been undertaken."The PIRC also found additional information from the woman's family about her intentions may have allowed the force to "reappraise" its earlier decisions.Professor McNeill said: "Following my investigation, I have made a number of recommendations both specific to this case and more wide-ranging, particularly in relation to the guidance that is available to officers dealing with incidents such as this."A Police Scotland spokesman said: "Police Scotland thanks the PIRC for their report, which outlines a number of findings following an investigation."Our thoughts are also with the family of the deceased at this difficult time."It is clear that a number of learning points exist in relation to this incident and we will study all the evidence provided by the PIRC."We note that the PIRC have made a number of recommendations, which includes investigating the actions of specific officers."This point, alongside all recommendations, will be investigated to ensure Police Scotland provide the highest of standards of service to the public."</body>

      <body>A man who murdered a pensioner in his own home in West Lothian has been jailed for life.Keiryn Nisbet had denied killing Robert Simpson, 67, known as Ronnie, in Mayfield Drive, Armadale, on 6 October 2012.Nisbet, 22, was jailed for a minimum of 18 years before being eligible for parole.Sentencing Nisbet, judge Norman Ritchie QC said: "You are a danger to the public."He added: "This was a horrific and sustained attack on an old man in his own home."Nisbet entered the flat of Mr Simpson, who was a complete stranger, and repeatedly punched, kicked and stamped on his head and body.He also struck Mr Simpson on the head with a blunt instrument and dragged him across the floor of his house.Mr Simpson received a number of blows to his head, but died as a result of injuries to his body which included fractured ribs.At the High Court in Glasgow, Judge Ritchie added: "For no known reason you assaulted Mr Simpson. This brutal and senseless attack left Mr Simpson lying dying in the living room of his flat."Mr Simpson had left his front door unlocked and it is thought Nisbet, who had been drinking for 10 hours and taken heroin and cocaine, may have gone inside thinking it was a former girlfriend's home.Once inside he subjected Mr Simpson, who was sitting watching television, to the violent attack.The police were called, but when they arrived they found Mr Simpson's home in darkness and left after seeing no signs of a disturbance.During that time Nisbet was in the flat with Mr Simpson.Judge Ritchie told Nisbet: "You did not get help for him. He either died in front of you or you left him to die alone."Nisbet showed no remorse and later tried to get into a nightclub before heading to a house party.When questioned by police he denied ever being in Mr Simpson's home, but was caught by forensic evidence as palm and fingerprints were found in the flat, along with footwear impressions, blood and DNA.Distinctive fibres from a red hooded top he was wearing that evening were also found while CCTV evidence and witnesses also placed him near the scene.Nisbet, who was on bail at the time, sent a message to a friend on Facebook saying he had attacked a man but could not fully remember what he had done.He continues to insist he is innocent.Nicky Patrick, procurator fiscal for High Court cases in the east of Scotland, said: "Keiryn Nisbet subjected Robert Simpson, a quiet and frail man who walked with the aid of a walking stick, to a sustained, vicious and unprovoked attack in his own home."Det Ch Insp Robert Cowper, of Police Scotland, said: "Keiryn Nisbet did not know Ronnie Simpson and throughout or enquiries we have been unable to establish any possible motive for this violent attack, which resulted in the 67-year-old's death."He has proven himself to be a cold and callous individual, who has shown no remorse for his actions and the impact they have had on Mr Simpson's family."With Keiryn Nisbet now set to spend a considerable period of time behind bars, I sincerely hope that Mr Simpson's family can put this horrendous ordeal behind them and begin to move on with their lives."</body>

      <body>A man from Port Glasgow has been formally arrested in Pakistan along with three other men in connection with the murder of his wife.Abdul Sattar's wife Mumtaz was killed in Pakistan on 21 September.Mr Sattar, 40, claimed the couple were drugged, attacked and thrown out of a taxi shortly after arriving in Lahore.They had been on their way to see his parents in Punjab. Mrs Sattar later died and was buried in Shahkot.Her husband has been detained in custody by police.The announcement was made at a media conference in Glasgow held by relatives of Mrs Sattar and the family's lawyer, Aamer Anwar.Mr Anwar said: "I can advise that Abdul Sattar has now been formally arrested and is presently in custody."I was advised by the investigating officer yesterday evening that all of Mumtaz Sattar's property, including her jewellery, as well as Mr Sattar's credit cards, passport and £3,500, were recovered yesterday. Included in the items was Mumtaz's diary."Mr Anwar said police in Pakistan had found a white car which Mr Sattar had said was a taxi used to transport him and his wife from outside the security perimeter of the airport in Lahore.The police had confirmed the vehicle was not a taxi, Mr Anwar said. He added that Mr Sattar had been seen on CCTV greeting males from the white car.He added: "Three other suspects in the murder have also been formally arrested. These men, who were on the run following the recovery of the white car on Sunday, are allegedly linked to the white car and to Abdul Sattar."Mr Anwar said he expected all four accused men to appear in court on Saturday, with bail likely to be opposed by the police.Scottish police have been helping the Pakistani authorities with their investigation.Last weekend the governor of the Punjab region, former Glasgow MP Mohammad Sarwar, assured Mrs Sattar's relatives that "justice will be done".</body>

      <body>The Conservative Party has said councils in Scotland have received more than 2,500 wind farm applications in the past 18 months.The party's figures indicate the local authorities facing the greatest workload in dealing with the proposals are Aberdeenshire, Highland and Orkney.The Conservatives said wind farms have become a "gravy train".The Scottish government said it has given councils additional funding to deal with the applications.The 2,508 applications represented, according to the Conservatives, seven every working day.Conservative energy spokesman Murdo Fraser said: "Alex Salmond has played to the gallery on this one, but the figures show the rush of wind farm applications remains intense."These applications put council planning departments under immense strain, and cause great concern to communities worried about the impact a massive wind farm on their doorstep will have."And even if a council does reject an application, there is a good chance the turbine-hungry Scottish government will overturn the ruling in pursuit of its own overly green policies."Mr Fraser added: "This surge has to stop, and the way to do that is ending ludicrous subsidies for an unreliable and intermittent energy source, and stop inviting companies to develop in areas which are clearly unsuitable."We appreciate that wind farms have a place, but the fact there are seven wind farm applications a day in Scotland proves this is a gravy train threatening to career out of control."The Scottish government has said its policy represents a "balance" between different interests.A spokeswoman said: "We recognise that some planning authorities face pressure from the volume of wind turbine applications they receive, and have identified additional funds to assist them."Seventeen bids were received for additional funds and earlier this year £725,000 was made available to support all of those bids."Our policy on wind farm applications aims to strike an appropriate balance between Scotland's massive green energy potential and the need to satisfactorily address the impacts on communities and the environment."</body>

      <body>A man who groomed a 14-year-old girl and had sex with her in a tent on a beach has been jailed.Sean Clode befriended the teenager while playing games online and she travelled from her home in northern Scotland to meet him.The 21-year-old, of Glamis Walk, Hartlepool denied sexual grooming, child abduction and sexual activity with a child, but was found guilty.He was sentenced to a six-year term by the judge at Teesside Crown Court.Clode was also subjected to a Sexual Offences Prevention Order, and must sign the sex offenders register.The trial heard that the girl told her parents she was going to school but instead met up with Clode and spent 20 hours in a tent on dunes at Crimdon Dene.Her disappearance sparked a "frantic search" by her father, who drove through the night to search for her.The tent was later spotted by the crew of a police helicopter.Judge Howard Crowson said that his plan for the pair to meet up caused "unimaginable anxiety" for her parents."That she was a willing participant in these activities is no mitigation," he said."Her life and outlook have been completely distorted by you."You are a selfish man interested only in your own sexual desires."Det Con Chris Bryan of Cleveland Police, said: "Parents should view this case as a warning to check who their children are speaking to, not only on social networking sites but also over live chat when playing on games consoles."Sexual predators will use any opportunity possible to groom victims."</body>

      <body>A former senior policeman was a "sexual predator" who used his power to abuse women, a trial has been told.Ian Paterson, 62, of Tarves, denies eight charges involving women when he was chief executive of Aberdeen Council of Voluntary Organisations.Fiscal depute Anne MacDonald told the jury at Aberdeen Sheriff Court that Mr Paterson abused his power to "manipulate" women.David Moggach, defending, described his client as a "tactile" person.Ms MacDonald told the fifth day of the indecency and sexual abuse trial: "The accused is simply a sexual predator."Power can be used for good or power can corrupt and this man corrupted himself with the power over these ladies."Mr Moggach suggested that the women could have misinterpreted the situations.He told the jury: "With an assault there must be evil intent."I would submit to you that there are occasions that when someone touches you on the arm, your leg, the small of your back perhaps to get you out of the way, there's no evil intent in that."The trial continues on Monday.</body>

      <body>A valuable bronze sculpture by Henry Moore has been stolen from a park in south west Scotland.Standing Figure was one of four pieces by Moore at the Glenkiln Sculpture Park in Lincluden Estate near Shawhead.Police Scotland said the sculpture was of "high value" and have appealed for witnesses to contact them.Standing Figure is among a string of works by the abstract artist, who died in 1986 aged 88, to be targeted by thieves in recent years.Last November, a Henry Moore sculpture worth up to £500,000 was taken from the Henry Moore Foundation at Much Hadham, Hertfordshire.Two men later admitted stealing The Sundial sculpture, which they then sold for £46.The Glenkiln sculpture park was created by local landowner Sir William Keswick between 1951 and 1976.Sir William bought Standing Figure after seeing it in an exhibition, and Moore was personally "thrilled" with the artwork's open air location.Moore said of the project: "I don't know whether he got the idea to put sculpture on his sheep farm after he saw the Battersea Park open-air exhibition, or whether he was inspired by his experiences in China, where he had lived for many years, and where, he said, there are many examples of monumental sculptures in the open air."In any case, he bought this piece to put on his farm in Scotland. He placed the sculpture himself on an existing outcrop of rock."Later I went up there and was thrilled with the beautiful landscape and at how well he had sited 'Yon Figure'."</body>

      <body>Two Stirling councillors have withdrawn a motion calling for the Union flag to be flown outside Stirling Council's headquarters.Tory member Callum Campbell suggested the debate which was seconded by Labour member Danny Gibson.The proposal had been condemned by some nationalists.On Thursday the councillors withdrew the motion, saying they did not want it to be a "distraction" from the "real issues of uncertainty".At present the council flies two flags at its headquarters - a conventional St Andrew's Cross and a specially-modified Saltire, which also includes the lion rampant and emblems from the city's coat of arms.The suggested motion would have seen both the Union flag and the modified Saltire flown.The Union flag would have been flown outside the council building while the Saltire would have been on the flagpole in the grounds between the building and the main road.Stirling is run by a coalition of Labour and Conservative councillors, although the SNP is the largest single party.After withdrawing the motion due to be debated on Thursday evening, Councillor Campbell said: "I don't want this motion to become a distraction from the real issues of uncertainty that the SNP are asking us to decide upon next year, so I have written to the provost withdrawing my motion."On Thursday, 18 September next year, the electorate in Scotland will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?"Policies on which flags are flown vary from council to council.Some fly the St Andrew's Cross, the union flag and the EU flag or a corporate logo. Others fly just one flag and change it depending on the occasion.Glasgow City Council normally flies the St Andrew's Cross above the city chambers but replaces it with a Union flag on royal birthdays and some other special occasions.</body>

      <title>Call for regional asylum centres</title>
      <description>A refugee charity calls for regional screening centres to be set up, to process applications from asylum seekers who arrive in Scotland.</description>

      <body>A refugee charity has called for regional screening centres to be set up to process applications from asylum seekers.Almost everyone seeking asylum in the UK currently has to travel to Croydon, in south London, to submit their application.The Scottish Refugee Council said many refugees could not afford to travel.A Home Office spokesman said the majority of applicants were located close to Croydon.A Home Affairs Select Committee report published on Friday was highly critical of the current system.In their report, MPs said they heard evidence from Debora Singer of the Asylum Aid charity, who described how a pregnant asylum seeker based in Scotland was required to travel overnight to Croydon for a morning appointment, despite the protestations of the Scottish Refugee Council (SRC).The woman went into labour on the steps of the asylum screening unit.Nina Murray, a women's policy officer with SRC, said the report was a "significant and powerful critique of a system that is really failing quite a lot of people, and particularly the most vulnerable people".She pointed out that, under very exceptional circumstances, the most vulnerable asylum seekers were able to be screened in regional centres, but said it was becoming "increasingly difficult" to prove people were genuinely unable to travel to Croydon.Ms Murray told BBC radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: "Many people arrive having spent their last penny trying to get out of a difficult situation and don't have any money - they may be destitute."Quite a lot of people do fetch up in Scotland. We're not quite sure how and why but there are issues around trafficking, around smuggling, people do come off the backs of lorries and turn up on our doorstep."But also people may be living legally in the country and the situation changes, for example Syrians who may have been studying in Scotland and are now unable to return home."She added: "We already have a Home Office office in Brand Street in Govan here in Glasgow. That is mainly a reporting centre for people to report to, and they also carry out some asylum interviews there, but at the moment people are told that to lodge an application they have to travel all the way to Croydon."We don't think it would be a huge ask for everybody to be screened here in Scotland. Other countries of a comparable size do have various regional screening centres and we know that this is an issue for other parts of the UK, such as Liverpool or Wales, that are also quite far from Croydon."Ms Murray said it was currently charities such as SRC and the Edinburgh-based Refugee Survival Trust who were paying for bus tickets to allow people to get to Croydon.She added: "We don't see that as sustainable".Among the other issues raised by the Home Affairs Committee were complaints about the length of time it took to get interviews at the Asylum Screening Unit in Croydon, with one legal representative making more than 200 phone calls in a month without being able to book any appointments.A further criticism was that, unlike the regional offices, the unit does not offer childcare.This means that children are present when parents are making their claim to the screening officer, which the committee said could inhibit disclosure as many parents would not discuss acts of sexual violence or torture in front of their children.The report added: "Despite the fact that childcare is offered at the regional offices, the letters inviting applicants for interview still state that childcare is not available and that they should not bring their children with them."This has been repeatedly raised with the Home Office over the past two years but the standard invitation letter has not been amended."The committee recommended that the Home Office amend its guidance to ensure that any applicant who is disabled or pregnant is offered a screening appointment at a regional centre.In cases where the applicant is the primary carer of a child under the age of 16, childcare should be made available to those who need it for their interviews, and this should be made clear in the invitation letters, it added.A Home Office spokesman said: "Asylum seekers are expected to claim asylum as soon as they arrive in the UK, at the airport or seaport of entry."For those who do not claim asylum on arrival, or whose circumstances change while in the UK, asylum applications can be registered at the Asylum Screening Unit in Croydon."This location, ten miles south of central London, is based on where the majority of applicants are located."</body>

      <body>New financial powers already agreed for Scotland will be a "considerable challenge" to implement, a Holyrood committee has warned.MSPs are concerned about the level of information provided by the UK and Scottish governments to help with the provisions of the Scotland Act 2012.This includes a new rate of income tax due to come into force in April 2016.The Scottish government agreed that more clarity was needed and said it was working on this with the Treasury.The new tax rate will involve the Treasury deducting 10p from standard and upper rates of income tax in Scotland and giving MSPs the power to decide how to raise money.But Holyrood's Finance Committee said there was a lack of clarity about forecasts, particularly with the UK's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).It found that considerable work would be needed by both governments to agree proposals to adjust the block grant allocated to Scotland by Westminster.MSPs also have concerns about "wildly optimistic" OBR forecasts for the land and building transaction tax (LBTT), which replaces stamp duty land tax in April 2015.They said forecasting for a new landfill tax must be transparent and open.Finance committee convener Kenneth Gibson MSP said: "We believe it is essential that there is effective parliamentary scrutiny of the implementation process and, in particular, the way in which the UK government will adjust Scotland's block grant to take account of the new financial powers."We will continue to closely monitor the accuracy of the OBR forecasts and will take evidence from the chair of the OBR on an annual basis."The report concluded: "The committee recognises that there is a considerable challenge for both the UK government and the Scottish government in implementing the financial provisions of the Scotland Act 2012."Nevertheless, it is essential that there is effective parliamentary scrutiny of the implementation process."The report added: "The committee is concerned about the level of information being provided by the two governments as the negotiations progress."At the same time, the committee welcomes the commitment of the Scottish government to consult with the Scottish Parliament on the adjustments to the block grant and emphasises the need for sufficient time to be made available to allow the committee to carry out effective scrutiny of the proposal."A Scottish government spokeswoman said: "We welcome this report and the recognition of the Scottish government's work to take forward the financial provisions of the Scotland Act."We agree that the Scottish Parliament and people require greater clarity over changes to the allocation of the block grant and the Scottish government is working actively with HM Treasury to achieve that."While welcome, the tax raising powers to be transferred to the Scottish Parliament through the Scotland Act represent a missed opportunity, only giving Parliament control over an additional 17% of Scotland's revenues."With full fiscal and economic powers the Scottish Parliament could do more to realise Scotland's full economic potential."</body>

      <body>The health service in Scotland has admitted that complaints about GPs and dentists rose by more than a third last year.Initially the statistics division of the NHS said complaints had dropped, but it has now said a "formula error" was discovered.It means complaints for all parts of the NHS rose last year.Complaints about hospitals and clinics were at their highest level for 10 years.Statistics published in September initially indicated that grievances against GPs and dentists had fallen by 15% between 2011/12 and 2012/13.But a revision to these original figures showed that the number of complaints in fact rose by 36%.NHS Scotland Information Services Division revised the number of complaints against family doctors and dentists from 2,992 to 4,804 for 2012/13, compared with 3,538 in 2011/12.Conservative health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: "This isn't a small statistical error. It's a major oversight which created the impression that doctor surgeries and dentists were performing considerably better than last year."In fact, the opposite is true and the Scottish government now needs to explain why there has been such a huge increase in complaints."</body>

      <body>Tourism in Scotland has enjoyed a "resurgence" following a challenging year for the sector, Tourism Minister Fergus Ewing has said.Official figures showed visitor numbers in the 12 months to June were 1% down on the previous year, with spend falling 6%.But the first six months of this year showed a slight rise in both visitor numbers and spending.Mr Ewing called the first-half figures "encouraging".The Office for National Statistics recorded a total of 6.5 million domestic and international visitors between January and June - 1.6% more than the same period last year.Tourism spend also rose by 1.7% in the first half, bringing overall expenditure in Scotland between January and June to £1.8bn.Domestic holidays continued to prove popular, with the number of staycations increasing by 2%.During the second quarter of the year, international visitor numbers were also 2% higher than the same period last year.Tourism minister Fergus Ewing said: "The growth in tourism during the first half of 2013 shows a resurgence in both domestic and international markets."Growth in international tourists has mainly been due to a rise in visitors from emerging markets, with an increase in visitor numbers from countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Brazil."New air routes such as the re-introduction of direct air links from Canada, and Easyjet, starting new routes from Europe to Scotland, will open up our country to more visitors."Virgin's new routes into Scotland from Heathrow have connected Scotland to more than 30 global destinations and already we are seeing tour operators launching new tourist packages to Scotland as a result."He added: "Despite this resurgence, last year was a challenging time for the tourism economy, and this is still impacting on visitor figures and spend."Last month, Historic Scotland reported a "record-breaking" summer for Scotland's visitor attractions.It said there were nearly 1.7 million visitors, an increase of 14.8% on the same period last year.Records were broken at "flagship" site Edinburgh Castle, with numbers up 26% on 2012 for the period June to August.August saw 229,940 visitors at the castle, more than any month ever.</body>

      <title>'Massive' energy investment expected</title>
      <description>Britain's energy sector is close to securing tens of billions of pounds in investment from the Far East, Energy Secretary Ed Davey says.</description>

      <body>Britain's energy sector is close to securing tens of billions of pounds in investment from the Far East, Energy Secretary Ed Davey has said.He said a "massive" wave of investment in nuclear and other technology from China, Japan and Korea would help secure the UK's future power supply.A deal to build new reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset was close, he added.Labour has said the government is not doing enough, but Mr Davey called its record on energy investment "shocking".His comments come amid a fierce political row over household energy bills, with SSE becoming the first of the "big six" energy firms to announce a sharp increase in prices last week.Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Mr Davey said he had made "huge progress" during a recent visit to China - during which he spoke to all of the country's major energy suppliers about boosting two-way investment."The Chinese, along with the Japanese and the Koreans are very interested in the opportunities in the British nuclear sector. I think it is really possible we will see massive Chinese investment, not just in nuclear but across the board.""I think we will see massive Japanese and Korean investment. It is really critical we get that investment," he said.Recent reports have suggested China General Nuclear Power Group could take a 49% stake in the French-led consortium seeking to develop Hinkley Point.Under existing proposals, two new nuclear reactors would replace those set to stop operating in the middle of the next decade.Mr Davey indicated the UK was also "extremely close" to a deal with EDF - one of Britain's big six energy firms - to invest in Hinkley.The government has said the state will not directly subsidise the building of new nuclear plants but has insisted that new generating capacity is essential - alongside other forms of energy - to meet the UK's growing energy needs.Mr Davey told the programme that, when an agreement was finally reached, he was "convinced I will be able to look consumers in the eyes, look businesses in the eyes, and say we have a good deal".The energy secretary also played down suggestions of differences with Tory Chancellor George Osborne - who is currently in China on a trade mission - over energy policy, saying they were "stuck together" on the need to substantially increase levels of investment.Elsewhere in the programme, Mr Davey said he expected other firms to follow SSE and raise energy prices, but he made no apology for seeking to upgrade and modernise the UK's energy system.Energy companies have said one of the reasons they are having to hike prices is to pay for huge investment in the UK's generation and distribution infrastructure.The energy secretary said he had written to the largest firms to ask them what they were doing to simplify their bills, so consumers could understand what they were being charged.He said he expected answers from them by Monday.Ministers have dismissed Labour's pledge of a price freeze on energy bills after 2015, arguing the way to help consumers is to increase competition and make it easier for people to switch supplier in order to access the best possible tariff.Mr Davey told the programme Labour's warnings about a looming energy crisis rang hollow."The lights are going to stay on. Since this government came to power, we have been running to increase energy investment. Labour's energy investment record was frankly shocking."They were negligent with energy and climate change policy. We are the ones delivering the new power stations, the policies to deliver the billions of pounds of investment."Meanwhile, Labour said the government was building false expectations about the benefits of shale gas and was presenting it as an alternative to renewable energy.Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint told Sky News Labour was not opposed to fracking in Britain, but warned it was not yet known at what cost it could be produced."We are not setting our face against it if the conditions are right and the environment is right, but what we do disagree with is polarising shale against renewables that we need as well," she said.</body>

      <body>Royal Mail shares rose 38% to 455p in their first day of conditional dealings on the London Stock Exchange.The hugely oversubscribed sale was priced at 330p a share, valuing the 500-year-old firm at £3.3bn. At one point, the price hit 459.75p.Private investors received 227 shares each. In all, more than 225 million shares were traded on Friday.Business Secretary Vince Cable told Channel Four News he could have charged a higher price for Royal Mail shares.Asked if he could have raised the sale price when he saw the level of demand for shares, Mr Cable said: "I could have done and I could have joined the speculators and spivs."I'm not interested in doing that," he said.The shares are listed officially next Tuesday, but City institutions began conditional dealings on Friday.Some 10 million shares were traded in the first 30 seconds when the market opened. Stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown reported that its website was having "intermittent problems" due to the "unprecedented interest" in Royal Mail.Tom McPhail, the firm's head of pensions research, said it was "extremely sorry for the delays", but was making "significant progress in clearing the backlog" and hoped to have all systems running normally again soon."We have experienced demand this morning which has gone off the scale," he said."We now have six times the normal number of staff working on our dealing lines. We know we are not the only broker affected by such problems this morning."The price rise is likely to fuel debate over whether the sale of Royal Mail has been undervalued. Mr Cable has insisted that the taxpayer has not been short-changed by the privatisation.But the general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, Billy Hayes, described the sell-off as "a tragedy" and predicted that it would make "not one scintilla of difference" to employees' intention to vote for strike action next Wednesday.Mr Hayes told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "This is a sham, really. The company has been undervalued."It's basically David Cameron rewarding his mates in the City. Vince Cable, one of the cleverest men in British politics, has made one of the stupidest decisions he is ever likely to make as a politician."Mr Cable told the Today programme that the bulk of the shares had gone to "long-term stable investors" in the UK.He said any volatility in the Royal Mail share price over the next week or so was of little consequence. "What matters is where the price eventually settles in three or six months' time".Mr Cable said: "You get an enormous amount of froth and speculation in the aftermath of a big IPO [initial public offering] of this kind."The bulk of the shares have gone to long-term institutional investors, stable investors, some overseas investors, but mainly British pension funds and insurance companies who are there for the long term."The objective of the exercise, which fits in with what we want for the Royal Mail, is to make sure it has stable, long-term investors."Voting in the strike ballot will close on 16 October. Under the current rules on industrial action, the earliest possible date for a strike is 23 October.In the flotation prospectus, Royal Mail warned that labour unrest posed a potential risk for the share price.Mr Cable said a strike was not in the interests of Royal Mail.City analysts said the price rise was driven by big institutional investors' demand for the stock. Matt Basi, head of UK sales trading at CMC Markets, said investment funds were "queuing up to make big purchases".Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, called the surge in Royal Mail shares a "dazzling stock market debut".But he said factors such as the threat of industrial action, a lack of adequate capital and unclear growth strategy could weigh down the stock price in the future.</body>

      <body>Details of the remaining Commonwealth Games tickets that will be offered to people who missed out on initial applications have been released.Seats at the rugby sevens, badminton, hockey, table tennis, squash, bowls and weightlifting competitions were said to have the best availability.Limited tickets also remain for some sessions of athletics, boxing and rhythmic gymnastics.Some tickets for both the opening and closing ceremonies are also available.During the initial four-week window for the Glasgow 2014 Games, there were 2.3 million requests for up to one million tickets.Of the 17 sports on offer, track cycling, diving, swimming, judo, shooting and the 100m sprint final were all over-subscribed and needed ballots to select who received tickets.The second sale will run for six days from Monday 21 October, with the first two days set aside for applicants who missed out in the initial ticket sales.From Wednesday 23 October, applicants who received some of their requested tickets in the initial period will have the chance to purchase more on a first come, first served basis, with those who received all of their initial application able to join the sale from Friday 25 October.Any remaining tickets will then be released on general sale at a later date.Ty Speer, deputy chief executive of Glasgow 2014, said: "We have been really delighted with the phenomenal demand for tickets since the opening of applications, but the message to everyone is there are still great tickets available to experience great sport in Glasgow next summer."Ahead of the exclusive on-sale period, we wanted to give ticket applicants the opportunity to think, plan and get excited about the opportunities that still exist to be part of the UK's next big sporting occasion."The Queen's Baton Relay - heralding the 2014 Games - was launched at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday.The baton contains the Queen's hand-written message to the Commonwealth and will visit all 70 competing nations and territories over the next 288 days.</body>

      <body>Twelve Scots have won financial support from the UK Athletics' World Class Performance Programme for 2013-2014 because of their Olympic potential.Eilidh Child and Jamie Bowie are both to receive "podium" support in their respective 4x400 relay teams.Paralympians Libby Clegg and Stef Reid also receive the top level of support.Mark Dry, Eilish McColgan, Laura Muir, Chris O'Hare, Lynsey Sharp, Samantha Kinghorn, Meggan Dawson-Farrell and Allan Smith have second-tier support.The "podium potential" athletes are viewed as developing towards Tokyo 2020 in the National Lottery-funded support programme.Meanwhile, the "podium" support is for those viewed as having the potential to win medals at Rio in 2016.Scottishathletics chief executive Nigel Holl said: "We'd like to offer our congratulations to the athletes and their coaches on this deserved selection."The news comes as a host of former World Championship medallists have lost their Lottery funding for the 2014 season.Lisa Dobriskey and Jenny Meadows, who won 1500 metres silver and 800m bronze respectively at the 2009 World Championships, and Andy Turner, the 2011 world 110m hurdles bronze medallist, are among the leading names to have been dropped from the programme under the strict new guidelines set down by UK Sport.Yamile Aldama, the 41-year-old Cuba-born triple jumper who won world indoor gold last year, has also left the programme, along with Phillips Idowu, whose removal was a foregone conclusion following his decision to take an indefinite break from athletics.UK Sport, the body which distributes the funding, has narrowed its criteria, meaning only athletes considered realistic medal contenders for the Rio 2016 Olympics are eligible for podium funding.Previously, the emphasis had been on the likelihood of making a final.The result is a smaller crop of 22 athletes on top-level funding, plus 16 on relay funding.The 44 younger athletes on the lower-level podium potential support had to have proved their potential to win a medal in Tokyo in 2020.In addition, there are 25 Paralympic athletes on podium funding, plus two on relay support, and 23 on podium potential.Scottish athletes on podium supportJamie Bowie (4x400m)Eilidh Child (4x400m)Libby Clegg (T12 sprint events)Stef Reid (T44 sprint and long jump)Scottish athletes on podium potential supportMark Dry (hammer)Meggan Dawson-Farrell (T54/F57 1,500m)Samantha Kinghorn (T53)Eilish McColgan (3000m steeplechase)Laura Muir (800m)Chris O'Hare (1500m)Lynsey Sharp (800m)Allan Smith (high jump)</body>

      <description>Gregor Townsend is pleased with Glasgow Warriors' fightback despite a heavy loss to Heineken Cup holders Toulon.</description>

      <body>Glasgow Warriors coach Gregor Townsend expressed pride in his side's second-half comeback despite a 51-28 thumping by Toulon in the Heineken Cup.The visitors' recovery after the defending champions raced into a 34-0 lead even had him contemplating a win."To get a bonus point was a huge effort from the boys and I'm very proud of them," he said after the group opener."With 10 minutes to go, if a few passes had stuck, we could have been close to winning."Toulon established their lead thanks to two tries from France centre Maxime Mermoz and others from Delon Armitage and Chris Masoe.But the visitors ran in four tries of their own in 22 minutes to find themselves within 13 points of their opponents with 20 minutes to go before Matt Giteau's second try of the match late on ensured a home win."Our goal was to show who we were," said Townsend. "We did that in the second half. It wasn't us in the first."And, if you stand off a good team like Toulon, that's what happens to you."Townsend thought the occasion might have affected his team early on."The first half is difficult to explain, the whole excitement got to us as a group, the atmosphere - we forgot to focus on doing our individual tasks," said the former Scotland and Lions back."And, if you don't slow down a team like Toulon, they're going to cut you apart. They played some great rugby."Glasgow's second-half revival came after Canada wing DTH van der Merwe was introduced at half-time and Niko Matawalu moved off the wing to scrum-half.They made a massive impact and scored three of the four tries between them."I wouldn't have signed for a bonus point before the game, but I would have at half-time," said Townsend."We approach every game with the belief that, if we play our best, we can be a match for anyone. We didn't take a shot at goal in the whole game."The guys really performed well, the subs that came on were fantastic. That helped put Toulon under pressure and the tries we scored were cracking tries."Glasgow next host Exeter Chiefs, who started their campaign with a fine 44-29 win over Cardiff Blues."Next week is going to be a huge challenge," said Townsend, who will look for his side to avoid another poor start."I've watched Exeter the last couple of days and their last performance against Gloucester was outstanding."Meanwhile, Toulon captain Chris Masoe picked out debutant Ali Williams for special praise and thought his 32-year-old New Zealand team-mate's arrival had improved the team."We have even greater depth in the squad than last year," he said. "We may even be slightly better off than last year."Overall, we're satisfied with the win over Glasgow. It was the first game of the Heineken Cup and we got a win with the bonus point."We're obviously a bit disappointed with the second half. We talked at half-time about not letting go and being ruthless, but we did switch off a bit after the break."But, credit to Glasgow, they can play some great rugby. We can't forget that they have 80% of the Scotland team."</body>

      <body>John Paul, Callum Skinner and Bruce Croall saw the City of Edinburgh Racing Club to victory over Glasgow Life in the team sprint final at the Scottish Cycling National Track Championships.Edinburgh RC's Alison Chisholm and Eleanor Richardson won the women's team sprint in the third day of action at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome in Glasgow.They edged out double Scottish champion Emma Baird and Jennifer Davis.Baird had won the women's sprint and keirin earlier in the weekend.On Friday evening, she had proved faster than Richardson and Louise Haston in the sprint and in a thrilling keirin final on Saturday night she produced a burst of energy to nip ahead of City of Edinburgh team-mates Davis and Haston, who won silver and bronze respectively.Chisholm, the 40-year-old World Masters 500m time trial champion, led out Richardson in Sunday's team sprint final victory against Baird and Davis with a time of 35.84 seconds.The bronze medal went to Lulu Bartlett and Rebecca Dornan of The Racers.For former runner Richardson, 27, it was a second gold medal. On Saturday she beat Baird to the Scottish 500m time trial title in 36.55, despite Baird posting a personal best of 36.68. Chisholm took the bronze.Paul and Skinner had dominated the men's sprint races on Friday and Saturday and with Croall on Sunday they proved too strong for their west coast rivals, Glasgow Life Track Cycling Team's Kenny Ayre, Jonathan Biggin and Delhi Commonwealth Games athlete Chris Pritchard.Skinner became Scottish men's keirin champion on the first day of the championships, beating Paul in a very close final, with Angus Gillies of TheBicycleWorks.com team taking third place.It was satisfying for Manchester-based Skinner as he had been unable to compete in the keirin final last year, crashing a few hours before the event and breaking his collarbone.On day two of this year's championships, in the best-of-three sprint final, 20-year-old Paul won the first two exchanges with Skinner to retain his Scottish title, with Croall winning the bronze medal.A fourth and final day of the championships takes place on Sunday 27 October, where the endurance riders take to the track to compete in the kilo, 2km pursuit, 3k pursuit and 4k pursuit.</body>

      <body>As the Queen's Baton Relay leaves the Indian city which staged the last Commonwealth Games, I have returned to Delhi to assess what sporting legacy has been left.Think of sport in this country and there is only one discipline which usually springs to mind.Cricket is not the national sport, that's hockey, but it is the national obsession.The India players are paid vast amounts and there is significant money for development within the sport.Like any discipline, the elite athletes are cultivated at the grass roots and in a small park in a residential part of Delhi, I observe four groups of friends playing matches.This is not an unusual sight and although it is just a knockabout it is taken seriously.While less than 1% of the population participates in sport, some disciplines have seen an increase since the 2010 games.Seeing people running was a rarity 10 years ago but in the big parks it is now more common.Ravinder Singh, founder of the Run With Me Foundation, told me: "People used to see someone running and say 'he is a crazy guy who is running, what is he going to get from running?'."Now people are supporting us with hydration energy drinks, bananas and apples when we are running in the streets."I was associated with so many numbers of running groups in Delhi and around and I have seen the passion of running in the participants and running groups and it is growing leaps and bounds."Academics say sport has been prioritised by local and national governments in India over recent decades.The University of Delhi now has an Institute of Physical Educational and Sports Science, the only one in the country.It received grants directly attributed to the Commonwealth Games.Dr Devinder Kumar Kansal, head of the institute, said: "There was less awareness and there was very meagre participation and now the people are considering that sports should be for all, maybe for competition, maybe for lifestyle. So all these things have been boosted."This institute also got enough grants for developing its sports science labs, for its gymnasium."Physiotherapy and all other things have been boosted after the Commonwealth Games."Of course the embarrassment factor brought about by problems preceding the games will not go away and some of those continue with its legacy.The large velodrome was specially constructed for hosting cycling and it has been left unused.Padlocks sit around the gates, there are peeling signs bearing the games logo and a washing line hangs between the trees containing the clothes of, presumably, the security guards.Cycling as a sport is not popular and nobody has thought to convert it for another use.The business community does its bit for participation in the city and elsewhere.Sanjiv Paul, managing director of Tata Metaliks and chairman of the sports committee for the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce (Ficci), explained: "Because of the mining industry, because of the steel plant, it does create disruption in the society it exists in."Sports, as part of the social responsibility programme of Tata Steel, was a way of getting accepted into society, it was a way of breaking into the hearts of people."Ficci, through its various industries that are part of this chamber, promotes that even in the rural areas."I know for sure that Tata Steel does it in more than 600-odd villages, they have programmes running on sports."So there is a lot of grassroots activity going on in the country, post the Commonwealth Games and in fact before that as well."Although participation in sport here remains small, most agree that progress is being made and that Delhi 2010 was the catalyst.</body>

      <title>Bathgate no more, Linwood no more</title>
      <description>The towns named in a political anthem to the 1980s</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-24509655</url>

      <body>"Bathgate no more. Linwood no more. Methil no more. Irvine no more..."The lyrics from The Proclaimers first hit song, quarter of a century ago, continue as an anthem to the 1980s.As the duo brought a two-year touring schedule to a close at Glasgow's new Hydro arena on Saturday night, they still resonate as part of Scotland's story about its modern self.They drew a parallel with the poetry and paintings of the 18th and 19th Highland Clearances. To the theme of "Lochaber no more", the Proclaimers added Skye, Sutherland and Lewis.So I've been on a journey across central Scotland and through the past quarter century to find out what happened next for the towns that were supposed to be "...no more".There are some who never recovered from the blight of unemployment in that decade. A generation was scarred by losing jobs, without skills to take on the new opportunities. There's evidence that the next generation who left school into the teeth of the Eighties recession continue to suffer some consequences still.But the main theme I've found is what is quite a positive story about resilience and flexibility.Scots are more skilled, and perhaps more resourceful. Having given up on supporting old industries, government has made a difference through building infrastructure for new ones. People have become much more mobile around the country.Whereas the Proclaimers were singing in 'Letter from America' about emigration and "all the blood that flowed away", the past 15 years have seen that flow reversed, with the arrival of immigrants, particularly from Poland and the Baltic states.As I heard from the duo, Charlie and Craig Reid, the song didn't say it was bad or good, but that it happens. "It was unthinkable there would be an influx of eastern Europeans before the Iron Curtain came down. That has changed Scotland for the good".The economy has continued to bring major plant closures, though on a lesser scale to the giant ones of the 1980s. Thirteen years ago, it included Motorola at Easter Inch, near Bathgate. More recently, it has been at the Hall's of Broxburn meat processing plant, ten miles from Bathgate.It's notable that the impact on single communities has been less clear and less harsh for the communities around them than when coal mines and the previous generation of industries closed. Workers have been more dispersed, and a combination of improved transport options and more flexible skills have taken them to jobs in other places and in other sectors.Charlie and Craig Reid, while giving up some rehearsal time ahead of their Glasgow gig, told me Letter from America now seems dated. They weren't to know that net emigration would be reversed, before the Iron Curtain came down.They know it speaks to a particular generation, and that it plays best when they are performing in Britain, Ireland and Canada. But Charlie Reid also reflects that his children's generation are in a weaker bargaining position with employers, backed by multi-national clout, than used to be the case, as they're "ground down" on pay and conditions, and struggle to turn part-time opportunities into full-time employment.The writers of the lyrics say the towns could as easily have been Kilmarnock, Cowdenbeath and Cumnock, but the ones they chose worked with the song. So that's where I went for my journey across Scotland, and across the past quarter century.The Leyland plant built trucks and tractors until work started to be moved elsewhere from 1982, and it finally closed in 1986. There was a work-in during that time, with a parallel dispute with the nearby Plessey workers, making telephone components.Jim Swan was convener of Leyland's joint shop stewards, and recalls: "It was difficult times; the pit closing, Plessey and us closing at the same time. It was devastating and the unemployment rate went up to 25 per cent in some areas."I always remember Gavin McCone, the civil servant, saying to me at that time: 'Mr Swan, I can't save your workers, but what I can do is set up an infrastructure which will try to get more inward investment and work which will probably employ your sons and daughters.' And that's what happened, but it took about 15 years to balance the economy out again."During that time, Silicon Glen brought thousands of electronics jobs to West Lothian, but many left again. This time, though, the big closures, such as Motorola at Easter Inch, had workforces which were dispersed, so the impact was not so severe on any one town.West Lothian now has the fastest population growth of any council area in Scotland, which explains why the old Leyland plant has a housing estate on it, where many commute to work at some distance. It's become part of greater Edinburgh.Harry Cartmill, representing Bathgate for Labour on the council, says the opening of the rail line to the capital in the same year that Leyland closed was the biggest single element of turning around the town. Only two years ago, the line west to Airdrie and on to Glasgow re-opened as well, making it more of a dormitory town for both cities.Where once they built Hillman cars at the Renfrewshire site, they now sell them. A lot of them. John McGuire, managing director of Phoenix Car Company, says there are 18 dealerships alongside an Asda superstore, restaurants and leisure.His father worked at Linwood, and when it closed, his first year of unemployment saw him age by more than 10 years "going from a relatively young man to a relatively old man""When I was wanting to start my own business, and we had an opportunity to buy land here, I wasn't sure if this was where I wanted to come, because of the damage done to the local community. But I'm very glad that I did."He reckons that there are now nearly 4000 jobs in the area, which is getting close to the number of jobs lost when the car plant closed."I wanted to employ people, because I saw the dignity that gave to people and I wanted to have my own business so that I'd be in control of my destiny and also that I'd look after a team of people and make sure they didn't have to go through what we saw happening in the Eighties in this country."The nearby village of Linwood hasn't fared so well. It won the unwanted Carbuncle Award for poor design, which provoked some in the community to treat it not as an insult but a challenge to improve. The Community Development Trust is keen to see change in the area done with people in the area, rather than to them.There's lots more to Methil, but it's been a rocky time. The Fife town's fabrication yard, under various ownership, was still building big oil platforms for the North Sea oil in the 1980s, but decline and closure was on the way. The fabrication was shut for seven years, until BiFab expanded from Burntisland, along the Fife coast.The company now has 800 people on site, and 1,100 if you include Burntisland and Arnish near Stornoway. It's hiring apprentices, but for welding skills, it had to go to Poland.It's working to capacity, much of that on a platform for Premier Oil's Solan field west of Shetland, scheduled for float-out next April. That will go in 140 metres of water, and while it will have 35 berths for offshore workers, the intention is to remove it after a year, and to operate it remotely.The big prospect, though, is in renewable energy. Samsung is constructing a huge, 7 megawatt wind turbine, just off the Methil quayside, and Scottish Enterprise, which owns the land, has a site cleared for the Korean giant to build turbines there - so long as the market conditions become clearer.BiFab's managing director John Robertson says the yard has built 42 jackets for offshore wind turbines. It has plans to invest in new production capacity up to 150 per year, if demand comes through.And as he said, there's a lot of uncertainty in the wind, while the industry awaits the guaranteed minimum prices that will underpin it in the UK government's Electricity Market Reforms, and a decision on how long that regime will last.He also said the uncertainty extended to the outcome of next year's independence referendum - a 'hurdle' that he wants to get over, so that the investment outlook becomes clearer.There was no signature plant or plant closure that defined Irvine's. And it's less clear that the town has found a way back from the hard times of the 1980s. The Irvine Bay regeneration plan aims to improve the new town and others nearby in North Ayrshire.The problem a quarter century ago was as much about young people leaving as businesses doing so. One of those to do so was Nicola Sturgeon, who grew up in Dreghorn, the village that became part of Irvine.She recalls a social life built around the path-breaking Magnum Centre and a political awareness that took her, as a teenager, into the Scottish National Party.She recalls the threat and reality of unemployment at that time feeling like it was "terminal" - there seemed no way back. And for her, there was only one thing she planned to do when she left school, which was studying law at Glasgow University.There is now more flexibility about people returning to work after redundancy. And what of her nephew who is around the age of the Deputy First Minister when she first heard the Proclaimers' Letter from America, and he's soon to leave school in Irvine?His interest in science may be well suited to the science opportunities in North Ayrshire's pharmaceutical industry.And while she thinks young people should have the opportunity to spread their wings and leave, she believes the important thing is to ensure they can come back to those opportunities.</body>

      <title>Italy steps up migrant boat patrols</title>
      <description>Italy says it is stepping up sea and air patrols in the southern Mediterranean following the deaths of hundreds of migrants sailing from North Africa.</description>

      <body>Italy is stepping up sea and air patrols following the deaths of hundreds of migrants sailing in overcrowded boats from North Africa.Prime Minister Enrico Letta said an "air and naval package" would start on Monday south of Sicily.On Friday at least 33 people died when their boat capsized between Malta and the Italian island of Lampedusa.A week earlier, more than 350 migrants died in another shipwreck off Lampedusa.Italy has previously called for EU help in dealing with the thousands of desperate migrants who wash up on its beaches every year. Many are families fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East who hope for a better life in Europe.But the recent loss of life has led to further calls for EU action.Italian Defence Minister Mario Mauro said the country intended to triple its presence in the southern Mediterranean.It had become necessary "in part by the fact that Libya is currently a 'non-state'," he told Italian newspaper Avvenire."We need strong action to stop these shipwrecks," he added.Italian media reported that unmanned drone aircraft based in Sicily could also be used to identify boats in trouble.Foreign Minister Emma Bonino said the patrols would be to rescue migrants rather than "telling them to stay where they are".In addition to coastguard and border police vessels, the Italian navy currently has three ships supported by four helicopters patrolling the area. It can also call on two surveillance aircraft with night-vision capabilities.A spokesman for the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, in Lampedusa told the BBC that Italy is also planning to increase its capacity for receiving migrants from 8,000 to 16,000."[Migrants] should be transferred to the mainland, to the proper reception system. It's a huge effort [Italy] is making... the reception capability will be raised starting from next January," Maurizio Molina said.Migrants who survived Friday's capsize say they were were shot at as they left Libya.One survivor told the BBC that some on board were shot and that bullet holes caused the boat to start sinking.Some have suggested that the Libyan coast guard had fired at the boat, though other accounts suggested that rival trafficking gangs or Libyan militiamen may have been to blame.Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat visited Libya on Sunday where he discussed the issue of migrant boats with his Libyan counterpart Ali Zeidan."We are determined to deal with the problem," Mr Zeidan said."Several measures have been taken in terms of equipment and the addition of maritime police to increase the monitoring of our shores," he added."But, as you know, human traffickers have gained considerable expertise on this matter and despite tightening measures sometimes it is out of the hands of the authorities."Armed militias still hold some power in parts of Libya since they helped topple Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Mr Zeidan was himself seized by militiamen last Thursday and held for several hours before being released.Mr Muscat has called on EU states to act over the migrant boats, saying that a "cemetery" was being created in the Mediterranean.According to the UN, some 32,000 migrants have arrived in Malta and Italy this year.</body>

      <title>Arms team in Syria short-truce plea</title>
      <description>The head of the body tasked with destroying Syria's chemical arsenal tells the BBC fighting is hampering access to sites and calls for truces.</description>

      <body>The head of the body tasked with destroying Syria's chemical weapons says fighting is preventing access to some sites through rebel-held areas.Ahmet Uzumcu, of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, called for local, short-term ceasefires to allow experts to work.He told the BBC he hoped the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to the group last week, would help their work in Syria.Syria officially joins the Chemical Weapons Convention on Monday.The OPCW and the UN have had a team of 60 experts and support staff in Syria since 1 October. They are based in Damascus and have been carrying regular visits to facilities.In his first interview since the OPCW won the prize, Mr Uzumcu told the BBC's Today programme that Syrian officials had been co-operating and facilitating the experts' work.He said they had been taken wherever they wanted to go, and that they had already reached five out of at least 20 facilities capable of producing chemical weapons.However, Mr Uzumcu said, routes to some of the sites went through opposition-held territory and this prevented access."They change hands from one day to another, which is why we appeal to all sides in Syria to support this mission, to be co-operative and not render this mission more difficult. It's already challenging," he said.He said he had called for truces because "in the previous, UN-led mission to investigate allegations of use [of chemical weapons] there were temporary ceasefires of four or five hours which helped this mission".He added that one abandoned site was located in a rebel-held area, and that his team was hoping to access it.It is the first time the OPCW has worked in a war zone since it was set up in 1997.Mr Uzumcu also said that on Saturday mortar shells had fallen "next to the hotel where our team is staying and there are exchanges of fire not far from where they go".Details of the visits have not been released. Syria is believed to possess mustard gas, as well as the sarin and VX nerve agents.Meanwhile, US Secretary of State John Kerry has said a peace conference should be held in Geneva as soon as possible to set up an interim government."There has to be a transition government in Syria to permit the possibility of peace," he said.The dominant group in the main opposition alliance, the Syrian National Council, has said it will not take part in the proposed peace negotiations - known as Geneva II.In Syria itself violence is continuing. On Monday a car bomb killed at least 12 people in the north-western rebel-held town of Darkoush in Idlib province, activists say.The attack came a day after seven workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross were abducted near Saraqeb, a town also located in Idlib province, near the Turkish border.Syrian state TV blamed rebels for the abduction, which correspondents say highlights the threats faced by those working in Syria.In his interview with the BBC, Mr Uzumcu said the Nobel prize had been "very big boost" to the morale of his teams. "They are working in very challenging circumstances in the field," he said.The OPCW, based in The Hague, was established to enforce the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. Its main role to monitor and destroy chemical weapons.The disarmament deal on Syria's chemical weapons was sparked by a poison-gas attack in Damascus on 21 August in which hundreds were killed. Western nations blamed the forces of President Bashar al-Assad, but he blamed rebel fighters.Syria later agreed to join the global Chemical Weapons Convention, and the UN said it would bound by the treaty from 14 October.Under a UN resolution, Syria's chemical weapons production equipment must be destroyed by 1 November and stockpiles must be disposed of by mid-2014.</body>

      <title>Malaysia court rules on 'Allah' use</title>
      <description>A Malaysian court has ruled that non-Muslims cannot refer to God as Allah, reversing a 2009 lower court ruling that sparked religious tensions.</description>

      <body>A Malaysian court has ruled that non-Muslims cannot use the word Allah to refer to God, even in their own faiths, overturning a 2009 lower court ruling.The appeals court said the term Allah must be exclusive to Islam or it could cause public disorder.People of all faiths use the word Allah in Malay to refer to their Gods.Christians argue they have used the word, which entered Malay from Arabic, to refer to their God for centuries and that the ruling violates their rights.One Malaysian Christian woman said the ruling would affect the community greatly."If we are prohibited from using the word Allah then we have to re-translate the whole Bible, if it comes to that," Ester Moiji from Sabah state told the BBC.The 2009 ruling sparked tensions, with churches and mosques attacked.It came after the government said that a Catholic newspaper, The Herald, could not use the word in its Malay-language edition to describe the Christian God.The newspaper sued, and a court ruled in their favour in December 2009. The government then launched an appeal.Upholding the appeal on Monday, chief judge Mohamed Apandi Ali said: "The usage of the word Allah is not an integral part of the faith in Christianity. The usage of the word will cause confusion in the community."The Herald editor Reverend Lawrence Andrew said he was "disappointed and dismayed", and would appeal against the decision."It is a retrograde step in the development of law in relation to the fundamental liberty of religious minorities," he said.The newspaper's supporters have argued that Malay-language Bibles have used Allah to refer to the Christian God since before Malaysia was formed as a federal state in 1963."Allah is a term in the Middle East and in Indonesia it is a term both for Christians and Muslims. You cannot say that in all of the sudden it is not an integral part. Malay language is a language that has many borrowed words, Allah also is a borrowed word."However, some Muslim groups have said that the Christian use of the word Allah could be used to encourage Muslims to convert to Christianity."Allah is not a Malay word. If they [non-Muslims] say they want to use a Malay word they should use Tuhan instead of Allah," Zainul Rijal Abu Bakar, a lawyer representing the government, told the BBC.Dozens of churches and a few Muslim prayer halls were attacked and burned in the wake of the 2009 ruling, highlighting the intensity of feeling about issues of ethnicity and faith in Malaysia.Some Malaysians believe the governing Malay-Muslim party is using the case to boost its Islamic credentials among voters, the BBC's Jennifer Pak reports from outside the court in Putrajaya.Malay Muslims make up almost two-thirds of the country's population, but there are large Hindu and Christian communities.Prime Minister Najib Razak's coalition won elections in May, but it was the coalition's worst result in more than half a century in power.</body>

      <body>The death toll from a stampede at a Hindu festival in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh has risen to 115, local officials have said.Many were crushed after panic broke out on a bridge near the Ratangarh temple. Others drowned when they jumped from the bridge into river waters below.Officials said the stampede may have been sparked by a rumour that the bridge had been about to collapse.Hundreds of thousands had gathered for the festival of Navratra (nine nights).Funeral pyres burned throughout the night, with many of the victims already cremated by Monday morning."The death toll has now gone up to 115 and more than 110 injured," news agency AFP quoted senior police official DK Arya in Datia district as saying on Monday."Ten of those [injured] are in a very critical state," he added.Earlier, officials said they had recovered bodies of people who had been crushed to death from the river.Meanwhile, relatives gathered outside hospitals to take away the bodies of the dead after post mortems had been carried out.Many were still searching for loved ones among the dead and the injured.The BBC's Zubair Ahmed in Datia said thousands of devotees were still thronging the temple on Monday.Many took a bath in the Sindh river before going into the temple to offer prayers.The accident happened at about 09:00 (03:30 GMT) on Sunday. The victims were mostly women and children, officials said.The narrow bridge is about 500m long and had only recently been rebuilt following another stampede in 2006 in which more than 50 people had died.Local official Sanket Bhondve said the immediate priority was to provide relief to the injured.Stampedes occur relatively frequently at religious festivals in India, which attract large crowds.In the past year, dozens have died in similar tragedies.In 2011 more than 100 died at a festival in the southern state of Kerala.Inside Jodhpur's Mehrangarh Fort, more than 220 people were killed in 2008 in a stampede at the Chamunda Devi Hindu temple.</body>

      <title>German 'luxury bishop' in Pope plea</title>
      <description>A German Roman Catholic bishop accused of lavish spending flies to Rome for talks at the Vatican about whether he can stay in office.</description>

      <body>A German bishop has flown - reportedly with a budget airline - to the Vatican in Rome to discuss his lavish spending.Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst - dubbed the "Luxury Bishop" - is facing calls for his resignation after spending 31m euros (£26m; $42m) on his residence.He is also accused of lying about the over-spend on the property in Limburg.In Rome, he will meet the head of the Catholic Church in Germany, Archbishop Robert Zollitsch. It is not clear if Pope Francis will intervene.Since taking office in March, Pope Francis has urged the Church to promote a lifestyle of frugality and simplicity.The allegations have stoked controversy among Catholics in Germany, where Martin Luther launched the Reformation in Europe five centuries ago in response to what he said were excesses and abuses within the Church.German Catholics also pay a compulsory tax to the Church as part of their income tax, and many are shocked by the apparent financial waste - prompting some to stage demonstrations outside the bishop's residence in Limburg, a town in Hesse near Frankfurt-on-Main."The bishop has made it clear that any decision about his service as a bishop lies in the hands of the Holy Father (Pope Francis)," said a statement issued by the diocese on Saturday."The bishop is saddened by the escalation of the current discussion. He sees and regrets that many believers are suffering under the current situation," it said.Bishop Tebartz-van Elst is also accused of twice lying under oath about a flight he took to India on a trip to visit poor children.The 53-year-old had filed a civil court claim against Der Spiegel magazine, which is based in Hamburg, for reporting that he had flown first-class on the trip.After being forced to print a retraction, the magazine filed a legal complaint of its own. As evidence, it published mobile phone video (in German) of its interview with Bishop Tebartz-van Elst, in which he clearly stated that he had flown business class.Asked by the German daily Bild about the high cost of his new residence, the bishop said: "I understand that the high cost of 31m euros sounds frightening. Those who know me know that I don't have a pompous lifestyle."Archbishop Zollitsch said he had set up a commission to investigate the finances of Limburg diocese.He said he would "speak to the Holy Father and the relevant people" about the issue in Rome.</body>

      <body>Police in Russia have arrested more than 1,200 people in a raid targeting migrants after major riots in Moscow.The "preventative raid" targeted workers at a vegetable warehouse, which was attacked by demonstrators on Sunday, Russian news agencies reported.Angry protesters overran the market searching for migrant workers.The rioting began during a protest over the death of an ethnic Russian man on Thursday allegedly by a Muslim migrant from the North Caucasus.Ethnic Russian Yegor Shcherbakov, 25, was killed in front of his girlfriend in the capital's Biryulyovo district.Police have released a security camera photo of the suspect, but have not identified him.Media said the image suggested the man was of "non-Slavic appearance", leading nationalists to conclude the killer was a Muslim migrant from the Russian North Caucasus.Some 380 people were detained during the rioting that began on Sunday, but most have been released without charge.It is unclear what charges, if any, those detained in Monday's raid against migrants in the vegetable warehouse would face, RIA Novosti reported. Police were quoted as saying that they were investigating "involvement in criminal activity", without elaborating.The issue of immigration and internal migration was one of the main issues in Moscow's recent mayoral election won by Sergei Sobyanin.The BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Moscow says the violence reflects Russian nationalism, and the growing tension between ethnic Russians and migrants from the Caucasus region and from former Soviet republics.</body>

      <title>Taylor challenges UK jail sentence</title>
      <description>Liberian ex-President Charles Taylor asks to serve his 50-year war crimes sentence in Rwanda, rather than the UK, where he is due to be transferred.</description>

      <body>Ex-Liberian President Charles Taylor has asked to serve his 50-year sentence for war crimes in Rwanda, rather than the UK.In a letter sent to the court that convicted him, he says it would be easier - and less expensive - for his family to visit him in Africa.He also said he feared being attacked in a British prison.Taylor was convicted of aiding rebels who committed atrocities in Sierra Leone during its civil war.Last week, a UK minister confirmed that Taylor would be transferred to a British prison.He was convicted by the UN-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL), but his trial was held in The Hague in case it sparked renewed unrest in West Africa.The Netherlands only agreed to host the trial if he was imprisoned elsewhere.In a letter seen by the BBC, Taylor wrote:"My position is that serving my sentence in Rwanda, in my home continent of Africa, would be substantially more humane not only on my own account, but also on account of the impact on my family."He noted that the court's statutes said access for prisoners' relatives should be taken into account when deciding where they should serve their sentence.He said that it would be cheaper and easier to travel to Rwanda - and that Liberian nationals could obtain visas at the airport, unlike in the UK.Taylor, 65, was convicted on 11 crimes including terrorism, rape, murder and the use of child soldiers by rebel groups in neighbouring Sierra Leone during the 1991-2002 conflict, in which some 50,000 people died.He was found to have supplied weapons to the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels in exchange for so-called blood diamonds.The rebels were notorious for hacking off the limbs of civilians to terrorise the population.Taylor has always insisted he is innocent and his only contact with the rebels was to urge them to stop fighting.He is the first former head of state convicted by an international war crimes court since World War II.In his three-page letter, dated 10 October, Taylor continued: "My name is now associated with horrendous atrocities. Prison inmates, whether from the region or not, are likely to be inclined to inflict their own brand of justice by attacking me."He pointed out that "a significant number of individuals from Sierra Leonean background are in detention in prisons in the UK" and noted that in 2011, Bosnian war criminal Radislav Krstic was attacked in a British jail by three Muslim men, apparently in revenge for his role in the Bosnian conflict.Taylor argued that the UK authorities "may also simply be unaware of the groups that might be particularly motivated to attack me in prison"."In short, incarceration in the United Kingdom will likely - and very soon - lead to me being seriously injured or killed."Some other people convicted by the SCSL are already serving their sentences in Rwanda.Last week, UK Justice Minister Jeremy Wright noted that the British offer to host Taylor had enabled his trial to proceed in The Hague.He told parliament: "The conviction of Charles Taylor is a landmark moment for international justice.""It clearly demonstrates that those who commit atrocities will be held to account and that no matter their position they will not enjoy impunity."Taylor's appeal against his conviction was rejected last month and he remains in The Hague, awaiting transfer.</body>

      <title>Warming makes El Nino 'more intense'</title>
      <description>New research says that the El Nino weather phenomenon will be more intense as a result of rising temperatures.</description>

      <body>Scientists say they are more certain than ever about the impact of global warming on a critical weather pattern.The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) occurs in the Pacific Ocean but plays an important part in the world's climate system.Researchers have until now been unsure as to how rising temperatures would affect ENSO in the future.But this new study suggests that droughts and floods driven by ENSO will be more intense.The ENSO phenomenon plays a complicated role in the global weather system.The El Nino part of the equation sees a warming of the eastern and tropical Pacific, while its cooler sister, La Nina, makes things chillier in these same regions.Like water in a bathtub, the warmer or cooler waters slosh back and forth across the Pacific Ocean. They are responsible for rainfall patterns across Australia and the equatorial region, but their effects are also felt much further away.During the Northern Hemisphere winter, for example, you can get more intense rainfall over the southern part of the US in a warmer El Nino phase.For years, scientists have been concerned about how this sensitive weather system might be changed by rising temperatures from global warming.Now, in this new paper, published in the journal Nature, researchers give their most "robust" projections yet.Using the latest generation of climate models, they found a consistent projection for the future of ENSO.According to the lead author, Dr Scott Power from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, global warming interferes with the way El Nino temperature patterns affect rainfall."This interference causes an intensification of El Nino-driven drying in the western Pacific and rainfall increases in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific," he said.According to Dr Wenju Cai, a scientist at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), who was not involved with the study, the paper is "significant"."Up until now, there has been a lack of agreement among computer models as to how ENSO will change in the future," he explained."This paper is significant in that there is stronger agreement among different climate models in predicting the future impact."This study finds that both wet and dry anomalies will be greater in future El Nino years. This means that ENSO-induced droughts and floods will be more intense in the future."Follow Matt on Twitter.</body>

      <title>Iran rejects shipping out uranium</title>
      <description>Iran will not allow any of its enriched uranium to be shipped abroad, the deputy foreign minister says, rejecting a key demand of Western powers.</description>

      <body>Iran will not allow any of its enriched uranium to be shipped abroad, the deputy foreign minister says, rejecting a key demand of Western powers.Abbas Araqchi was quoted by state media as saying that "shipping the material abroad is our red line".The comments come ahead of key talks this week in Geneva between Iran and international negotiators over the nuclear dispute.The talks will be the first since President Hassan Rouhani took office.US Secretary of State John Kerry said on Sunday that the window for diplomacy was "cracking open"."But I want you to know that our eyes are open, too," he added, addressing a summit of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee by video link from London. "Words must be matched with actions."Western negotiators have demanded Iran halt production and stockpiling of uranium enriched to 20% - a step away from achieving a nuclear weapons capability - and send some of its stockpiles abroad.They have also demanded Iran shut down the Fordo production site near Qom, where most of the higher-grade enrichment work is done.But Mr Araqchi insisted on Sunday that there could be no question of Iran relinquishing its stockpiles of enriched uranium."We will not surrender or suspend uranium enrichment in any situation...We will not allow even a gram of uranium to go out of the country," he said, quoted on the website of Iranian state TV.He did, however, say Tehran would negotiate the form, amount and levels of uranium enrichment.His comments seemed to contradict those of Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani, who was reported last week as telling several Western news agencies that the country had a surplus of enriched uranium and might use this as a bargaining tool at nuclear talks.However, Iran's Parliament later denied the claims, saying parts of Mr Larijani's interview with Associated Press were "false and fundamentally inaccurate".The West suspects Iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons but Iran maintains its programme is entirely peaceful.Iran, which has been negotiating with the P5+1 group ( the UK, China, France, Russia and the US plus Germany) over the nuclear issue since 2006, wants the lifting of UN sanctions.The sanctions were imposed over concerns that it is seeking to build nuclear weapons clandestinely - an allegation Tehran denies.President Rouhani, who is seen as a moderate, has said he wants to reach a deal on the nuclear dispute in three to six months and has vowed to send a plan to the two-day talks due to begin on 15 October.The US has said there will be no major concessions on sanctions until the Iranians take concrete steps to reassure the world they are not seeking nuclear weapons.</body>

      <title>IMF chief warns of recession risk</title>
      <description>The head of the International Monetary Fund warns a US default could spark a global recession, as the deadlock in Congress continues.</description>

      <body>The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, has warned that a US default could tip the world into recession.In a US TV interview she said a default would result in "massive disruption the world over".The US Treasury will start to run short of funds on Thursday if no agreement is reached for it to raise its debt limit.Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate held direct talks for the first time in weeks on Saturday.But there is little sign of any breakthrough, correspondents say.In an interview with ABC's Meet the Press Christine Lagarde said America must now raise the debt ceiling before Thursday's deadline."If there is that degree of disruption, that lack of certainty, that lack of trust in the US signature, it would mean massive disruption the world over and we would be at risk of tipping yet again into recession," she said.The president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, has also expressed his concern over the situation.He warned that the United States is just "days away from a very dangerous moment" because of the government's borrowing crisis.Mr Kim urged US policymakers to reach a deal to raise the government's debt ceiling before Thursday's deadline.He warned this could be a "disastrous event" for the world."The closer we get to the deadline the greater the impact will be for the developing world."Inaction could result in interest rates rising, confidence falling and growth slowing," said Mr Kim, speaking at the World Bank's annual meeting in Washington."If this comes to pass it could be a disastrous event for the developing world and that will in turn greatly hurt the developed economies as well," he added.If the US does run short of cash, this could cause it to default on its debts, a development which would be likely to have a severe effect on financial markets around the world.The BBC's Andrew Walker said that finance ministers from other countries think the US probably won't default, but they are uneasy and want the crisis resolved very soon.Republicans and Democrats failed to come to an agreement on Saturday, but Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat, said the aim was to reach a deal on extending the debt limit before markets reopen on Monday.The White House rejected a deal for a short-term increase to the borrowing limit."It wouldn't be wise, as some suggest, to just kick the debt ceiling can down the road for a couple of months, and flirt with a first-ever intentional default right in the middle of the holiday shopping season," said President Barack Obama.The US government has been in partial shutdown since Congress missed a 1 October deadline to pass a budget, with politicians being unable to agree funding for current spending.This has resulted in hundreds of thousands of federal employees being sent home and government offices closing.Republicans refused to approve the new budget unless President Obama agreed to delay or eliminate the funding of the healthcare reform law of 2010.US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has estimated that each week the government is shut down, 0.25% is shaved off economic growth, which was already expected to be a sluggish this quarter.Mr Lew has also has warned that letting talks over the debt ceiling go down to the wire "could be very dangerous".The current debt limit of $16.699 trillion was reached in May.Since then the US Treasury has been using what are called extraordinary measures to keep paying the bills, but those measures run out on 17 October.Every week, the Treasury also has to refinance $100bn worth of debt in the form of US government bonds known as treasuries.The US also has to pay interest on its huge debt burden.An inability to pay that interest, or pay back debt if required, would put the US into default.On Saturday, Jamie Dimon, boss of the American bank JP Morgan said the possible repercussions did not bear thinking about."You don't want to know [what would happen]," he said."It would ripple through the world economy in a way that you couldn't possibly understand."</body>

      <body>A government proposal to bar HIV patients from using public bathhouses has been condemned in China as discriminatory.The proposal orders public bathhouses to display signs prohibiting "people with sexually transmitted diseases, Aids and infectious skin diseases".It has been posted online for public consultation by China's State Council.But Aids activists and ordinary users of Weibo, China's version of Twitter have strongly criticised the move."There is no evidence that people can be infected with HIV in public bathhouses," Wu Hao, from the Beijing Research Centre on Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Aids, was quoted as saying by the Beijing Morning News."Apparently, the rule to bar HIV patients from entering public bathhouses is way over the top," he said.The paper also quoted an unnamed Aids activist as saying he was extremely disappointed with the draft proposal."Banning HIV patients from using public bathhouses and spas will only exacerbate people's misunderstanding, discrimination and fear of HIV/Aids, and will not help reduce the transmission of the disease," he said.The proposal has also been condemned by the United Nations' Aids agency.Hedia Belhadj, China country coordinator for UNAIDS, said it was concerned by the provision and called for it to be removed, the AFP news agency reports.She said that there was no risk of transmission of HIV in a spa or bathhouse setting."UNAIDS recommends that restrictions preventing people living with HIV from accessing bath houses, spas and other similar facilities be removed from the final draft of this policy," Ms Belhadj told AFP.The proposal has also drawn strong criticism from China's Weibo users.One user said that the decision to ban HIV patients using public bathhouses must be based on scientific facts about the ways HIV was transmitted."In reality, many public bathhouses have already implemented the ban. The practice is discriminatory and must be stopped, and must not be institutionalised."HIV patients are already very vulnerable. They should be protected and respected. We must not further harm them with discrimination," the user said .But there are also Weibo users who agree with the ban.One Weibo user said that HIV patients should be advised not to use public bathhouses or at least they should check whether they have any open wounds before entering.According to government figures released in 2012, China has 430,000 people infected with HIV.But the United Nations has said that the real figure could be 620,000 to 940,000.Among them, 146,000 to 162,00 have developed full-blown Aids.</body>

      <body>Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's Twitter feed briefly followed a Persian erotica account before unfollowing it on Sunday, The Times of Israel reports.The PM's Twitter account, @Netanyahu, followed some 90 accounts, mainly of Israeli embassies and the government, at the time, the paper said.But one of the most recent it was following was @PersianHotBook, it said.The PM's Likud party later said it managed the page and that it was investigating a "malfunction"."It was a malfunction and the issue will be checked. In any case, the account was removed immediately," Likud is quoted as saying by reporter Chico Menashe from Israel Radio in a tweet.The page @PersianHotBook describes itself as "the first library of hot sex books [in the] Persian language".Early on Sunday, the page only had 15 followers, one of which was the prime minister's account, the newspaper reported.But later the prime minister's Twitter feed no longer followed @PersianHotBook, it said, and had also stopped following other feeds, bringing down to 81 the number of feeds it was following.This gave rise to amused comments on social media sites, with one user interpreting the interest as a desire to want "to see the real Iranian weapon of mass destruction".Last week, in an interview with the BBC Persian service, Mr Netanyahu said that if Iranians were free they would wear blue jeans, and listen to Western music.His comments led to reactions from Iranians in Iran and abroad on social media sites, with many posts showing mainly young Iranians wearing jeans and listening to Western music, some in comic poses.</body>

      <body>Original signed canvasses by British street artist Banksy have been sold from a stall in New York's Central Park for $60 (£38) each.The elusive artist posted a video on his website showing a man selling what appeared to be fake Banksys.Many of the pieces, estimated to be worth up to £20,000 each, remained unsold at the end of the day.Banksy is in New York for a month-long residency during which he has promised a new piece of street art every day.Entitled Better Out Than In, the public art show has its own website on to which pictures and videos of the art works have been posted.The latest video was accompanied with the words, "Yesterday I set up a stall in the park selling 100% authentic original signed Banksy canvases. For $60 each."The video shows an unknown older man making his first sale mid-afternoon, to a woman who buys two small canvasses for her children after negotiating a 50% discount.Another woman from New Zealand is seen buying two of the paintings, before a man from Chicago buys four.He tells the stall holder he has recently moved house and needs something for the walls.The day's takings came to a grand total of $420 (£263).Underneath the video Banksy added: "Please note: This was a one off. The stall will not be there again today."In a recent interview conducted via email with New York publication the Village Voice, the guerilla artist - whose identity is still a secret - revealed the thinking behind his month-long trip to the city."I know street art can feel increasingly like the marketing wing of an art career, so I wanted to make some art without the price tag attached," he said."There is no gallery show or book or film. It's pointless. Which hopefully means something."Each day in October will see a new piece of either an "elaborate graffiti, large scale street sculpture, video installation or substandard performance art".So far they have included The Sirens of the Lambs, a slaughterhouse delivery truck filled with stuffed animal toys which toured the meatpacking district, and more traditional Banksy art such as a heart-shaped balloon covered in bandages on a Brooklyn wall.</body>

      <title>Eating popcorn 'disrupts adverts'</title>
      <description>Cinema advertising is rendered ineffective when audiences chew sweets or popcorn, a study from Cologne University claims.</description>

      <body>Cinema advertising is less effective when audiences eat popcorn, according to a study from Cologne University.Researchers found that viewers remember brands by simulating the pronunciation of a new name with their mouths.But this "inner speech" can be disturbed by chewing, rendering adverts redundant, said the research, published in the Journal of Consumer Psychology.It contrasts with previous studies, which suggested chewing gum could aid memory.There is some evidence that the act of chewing gum improves blood flow to the brain, and can make you more alert over long periods of sustained concentration.However, researchers from Cardiff University reported last year that people's ability to recall lists in a specific order is impaired by chewing gum.To investigate the effects of popcorn on memory, researchers at Cologne University invited 96 people to a cinema to watch a movie, preceded by a sequence of adverts.Half of the group was given popcorn, which was replenished throughout the screening, while the rest received a small sugar cube.They were shown genuine commercials for existing products which were, crucially, unfamiliar to the German participants - for example, for the Scandinavian butter Lurpak.A week later, the participants were invited to a laboratory and asked to rate a series of products, including some of those which had been advertised.The sugar cube group displayed preferences for the advertised products, but the popcorn munchers did not.In a second study, 188 people were shown adverts in similar circumstances, then given money to donate to charity.Again, the sugar cube sample tended to give money to charities that had been advertised in the cinema, but the participants who had been eating during the screening showed no such preference."The mundane activity of eating popcorn made participants immune to the pervasive effects of advertising," said Sascha Topolinski, one of the researchers.The study posits that repetition of brand names is essential in imprinting them in our consciousness"Particularly for novel brands, excessive exposure and repetition is necessary to establish the brand name in the first place," wrote the authors."Remember your initial irritation upon encountering the names Yahoo, Google and Wikipedia for the first time; now they are imprinted in your brain."Mr Topolinski goes so far as to suggest that advertisers may try to boycott popcorn."This finding suggests that selling candy in movie theatres actually undermines advertising effects, which contradicts present marketing strategies."In the future, when promoting a novel brand, advertising clients might consider trying to prevent candy being sold before the main movie."Cinema-owners may not be so keen, though.

      <body>Egypt's public prosecutor has ordered an inquiry into the death of a US citizen found dead in a police cell.He said the man, named as retired US military officer James Henry, was found hanging from a bathroom door by his belt and shoe laces.Mr Henry, 66, was reported to have been heading for the Gaza Strip in August, when he was detained in North Sinai for violating a curfew.A US embassy official in Cairo said the death was "an apparent suicide".According to local reports, the retired army officer's death came a day after the authorities told him they were extending his detention by a further 30 days.Officials told the AFP agency that a US embassy delegation had visited James Henry in his cell in the city of Ismailiya last week.The prosecutor said Mr Henry was arrested on 29 August on the road between El Arish and Rafah in North Sinai, for breaking a dusk-to-dawn curfew.The curfew was put in place across large parts of Egypt under a decree by the interim government, to quell unrest following the ousting in July of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.In a statement, the prosecutor said Mr Henry had been carrying a map of Egypt and an advanced electronic device.US embassy officials in Cairo said they were in contact with the Egyptian authorities and were providing all appropriate consular services.Mr Henry is the second foreign citizen to die in police custody in as many months, reports BBC Cairo correspondent Orla Guerin.A French national was found dead in a Cairo police station in September after allegedly being beaten to death by fellow prisoners following a row.</body>

      <body>The Cuban-American writer Oscar Hijuelos - the first Latino to win the Pulitzer Prize - has died aged 62.Hijuelos's agent, Jennifer Lyons, said he had died of a heart attack in New York City while playing tennis.Hijuelos won the award in 1990 for his second novel, The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love, which was later adapted as a Hollywood film.Like many of his novels, it focused on the lives of immigrants and their quest for the American dream.Hijuelos was born in New York City in 1951 to Cuban immigrant parents.He enrolled in local community colleges before studying creative writing under tutors included Susan Sontag, Donald Barthelme and Frederic Tuten.Hijuelos was also exposed to Cuban and Latin American writers including Jose Lezama Lima, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Carlos Fuentes, whose work inspired him.He published his first novel, Our House in the Last World, in 1983.In his 2011 memoir, Thoughts Without Cigarettes, Hijuelos said he had struggled against being labelled an "ethnic" writer.The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love tells the story of two Cuban brothers who travel from Havana to New York to start an orchestra.In 1992 the book was turned into a film starring Armand Assante and Antonio Banderas.Hijuelos is survived by his wife, Lori Marie Carlson.</body>

      <body>Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has left hospital five days after having surgery to remove a blood clot on her brain.President Fernandez, 60, was in high spirits and had already returned to her official residence, a government spokesman said.She suffered a head injury in August and was told last week to halt her congressional election campaign.Doctors have advised her to have "strict rest" for 30 days.She has also been advised to avoid air travel for the next month."She remains in high spirits. Constantly recovering. She sends her love", presidential spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro said shortly before Ms Fernandez was driven away from Favaloro Foundation hospital in Buenos Aires."Due to the favourable post-operative evolution of the president, it has been decided to discharge her today," the medical report read.It is not clear when the president will reassume her duties.A day after doctors discovered the subdural haematoma, Ms Kirchner complained of loss of sensitivity in her left arm.Her two-hour emergency operation meant she was forced to abandon a campaign before congressional elections on 27 October.Her party is facing the prospect of losing control of Congress.While she was in hospital, dozens of supporters camped outside.Her public duties are being carried out by Vice-President Amado Boudou.President Fernandez was first elected in 2007 and was returned to power by a comfortable majority in 2011.Her health has been followed closely since the sudden death of her husband, former President Nestor Kirchner, from a heart attack in 2010.She has been admitted to hospital on a number of occasions during her presidency. She has low blood pressure and had to have a thyroid gland removed in 2012.</body>

      <body>Rescue workers searching the rubble of a collapsed block of flats in north-west Colombia for at least 11 missing people say they have found one body.The 24-storey tower in the city of Medellin collapsed on Saturday night having been evacuated on Friday after cracks were found in its structure.A team of construction workers and at least one resident were in the block when it came down.Neighbouring towers could be at risk and have been cleared, officials say.The collapse of tower six in The Space condominium happened shortly before 20:30 local time (01:30 GMT) on Saturday, officials say.Residents of the neighbouring building told local media it sounded as if bombs had exploded.Most of the missing are workers who had been sent by construction company CDO Constructora to assess and repair the structural damage.A resident believed to have been in the building's car park when the accident happened was also reported missing.Medellin Mayor Claudia Restrepo said on Sunday that a body had been located on the third floor of the building.The body has not yet been identified or removed, she added.Around 60 people with sniffer dogs have been searching the rubble but heavy rain and fears of another collapse have hampered the rescue effort.Earlier, emergency officials said that one of two people rescued early on Sunday could be paralysed.The Space flats were completed earlier this year and cost between $100,000 (£67,000) and $265,000 (£166,000).The Medellin authorities have launched an inquiry into the cause of the collapse.CDO Constructora said a flaw had been found in a concrete column.</body>

      <body>The African Union summit in Ethiopia has demanded a deferral of The Hague trial of Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, due to start in November.It also agreed a resolution stating no sitting African head of state should appear before an international court.With both Kenyan and Sudanese presidents facing ICC cases, African leaders have long complained that the court unfairly targets them.The AU had discussed withdrawing from the ICC, but failed to get support.Senior figures including Kofi Annan have criticised plans to quit the ICC.The AU leaders, meeting in Addis Ababa, agreed to back immunity for any sitting African head of state.They also asked Kenya to write to the UN Security Council seeking a deferral in the International Criminal Court (ICC) case against Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, who faces charges of crimes against humanity.Both he and his deputy, William Ruto, deny charges of organising violence after the 2007 election.While Mr Ruto went on trial in September, President Kenyatta has repeatedly requested his trial - due next month - be postponed.Addressing the summit, Mr Kenyatta accused the court of bias and "race-hunting", AFP reports."The ICC has been reduced into a painfully farcical pantomime, a travesty that adds insult to the injury of victims. It stopped being the home of justice the day it became the toy of declining imperial powers."Ethiopian Prime Minister and AU chairman Hailemariam Dessalegn said the summit was not a crusade against the ICC but a call for the court to address Africa's concerns seriously.He said the ICC's cases against the Sudanese and Kenyan presidents could hamper peace and reconciliation efforts in their countries."The unfair treatment that we have been subjected to by the ICC is completely unacceptable," he said.The ICC issued a warrant in 2009 for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir over alleged war crimes in the Darfur region, but he has not yet been arrested.The ICC relies on the authorities of national governments to hand over suspects, but Mr Bashir has avoided arrest despite travelling to countries that have signed up to the ICC statute.Ethiopian Foreign Minister Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is the current chairman of the AU's Executive Council, said the ICC had failed to respond to the African Union's previous complaints."What the summit decided is that President Kenyatta should not appear until the request we have made is actually answered," he said.Thirty-four of the AU's 54 members have signed up to the ICC.Kenya's parliament has already passed a motion for the country to withdraw.Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said that withdrawing from the court would be a "badge of shame".Nobel Peace laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu has also voiced his support for the ICC."Those leaders seeking to skirt the court are effectively looking for a license to kill, maim and oppress their own people without consequence," he wrote in an article carried by several newspapers."They simply vilify the institution as racist and unjust, as Hermann Goering and his fellow Nazi defendants vilified the Nuremberg tribunals following World War II."All eight of the cases currently open at the ICC are in Africa but it is also investigating possible cases elsewhere.</body>

      <body>At least 20 bodies have been recovered after a boat carrying hundreds of passengers capsized on the River Niger, Mali, on Friday night, officials say.The vessel broke up near Konna whilst en route north from the town of Mopti to Timbuktu.Over 200 people are known to have survived the accident, but it is not yet clear how many are still missing.Officials said the boat was overloaded with goods and may have carried as many as 400 passengers.The boat broke at the stern on a branch of the river near the village of Koubi, with some 210 survivors, Commander Dramane Diallo of the rescue services told the Agence France-Presse news agency.He said the reason for the boat overturning was unknown but an investigation is under way.Dozens of people are still feared missing, but there are conflicting reports over the exact numbers.Emergency officials, quoted by AFP, said 23 people were still missing.However, the mayor of Koubi, Sory Diakite, told AP that only 210 of the 400 passengers onboard had been accounted for.Eyewitness Ibrahim Yattara, who was asleep with his pregnant wife onboard the boat when it sunk, told Associated Press it collapsed because it was overloaded with cargo."With the excess weight it broke into two pieces. I started to swim and looked for my wife but after a while the boat was completely under water."He says his wife is still missing.Local residents say many of the passengers would have been schoolchildren returning to the north for the start of their new academic year.Officials have warned the death count may rise, as recovery operations continued late into Saturday afternoon.Many Malians opt to travel by water, often in rudimentary canoes, due to poor road conditions in the north and the relatively high cost of overland travel.At over 4,000km (2,500 miles) long, the Niger river connects landlocked Mali's arid north with the more fertile south.</body>

      <body>Hundreds of thousands of people who were evacuated before Cyclone Phailin crashed into eastern India have begun returning to their homes.But many will remain in shelters as their homes and businesses were wrecked by the strongest cyclone in 14 years.As the storm weakened a vast relief operation got under way in Orissa and Andhra Pradesh states, where officials say up to one million were displaced.Mass evacuations managed to keep the death toll to a bare minimum.Officials said 22 people were killed - all but one of the deaths were in Orissa.The cyclone flattened many coastal homes, uprooted trees and blocked roads in the two states but the evacuation effort - described by officials as "the biggest in India's history for such an event" - ensured the death toll remained low.Correspondents say before the cyclone hit, the authorities moved - sometimes forcibly - nearly one million people into temporary shelters set up in schools and government buildings.The move has earned the Indian authorities rare praise for their preparedness.In 1999 a cyclone killed more than 10,000 people in Orissa.Thousands of families have started going back to their homes on Monday morning, the BBC's Sanjoy Majumder reports from Berhampur in Orissa.Many, however, remain in temporary shelters since their villages and homes have been destroyed or inundated, our correspondent adds.The authorities have promised that power and road access would be restored in the state by Monday evening, except in the worst-hit Ganjam district.The massive storm made landfall on Saturday evening, with winds of about 200 km per hour (125mph).It began weakening on Sunday as it made its way north-west.But the intense storm has made more than half-a-million people homeless, state government officials said.The storm tore down power and communication lines and knocked out road and rail links, making an assessment difficult.An estimated 5,000 sq km of mostly paddy crops have been destroyed, causing a loss of some $320m (£220m).Meanwhile, 28 sailors, who went missing after their ship sank in the cyclone, have been rescued from the Bay of Bengal, a defence spokesman told the BBC.They were rescued from lifeboats north-east of Orissa's Balasore district, he said.Send your pictures and videos to yourpics@bbc.co.uk or text them to 61124 (UK) or +44 7624 800 100 (International).

      <body>Parts of Vietnam and China are bracing for the arrival of Typhoon Nari, which has left at least 13 people dead in the Philippines.The typhoon hit the Philippines over the weekend, inundating northern provinces, and was expected to make landfall in central Vietnam on Tuesday.Vietnam's weather forecaster has warned of heavy rain and destructive winds.Heavy rain was also expected in China's Hainan, Guangdong and Fujian on Monday, Xinhua news agency said.At least 750,000 people were affected by the typhoon, Philippine officials said, before it made its way out into the South China Sea.In anticipation of the storm's arrival, Vietnam had moved at least 55,000 people living in the coasts of Thua Thein Hue and Da Nang to safety, state media media said. Boats had also been advised to berth."Very strong winds are expected from later Monday. There might be heavy rains of up to 500mm [20 inches] over the next few days," the head of Vietnam's national weather forecast centre was quoted by Agence-France Presse as saying.In southern China, Hainan authorities had issued a red alert for the storm, state broadcaster CCTV said on its official Twitter account.Last month, Typhoon Wutip caused destruction in Vietnam, damaging tens of thousands of houses, state media said.In China, at least 10 fishermen died after boats were hit by strong winds.</body>

      <body>Cancer costs countries in the European Union 126bn euro (£107bn) a year, according to the first EU-wide analysis of the economic impact of the disease.The charity Cancer Research UK said it was a "huge burden".The figures, published in the Lancet Oncology, included the cost of drugs and health care as well as earnings lost through sickness or families providing care.Lung cancer was the most costly form of the disease.The team from the University of Oxford and King's College London analysed data from each of the 27 nations in the EU in 2009.The showed the total cost was 126bn euro and of that 51bn (£43bn) euro was down to healthcare costs including doctors' time and drug costs.Lost productivity, because of work missed through sickness or dying young, cost 52bn (£44bn) euro while the cost to families of providing care was put at 23bn (£19.5bn) euro.Overall, richer countries, such as Germany and Luxembourg, spent more on cancer treatment per person than eastern European countries such as Bulgaria and Lithuania.Lung cancer accounted for more than a tenth of all cancer costs in Europe. The deadly cancer tends to affect people at an earlier age than other cancers so the lost productivity through early deaths is a major factor.However, the overall economic burden is behind the costs of dementia and cardiovascular disease.An EU-wide study, by the same research group, showed cardiovascular diseases, including high blood pressure and stroke, cost 169bn euro (£144bn) a year while dementia cost 189bn euro (£169bn) in just 15 countries in Western Europe.Dementia has very high costs associated with long-term care while cardiovascular diseases include such a wide range of conditions it affects many more people than cancer.One of the researchers, Dr Ramon Luengo-Fernandez, from the Health Economics Research Centre at the University of Oxford, said: "By estimating the economic burden of several diseases it will be possible to help allocate public research funding towards the diseases with the highest burden and highest expected returns for that investment."Prof Richard Sullivan, from King's College London, said: "It is vital that decision-makers across Europe use this information to identify and prioritise key areas."More effective targeting of investment may prevent health care systems from reaching breaking point - a real danger given the increasing burden of cancer - and in some countries better allocation of funding could even improve survival rates."Sara Osborne, head of policy at Cancer Research UK, said: "The financial impact that cancer has on the economy across Europe due to people dying prematurely from the disease and time off work remains a huge burden."This study reinforces why research is vital to improve our understanding of the causes of cancer - so that we lessen the impact of the disease and develop better ways to prevent and treat the illness."We also need to understand why the UK's cancer mortality rates remain higher than many EU countries despite a similar spend on cancer care."</body>

      <body>UK police investigating Madeleine McCann's disappearance have released two e-fits of a man they want to speak to as a matter of "vital importance".They will feature in a BBC Crimewatch appeal later over her disappearance on 3 May, 2007, in Praia da Luz, Portugal.Police said the man "may or may not be key" but had been placed in the area.The images are based on evidence from two witnesses who saw him on the night three-year-old Madeleine, from Rothley, Leicestershire, went missing.The witnesses said the man was white, 20 to 40 years old and of medium build. He had short brown hair, was clean-shaven and of medium height, they added.Det Ch Insp Andy Redwood, the senior Metropolitan Police investigating officer, said: "Whilst this man may or may not be the key to unlocking this investigation, tracing and speaking to him is of vital importance to us."We have witnesses placing him in the resort area around the time of Madeleine's disappearance."This is far from our only line of inquiry and there will be e-fits released of other sightings as well, who we are equally keen to trace."These people were seen on the day of Madeleine's disappearance and the days leading up to it."Madeleine went missing from a holiday flat in Praia da Luz, Algarve, as her parents dined with friends at a nearby restaurant.A Portuguese investigation into the case was dropped in 2008, but Scotland Yard began a review of the case in May 2011.On Sunday the Met said the timeline and "accepted version of events" surrounding Madeleine's disappearance had significantly changed, without giving further details.A detailed reconstruction lasting close to 25 minutes and covering events leading up to and surrounding Madeleine's disappearance will also feature on Monday's Crimewatch.Police say the appeal is based on "substantive" new material including mobile phone records.A short clip released in advance by police shows actors playing Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, leaving their holiday apartment for the nearby tapas restaurant.They are then seen seated outdoors at a large poolside table, greeting friends as they come to join them for dinner.Speaking about the review-turned-investigation, Det Ch Insp Redwood said detectives had been able to "make massive steps forward" by drawing together all the material gathered to date and reviewing it as a whole.He said his team had sought to "try and draw everything back to zero... take everything back to the beginning and then reanalyse and reassess everything, accepting nothing".He added: "Praia da Luz is a popular holiday destination for many nationalities so our requests for help need to be repeated in many different countries."He said he would travel to the Netherlands, Germany and Ireland to seek public support there, and would repeat the appeals in Portugal - "a key country for us to trace any outstanding witnesses".In Germany, a special edition of the crime programme Aktenzeichen XY - Ungeloest which is translated as "File XY - Unsolved", will be aired on Wednesday night and will feature an appeal for information from Mr and Mrs McCann.Det Ch Insp Redwood went on to urge anyone, including from the local community, who was in or around Praia da Luz on Thursday, 3 May 2007, to speak to police if they had not already done so."We still have a lot of material to investigate and much work to do," he added.Meanwhile former Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre head Jim Gamble - who carried out a review into the case in 2010 - said the appeal offered "an opportunity for everyone to help"."It doesn't matter that you were not in Praia da Luz - you may watch something, you may see an e-fit, you may see some other information, they may talk about telephone numbers and something will click with you," he told BBC News."And that you will not know unless you watch."Mr and Mrs McCann are expected to make a live appeal from the studio during the programme.Ahead of its broadcast, Mrs McCann said: "We're not the ones that have done something wrong here."It's the person who's gone into that apartment and taken a little girl away from her family."Meanwhile Robert Murat, the first official suspect in the case but long since cleared of any involvement, told the BBC he hoped the new appeal would produce results."It's gone on and on and every time something new comes up, you know, it brings hope and then it seems to fade away and disappear. So I'm hoping that's not going to be the case again," he said.The Crimewatch appeal will be shown in the UK on BBC One on Monday from 21:00 BST. It will also be broadcast in the Netherlands and Germany.</body>

      <title>Gaza 'terror tunnel' found in Israel</title>
      <description>Israel suspends deliveries of building supplies to the Gaza Strip after discovering a long tunnel out of the Palestinian territory into Israel.</description>

      <body>The Israeli army says it has discovered a tunnel running 1.7km (1 mile) from the Gaza Strip into Israel.The tunnel led from a house to a site close to a kibbutz, Ein Hashlosha, and could have been used to carry out attacks on civilians, a spokesman said.Israel has responded by halting the transfer of all construction materials to Gaza. Restrictions on the private sector were lifted last month.Gaza's Hamas rulers accused Israel of "exaggerating things".By talking about the discovery of a tunnel, Israel was "trying to justify the blockade and the continuous aggression on the Gaza Strip," spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said.A spokesman for the military wing of Hamas, al-Qassam Brigades, said on Twitter that "the minds which manage to dig the tunnel can dig dozens more".The tunnel was uncovered last Monday after kibbutz residents complained of hearing an unusual noise from the heavily fortified border area.It ran from Absan village near Khan Younis in Gaza under the border fence almost as far as Ein Hashlosha, Israeli media reported.Explosives found inside the tunnel had since been made safe, the army said. A spokesman told the BBC the tunnel was some 15-18m (50-60ft) deep and would have taken at least one month to dig.Tunnels have been used before to launch attacks from Gaza. In 2006, Palestinian militants seized Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit who was kept in captivity in Gaza for more than five years.Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu praised the army but warned that the "quietest year in over a decade" had been disturbed by recent militant activities.A retired colonel was murdered at his home in the West Bank on Thursday night, although police say the motive is so far unclear. Three Palestinians have been arrested.Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon said the discovery of what he described as the "terror tunnel" was "further proof that Hamas continues to prepare for confrontation with Israel and for carrying out terror attacks, if it feels it is possible."Since construction materials were used to dig the tunnel, I instructed, over the weekend, to halt the transfer of these materials to the Gaza Strip."Israeli human rights group Gisha said 70 lorry loads of building materials for the private sector and 60 loads for humanitarian projects had been due to enter Gaza on Sunday.Israel tightened a blockade on Gaza when Hamas took power in 2007.Israel has gradually eased restrictions since 2010.Egypt, which has its own blockade of Gaza, has recently attempted to close off the network of tunnels used to smuggle goods beneath the border.Relations have soured since July, when the Egyptian army ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, whose Muslim Brotherhood movement is close to Hamas.</body>

      <body>The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says gunmen have abducted six of its workers and one Red Crescent volunteer in north-west Syria.The aid agency has had no contact with the gunmen, an ICRC spokesman says.Earlier, Syrian state media said gunmen had opened fire on Red Cross staff travelling on the road between Sarmin and Saraqeb in Idlib province.The ICRC says it has been struggling to gain access across Syria to provide aid to injured and displaced people.A convoy carrying six ICRC staff members and one Syrian Arab Red Crescent volunteer was intercepted by unidentified armed gunmen near the town of Saraqeb in Idlib province, ICRC spokeswoman Rima Kamal told the BBC."We call for the immediate release of the seven colleagues abducted this morning... who work tirelessly to provide assistance to those most in need in Syria. Incidents such as this one unfortunately will undermine our capacity to assist those who need our help," she said.The ICRC has declined to reveal the identity, gender or nationality of the abducted workers but they are believed to include both local and international staff, who are mainly medical specialists.Syrian state news agency Sana earlier quoted an unnamed official as saying the workers were abducted and taken to an unknown location after gunmen blocked their path and shot at their convoy.The aid agency did not confirm whether shots had been fired, but said the team's vehicles were also missing.An ICRC statement said the vehicles they were travelling in had been clearly marked with the Red Cross emblem, "which is not a religious symbol".Another ICRC spokesman, Simon Schorno, told Associated Press the attack took place at around 11:30 (08:30 GMT) on Sunday as the team was returning to Damascus.He said the team had been in the field since 10 October to assess the medical situation and deliver aid in what he described as "a difficult area to go in".It is not yet clear who carried out the kidnapping, but Syrian state TV blamed it on what it called "armed terrorists" - a term it frequently uses to describe anti-government rebels.Hardline Islamist rebels are known to operate in the area, says the BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut.Kidnappings, particularly of aid workers and journalists, have become increasingly common in the north, where much of the countryside has fallen into rebel hands.In August, the ICRC said the number of Syrian Arab Red Crescent volunteers who had lost their lives since the start of the conflict had risen to 22.The abductions will clearly complicate further the already difficult and dangerous task of providing humanitarian aid to all parts of the country, he adds, at a time when the UN is pressing all sides to allow freer access.On Saturday, the Syrian government began the evacuation of around 1,500 civilians, mainly women and children, from a rebel-held Damascus suburb besieged by the army for months.Many of those coming out of Muadhamiya, south-west of Damascus, were said to be exhausted and traumatised.In a separate development, the state news agency said two car bombs exploded on Sunday evening near the state TV building in Damascus.The TV headquarters in the capital's Umayyad Square was reportedly damaged in the attack, but there was no immediate word on casualties, the agency reported.More than 100,000 people have been killed since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in March 2011, according to the UN.Earlier this month, the UN estimated that more than eight million Syrians could have been forced from their homes by the country's civil war by the end of 2014.</body>

      <title>NHS Savile abuse probe widened</title>
      <description>The probe into Jimmy Savile's abuse of NHS patients has been extended to include more hospitals, says the health secretary.</description>

      <body>The investigation into Jimmy Savile's alleged abuse of patients at NHS hospitals has been extended to other hospitals, the health secretary says.The inquiry, currently focused on Broadmoor, Stoke Mandeville and Leeds General hospitals, as well as a further 10 trusts, will be expanded to include "other hospitals", Jeremy Hunt said.The hospitals were not named. A final report will be published in 2014.The late DJ is believed to have abused hundreds of victims.The former BBC presenter of Top Of The Pops and Jim'll Fix It, who also worked as a Radio 1 DJ and received a knighthood in 1990, died aged 84 in October 2011 - a year before the allegations were broadcast in an ITV documentary.Revelations that the famed fundraiser had sexually abused children prompted hundreds of victims to come forward, including those who said they were attacked on BBC premises and at a number of other institutions.Savile had a bedroom at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, an office and living quarters at Broadmoor, and widespread access to Leeds General Infirmary.Mr Hunt said: "It is vital that the final NHS investigation report is thorough and complete and reflects all the evidence about Jimmy Savile's pattern of offending."A Scotland Yard investigation into Savile's alleged crimes - one of three strands of Operation Yewtree - is due to report in the new year.The BBC understands it will put the number of alleged victims at over 500.The Department of Health investigation into the three hospitals is being overseen by barrister - and former deputy chairman of the Financial Ombudsman Service - Kate Lampard.In a written ministerial statement, Mr Hunt said: "The Metropolitan Police Service, working with Kate Lampard, has established there was further relevant information regarding Jimmy Savile."The Department of Health asked the Metropolitan Police Service, through an agreed information sharing process, to review information it held to ascertain if it included material related to health and care settings."The revelations about Savile have led to a number of inquiries.Firstly, the police investigation, Operation Yewtree, which has three strands.One is looking specifically at the actions of Savile, and the second strand concerns allegations against "Savile and others".The third strand relates to complaints against other people unconnected to the Savile investigations, made by people who came forward after widespread coverage of the scandal.The BBC has also launched three reviews, including the Pollard Review, which has already reported the findings of its investigation into the dropping of a Newsnight report into claims Savile was a paedophile; and a review by Dame Janet Smith into culture and practices during Savile's career and current policies.The director of public prosecutions is also reviewing decisions not to prosecute Savile in 2009.</body>

      <body>Industrial output in the eurozone grew at the strongest pace for more than two years in August, figures have shown.Factories in the 17-country bloc saw output rise by 1% in the month, which was better than analysts' forecasts.The figures showed that the highest increase was registered in Portugal, where output grew by 8.2%.Europe's economic powerhouse, Germany, saw output rise 1.8%, while French output increased by 0.2% following three consecutive months of decline.However, output in Italy fell by 0.3%. This was the second decline in a row, as Italy's economy continued to falter.Germany, France and Italy make up two-thirds of the overall production figure for the eurozone.Chris Williamson, chief economist at the researchers Markit, said that while the figures were encouraging there was still cause for concern over the strength of the bloc's recovery.While production had rebounded in August, he noted that this "merely brings output back to June's level, which was still some 12.5% below its pre-crisis peak".However, he added that the upturn is "an encouraging sign that the sector is slowly recovering"."Policymakers will be encouraged by the ongoing recovery trend, but will be reminded of the huge surplus of capacity that persists compared to before the crisis struck."In August, the eurozone emerged from an 18-month recession, after reporting growth of 0.3%.However, economists have cautioned that growth and manufacturing figures will remain choppy, and that the recovery from recession is far from secure.Earlier this month, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi said that the economic recovery in the eurozone remained "weak, fragile, uneven".</body>

      <body>The 2013 Nobel Prize in economics has been awarded to Eugene Fama, Lars Peter Hansen and Robert Shiller.It was awarded for their "empirical analysis of asset prices", according to the awarding committee.The committee said the trio's separate pieces of work had "laid the foundation for the current understanding of asset prices".The prize is worth 8m Swedish krona (£775,000; $1.2m), which will be shared equally among the three winners.Eugene Fama from the University of Chicago was praised for demonstrating that share prices are extremely difficult to predict in the short run, with new information quickly incorporated into prices.The committee said Mr Fama's findings had had "a profound impact" on subsequent research, and also changed market practice.Lars Peter Hansen, also from the University of Chicago, was awarded the prize for his development of a statistical method that was able to test theories on asset pricing.Robert Shiller, from Yale University, was included for his 1980s discovery that stock prices fluctuate much more than corporate dividends.The Nobel committees have now announced all six of their annual awards for 2013.The economics award was added to the existing Nobel award in 1968 by Sweden's central bank as a memorial to Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel.Mr Nobel created the other five prizes for medicine, chemistry, physics, literature and peace in 1895.</body>

      <title>UK to relax visa rules for Chinese</title>
      <description>The UK government will relax visa rules for Chinese nationals coming to the UK, Chancellor George Osborne announces during his China trade trip.</description>

      <body>Visa applications for Chinese visitors entering the UK will be simplified, Chancellor George Osborne has announced during his trade trip to China.Under the plan, Chinese nationals visiting the EU will not need to submit separate UK visa applications if they book with selected travel agents.Mr Osborne is trying to persuade more Chinese companies to invest in the UK.But he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that his trip was also about changing British attitudes to China."Many people think of China as a sweat shop on the Pearl River. Yet it is at the forefront of medicine, computing and technology. It's a very rapidly changing country."Earlier, Mr Osborne told an audience of students that his visit was about "much more than a collection of business deals"."What I really want it to be about is strengthening the understanding between our two nations, deepening our friendship, working out where by working together we can improve the lives of all our citizens," he said in a speech to university students in Beijing."Yes, of course, we have differences, different political systems, we attach value to different things, and we shouldn't be afraid of pointing out where we disagree."But let us not do it in a way that is not respectful of each other and tries to understand each other, and let us try to overcome our differences and work together in peaceful co-operation."Because ultimately we want the same thing - a better life for our citizens."Adam Marshall, director of policy at business lobby group the British Chambers of Commerce, said UK businesses would "breathe a collective sigh of relief" at the plans to simplify Chinese visa applications."For too long, Britain has courted Chinese investment and tourism without facilitating the entry of Chinese visitors with the same vigour. A responsive visa system is crucial to demonstrating that the UK is open to trade and investment," he added.During his week-long trip, Mr Osborne has already unveiled a deal in which a Chinese firm took a 20% stake in a new business park in Manchester.And on Sunday came details of the visa changes.Currently, Chinese visitors can apply for a single visa to visit much of Europe but a separate one is required to travel to the UK.It is thought that the extra paperwork is deterring many Chinese visitors from including the UK in a trip to Europe.A mobile visa scheme that already operates in Beijing and Shanghai will be expanded as part of the changes.Under the mobile service, which was first tested by executives at Wanda, the company that bought Sunseeker yachts, officials go out to applicants to collect their paperwork and biometric data.The process can take less than five minutes.A 24-hour "super priority" visa service will also be available from next summer. The moves will be welcomed by UK businesses who want to benefit from Chinese tourists.In his speech, Mr Osborne said: "Let me make this clear to you and to the whole of China, there is no limit to the number of Chinese who could study in Britain."There is no limit to the number of Chinese tourists who can visit. No limit on the amount of business we can do together."According to the government, last year 210,000 visas were issued to Chinese nationals and they contributed about £300m to the UK economy.</body>

      <title>18,000 Poland fans 'to boost Wembley'</title>
      <description>England defender Leighton Baines is unconcerned by the FA's decision to sell 18,000 World Cup qualifier tickets to Poland fans.</description>

      <body>England left-back Leighton Baines has defended the Football Association's decision to sell 18,000 tickets to Poland fans for Tuesday's decisive World Cup qualifier at Wembley.The FA hope doubling the 9,000 seats Poland are entitled to will prevent away fans from buying home tickets.It was a move used for recent games with Scotland and Republic of Ireland.Baines said: "If away fans add to the atmosphere the home fans produce, it just adds to the occasion."England lead Group H on 19 points and will guarantee a place at Brazil 2014 if they follow Friday's 4-1 win over Montenegro with another victory.A draw or defeat would open the door for Ukraine, who are second on 18 points, to top the group, providing they win their final qualifier against pointless San Marino.That eventuality would see England head into a two-leg play-off against one of the other seven best runners-up from the European qualifying groups.Poland held Roy Hodgson's side to a 1-1 draw in Warsaw earlier in the qualifying campaign.Wembley has not been filled to its 90,000 capacity during England's qualifying campaign, with attendances fluctuating from under 70,000 during their first home fixture against Ukraine, to almost 87,000 for the win over San Marino.Poland are entitled to 10% of the capacity but the FA took the decision to offer Polish fans 18,000 tickets in an attempt to stop them buying seats among home support.Baines will win his 21st cap after Chelsea's Ashley Cole was ruled out with a rib injury and does not expect the enhanced away following to intimidate England's players."It could work in that manner, but to put a more positive spin on it you'd rather play in a stadium with a good atmosphere rather than it be a half-empty stadium," added the Everton defender."I remember when we played Ghana - and I don't know how many there were there - they were amazing and it just made it better."If it adds to the atmosphere, it's great."It is understood the FA took the decision to increase the away allocation after discussions with police."With high demand for tickets from the large Polish community in England the FA took the decision, based on safety grounds, to ensure Polish fans were allocated space in a specific area of the ground rather than attempting to buy tickets in home areas," said and FA Spokesman."This is the same process that was employed for the successful Scotland and Republic of Ireland fixtures earlier this year."</body>

      <body>Ferrari's Fernando Alonso said he was happy to have broken the all-time Formula 1 points record but admitted this year's championship is over.The Spaniard finished fourth in the Japanese Grand Prix to pass Michael Schumacher in the all-time points list.But he is 90 points behind race-winner Sebastian Vettel with 100 available."Even if Vettel doesn't finish all of the races I need to win nearly all, so it's a matter of time [until Vettel is champion]," Alonso said.On his own accomplishment, he admitted he had benefited from the fact that slightly more of his career than Schumacher's had come after 2010 when points awarded were more than doubled and extended to 10th place.Alonso has now scored 1,571 points in his 12-year career, two more than Schumacher. Vettel is third on 1,351."We have different goals now and they told me I have the record for the most amount of points in F1 history, so it's a happy day. Leading points scorer in F1 is something great," he said."I know the points system changed, but when someone overtakes me in the points no-one will remember the points system changed."To win the title, however, Alonso - who has won 32 grands prix in his career to Vettel's 34 - would have to win three of the remaining four races and finish second in the other, with Vettel retiring from them all.Alonso acknowledged his Ferrari did not have enough pace to do that."We struggle a little bit to do so," he said, "so it is matter of time. We continue to try to do out best on Sundays. When it is mathematically settled we [will] congratulate him."In fact, Vettel will clinch the title in the next race in India on 27 October as long as Alonso does not outscore him by at least 16 points."Regarding the championship, as I said, I think obviously we have a very, very good gap but we still keep pushing," said Vettel."I think we've proven in the last couple of years that we never give up. I think we've won one or two championships because of that."Obviously this year it looks very good at this stage - but it's not over before it's over."Alonso's aim is now to secure second in the drivers' championship and do the same for Ferrari in the constructors' competition.The Italian team extended their lead over Mercedes to 10 points after a bad race for the German team, who saw Lewis Hamilton retire with damage caused by a puncture and Nico Rosberg take eighth after a drive-through penalty for an unsafe release from a pit stop.Lotus are also in the running for second place - they are 33 points behind Ferrari after Romain Grosjean took third in Suzuka and Kimi Raikkonen fifth.Team boss Eric Boullier said: "Two weekends in a row we have gained some points on them. If we can keep it going it's possible."The four remaining races are in India, Abu Dhabi, the United States and Brazil.Full race results</body>

      <body>Jamaica's drug-testing practices are to be audited by the World Anti-Doping Agency, the Associated Press reports.A former director of the Jamaican Anti-Doping Commission (Jadco) claims a significant gap in out-of-competition testing existed ahead of the Olympics.Since London 2012 though, high-profile sprinters including Asafa Powell have tested positive for banned substances.But athletics' governing body, the IAAF, insists it extensively tested elite Jamaicans throughout that period.The country's sprinters won eight individual medals at the London Games.But in recent months, Jamaica's reputation has been tarnished with news of positive tests by Powell, Sherone Simpson and three-time Olympic gold medal winner Veronica Campbell-Brown.Former Jadco director Renee Anne Shirley alleged in August that athletes were not tested outside of competition for five of the seven months before last year's Olympics.While the organisation's chairman Herbert Elliot has dismissed her claims, Wada director-general David Howman believes there is an issue."There was a period of, and forgive me if I don't have the number of months right, but maybe five to six months during the beginning part of 2012 where there was no effective operation," Howman told the Associated Press."No testing. There might have been one or two, but there was no testing. So we were worried about it, obviously.''More to follow.</body>

      <body>Astronaut thriller Gravity has kept its grip on the North American box office for a second consecutive weekend.The outer space drama starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney took $44.3m (£27.7m) according to early estimates.It easily beat Tom Hanks' latest film, Captain Phillips, which took $26m (£16.3m).The movie tells the true story of the cargo ship captain who was taken hostage by Somali pirates after his ship was hijacked in 2009.Both films have earned critical acclaim with both Bullock and Hanks tipped as likely Oscar contenders.Gravity's successful second week haul brings its total US domestic takings to $123.4m (£77.2m)."They say what goes up must come down, but that's not really true with Gravity," box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian said."To have opened as big as it did last week and only drop 21% [in revenue], that's really an amazing hold. It's a direct testament to the word of mouth on the movie."Animated sequel Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs 2 was at three in its third week of release with $14.2m (£8.9m).The weekend's only other new release, Machete Kills, opened in fourth place with $3.8m (£2.4m).The gun-toting sequel from director Robert Rodriguez and starring Danny Trejo and Michelle Rodriguez is the follow-up to Machete, which earned $11.4m (£7.1m) when it opened in 2010.Runner Runner, starring Ben Affleck and Justin Timberlake, fell two places to five with $3.7m (£2.3m)</body>

      <body>WH Smith has taken its UK site completely offline until all abuse-themed e-books are removed from its product listings.The move comes after last week's revelations that Amazon, WH Smith, Barnes and Noble, and other retailers were selling pornographic e-books featuring incest, rape and bestiality on their sites.WH Smith said it was "disgusted" by such titles and found them "unacceptable".It takes e-book content from Kobo.com.In a statement Kobo said it was "working quickly to review its catalogue and remove the content, authors and publishers in question"."We are also evaluating new procedures to help ensure that this type of content will not become available... in the future," it said.Meanwhile visitors to the WHSmith.co.uk website were greeted by a holding page statement.The retailer said it had taken the site offline "to best protect our customers and the public"."Our website will become live again once all self published e-books have been removed and we are totally sure that there are no offending titles available", it said."We sincerely apologise for any offence caused."While Kobo said some publishers and authors had violated its self-publishing policies, it maintained that its goal was "not to negatively impact the freedom of expression and the work of the amazing self-published community that has been created at Kobo.com."Over the weekend US retailing giant Barnes and Noble said offending titles were "in violation" of its policy on content offered in the NOOK Bookstore and were in the process of being removed."When there are violations to the content policy that are brought to our attention, either through our internal process or from a customer or external source, we have a rapid response team in place to appropriately categorise or remove the content in accordance with our policy," it said.Self-published e-books have grown massively in popularity along with the growth in digital e-readers and tablet computers, but retailers have been struggling to filter explicit content that breaches their website guidelines.On Friday, technology news site The Kernel revealed how Amazon, Barnes and Noble, WH Smith, Waterstones and Foyles were listing what it called "breathtakingly obscene" books on their websites.But Fiona Allen, spokeswoman for Waterstones, told the BBC: "None of the e-books mentioned in current reporting are now or ever have been available in Waterstones shops or listed on Waterstones' website."She admitted that Waterstones was concerned about some print titles and was investigating those, but that all such printed book data was supplied by Nielsen, a data provider.</body>

      <body>Acclaimed film-maker Ethan Coen has revealed that some of his stage plays might be heading to the UK for the first time.Coen is best known for his movie-making partnership with brother Joel on films such as Fargo, The Big Lebowski and True Grit.But he also has what he describes as a "part-time" career as a playwright.His first full-length stage play, Women or Nothing, has just ended an off-Broadway run in New York.Speaking to the BBC while promoting the Coen Brothers' new film Inside Llewyn Davis at the London Film Festival, Coen said there had been talks about bringing some of his earlier works to the capital."There's nothing definite, but hopefully the first bunch of one-act plays I did with Neil Pepe [artistic director] at the Atlantic Theater Company might be coming here."Almost an Evening, comprising three of Coen's short plays, was staged by Atlantic in New York in 2008. Two other productions of short plays, Offices and Happy Hour, followed.In 2011, Coen's one-act play Talking Cure, along with plays by Woody Allen and Elaine May, appeared on Broadway under the title Relatively Speaking, staged by John Turturro.Speaking to the Associated Press earlier this year, Coen said the reason he began writing plays was a mystery, even to him."I don't know why. You know, it's kind of like doing movies. You see a movie and you go, 'OK, I can try one of those. Maybe I could do that.' It's the same impulse: that would be fun."He added: "It's recreational. It's part-time. I'm a play hobbyist. I'm a gentleman playwright."His debut full-length play, Women or Nothing, had its world premiere at the Linda Gross Theater in August and was extended to 13 October.It tells the story of a lesbian couple and the lengths they go to to have a child without going to a sperm bank.On his future plans as a playwright, Coen told the BBC: "I plan to keep doing it, but I don't know know what the next one will be."The Coen Brothers' Inside Llewyn Davis, which tells the story of a hapless singer-songwriter on the 1960s New York folk music scene, will be out in the UK in January 2014.Joel and Ethan Coen are also executive producing a 10-part television adaptation of Fargo, their Oscar-winning 1996 film, which will star Martin Freeman and Billy Bob Thornton.</body>

      <body>Iceland is experiencing a book boom. This island nation of just over 300,000 people has more writers, more books published and more books read, per head, than anywhere else in the world.It is hard to avoid writers in Reykjavik. There is a phrase in Icelandic, "ad ganga med bok I maganum", everyone gives birth to a book. Literally, everyone "has a book in their stomach". One in 10 Icelanders will publish one."Does it get rather competitive?" I ask the young novelist, Kristin Eirikskdottir. "Yes. Especially as I live with my mother and partner, who are also full-time writers. But we try to publish in alternate years so we do not compete too much."Special saga tours - saga as in story, that is, not over-50s holidays - show us story-plaques on public buildings.Dating from the 13th Century, Icelandic sagas tell the stories of the country's Norse settlers, who began to arrive on the island in the late 9th Century.Sagas are written on napkins and coffee cups. Each geyser and waterfall we visit has a tale of ancient heroes and heroines attached. Our guide stands up mid-tour to recite his own poetry - our taxi driver's father and grandfather write biographies.Public benches have barcodes so you listen to a story on your smartphone as you sit.Reykjavik is rocking with writers. It is book festival time. Man Booker Prize winner Kiran Desai and Generation X author Douglas Coupland rub shoulders with Icelandic literary superstars Gerdur Kristny and Sjon. Sjon also pens lyrics for Bjork, Iceland's musical superstar."Writers are respected here," Agla Magnusdottir tells me. "They live well. Some even get a salary."Magnusdottir is head of the new Icelandic Literature Centre, which offers state support for literature and its translation."They write everything - modern sagas, poetry, children's books, literary and erotic fiction - but the biggest boom is in crime writing," she says.That is perhaps no surprise in this Nordic nation. But crime novel sales figures are staggering - double that of any of its Nordic neighbours.So what has led to this phenomenal book boom? I would say it is due to a crop of darn good writers, telling riveting tales with elegant economy and fantastic characters.Iceland's black lava riverbeds, its steaming, bubbling earth, with its towering volcanoes and fairytale streams also make it the perfect setting for stories.No wonder JRR Tolkien and Seamus Heaney were entranced and Unesco designates Reykjavik a City of Literature.Solvi Bjorn Siggurdsson, a tall, Icelandic-sweater-clad novelist, says writers owe a lot to the past."We are a nation of storytellers. When it was dark and cold we had nothing else to do," he says. "Thanks to the poetic eddas and medieval sagas, we have always been surrounded by stories. After independence from Denmark in 1944, literature helped define our identity."Siggurdsson pays homage to Iceland's Nobel Literature Laureate, Halldor Laxness, whose books are sold in petrol stations and tourist centres across the island. Locals name their cats after Laxness and make pilgrimages to his home."When Laxness won the Nobel prize in 1955 he put modern Icelandic literature on the map," Solvi tells me. "He gave us confidence to write."A combination of ash and the crash also put Iceland on the map.The financial crisis - or "kreppa" - of 2008, which helped trigger the world economic crash, came first. The ash cloud from one of Iceland's many active volcanoes created a second in 2010.Hallgrimur Helgason - comedian, painter and writer - tells me the kreppa brought Icelanders down to earth."It made us less complacent and gave artists a creative shot in the arm - as Thatcher did for Britain," he grins. "We address politics too - it is not all about sagas."But some fear a book kreppa, too. Iceland has so many writers there is huge pressure on publishers.This time of year sees the "jolabokaflod", or Christmas Book Flood, when most books are published.About now every household gets a book catalogue through the door. They pore over it like a furniture catalogue. Everyone receives books as Christmas presents - hardback and shrink-wrapped."Even now, when I go the hairdressers," Kristin Vidarsdottir, manager of the Unesco City of Literature project, says, "they do not want celebrity gossip from me but recommendations for Christmas books."But it is a lock of blue hair which alerts me to the presence of Iceland's most famous celebrity. The singer Bjork attends several of the festival events."It is great to see you supporting writers," I say to her."It is a small place. We have grown up together," she replies. "We support each other."If Bjork was, once upon a time, Iceland's biggest cultural brand, she is today joined by a whole bokaflod of authors.From Our Own Correspondent: Listen online or download the podcast.BBC Radio 4: Saturdays at 11:30 and some Thursdays at 11:00BBC World Service: Short editions Monday-Friday - see World Service programme schedule.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>India battles dengue fever outbreak</title>
      <description>How India is coping with a dengue fever epidemic</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-24440145</url>

      <body>An outbreak of dengue fever since February has killed more than 100 people, inundated hospitals with patients and triggered school closures, reports Atish Patel.In India, many savour the moment when the skies turn grey and monsoon rains lash down to bring respite from the excruciating summer heat.This year, the country saw the heaviest rains in nearly two decades, particularly pleasing farmers who rely on the monsoon for their living.But the rains also bring challenges, including the appearance of Aedes aegypti, a species of mosquito that spreads dengue and yellow fever.The government says 109 Indians have died from the tropical illness in the first nine months of this year and 38,179 cases have been recorded in total, more than double the number for all of 2011.Experts say this year's early and prolonged monsoon has provided more breeding grounds for disease-carrying mosquitoes, who lay their eggs in stagnant water, including pots of clean water, puddles and open sewage drains.Dengue cases usually jump during and just after the rainy season, which normally lasts from June to September, but this year it has extended until October in some Indian states.Hospitals and clinics across the country have been inundated with patients, putting a strain on emergency services, while many schools have shut as a precautionary measure."There has been a shortage of beds," said Dr Sanjay K Tandon, medical superintendent at Paras Spring Meadows Hospital, a private facility in the capital, Delhi."We have refused patients. If the critical phase for a patient is over, we explain to them that now you don't need admission, so let the other person get the advantage."Meanwhile, at Delhi's largest state-run hospital, routine surgeries were halted last week following a government order so that equipment and staff could attend to the daily rush of patients coming in for the past few weeks to be tested for the virus."Routine, planned surgeries have been deferred temporarily. But emergency operations, those that absolutely must happen, are still being done," said Dr RB Mittal, medical superintendent of Hindu Rao Hospital.The areas worst affected in India have been the southern state of Kerala - where more than 23 people have died and 7,000 people are infected - and the western state of Maharashtra - which has registered 31 deaths and 2,681 infections.The World Health Organisation says about half of the globe's population is now at risk from the infection and a study published in April in the scientific journal Nature found India had more cases of dengue than any other country in the world.All hospitals and clinics in India are meant to report every case of confirmed dengue, but many don't, with some health experts believing there isn't enough oversight.In Delhi, the official number of reported cases is 3,298. But Dr Navin Dang, who runs a medical diagnostics centre, said the real number could be 10 times higher."We have been testing for 50 to 60 patients every day over the past month and a half, and getting 20 to 25 positive results a day, so as a standalone lab, we have reported over 1,000 dengue patients," he said."The government numbers are totally underreported... to a very substantial extent. The government only picks up data from a few hospitals and labs."Dr AC Dhariwal, director of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, a government agency, admitted it was "very, very difficult to get accurate numbers".Gareth Camilo Sims, a Welsh expatriate living in Delhi, was recently diagnosed with dengue fever, also called "breakbone disease," after suffering from a headache, exhaustion, high temperature and body rashes - clear signs he had contracted the virus despite taking preventive steps."I was really careful," the 31-year-old lawyer said. "I put mosquito repellent on a few times a day and I haven't been bitten many times," he added.His blood platelet count didn't drop to dangerous levels, but when it does, it can be deadly. There is no treatment for the virus.Mr Sims said he was advised to keep hydrated by drinking six litres of water each day, take a paracetamol pill every six hours and occasionally apply a cold flannel to his forehead to reduce fever.Mr Dhariwal says surveillance is being carried out across the country and in hotspot areas, extensive education campaigns are being organised to inform the public of risks."Dengue enters a country and it stays there," he added.But some have blamed the government for not doing enough to tackle the spread of the disease despite fresh cases being reported year after year."It's a combined responsibility for everybody," Dr Dang said."But of course the government as the elected representative has to play a significant role."If proper measures are taken, there's no stagnant water, there's proper fumigation, sewage and drainpipes are cleaned properly, there is no water logging, and there are fish in water bodies, I'm quite sure things can be brought under control," he says.</body>

      <title>Dog cull plan divides Romanians</title>
      <description>Romanians agonise over plan to cull strays</description>

      <body>It is almost impossible to walk the streets of Bucharest for more than five minutes and not encounter a stray dog.According to official estimates there are 65,000 of them - one for every 30 residents of the Romanian capital.But this situation is about to change, if the government gets its way. Or, if a growing number of alarmed international protesters get theirs, it will not.The government wants the dogs rounded up and, if not claimed within two weeks, put down.While this proposal has plenty of support in Romania, protests have rapidly spread around the world, with critics deploring the impending "massacre".There have been demonstrations outside Romanian embassies in some European capitals, and celebrities like Brigitte Bardot and Pamela Anderson have made forceful representations against the law.This outside interference has incensed supporters of the law, who say "animal lovers" - used partly as a term of abuse - are distorting the truth by, in some cases, disseminating pictures showing cruelty against stray dogs taken in other countries, while claiming to originate from Romania.Stray dogs are nothing new for Bucharest or for Romania in general but the canine population has grown, especially since former communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu ordered in the 1980s the demolition of vast areas of houses in Bucharest and other cities, and their replacement with concrete blocks of flats, forcing the owners to abandon their dogs.Attacks are frequent: in the first eight months of 2013, almost 10,000 people in Bucharest were treated for dog bites by the Matei Bals Institute for Infectious Diseases.In some cases, stray dogs have killed people. One of the most infamous incidents resulted in the death of a Japanese tourist in Bucharest in 2006.But the incident which led to an explosion of popular anger was the mauling to death of a four-year-old boy, Ionut Anghel, by a pack of stray dogs on a private plot in northern Bucharest, on 2 September."It took this tragedy to wake me up to the fact that there are dogs on the streets," says Nadine Apostolescu, a well-known singer and dog owner herself, who is the public face of the campaign to remove stray dogs."Now, after 20 years when nothing was done, I took to the streets as a mother and a citizen to protest against this situation."Demonstrations followed and parliament quickly adopted a bill, dormant for more than three years, which provides for the destruction of captured stray dogs by "humane methods" as a last resort, after 14 working days.It also introduces mandatory registration for dogs and harsher penalties for owners who abandon their animals.But critics complain that, besides potentially triggering a massacre of stray dogs, the law will not solve the problem in the long term, as it does not tackle the issue of uncontrolled breeding."The likelihood is that only tame strays will be captured, as the authorities lack the resources to capture the most aggressive ones, which will continue to breed and the problem will only get worse," says Ovidiu Rosu, a vet with the animal charity Vier Pfoten (Four Paws).He also points out that lots of Romanians are in the habit of feeding stray dogs, which is likely to encourage their continued survival.On both sides of the argument there is a consensus that stray dogs have no place on the streets.Dog-lovers want a sterilisation programme instead, and more investment in dog shelters and adoption. These ideas have had only limited success in the past.Language has become a key point of contention. Opponents object to the law's reference to "euthanasia", saying most stray dogs are healthy animals and this is not an act of mercy killing, but a "massacre".Supporters liken the packs of stray dogs to a "plague of wild animals".Opinion polls suggest supporters outnumber the opponents - by as much as 70% to 30%.Bucharest's mayor, Sorin Oprescu, has promised that 80% of stray dogs will be removed within a year - half of these, apparently, by adoption.He refused to elaborate on what method would be used to kill those dogs which are not adopted. A lethal injection seems most likely.Whatever the outcome, in the end the question still lingers: if Romania has been unable to control its stray dog population for the past 20 years - be it through lack of political will or through corrupt diversion of funding - what is the guarantee that it will manage to do so in future, once the anger generated by the tragic death of an infant mauled by stray dogs starts to subside?</body>

      <title>Plight of India's abandoned widows</title>
      <description>Growing number of elderly Indian women struggle to survive</description>

      <body>The Hindu temple town of Vrindavan, a few hours south-east of Delhi, is known by another name locally: it's called the city of widows.While most come here to find religion, many come because they have nowhere else to go. Others are just dumped here by families who no longer want to pay for their care.Almost all of them are widowed women.Sixty-five-year-old Shakti Dasi from Agartala in north-eastern India is one. She came here eight years ago when her husband died.Her sons no longer want her, she says."It's a struggle to survive, but I can manage on very little. Like everyone else, I too hoped that my children would grow up to take care of me, but they didn't. So I had no choice but to come here."India is home to an estimated 40 million widows - approximately 10% of all women.Ageing women are more vulnerable than men. Without any financial security or welfare infrastructure, many of them are abandoned in Vrindavan- where they live off charity while they wait to die.Shakti Dasi and other widows like her chant prayer songs twice a day, four times a week to earn 20 cents and a bowl of rice.Considered inauspicious, widows are ostracised by many and have few sources of income.Helping these women with their finances are non-profit organisations such as Maitri."The social welfare system in India is practically non-existent," says Winnie Singh, the founder of Maitri.All widows over the age of 60 are eligible for a small government pension worth less than $5 (£3) a month.But most are illiterate and do not have bank accounts to access even that."How can someone getting 300 rupees, or less than $5, survive?" says Ms Singh."How are they going to hire a room to live, buy rations etc? Even if you give them a below-the-poverty-line card, that doesn't give them anything free."Overall, India remains a young country. The elderly account for just 9% of the population.But the number of old people is rising steadily. The UN warns it could triple, reaching 300 million within the next 40 years.In a nation without social security and state healthcare, there is growing anxiety about how India will care for its elderly.Nearly 90% of the country's workforce is in the informal sector. They are mainly self-employed, low-income workers who do not have any access to pension schemes.So that puts them in a particularly vulnerable position where they could easily sink below the poverty line in their old age.Many doubt whether the country's current infrastructure can keep up."One step could be, can you establish a subsidy mechanism for screening or providing some medication for these people? That could have a certain cost," says Amit Mookim, head of healthcare at KPMG."Then, is there a mechanism to take care of certain procedures, operations or surgeries which is then contracted to private players? That is another cost."Then there is the end-of-life care for which the infrastructure doesn't exist - so how much infrastructure can you build?"Experts feel that the lack of a nationwide social security system poses a serious risk to the economy.In Vrindavan, some non-profit organisations are tackling the problem of food and healthcare at a micro level.At Maitri's centre, about 500 widows converge at midday for a free hot meal.They are given health advice and free medicines as well.With families struggling to care for their elders at home, the plight of these women is likely to become increasingly common.But for now, neither the government nor the private sector have any simple solutions to offer.And for some, like Shakti Dasi, it may already be too late.</body>

      <description>Singapore nun dusts off black belt to teach taekwondo</description>

      <body>Sister Linda Sim gave up taekwondo when she joined a convent. Years later, she's dusted off her black belt at a Singaporean hospice to teach children recovering from cancer.When she was much younger, Linda Sim wanted to join the army, but was told she was too small."Next I thought I could be a policewoman - to protect people," she says, but she didn't make the weight requirements for the police force, either.Instead, she discovered taekwondo in 1971, and it seemed to fulfil her need to help other people. "If I had a black belt I thought I could be a bodyguard and protect somebody." Within a few years, she achieved just that.Though the sport gave her great mental strength, she didn't find a practical use for her martial art for more than three decades.Much to the chagrin of her parents, Sim met the Franciscan Missionaries of the Divine Motherhood, and decided to join them by becoming a Catholic nun."Being the only daughter, my mum was very upset when I said I would give my life to God and be a missionary," she says. Her parents had hoped she would provide them with grandchildren.Since the group's headquarters were on the other side of the world in Britain, she would disappoint them further by leaving Singapore."I spent 17 years in England and three more in Africa, where I ran a hospital in Zimbabwe," she says.During her absence, a relationship developed between the Singapore Taekwondo Federation and Mount Alvernia hospital in the centre of the country.Ming Wong, secretary general of the federation explains that an employee of the hospital thought some of its patients - young children being treated for cancer - could benefit from the sport. They were "stuck inside playing snakes and ladders", she says, and the organisation agreed to provide training sessions for them.It was not until 2004, when Sim's mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, that she felt she had to return to Singapore.When she saw the classes taking place, she knew she wanted to be involved. "That was what I had to leave behind in order to be a sister, and so I thought 'now I'm reunited'," she says.Today she runs a weekly class for about 20 people, all of whom have brain tumours or childhood leukaemia. Most are young children, although three are now in their 20s, having trained under Sim for many years.One of the older students, Ng Wei Hau, was diagnosed with a brain tumour at the age of 12 and given just six months to live by his doctors. "When I first met him he was in a wheelchair. When he reached 21 he was walking with a frame, when he reached 23 he had a stick, and now he walks unaided," she says. Despite being partially deaf and blind, Wei Hau became a black belt last year under Sim's tutelage."These children try to do their best however they can, despite their sickness," says Wong. "I think because they want to live life for the fullest because they want to enjoy whatever time they have."The federation's charitable work is not just limited to children from the hospital. The organisation works with children's homes and other disadvantaged groups to offer free taekwondo classes to others who would not usually come into contact with the sport.For Sim, religion is central to her motivation. Whereas most sisters teach religious education in quite a traditional way, she thinks the taekwondo classes allow her to lead by example instead."For me I can actually be a presence and a witness to God's love without actually quoting scripture," she says. "It gives me a lot of peace and satisfaction. It's about evangelising without having to mention going to church."Video produced by Zarina Hussain.

      <title>NHS Savile abuse probe widened</title>
      <description>The probe into Jimmy Savile's abuse of NHS patients has been extended to include more hospitals, says the health secretary.</description>

      <body>The investigation into Jimmy Savile's alleged abuse of patients at NHS hospitals has been extended to other hospitals, the health secretary says.The inquiry, currently focused on Broadmoor, Stoke Mandeville and Leeds General hospitals, as well as a further 10 trusts, will be expanded to include "other hospitals", Jeremy Hunt said.The hospitals were not named. A final report will be published in 2014.The late DJ is believed to have abused hundreds of victims.The former BBC presenter of Top Of The Pops and Jim'll Fix It, who also worked as a Radio 1 DJ and received a knighthood in 1990, died aged 84 in October 2011 - a year before the allegations were broadcast in an ITV documentary.Revelations that the famed fundraiser had sexually abused children prompted hundreds of victims to come forward, including those who said they were attacked on BBC premises and at a number of other institutions.Savile had a bedroom at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, an office and living quarters at Broadmoor, and widespread access to Leeds General Infirmary.Mr Hunt said: "It is vital that the final NHS investigation report is thorough and complete and reflects all the evidence about Jimmy Savile's pattern of offending."A Scotland Yard investigation into Savile's alleged crimes - one of three strands of Operation Yewtree - is due to report in the new year.The BBC understands it will put the number of alleged victims at over 500.The Department of Health investigation into the three hospitals is being overseen by barrister - and former deputy chairman of the Financial Ombudsman Service - Kate Lampard.In a written ministerial statement, Mr Hunt said: "The Metropolitan Police Service, working with Kate Lampard, has established there was further relevant information regarding Jimmy Savile."The Department of Health asked the Metropolitan Police Service, through an agreed information sharing process, to review information it held to ascertain if it included material related to health and care settings."The revelations about Savile have led to a number of inquiries.Firstly, the police investigation, Operation Yewtree, which has three strands.One is looking specifically at the actions of Savile, and the second strand concerns allegations against "Savile and others".The third strand relates to complaints against other people unconnected to the Savile investigations, made by people who came forward after widespread coverage of the scandal.The BBC has also launched three reviews, including the Pollard Review, which has already reported the findings of its investigation into the dropping of a Newsnight report into claims Savile was a paedophile; and a review by Dame Janet Smith into culture and practices during Savile's career and current policies.The director of public prosecutions is also reviewing decisions not to prosecute Savile in 2009.</body>

      <title>Cancer carers 'need more training'</title>
      <description>Some carers looking after cancer patients in the UK are carrying out vital healthcare tasks without always having adequate training, says a charity.</description>

      <body>Some carers looking after cancer patients in the UK are carrying out vital healthcare tasks without always having adequate training, according to Macmillan Cancer Support.They asked more than 2,000 past and current carers about support they gave.Twenty-two per cent said they had dealt with specific healthcare tasks like administering medicine and pain relief, while others had to give injections.The charity wants the NHS to do more to support carers of people with cancer.There are estimated to be around 240,000 carers looking after family members with cancer in the UK.Some of the carers surveyed by Macmillan said they had to change dressings or even manage a catheter.Fewer than half said they had received training from a healthcare professional.Macmillan Cancer Support is pressing for an amendment to the Care Bill, which is due in the Commons later this month, placing a specific duty on the NHS in England to help cancer carers.A spokesperson from the Department of Health agreed that there needed to be better joint working."Proposals already in the Care Bill will mean that local authorities will have to co-operate and work closely with the NHS to identify and support carers."We have also provided £400m to the NHS for carers' breaks and given over £1.5m of funding to help develop initiatives with GPs, nurses and carers organisations to train people to help support them in their caring roles."In the survey carried out by YouGov for Macmillan Cancer Support, 63% of cancer carers who did not receive any training or said their training was not enough, were left feeling distressed and frightened.One in three of this group said they were scared that their lack of knowledge could result in the person they care for being admitted to hospital.A spokesperson for NHS England said not enough had been done in the past to ensure carers get the right training and support."Closer partnership working is already under way and the Integration Transformation Fund will act as a further catalyst for this."Health and Wellbeing Boards have been established, which bring together local clinical commissioning groups and local authorities to gain a shared understanding of the health and wellbeing needs of the community and develop a more responsive health and social care system which delivers better services and reduces health inequalities."Ciarán Devane, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support, said cancer carers took on a huge responsibility and deserved more help."Not only do cancer carers give hours of emotional support and practical help, they are performing clinical duties. Families and carers are the backbone of society and they deserve to be supported."The Care Bill legislation must be amended to ensure the NHS in England has a responsibility to work with local authorities to identify and signpost cancer carers to appropriate services."As the number of people diagnosed with cancer doubles in the next 20 years, there will also be a surge in the number of people caring for them."</body>

      <body>Cancer costs countries in the European Union 126bn euro (£107bn) a year, according to the first EU-wide analysis of the economic impact of the disease.The charity Cancer Research UK said it was a "huge burden".The figures, published in the Lancet Oncology, included the cost of drugs and health care as well as earnings lost through sickness or families providing care.Lung cancer was the most costly form of the disease.The team from the University of Oxford and King's College London analysed data from each of the 27 nations in the EU in 2009.The showed the total cost was 126bn euro and of that 51bn (£43bn) euro was down to healthcare costs including doctors' time and drug costs.Lost productivity, because of work missed through sickness or dying young, cost 52bn (£44bn) euro while the cost to families of providing care was put at 23bn (£19.5bn) euro.Overall, richer countries, such as Germany and Luxembourg, spent more on cancer treatment per person than eastern European countries such as Bulgaria and Lithuania.Lung cancer accounted for more than a tenth of all cancer costs in Europe. The deadly cancer tends to affect people at an earlier age than other cancers so the lost productivity through early deaths is a major factor.However, the overall economic burden is behind the costs of dementia and cardiovascular disease.An EU-wide study, by the same research group, showed cardiovascular diseases, including high blood pressure and stroke, cost 169bn euro (£144bn) a year while dementia cost 189bn euro (£169bn) in just 15 countries in Western Europe.Dementia has very high costs associated with long-term care while cardiovascular diseases include such a wide range of conditions it affects many more people than cancer.One of the researchers, Dr Ramon Luengo-Fernandez, from the Health Economics Research Centre at the University of Oxford, said: "By estimating the economic burden of several diseases it will be possible to help allocate public research funding towards the diseases with the highest burden and highest expected returns for that investment."Prof Richard Sullivan, from King's College London, said: "It is vital that decision-makers across Europe use this information to identify and prioritise key areas."More effective targeting of investment may prevent health care systems from reaching breaking point - a real danger given the increasing burden of cancer - and in some countries better allocation of funding could even improve survival rates."Sara Osborne, head of policy at Cancer Research UK, said: "The financial impact that cancer has on the economy across Europe due to people dying prematurely from the disease and time off work remains a huge burden."This study reinforces why research is vital to improve our understanding of the causes of cancer - so that we lessen the impact of the disease and develop better ways to prevent and treat the illness."We also need to understand why the UK's cancer mortality rates remain higher than many EU countries despite a similar spend on cancer care."</body>

      <title>Poots breached code over gay blood</title>
      <description>Stormont's health minister did not have the power to keep in place a lifetime ban on gay men giving blood in Northern Ireland, a High Court judge rules.</description>

      <body>Stormont's health minister did not have the power to keep an "irrational" lifetime ban on gay men giving blood in Northern Ireland, a judge has ruled.The High Court judge also found that Edwin Poots had breached the ministerial code by failing to take the issue before the Stormont Executive.The Department of Health said Mr Poots would "read and consider" the verdict.The complete ban, put in place during the 1980s, was lifted in England, Scotland and Wales in November 2011.It was replaced by new rules that allow blood from men whose last sexual contact with another man was more than a year ago.The 12-month deferral was left in place following a Government Advisory Committee report.It identified a much shorter period during which infection with blood-borne viruses could not be detected.Mr Poots maintained the ban in Northern Ireland on the basis of ensuring public safety.But a gay man granted anonymity due to his perceived vulnerability launched a judicial review challenge to Mr Poots' position on blood donation.The judge heard claims that the minister had displayed apparent bias that went beyond religious beliefs and into the realms of prejudice.It was revealed in court that despite the unidentified applicant's sexual orientation, he has become a born-again Christian who now disapproves of homosexual practices.Attorney General John Larkin QC, the chief legal adviser to the Stormont Executive, questioned the legitimacy of the challenge.He claimed the challenge was a waste of time because the applicant had previously had sex for money.Mr Larkin rejected arguments that the issue required full executive approval and questioned whether the minister had made a decision to maintain the current ban.However, the judge said that in continuing the lifetime deferral policy the minister had deviated from the position taken in England, Scotland and Wales.He said the decision was made against the secretary of state's recommendation that the report from the advisory committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) should be followed.The judge held that the additional risk from deferring donation for 12 months, instead of permanently, was very minimal.He said: "The minister has decided that MSM (males who have sex with other males) behaviour creates such a high risk of infection to the donor that such donors must be permanently deferred with the result that such blood cannot enter the Northern Ireland blood stock."Importing blood from other places which do accept MSM donors, even in limited quantities, leaves the door open for MSM blood to do just that."There is clearly a defect in reason here."Applying different standards to imported blood defeats the whole purpose of a permanent deferral, he added.Declaring the decision irrational, he said: "If there is a genuine concern about the safety of MSM-donated blood, such that the blood stock must be protected absolutely from such blood, then the security of that blood must actually be maintained absolutely."Dealing with the alleged breach of the ministerial code, the judge said the lifetime ban was both controversial and cross-cutting, taking in equality issues."As such the minister had no authority to act without bringing them to the attention of the Executive Committee which he failed to do."In doing so the minister breached the ministerial code and... had no legal authority to take a decision in breach of the ministerial code."In response to the judgement, a spokesperson for UK Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "We will consider the potential implications of this judgement on UK blood policy."Sinn Féin assembly member Maeve McLaughlin, who is currently the chair of Stormont's health committee, said: "The decision raises in many people's minds serious questions as to whether Edwin Poots has the ability to carry out his duties as health minister for all."She added: "It goes without saying that we need to have robust screening of blood, whoever it comes from. Discriminating against people from within our community who are prepared to give blood, which would be used to save lives, needs to be reversed immediately."Alliance Party health spokesman Kieran McCarthy said the DUP MP's position as health minister had been "seriously compromised" and he should "consider his position"."He has been badly advised and now has serious questions to answer. Not only has he wasted public funds, but he also acted to prejudice one section of society in Northern Ireland," he said.John O'Doherty of the Rainbow Project, a gay advocacy organisation, said: "This ruling is a shocking indictment of the conduct of Minister Poots, who has proven himself incapable of separating his personal prejudices from his public responsibilities."</body>

      <title>Court orders girls' MMR vaccination</title>
      <description>A High Court judge rules two sisters aged 15 and 11 must be given the MMR vaccine against the wishes of the girls and their mother, BBC Newsnight learns.</description>

      <body>A judge has ruled that sisters aged 15 and 11 must have the MMR vaccine even though they and their mother do not want it, BBC Newsnight has learned.The High Court decision, made last month, came after the girls' father brought a case seeking vaccination.The parents, now divorced, had agreed when married not to vaccinate the girls in the wake of the MMR controversy.But the discrediting of concerns about an MMR autism link and recent measles outbreaks changed the father's view.This is the third time this issue has come before the court.In 2003 a mother was ordered to have her child immunised against measles, mumps and rubella after the court ruled the benefits of vaccination outweighed the risks. In 2011, children in care were ordered to have the MMR jab against the wishes of their parents.When outlining her decision in the latest case, Mrs Justice Theis emphasised it was a specific case "only concerned with the welfare needs of these children", but lawyers say as one of a series it confirms there is no longer any debate about the benefits of the vaccine.Measles is a highly contagious disease characterised by a high fever and a rash.In one in 15 cases it can lead to severe complications, such as pneumonia, and in a very small number of cases it can cause encephalitis - inflammation of the brain - which can cause brain damage or even death.MMR is a combined vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella, three common infectious diseases of childhood. It was introduced in the UK in 1988 to replace single vaccines for each disease.The first MMR vaccine is given as a single injection to babies as part of their routine vaccination schedule, usually within a month of their first birthday, then a second injection of the vaccine, known as the MMR booster, is given before starting school.The first gives about 95% protection against measles, while two doses give 99-100% protection.In 1998, a study by Dr Andrew Wakefield was published in the respected medical journal The Lancet raising the possibility that the MMR jab was linked to autism and bowel disease.The report and the media furore that followed prompted many parents to decide against having their children vaccinated with the three-in-one injection, including the parents of the two girls at the heart of this case.The elder daughter was given the first injection, but not the booster vaccine; the younger daughter did not receive any vaccinations at all - decisions made jointly by both parents at the time.However, in 2010 Dr Wakefield's research was found by the General Medical Council to have been "dishonest" and has since been entirely dismissed.The father of the two girls says that this change, combined with an outbreak of measles in Swansea late last year, changed his mind in January 2013 about whether his daughters should be given the MMR jab. He says he was worried these diseases could have serious consequences.According to the text of the court decision, seen by BBC Newsnight, the father's solicitor wrote to the girls' mother in January seeking her agreement that they should now be vaccinated, and saying that if she did not agree he would take the matter to court.The mother did not agree and the matter eventually came before the Family Division of the High Court.A court-appointed welfare officer who spoke extensively to the girls said that neither of them wanted the vaccination.The children were particularly concerned about the ingredients in the vaccine, which include animal-based materials; one of the girls is a vegan.However, the officer said that when she asked them what would happen if they became ill with measles, mumps or rubella and needed medicine, they clearly had not thought about what the ingredients in that medicine might be.The welfare officer said both children had been strongly influenced by their mother, who was very anxious about the jab.Mrs Justice Theis decided that it was in the best interests of the children that they were vaccinated."I am aware that this is against the girls' wishes but that it is not the only factor," she wrote. "The court also has to consider their level of understanding of the issues involved and what factors have influenced their views. I do not consider there is a balanced level of understanding by them of the issues involved."The mother's lawyer Philippa Dolan told Newsnight that the girls had not yet been vaccinated despite the deadline to do so having passed on Thursday.She said: "There are practical difficulties in enforcing the order and that is at the moment an ongoing issue. There's not a legal deadline that's a serious issue the parents are in discussion and everyone hopes it will be resolved without any more litigation."</body>

      <title>Vitamin D 'no effect' on the healthy</title>
      <description>Healthy adults do not need to take vitamin D supplements, suggests a study in The Lancet which found they had no beneficial effect on bone density, a sign of osteoporosis.</description>

      <body>Healthy adults do not need to take vitamin D supplements, suggests a study in The Lancet which found they had no beneficial effect on bone density, a sign of osteoporosis.But experts say many other factors could be at play and people should not stop taking supplements.University of Auckland researchers analysed 23 studies involving more than 4,000 healthy people.The UK government recommends children and over-65s take a daily supplement.The New Zealand research team conducted a meta-analysis of all randomised trials examining the effects of vitamin D supplementation on bone mineral density in healthy adults up to July 2012.The supplements were taken for an average of two years by the study participants.Bone mineral density is a measure of bone strength and measures the amount of bone mineral present at different sites in the body. It is often seen as an indicator for the risk of osteoporosis, which can lead to an increased risk of fracture.The trials took place in a number of different countries including the UK, the US, Australia, Holland, Finland and Norway.Although the results did not identify any benefits for people who took vitamin D, they did find a small but statistically significant increase in bone density at the neck of the femur near the hip joint.According to the authors, this effect is unlikely to be clinically significant.Prof Ian Reid, lead study author, from the University of Auckland, said the findings showed that healthy adults did not need to take vitamin D supplements."Our data suggest that the targeting of low-dose vitamin D supplements only to individuals who are likely to be deficient could free up substantial resources that could be better used elsewhere in healthcare."Writing about the study in The Lancet, Clifford J Rosen from the Maine Medical Research Institute agrees that science's understanding of vitamin D supports the findings for healthy adults, but not for everyone."Supplementation to prevent osteoporosis in healthy adults is not warranted. However, maintenance of vitamin D stores in the elderly combined with sufficient dietary calcium intake remains an effective approach for prevention of hip fractures."The Department of Health currently recommends that a daily supplement of vitamin D of 10 micrograms (0.01mg) should be taken by pregnant and breastfeeding women and people over 65, while babies aged six months to five years should take vitamin drops containing 7 to 8.5 micrograms (0.007-0.0085mg) per day.Dr Laura Tripkovic, research fellow in the department of nutritional sciences at the University of Surrey, said the study was important but very specific."I'm not surprised they didn't find any evidence of the effects of vitamin D on bone density because there are so many other factors involved in osteoporosis, like genes, diet and environment."To pin it all on vitamin D... it's difficult to do that."Dr Tripkovic said it was no good taking vitamin D supplements if people didn't also maintain a healthy, balanced diet containing calcium and take plenty of exercise.She said most healthy people should be able to absorb enough vitamin D naturally, through sunshine and diet."But if people are worried about their vitamin D levels then a multi-vitamin tablet would do. If you have bone pain and muscle aches then you should go and see your GP and discuss it."We get most of our vitamin D from sunlight on our skin, but it is also found in certain foods like oily fish, eggs and breakfast cereals.However, taking too much vitamin D in the form of supplements can be harmful because calcium can build up and damage the kidneys.Experts advise taking no more than 25 micrograms (0.025mg) a day.The UK guidance is currently being reviewed.</body>

      <body>A new campaign to raise awareness about becoming a bone marrow donor in Wales is being launched.There are an estimated 20,000 people worldwide desperately searching for a possible match to an unrelated donor.In Wales, more than 75,000 people have already joined a database of potential marrow donors, but the Welsh Blood Service says many more are needed.As part of the campaign, a choir of donors, patients and medical staff has been brought together to perform.The '2nd Chance Choir' will be making their debut at the Wales Millennium Centre later on Monday, as the campaign kicks off.It is the first time the Welsh Blood Service has run a bone marrow donor awareness programme.Dr Keith Wilson, consultant haematologist at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, said with bone marrow donors it is always about having a choice from as many people as possible."What are the chances of you walking down your street and meeting your exact double, who is like you in every way," he explained."It is not very likely. But if you are searching for that double among thousands and thousands of different people, perhaps you will find that match."That is what the bone marrow donor register is about."It is a worldwide register - the person who needs treatment here in Wales, may be a match to a donor in Europe, America, Asia - anywhere in the world."So we need as many people as possible to sign up for the register to see if they can help."He said he was treating one patient who would be getting a donor matched from Japan or China."Basically, the bigger the pool of people who are registered as donors, the better the chance of a match," he added.Dr Wilson said Wales was already doing well in the league table of donors registered but even more could be done.The Wales bone marrow register is asked to make about 30,000 searches a year to find a possible donor match, and since 1989, more than 850 people in Wales have gone on to become donors.Anyone who is already registered as a blood donor can become part of the marrow register, and a small sample of blood is taken at a donation session.The bone marrow can be used to treat a wide-range of cancers, as well as help rebuild damaged immune systems.The procedures for actual donation if a match is found have also changed dramatically.It used to mean an operation involving anaesthetics and painful injections.Now the preferred method is to collect the marrow from blood."We can collect the donor marrow much more efficiently this way - it just means being hooked up to a machine for four or five hours" added Dr Wilson, who is chair of the south Wales blood and marrow transplantation project."So it's not painful - perhaps boring - you just need a long book."</body>

      <title>'Get flu vaccine this winter' plea</title>
      <description>People at most risk from flu this winter should make sure they get vaccinated against the virus, says Public Health England.</description>

      <body>People at most risk from flu this winter should make sure they get vaccinated against the virus, says Public Health England.For the first time, a nasal spray vaccine is being offered to all two- and three-year-old children because they are key "spreaders" of the virus.People over 65, adults and children with long-term health conditions and pregnant women are known to be at risk.Around 800 people were admitted to intensive care with flu last year.A national advertising campaign is being launched by Public Health England to encourage parents of two- to three-year-old children, and other at-risk groups, to take up the offer of a vaccination.This follows research which found that young children's close contact with each other means they are more likely to transmit the virus to other vulnerable people, such as babies and elderly people.The national flu vaccination programme should eventually include annual vaccination of all two- to 16-year-olds.At present the government says it would not be effective for the NHS to vaccinate every healthy person against flu. However people can still pay for the flu vaccine at their local pharmacy.Every each winter hundreds of thousands of people see their GP and tens of thousands are hospitalised because of flu.Prof Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer, said being protected against flu was vital for certain groups of people."Severe winter flu and its complications can make people really ill and can kill - you are eleven times more likely to die from flu if you are in a clinical at-risk group."I urge everyone who is eligible to get the vaccine and help protect themselves and their families this winter."Dr Paul Cosford, medical director and director for health protection at PHE, said flu was unpleasant for the majority of people but could be life-threatening for others."It can be very serious for older people and those groups at risk of developing complications including people with weakened immune systems, as well as those with underlying conditions such as neurological disorders, liver, lung or renal disease, heart problems or diabetes, and pregnant women."Vaccination remains the best way to protect against the potential serious harm from flu this winter."For information on how to get vaccinated, contact your local GP surgery.</body>

      <body>A woman has described taking her "first deep breath in two years" after becoming the first person in Wales to have a new procedure to control her heart.Because of her scarred heart, Gaynor Wright's original pacemaker was not effective.But its replacement can be "fine-tuned" to her needs by her consultant at the University Hospital of Wales, who can even upload data from it transmitted wirelessly via the internet.Mrs Wright, 65, from Beddau, near Pontypridd said: "I'm back to normal."Her problems started in May 2011 when she ended up in hospital while on a holiday in Cyprus for her 40th wedding anniversary.On her return she underwent tests and it was eventually found she had a serious heart problem and by October 2012 she had her first pacemaker fitted.She said that although it was supposed to "kick in" if anything serious happened to her heart, it did not improve her health and left her breathless.The retired nurse had to give up a rambling group and enjoying long walks over Pembrokeshire Coast Path.Eventually, walking her grandchildren to school or even walking up the stairs became difficult.Mrs Wright's problem was complicated because her heart has scar tissue which means that the original pacemaker could not really improve her day-to-day condition.But her cardiologist Dr Zaheer Yousef was awaiting approval for a new treatment and said she could be a suitable candidate.The replacement pacemaker fitted in May has a new type of system to control her heartbeat and keep the whole muscle beating in synchronisation.It has improved her heart's overall effectiveness as all sections of her heart were not previously working in unison.Dr Yousef, a consultant at University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, has more flexibility to pace the heart so if ever a new problem presents itself then there will be a better chance of being able to adapt to it without surgery.And the pacemaker is fitted with a tiny device that connects wirelessly to a transmitter in Mrs Wright's home to upload data over the internet to Dr Yousef.Now she is enjoying life again and her husband David, 70, says she is no longer "blowing like a whale" as she used to struggle for breath."Within an hour after the procedure I took my first deep breath in two years," said Mrs Wright."After about four weeks I was walking to school to collect my grandchildren."Dr Yousef had been working for three years on clinical trials involving 45 patients in the Cardiff area along with other trials elsewhere and they were awaiting formal approval before it could be used on patients.At that time Mrs Wright was referred to him after having her original pacemaker fitted at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital.He says the adaption to the resynchronisation (biventricular) pacemaker allows cardiologists to "fine tune" or individualise the device.While the pacing configuration was right first time for Mrs Wright other patients may need to have their pacemaker's pacing reconfigured before it suits their needs.He reckons it will help about 20% of the 100 patients with similar conditions referred to him annually as well as countless others."She has really seen the benefit," he said."The additional pacing options will not only give us the opportunity to offer this treatment to patients like Gaynor with very scarred hearts, but the additional pacing options will also allow us to individualise pacing configurations for all patients."Mrs Wright says she is enjoying life again and finding pleasure in small things like doing away with a mountain of pillows as she used to try to sleep while sitting up in bed so she could breathe."It's absolutely amazing," said Mrs Wright.</body>

      <title>Disabled child support review urged</title>
      <description>The government is urged by the children's commissioner for England to undertake a review of the adequacy of support for disabled children.</description>

      <body>Ministers are being urged to review care provided for children with disabilities following research into the adequacy of support for families.Children's commissioner for England Maggie Atkinson called the findings "heart-rending" and "disturbing".The report suggested some families were unable to afford basic necessities for "a dignified life".The Department for Work and Pensions said the report contained "a small sample, presenting a partial picture".The study, carried out by the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) for the children's commissioner, found evidence that poverty meant some disabled children were not living lives that met international human rights standards.Ms Atkinson said the research findings were "not an easy read"."This is about voicelessness and powerlessness, as well as about making ends meet," she said. "It's very poignant and very difficult to hear the stories."Money issues are very real and very challenging, but parents are equally saying they have little or no say in the ways services are planned and provided, from transport to access to youth, or play or leisure which is properly adapted for one's disability."The research was based on interviews and group discussions with 78 disabled children and young people and 17 parents.It was co-led by a team of 11 disabled children and young people working with the university.A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions rejected some of the conclusions."In fact, independent reports show how we are world leaders in support for disabled people with the UK's spending on disability-related benefits a fifth higher than the EU average."The UK is also acknowledged as a world leader in supporting independent living for disabled people, having the best overall rating of 55 countries."We continue to spend around £50bn a year on disabled people and their services and our reforms will make sure the billions spent give more targeted support to those who need it most."Ms Atkinson acknowledged the government's response, but stressed some of the "personal stories" she had heard painted a different picture.She said: "I would like some of the officials who have no doubt written that statement to come and meet some of the young people, who will tell the very true story of living with a disability on a very low income, and then I would ask them to say that again."There is a mum quoted in the survey, who because her child needs an adapted home, including a multi-sensory environment... was persuaded to make sure that was available."She will be paying for it until November 2022."There is also a young woman going through everything that adolescence brings with it, who needs incontinence pads."The benefits pay for four-a-day, she needs 10. That is not human dignity and it is not human rights either."Despite the criticism, researchers found "many examples" of disabled children receiving good care and services which they said "demonstrate how low income does not have to be a barrier".But evidence was also found of inadequate services, compounding the problems of some low income families.The authors said that although families with disabled children often have rights to welfare payments and practical support, their basic incomes often do not cover the extra costs of raising and caring for a disabled child.The team analysed three United Nations treaty documents: the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on Persons with Disabilities and the International Covenant on Economic and Social Rights.Between them these treaties specify individuals' rights to food, clothes and heating, to live independently, to be able to decide where to live, to live in their local communities and to the support and services they need to be able to do that.The researchers found the lives lived by some disabled children and young people did not meet these basic rights."There were accounts of some disabled children, young people and their parents not being able to heat their homes properly or afford adequate clothing and food," said the paper."Some were not informed or involved in decisions about changes to where they lived."Some experienced delays in adaptations being made to their homes and some did not have enough space nor support for independent living."</body>

      <body>London's hospitals are at "breaking point" and face a £4bn shortfall by 2020, NHS England has warned.The organisation, which works to improve the NHS, says patient care will be harmed unless there is a "radical and urgent overhaul" of the service.It said demands for healthcare will soon outstrip supply due to a rising and ageing population and increasing costs, making the NHS "unsustainable".The Department of Health said the NHS should make £20bn of savings by 2015.NHS England in London has outlined several factors which are putting pressure on the service in the capital. These include:Dr Anne Rainsberry, regional director for NHS England, said: "Based on our expectations of patient demands and that we expect a period of flat financial growth, we are likely to have an affordability gap of £4bn in London by 2020."Investing more in hospitals is not the answer. We need to focus more on prevention and improve our primary and community care services to co-ordinate services closer to where patients live."A Department of Health spokesman said: "The NHS is already on track to make £20bn of efficiency savings by 2015 by making changes to the way it works — changes that will continue to deliver savings beyond 2015."NHS England is asking for the public's views to help develop plans to meet the city's needs over the next decade.You can leave your opinion on the myhealthlondon website.</body>

      <title>NHS 'must seek saving ideas abroad'</title>
      <description>The NHS in England has to look to India and Mexico for saving ideas - or face a large funding shortfall, its regulator says.</description>

      <body>The NHS in England has to look abroad for new ideas - or face a large funding shortfall by the start of the next decade, a health regulator has said.Monitor said the NHS was only likely to reach two-thirds of its £30bn saving target by 2021 if it kept on as it was.Most savings so far have come from keeping wages low and improving productivity.But the regulator said the NHS should be more radical by borrowing ideas from countries such as India and Mexico.Monitor's report cites Aravind Eye Care which runs a network of cataract clinics across India.The report said: "By streamlining the workflow of care to maximise the use of staff skills, Aravind is able to perform 60% of the number of NHS cataract surgeries but at one-sixth of the cost to the NHS and achieve better clinical outcomes."Another scheme highlighted was Medicall Home in Mexico which is a nurse telephone advice service that has had great success in reducing the need for consultations with local doctors."If the NHS were to introduce a similar service and it reduced 50% of first visits to general practice, where patients would otherwise have seen a doctor, we estimate it could free up GP time worth in the region of £0.6bn to £0.8bn, taking into account the cost of nurses to run the phone service," stated the report.Other schemes highlighted include one in Ghana for capturing patient information and images on a mobile phone and sending them "for interpretation by a doctor at a different location".Monitor said using fresh ideas such as these could help the NHS meet its ambitious savings targets.Over recent years the NHS has been working towards saving £15-20bn by 2015 - the so-called "Nicholson challenge".But it is now becoming accepted that the savings drive will need to be extended beyond that and hence a £30bn figure has been put forward for 2021.Monitor chief executive David Bennett said he agreed with that but claimed the combination of wage restraint, productivity improvements and reconfiguration of hospitals services was only likely to save around two-thirds of that and so fresh ideas were needed.He said that could either be achieved by getting new providers from abroad into the NHS to compete or by getting NHS trusts to adopt their ideas.He added: "We are not going to make the numbers add up if we don't have this sort of innovation."We must not rule out letting players outside the NHS from coming in and showing us how to do things differently."British Medical Association leader Dr Mark Porter questioned how easy it would be to adopt ideas from abroad."Doctors would need to see more detail as to how the changes proposed would work in reality," he said.But he added it was clear the continuing funding crisis meant doctors had to be given the "freedom" to innovate.Monitor, set up in 2004, describes itself as "the sector regulator for health services in England". It exercises a range of regulatory powers under different acts of parliament.</body>

      <title>Curved soles 'do not help back pain'</title>
      <description>Shoes with curved unstable soles are no better than traditional trainers for reducing lower back pain, suggests a study from King's College London.</description>

      <body>Shoes with curved unstable soles are no better than traditional trainers for reducing lower back pain, suggests a study from King's College London.But previously published research has shown that the shoes can have a positive impact on posture, back and joint pain.Medical professionals are known to regularly recommend the shoes.The study also said normal trainers may be more beneficial for back pain brought on by standing or walking.Shoes with an unstable curved sole are often sold as being able to help increase muscle activity, reduce lower back pain and improve posture and balance.Physiotherapist Dr Sian MacRae, who led the research during her PhD at King's College London, said patients were always asking her if 'rocker sole' footwear worked, so she decided to find out if they could improve back pain and disability.In the study, in the journal Spine, 115 people with chronic lower back pain were asked to wear rocker sole shoes or normal trainers for at least two hours a day while standing and walking.They also attended an exercise and education programme once a week for four weeks and wore their shoes during these sessions.After six weeks, six months and then one year, the participants were assessed using a disability questionnaire.At the end of the study, researchers calculated that people in the trainer-wearing group experienced a larger reduction in disability than those in the rocker sole group.After six months, 53% of the trainer group showed a small improvement in their back mobility compared to 31% of the rocker sole group.For the 59 people who said their back pain was aggravated by standing and walking at the start of the study, those in the trainers group experienced a greater reduction in disability after one year than those in the rocker sole group.Dr MacRae said: "On the basis of the findings of this randomised clinical trial, clinicians should be confident in advising patients with chronic lower back pain that wearing either rocker sole shoes or trainers may offer similar outcomes in disability and pain."However, if a patient reports lower back pain when standing or walking, it may be more beneficial to wear trainers than rocker sole shoes."Noel May, a spokesman for Masai Barefoot Techonology (MBT), which makes unstable footwear, said many other studies had been published showing that shoes with curved soles could reduce pressure on the joints and have a positive impact on posture."We are unique in having a significant number of scientifically published studies combined with vast empirical evidence from user stories over many years."I have great respect for studies based on questionnaires such as this one but we know that all sorts of things impact people's response to wellness questionnaires, including the attitude of the person conducting the study, the economy and even the weather."We have people every week who have written to us stating how beneficial the shoes have been for them over the years including many being helped with lower back pain."</body>

      <body>"Ancient humans" used toothpicks nearly 1.8 million years ago, a study of their teeth has revealed.A team studied hominid jaws from the Dmanisi Republic of Georgia - the earliest evidence of primitive humans outside Africa.They also found evidence of gum disease caused by repeated use of what must have been a basic toothpick.Writing in PNAS, the team says its findings help to explain the diversity found in hominid teeth.The researchers used a new forensic approach to look at variations on the teeth of hominids thought by some to be early European ancestors.Teeth can shed light on what the individuals ate and how old they may have been, but until now it was not clear why there was so much diversity in the Georgian hominid mandibles, or jaws.Ani Margvelashvili, lead author of the study at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, said that scientists dealing with fossil hominid mandibles should pay close attention to tooth wear and the fossil individual's age."Progressive tooth wear triggers bone remodelling processes that substantially modify the shape of the jaw during an individual's lifetime. These effects are typically underestimated when attributing fossil hominid jaws to different species," she told BBC News."The individual who was using a toothpick was young, as his or her teeth were not worn down. We also discovered a damaged area between the tooth area and the gum. There was a small cylinder-shaped lesion - in this area, if you place a toothpick it goes through."The researchers analysed four mandibles from one of the biggest collections of well-preserved early human remnants known anywhere in the world.The Dmanisi site has been valued as an important place to look at how hominids migrated from Africa."It's not very often you have one site with four mandibles. It has allowed us to see special features that have not been seen before," explained David Lordkipanidze of the Georgian National Museum.This included horizontal scratches on a lesion, visible on the root surface of one of the teeth."Scientists often describe groups with new characters as different species. Here we show in one group you can see many characteristics. It shows once more how complicated the story of human evolution is," Prof Lordkipanidze, co-author of the work, told BBC News.It is still unclear what species the Dmanisi hominids were. Experts once believed it was Homo erectus who first ventured out of Africa.But the Dmanisi hominids were not typical of the tall-standing and big-brained H. erectus. Instead, the Dmanisi individuals were short, long-armed, small-brained and thin browed. The fossils are therefore now sometimes referred to as Homo georgicus.Louise Humphrey from the Natural History Museum, London, said there had been a longstanding interest in the causes and implications of the high degree of variation in their mandibles and crania."This paper demonstrates that remodelling of the mandible associated with heavy tooth wear and continuous tooth eruption could contribute to that variation."Peter Ungar from the University of Arkansas, US, said the study could provide a new way of looking at fossils."Tooth pick markings are not uncommon in fossil hominids from this time period, but this clinical, forensic approach is new and potentially useful."Analyses of tooth movements due to wear have been more-or-less limited to anatomically modern humans, and this paper introduces the approach to paleoanthropology," Prof Ungar added.</body>

      <title>Does reality TV help the NHS?</title>
      <description>Fly-on-the wall TV programmes may not be showing us the real National Health Service, warns Dr Johnny Marshall, of the NHS Confederation.</description>

      <body>Reality TV finds its way into all areas of our lives - including our hospitals. In this week's Scrubbing Up column, Dr Johnny Marshall, of the NHS Confederation, asks if the picture it reflects is distorting our idea of how the NHS works.There has been an increasing range of reality shows focusing on NHS services in recent years: One Born Every Minute, 24 Hours in AandE, Keeping Britain Alive, and Junior Doctors, to name just a few.These programmes provide amazing insights into the tireless work of NHS staff and the joys and heartaches of patients and their families.They show a health service that many of us as professionals are proud to work in and are determined to improve despite the increasing pressures on it, a service that is a source of great pride.But as more NHS reality shows appear on our screens, do they really give us a representative view of everything that the health service can and does do?In particular, is there too much fixation on the hospital model, the wonder services and miracle drugs breaking new barriers, and not enough on the care outside hospitals that provides just as essential a purpose?And does this bias the public's view of what we think the "right" kind of healthcare looks like, and inhibit our acceptance of change?The NHS is a complex system, and most of us would agree that many modern treatments are unrecognisable from the original service set up in 1948.Yet the very success of improving health outcomes for the postwar big killers is resulting in a new challenge - people living longer but developing more long-term diseases in older age.To meet these challenges we need to move the emphasis away from hospitals and towards community services.I fear that reality shows, as great as they are, may inadvertently reinforce the public view that hospitals, regardless of their standards, are best, without considering the alternatives.The reality is that hospitals are only one part of the modern NHS story.Many core health services may not have the TV wow factor of pioneering treatment carried out by our big teaching hospitals, or be as thrilling as the trauma care that saves lives in the most horrific of situations.But many community-based services are life-saving - such as falls services, which have been shown to reduce death rates by as much as by 50%.And although they are not glamorous they do save lives and, importantly, allow people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. After all, there is no place like home.Services such as these are a critical part of ensuring that people receive the right care.They relieve pressure on hospitals so those who do need treatment can be seen more quickly.And they reduce the likelihood of people having to stay in hospital because the support they need to be cared for at home or in the community is not there.We have seen how the pressures grow on our AandE departments when these other services are not available.Like any other industry, if the NHS is to retain its core purpose and principle - to meet the needs of everyone and remain free at the point of delivery - and in a safe affordable and sustainable way, it has to move with the times. And we need to let it do so.We have seen many improvements across a wide range of areas, with people spending less time in hospital, so it makes sense to have fewer hospital beds and more support in the community.Similarly, by concentrating the skill and expertise needed to deliver round-the-clock specialist care for patients, we are reducing the number of places it is allocated.By improving stroke services in London, care is now located at eight sites rather than 30 sites, with hundreds of lives - and money - saved each year.These changes may seem daunting, and I have no doubt the NHS needs to do more to engage the public in debate.Often we have not explained the benefits of change well enough.Instead, we have tended to engage with communities after we have come up with a preferred solution, and so have found ourselves in long, drawn-out battles over proposals deemed to be without proper foundation or evidence.So what, you might ask, does reality TV have to do with this?TV shows are there to entertain us, and we should not knock the opportunity to improve our knowledge and insight of various aspects of medicine.But TV also provides a useful mirror that reflects society - our prejudices, fears and hopes.And if our hope is to care for everyone in the right way and in the right place, TV needs to start reflecting that.The future I describe is already a reality in many parts of the NHS, but not evenly distributed.So how about a reality series looking at the amazing work that goes on in the community?After all, that is where life really happens. Is reality TV a help or hindrance to the NHS?</body>

      <title>App aims to improve death records</title>
      <description>How mobile phones are helping register deaths</description>

      <body>Two thirds of deaths worldwide go completely unrecorded, making it impossible to know if public health money is being spent in the right places. But could a mobile phone app be the answer?Birth and death are perhaps the most significant moments of any human life - worth writing down for posterity.But in many countries around the world, the systems set up to collect vital data about citizens have such low coverage that many deaths slip through the net.Not knowing who has died, and what they have died of, makes it impossible to build an accurate picture of a nation's health.Now technology - in the form of a specialist mobile phone app - could make all the difference.Using a technique known as "verbal autopsy", field workers visit relatives to ask them about the circumstances of a family death.By collecting the information digitally from currently hard-to-reach places, it has the potential to revolutionise our understanding of global health.In Malawi, any death that occurs outside a medical facility is not recorded.Dr Carina King, a fellow at University College London, is overseeing the implementation of the mobile phone autopsies in the Malawian district of Mchinji."We found everyone surprisingly open, and I think they find the phone quite an interesting thing when we go for interviews," she told the BBC.Verbal autopsies have been in use for about 20 years but the information was traditionally recorded on a paper questionnaire.These often lengthy documents were supposed to be analysed by two doctors, who would use the answers to deduce the likely cause of death.However the sheer scale of the task was often too great, meaning that many of the questionnaires ending up languishing in dusty rooms, completely unread."The mobile phone has been very good and means we don't have lots of paper forms," says Dr King."We have very quick access to the data and we can analyse it quickly to get the causes of death."The phone software, known as MIVA, presents a series of questions that a trained field worker uses to find out information from the family.Each question has a range of possible answers and the software intelligently skips to the next relevant question depending on the response.Most important of all is that it is designed to quickly compute the most likely cause of death.The result is stored in the phone and can be sent to a central database either by text message or internet upload.Dr Jon Bird of City University, London, who was part of the team involved in creating the software, says mobile phones provide a particularly convenient way of collecting data."Mobile phones are probably one the most widespread technologies in the world. They're cheap, they're robust and everyone knows how to use one," he told the BBC."The everyday nature of mobile phones also makes them really valuable because the people that are being interviewed don't find them intrusive."In Malawi, mobile phone autopsies are currently being used to record the cause of death in children.The project is called MaiMwana, meaning mother and child in the local Chichewa language, and it focuses on children who died before their fifth birthday.The under-five mortality rate in Malawi is 71 per 1,000 live births according to 2012 figures from the World Bank - compared to just five per 1,000 live births in the UK.Lazaro Cypriano lives in the village of Mzangawa in Mchinji district, central Malawi with his wife Magdalena and their toddler.The couple lost their first two children.Their second child died about a year ago, after a series of hospital visits due to fever. It is this death that will be the subject of the verbal autopsy.Outside urban areas, one of the main problems for collecting data is finding out when a death has occurred.To get around this, field reporters from the local community take on the responsibility of alerting the MaiMwana team of people who have died in their area.This is how Lazaro's family was identified, and the visit now affords him his first opportunity to narrate what happened to his son and have that information recorded.The interviewer asks the couple standard questions and matches their answers to the choices provided in the application's template.It's a highly sensitive and skilled job - and one which field interviewer Nicholas Mbwana can see is made easier by using a mobile phone."We go to the households, ask about the causes of death - what really happened - and we also record the GPS in order to trace the household in future," he told the BBC.Dr King says the system is key to the success of the project."GPS gives us the location of every household in the district so we can actually plot out on a map where people are dying of what, which means that you could design more sophisticated programs for targeting specific interventions."Mobile phone autopsies are being used on a limited scale at present. But the long term aim is to roll out the technique much more widely."The beauty of the system is that it's standardised and can be translated into any language you want," says Dr Bird."It's important when you're collecting data on a large scale that everyone is answering the same question, so that you know that the results are directly comparable from town to town and country to country."The World Health Organization (WHO) is already supporting the initiative and is working with institutions from the UK to Sweden to develop the technology further.The data is currently being collected in a range of databases that can be accessed by researchers interested in public health.As the project grows, researchers from the University of Umea in Sweden will co-ordinate the growing number of translations and the distribution of the technology around the world.The government in Malawi is already keen to see the results of the project."It is important for us as a ministry to know what is killing Malawians out there so that we can plan ahead and put appropriate interventions in place to prevent that - and also to put out health messages," says Dr Charles Mwansambo, Malawi's Health Secretary.The Ministry of Health has so far only been using information collected from medical facilities, which the health secretary concedes is biased data."We need comprehensive data from the hospitals and the community to plan well. We find ourselves planning for the small community that comes to hospital, not realising there is a bigger community out there that we need to budget for," he adds.Dr Mwansambo also acknowledges that a cultural practice of burying health documents with the dead makes it difficult to collect important information about deaths."When somebody dies people want to forget everything about them - those memories that will remind them of their loved ones. So unfortunately they bury the health passport along with their clothes and other possessions and we lose vital information in the process," he explains.The health passports are documents issued to parents, which record the birth weight of the baby and its gain over time, as well as which immunizations were administered and when.An elder at Mzangawa village, Kangkwamba Piri, is already talking to members of his community to drop that cultural practice."We've been doing this for a long time but it is wrong. What needs to be done is not to bury the documents and that's what we're encouraging people to do," he says.For now, it is likely that millions of deaths will still go unnoticed by official figures. But verbal autopsies recorded on mobile phones are making small but significant inroads into solving the problem.And for and his wife Magdalena, the chance to give information about what killed their child to an official is important.Magdalena says: "What I have learnt from this interview will help me take care of my third baby so he can be healthy and live long."</body>

      <title>Thalidomide: Were more affected?</title>
      <description>A new group of people battle for compensation</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24472269</url>

      <body>New scientific research appears to suggest the drug Thalidomide may have caused a wider range of deformities than previously thought. A new group of "Thalidomiders" now believe they should get compensation for their disabilities.Gary Grayson, from Ipswich, shows me the very first pair of wooden legs he had to wear as a child. They are painted pink, but are heavy and ungainly.The feet are not hinged and there is a complicated harness of steel and leather."They used to call me peg leg and wooden leg. They didn't have a lot of imagination!" he says about some of his former schoolmates.He was born in 1961 with extensive deformities to his lower limbs. His mother says that staff at the hospital reacted with horror."When I was born she heard the nurse gasp and leave the room."Before he was two years old he was admitted to hospital and had both his lower legs amputated. He was walking on artificial limbs within months.His mother has signed an affidavit stating that she took Thalidomide, but he has never received any compensation for his injuries.Thalidomide was originally marketed as a sedative, but from the late 1950s was prescribed to women around the world to combat morning sickness.By 1961 it was clear that it was causing serious birth defects and by late 1961 it was withdrawn in the UK.Ten thousand children were born worldwide with terrible disabilities. It is thought many more died in the womb.After a 10-year legal battle in 1973 the British distributors Distillers agreed to pay compensation in the UK.The Thalidomide Trust was set up and more than 400 children were admitted to the group as beneficiaries.The German manufacturers Grunenthal have never admitted liability to the British victims nor have they contributed to the Thalidomide Trust.A statement from Grunenthal said: "Thalidomide is part of our history and always will be and we have accepted a responsibility to offer help. We have no legal responsibility to compensate individuals affected.Gary Grayson's parents applied to the Thalidomide Trust but doctors said his injuries weren't typical of Thalidomide.He did not let his disability hold him back and did well at school before joining the Ministry of Defence.The 52-year-old's work took him around the world, he rode motorbikes, married and had children. He's now an information security specialist."In my younger years I did not see myself as a victim," he says.But now he has researched deeper into his own medical history and believes the proof is there.He said: "Compensation in today's world, must naturally follow."His case has been taken up by several law firms under the banner of the Thalidomiders legal group, which is representing a number of other clients in the UK.The legal action has temporarily stalled over funding and insurance, but elsewhere in the world other cases continue.As those affected get older, their health is failing.Today in Spain 185 people affected by Thalidomide are taking Grunenthal to court. They have never received compensation from the German company and are now seeking more than £175m in damages.In Australia last year the distributors of the drug agreed to pay damages to fifty-year-old Lynette Rowe. More cases are expected to be settled later this year.In Britain the legal picture is complex.The Thalidomide Trust receives money from both the UK Government and Diageo the company which acquired Distillers. Since 2006 Diageo has put in an average of £7.5 million per year and has committed to do so until 2037.The Trust has only admitted one new beneficiary in the last year and applies strict criteria for inclusion.Those who feel they were harmed by the drug, but do not qualify for the Trust turn to legal action in the hope of getting compensation.Their cases may be assisted by new research being carried out at the University of Aberdeen by Dr Neil Vargesson.His work involves observing the effect of Thalidomide on the development of chick and fish embryos.He has in the past written expert reports for two of the solicitors acting for the new cases.In the 1960s, experts decided that babies were damaged by the drug during a very short period in pregnancy - between 20 and 36 days after conception.Dr Vargesson says questions can be raised about this time-sensitive window and the way the medicine reacted on each individual."The time-sensitive window was based on interviews with parents of severely affected children and relates to outward damage and severe internal damage."He concludes that: "Given the range of damage in Thalidomide survivors and given animal studies that show in one litter each foetus is damaged differently it's clear to me the drug acts differently in each individual and embryo."That would mean that it is possible Thalidomide caused a wider range of damage than was first thought.But he admits that: "We will never know the true range, it's so difficult to go back 55 years and say well let's have a look at these people, because most of them, we don't even know who those people are."His work though is highly controversial. Other experts in the field disagree with his conclusions.Gary Grayson is busy with his career in IT and does all his own DIY.But he can see a time in the future when his health may deteriorate and he'll need more help.For that reason he is determined to continue with his legal action, but also for a much more personal reason too."It would mean the world to me, to be able to ring my mother and say they've admitted they've made a mistake."</body>

      <title>First aid skills can 'save the boy'</title>
      <description>Will hard-hitting advert get first aid message through?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24396890</url>

      <body>A child falls out of a tree with a sickening thud while his father is preoccupied on his mobile phone.In a kitchen, a woman trained in emergency first aid rushes outside to help, but instead of coming to their aid she gathers in washing from the rain. She is not the boy's mother but she would have known what to do.The father is left kneeling by his unconscious son, blood trickling from his lips, screaming for help.The advert, from St John Ambulance, which has been running on television channels in recent weeks is powerful, the message hard-hitting. What parent would not want to know how to save the boy?Yet the first aid charity says that more than half of parents (55%) lack the skills necessary to save their child in the event of a life-threatening accident. It was their reason for commissioning the advert in the first place.More worryingly perhaps, the charity says that although most parents claim to know basic first aid, many say they would not touch or move the boy until an ambulance arrived - which would be the wrong thing to do.It says the correct procedure to save the boy is to follow the important first steps of first aid by checking for injuries and bleeding, opening his airway and checking his breathing. The charity also explains in their video how to put the boy in the recovery position and it says to call 999.So Sue Killen, chief executive of St John Ambulance, is understandably happy that the response to the advertising campaign has been positive.She says: "We know some people were a little shocked by the advert but as one Twitter user said: 'I'd rather be scared by an ad than scared because I couldn't save someone'."We're really pleased with the way people have responded and that tens of thousands more people can be the difference between life and death."But not everyone is convinced that the tone of the advert was correct.Emma Hammett, who is a first aid trainer with her own company, First Aid for Life, said the advert had "quite a scary message" which left her feeling horrible."A lot of people missed the point that the woman in the advert wasn't the mum [of the boy]."The way the advert was presented, it's not an easy thing to share. Mumsnet still isn't talking about it."She says happier stories are easier to talk about, particularly if they have a feelgood factor.But figures from St John Ambulance show that people are responding to the advert. More than 100,000 people have logged on to the charity's website to find out how to 'Save the boy' in the advert.Thousands of new followers of St John Ambulance on Facebook and Twitter suggest that the message has reached a wider audience.And a 62% rise in bookings on St John Ambulance first aid courses since the campaign aired shows that people are actually prepared to learn some new skills.So perhaps the shock tactics in the ad worked? Emma Sheppard, acting director of brand, communications and fundraising at St John Ambulance, thinks so."We don't want to be shocking for the sake of it but we've found that people have an apathy towards first aid and a powerful message is proven to get people to take action."Many people think someone who knows what to do is going to be there."Unfortunately, that's not always going to be the case and that's the point we try and get across in the advert."The thinking behind the ad, she says, is to put people in the characters' shoes and make them confront the idea that no-one could be around to help them in an emergency.Other organisations have used different tactics to get across an important message.In 2012, for instance, the British Heart Foundation used former footballer Vinnie Jones to front a campaign to educate people about hands-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), as opposed to mouth-to-mouth resuscitation which they felt was preventing bystanders from giving vital CPR in a medical emergency.The well-known face of a player with a hardman reputation showing people how to save lives made people laugh - and log on to learn more.The BHF says the advert has now been viewed nearly four million times on YouTube and the training film has clocked up three million views alone.It also says that at least 41 lives that have been saved as a result of the advert and one of those survivors featured in the second TV ad.From the evidence, it appears that both approaches to getting across an important public health message on TV work.In the end, Sue Killen of St John Ambulance says, there is no excuse for not knowing exactly how to save someone's life."It's devastating to find that over half of parents wouldn't have the first aid confidence to save their own child's life."And it's not just parents. Over 40% of people admit that it would take something as severe as the death of a loved one to make them learn first aid."</body>

      <title>India battles dengue fever outbreak</title>
      <description>How India is coping with a dengue fever epidemic</description>

      <body>An outbreak of dengue fever since February has killed more than 100 people, inundated hospitals with patients and triggered school closures, reports Atish Patel.In India, many savour the moment when the skies turn grey and monsoon rains lash down to bring respite from the excruciating summer heat.This year, the country saw the heaviest rains in nearly two decades, particularly pleasing farmers who rely on the monsoon for their living.But the rains also bring challenges, including the appearance of Aedes aegypti, a species of mosquito that spreads dengue and yellow fever.The government says 109 Indians have died from the tropical illness in the first nine months of this year and 38,179 cases have been recorded in total, more than double the number for all of 2011.Experts say this year's early and prolonged monsoon has provided more breeding grounds for disease-carrying mosquitoes, who lay their eggs in stagnant water, including pots of clean water, puddles and open sewage drains.Dengue cases usually jump during and just after the rainy season, which normally lasts from June to September, but this year it has extended until October in some Indian states.Hospitals and clinics across the country have been inundated with patients, putting a strain on emergency services, while many schools have shut as a precautionary measure."There has been a shortage of beds," said Dr Sanjay K Tandon, medical superintendent at Paras Spring Meadows Hospital, a private facility in the capital, Delhi."We have refused patients. If the critical phase for a patient is over, we explain to them that now you don't need admission, so let the other person get the advantage."Meanwhile, at Delhi's largest state-run hospital, routine surgeries were halted last week following a government order so that equipment and staff could attend to the daily rush of patients coming in for the past few weeks to be tested for the virus."Routine, planned surgeries have been deferred temporarily. But emergency operations, those that absolutely must happen, are still being done," said Dr RB Mittal, medical superintendent of Hindu Rao Hospital.The areas worst affected in India have been the southern state of Kerala - where more than 23 people have died and 7,000 people are infected - and the western state of Maharashtra - which has registered 31 deaths and 2,681 infections.The World Health Organisation says about half of the globe's population is now at risk from the infection and a study published in April in the scientific journal Nature found India had more cases of dengue than any other country in the world.All hospitals and clinics in India are meant to report every case of confirmed dengue, but many don't, with some health experts believing there isn't enough oversight.In Delhi, the official number of reported cases is 3,298. But Dr Navin Dang, who runs a medical diagnostics centre, said the real number could be 10 times higher."We have been testing for 50 to 60 patients every day over the past month and a half, and getting 20 to 25 positive results a day, so as a standalone lab, we have reported over 1,000 dengue patients," he said."The government numbers are totally underreported... to a very substantial extent. The government only picks up data from a few hospitals and labs."Dr AC Dhariwal, director of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, a government agency, admitted it was "very, very difficult to get accurate numbers".Gareth Camilo Sims, a Welsh expatriate living in Delhi, was recently diagnosed with dengue fever, also called "breakbone disease," after suffering from a headache, exhaustion, high temperature and body rashes - clear signs he had contracted the virus despite taking preventive steps."I was really careful," the 31-year-old lawyer said. "I put mosquito repellent on a few times a day and I haven't been bitten many times," he added.His blood platelet count didn't drop to dangerous levels, but when it does, it can be deadly. There is no treatment for the virus.Mr Sims said he was advised to keep hydrated by drinking six litres of water each day, take a paracetamol pill every six hours and occasionally apply a cold flannel to his forehead to reduce fever.Mr Dhariwal says surveillance is being carried out across the country and in hotspot areas, extensive education campaigns are being organised to inform the public of risks."Dengue enters a country and it stays there," he added.But some have blamed the government for not doing enough to tackle the spread of the disease despite fresh cases being reported year after year."It's a combined responsibility for everybody," Dr Dang said."But of course the government as the elected representative has to play a significant role."If proper measures are taken, there's no stagnant water, there's proper fumigation, sewage and drainpipes are cleaned properly, there is no water logging, and there are fish in water bodies, I'm quite sure things can be brought under control," he says.</body>

      <description>Can life-saving gadgets be made in garages?</description>

      <body>Archimedes did it in the bath, Tesla with a walking stick and the father of the sticky note had his flash of inspiration while singing in church - or so legend has it.Yet today we expect new inventions to be born in anonymous laboratories after the submission of several grant proposals.But the age of the home-grown inventor may not be over.David Williams and John Dingley are consultant anaesthetists at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Their moment of genius came in their garages while tinkering with glue-guns and car-body filler.Inspired by Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio, they wondered "almost jokingly" whether it might be possible to make something similarly economical and easy-to-use in the medical world.And having worked in remote settings, Dr Williams was aware of how crucial equipment that does not require a constant power source could be. In Zambia he had noticed entire operating theatres remaining unused because of a lack of replacement light bulbs or a reliable mains power supply.So the doctors set themselves the challenge of inventing essential kit for the doctor's bag on a budget.And after a week spent attacking conventional medical equipment with power tools, they had the first prototype of a device which has the potential to save lives.The ShakerScope is a light source which can be quickly adapted to look in people's eyes, ears and throats. But unlike regular devices it does not need batteries.Dr Patrick Finlay, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said: "According to the World Health Organisation, 95% of medical devices fail to work in developing countries. Often designers in the West don't understand the conditions elsewhere."This type of invention is very important. With these scopes you would normally need three different instruments for each examination, each one requiring batteries. For low income countries this is a joke. "At the core of the ShakerScope is a powerful moveable magnet, surrounded by a coil of wire.As noted by Michael Faraday in 1831, as the magnet moves over the wire the magnetic field induces an electric current in the coil. And shaking the ShakerScope for 30 seconds produces enough current to light the device for three minutes."That might not sound like long but it is more than enough time for most ear or eye examinations or to insert tracheal tubes," Dr Williams said.Once the scope is shaken the charge can be stored for many weeks. And instead of using a conventional light bulb, it uses a light emitting diode which can last up to 10,000 hours.The team has designed changeable heads allowing it be converted into a number of devices.One of its most promising uses so far has been as a laryngoscope - an instrument which lights-up the back of the mouth allowing anaesthetists to insert breathing tubes when people are unable to breathe for themselves.It has already been tested in military hospitals in Afghanistan, in Uganda and after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010."In Haiti we saw a lady with a neck injury who urgently needed a tracheal tube to help stabilise her. There were no other functioning laryngoscopes close by and the ShakerScope worked well despite the difficult case," said Dr Williams.According to Dr Williams the project has been a series of steep learning curves."Having the good idea is the easy part. Making it into a reality required an almost obsessive degree of dedication," he said.In the early days the doctors tried to do as much as possible from home - from teaching themselves microelectronics to perfecting their computer-aided design skills.Luckily for Dr Williams, his wife is a sculptor who works on large pieces of metal.He has been known to borrow her workshop, saws and glue-gun on many occasions. But he says he learned very early on that the kitchen may not be the best place to melt plastics.Dr Jerry Nolan, a consultant anaesthetist at Bath Royal United NHS Trust, who was not involved in the research said: "The ShakerScope has the potential to be invaluable in remote locations."That they have taught themselves the skills to get a final version near to market is even more remarkable and surely disproves the adage doctors make poor businessmen."The device is one of many frugal, home-grown devices recently showcased at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in the UK.Having made several fully-functioning versions tested across the world, the doctors say they recently reached the limit of their technical abilities, and passed on further manufacturing and design to a larger company.But these anaesthetists have returned to their sheds and have many other possible irons in the fire.</body>

      <title>Life after the Army overshadowed by stress</title>
      <description>How one veteran found help in dealing with post-traumatic stress</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24502068</url>

      <body>For former soldier Tom Sawyer and his partner Sue Hawkins, Tom's service in Northern Ireland and his head injury during the first Gulf War in 1991 cast a long shadow over their lives.He left the Army in 1993, but his experiences in both places haunted him in ways he felt he couldn't share with anyone."After what I'd seen in Northern Ireland, I kept it subdued but even while I was still in the Army I was turning up on parade in the morning, still drunk, my kit not pressed, and it just got worse and worse," he says. "My drinking was heavy, and helped break up two marriages."Today, his partner Sue sits supportively beside him as Tom, 48, recounts what happened after he left the armed forces.The fresh-faced young man on the military ID card that he still carries in his wallet had turned into an adult who couldn't bear crowds and could barely leave the house.He once tried talking to an NHS doctor about it but walked out when the doctor told him that he "knew exactly" what he'd been through.I ask why he didn't talk to anyone within the Army while he was still serving."It was the macho thing," he shrugs, lighting a cigarette."You keep it quiet and even in the units I served with we didn't really speak about it. Even if you'd gone to your commanding officer or family officer then they'd just tell you 'don't be stupid, there's nothing wrong with you, are you man or mouse?' At that time, I was a mouse. I couldn't speak."After several years of trying to blot out his traumatic memories with alcohol, the death of Tom's father threatened to tip him over the edge.It was then that Tom decided killing himself might be the best solution."I just couldn't put up with life," he remembers.Sue knew then that he needed urgent help."That particular night, I really thought that he was going to kill himself. I have never ever, in all the years I've known him, known him to be so down. Tom felt he was a freak and that no-one wanted to know him," Sue says, squeezing Tom's hand as she sits next to him."I just knew we had to do something or else he wouldn't be here."Their call for help was answered by a small and relatively new military mental health charity, PTSD Resolution, which put them in touch with one of its network of therapists, Joy Gilson, in Brighton.Over the past months, Tom has had five sessions with Joy in the bright and sunny room she sees clients in; the aim of the therapy is to help take away the trauma associated with his memories.Sue has also been able to sit in during the sessions and offer her support.Joy uses a method known as "human givens" and has also studied trauma-focused cognitive therapy.She explains that post-traumatic stress disorder can happen when traumatic memories are not processed properly in the brain."The memory is in the wrong place, so it's constantly live and when information is coming in, it's always flashed by this part of the brain, the fight or flight part," she says."I don't have to ask people to relive the memories; all I need to know is that there is a memory here so I can get them to reprocess the memory in a calm way."Once they've done it a few times it becomes a normal memory and they are not constantly on alert."She still remembers the day that Tom arrived for his first session."When he walked in here, he was suicidal and he said to me 'I'm terrified. This is my last shot and I'm going to kill myself if it doesn't work'," Joy tells me."Now he feels that he wants to live and although he's not as far down the road as he wants to be, he wakes up in the morning with a sense of meaning and purpose. That's a huge difference and that's after five sessions."Despite having helped former soldiers such as Tom, the charity is still fighting its own battle for official recognition of its services for veterans, while the use of human givens as a therapy is not yet publicly funded for treating PTSD by NICE, the institute for clinical excellence that evaluates therapies and drugs for the NHS.Piers Bishop is one of the founders of the charity and now a trustee."Of the 400 or so veterans that PTSD Resolution has taken in the past four years, it has worked for 80% or so of cases where people have had more than one session," he says."That might look unusually high but everything we do is documented and we keep detailed evidence of every session that takes place. The real hurdle is the expectation that trauma is hard to treat."He is in no doubt there will be a knock-on effect on the mental health of some veterans from the current military campaigns."The official figures are starting to show there is a greater chance of being traumatised by repeated deployment to conflicts."If we're going to have more people coming through with trauma, we're going to have to find more efficient ways of dealing with it that equip someone to get on with their own life under their own steam."For Tom, help came just in time."What's really helped is having Sue with me through all the sessions so I didn't have to come out and explain."Every time I come out of a session it's like a weight being taken off my shoulders. I've come back and am feeling a lot better in myself."For years I thought I was a freak, a mishap of service life, but now I know I'm not a freak - but just normal crazy," he smiles.Sue is simply relieved that many of the demons that haunted Tom are now under control."He's learning to cope with it, and it's not the PTSD in charge of him any more. I've learned a lot, and the sessions with Joy have saved his life. It's so much better now that he's not creeping around corners any more."The Ministry of Defence says it recognises mental illness, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as a serious and disabling medical condition, but one that can be treated.Assessment and treatment is available for service personnel who might be concerned about their mental health.The MoD is also running a mental health awareness campaign to encourage those serving today to come forward if they are experiencing problems.Like Tom, though, many may wait until long after they have left the forces to ask for help.</body>

      <title>Alzheimer's breakthrough: Cure or hype?</title>
      <description>How significant are reports of a turning point in Alzheimer's?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24478942</url>

      <body>If you regularly walk past a newspaper stand, then "Alzheimer's cure" or "Major Alzheimer's breakthrough" headlines will be a familiar sight. And here we are again.UK researchers have, for the first time, used a chemical to prevent the death of brain tissue in a neurodegenerative disease.The Times went with Cure for Alzheimer's "within reach" on its front page, the Independent had Scientists hail historic breakthrough in war against Alzheimer's, and my BBC News website article used the headline Alzheimer's find is "turning point".One major difference this time is that sensible, cautious scientists are suggesting the latest discovery could be one for the history books.Nearly every report contains this quote from Prof Roger Morris, at King's College London: "This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer's disease."So what is it about the latest study that generates a rare level of excitement? And is a cure really on the cards?The prime source of excitement is that a chemical has stopped the death of brain cells, in a living brain, that would have otherwise died due to a neurodegenerative disease.This is a first and a significant one. When I interviewed Prof Morris on Wednesday night, he used the word "landmark" repeatedly.In the Medical Research Council study at the University of Leicester, the mice had prion disease, similar to the human form of mad cow disease. Within eight weeks, their brains deteriorated so badly that memory and movement were noticeably affected. By the 12th week, the mice were dead.But when the same infected animals were given a "drug-like compound", they survived the 12 weeks with no sign of the brain dying. The chemical also caused side-effects including weight loss and diabetes.The second tier of excitement comes from the potential implications.The chemical helps the brain cope with producing broken proteins. In Parkinson's the alpha-synuclein protein goes wrong, in Alzheimer's it's amyloid and tau, in Huntington's it's the Huntingtin protein.The brain's response to all of these diseases is to shut down protein production, but this eventually kills brain cells. The chemical helps brain cells ignore the broken proteins, keep functioning and stay alive.In the past, research on neurodegenerative diseases has focused on what is unique to that condition. This approach looks at what is common to all of them and if it really does work, then it raises the prospect of a single drug to cure or prevent nearly all forms of neurodegeneration. Another reason for excitement.Lead researcher Prof Giovanna Mallucci said: "If it stops brain degeneration in its tracks, it will halt disease in people who have already got it. And if we can detect early disease, it will prevent a lot of degeneration."The hope is to arrest the process of brain cell death, and that's what's so exciting."It's worth emphasising the precise findings of the study - a toxic chemical, which the researchers will not even call a drug, halts the death of brain cells in mice with prion disease.Clearly this is not a cure, but it points the way to one. It gives drugs companies and scientists something to work with.That process will take time, probably more than a decade, with no guarantee of success at the end.And the recent history of medical research is littered with examples of drugs that looked promising in mice, but were a bitter disappointment when tested in people.This chemical works in a mouse brain of 75 million neurons. A more complex human brain built from 85 billion neurons is a far different challenge.Dr Simon Ridley, the head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, told the BBC patients would be facing a long wait."I'm afraid it's far longer than any of us would like," he said."I think there are many people who'd be desperate for any news of new treatments, which they would like to take today."I think at this stage we could be looking at a decade before we'll know whether this will be effective."This study is certainly exciting scientifically. But it might take until 2023 to see whether it truly deserves its place in the history books.</body>

      <title>A list for living, not a bucket list</title>
      <description>Helen Fawkes explores 50 things she wants to do before she dies</description>

      <body>Many people now make bucket lists. The BBC's Helen Fawkes explores the experiences people want before they die, and her own "list for living".What would you do if you found out that your time was limited? If you were told that you could be dead within months, you certainly had no more than five years to live?Well, that's the situation which I'm facing. On Christmas Eve last year I found out that I had incurable ovarian cancer. I felt waves of shock, sadness and anger. But I also knew that once I'd come to terms with the devastating news, I was going to make the most of the time I had left.A few days before the diagnosis, as I waited for one of many medical appointments, I thought about the things I might never do. I started to write down some of the stuff in my reporter's notebook. This was the start of my bucket list.Getting a dog, exploring the ancient ruins in Rome, taking a speed boat down the Thames, having my book published, learning to play poker and seeing penguins in the South Pole are just some of the 50 things I want to do.This has become known as a bucket list because it's all the things you want to achieve before you kick the bucket. But I don't like the term. I'd rather focus on the living, not the dying. I prefer to call it my "list for living".This cancer business is so horrific that it can easily take over your identity. Having this gives you something else to focus on and makes you feel like you again. So far I've managed to do 10 of them. I've pulled a pint in my local pub, I went to Paris with a group of friends just for lunch, modelled in a fashion show and zoomed down a zip wire. Next weekend I will present a Radio 4 programme, Pick of the Week, which will mean another big tick.But what's most important to me is right at the top of the list - move to the countryside and live in my own house. This is also what I wrote down in my notepad while I waited at hospital back in the winter. A couple of months ago I finally got my own home in a village. It needs lots of work to coax it out of the 1980s but once its done I'll be able to live there. It's an incredible feeling doing something I've wanted for years.I'm not sure I'll ever get to do everything on my bucket list but Susan Spencer-Wendel, from Florida, is someone who has. Susan is terminally ill with ALS, or motor neurone disease, an incurable condition which destroys the nerves that power her muscles.Susan realised that she had around a year left of relatively good health so she went on all the trips she wanted to with her loved ones. This included going to see the Northern Lights with her best friend and wedding dress shopping in New York with her teenage daughter - something she knew she'd never get to do for real.Susan wrote about her story in Until I say Goodbye: My Year of Living with Joy - A book she tapped out on an iPhone using just one thumb. She told me that her joy came from getting the best possible outcome from the worst of circumstances."I discovered the depth of love I have for the people around me and the depth of love they have for me. I discovered friends I never knew I had. And this lifts me each and every hour."Just like Susan, my list for living is about taking back some control. When you're told that you could die soon, many of your future plans are shattered. Life revolves around tests, treatments and trying desperately to feel well.My bucket list has given me some kind of a structure. There are no excuses anymore. You have to get on and do things rather than thinking you must do it someday. It's almost like giving pleasure a priority, in doing so you create powerful memories. I have one friend who must have spent hundreds of hours at hospital with me so it was really special to be able to do something totally unconnected with cancer and go glass-blowing.My list for living has made me realise that when I'm taking part in something I enjoy I feel so much better. It gives me a real boost. In May, I went to see Stonehenge at sunrise with a friend. As soon as I stood inside the ancient stone circle it was like my chemo fog lifted.For a magical hour, just the two of us watched night turn into day. As we left, the spell was broken. Not long afterwards I felt so chronically ill that I was barely able to walk.This was near to the end of some very toxic treatment. What helped to get me through it all was my plan to recover afterwards on a ridiculously perfect beach. It was so chilly and wet at times that I needed my coat but I had a blissful time in Cornwall. It was number five on my list so this shows you how badly I wanted the holiday. It's so vital to have something to look forward to. I may be fighting a killer disease but I still need some hope in my life.I used to be very sporty and I still crave that adrenalin rush so I picked a few things like sky diving and swimming with sharks just because they would terrify me. I haven't yet been brave enough to do those. But I have been driven very fast around a racetrack. A friend arranged for the ex-Formula 1 star David Coulthard to drive me around Silverstone. The speed was so exhilarating that I couldn't even scream to start with. It's funny how being scared to death can make you feel so alive.One of the reasons I responded to my diagnosis with a bucket list was because of a book I'd recently read, The Top Five Regrets of the Dying. Bronnie Ware looked after terminally ill people in Australia. She realised that many of them shared the same concerns. For example, they wished they hadn't worked so hard and they'd allowed themselves to be happy.When I interviewed Bronnie for my documentary she told me that one of her favourite clients was a woman called Grace. She always wanted to travel but didn't because of her husband."She was a lady who spent her life in a very unhappy, dominating marriage. Her husband went into a nursing home because he was ill. She then became terminally ill within a few weeks of gaining the freedom that she had waited 50 or 60 years for. So she actually never got to live any of those dreams and she insisted on me promising her that I would live a life true to myself," Bronnie explained.I'm glad that I don't have any big regrets. This is partly down to another bucket list that I made. Twelve years ago I was diagnosed with cancer for the very first time. While I was ill from the evil chemo cocktails I couldn't do anything but think about what I wanted to do once I was well again. I came up with a list of 10 things. Within weeks of finishing treatment I was in Moscow, pursuing my dream of becoming a BBC foreign correspondent.I'm clearly a fan of bucket lists but I understand that they're not for everyone. I wonder whether they create too much pressure to try to cram in everything? Psychotherapist Philippa Perry is worried that some people may have one for the wrong reasons."My first reaction is to think of it in terms of a shopping list. It reminds me too much of a consumer society. A shopping list of holidays and sights and sensations. It's not about being alive, it's about going through the motions."My aim is not just to have things to tick off but to be left with a whole load of special memories with the people who mean the most to me. I know that when I'm dying and I'm too sick to do anything else they will be at my bedside reminding me about our adventures.Like the time we went to Paris. How we ended up at a beautiful cocktail bar in the middle of the afternoon after a long lunch. Another customer remarked that we sounded like we were having a lot of fun and asked me what we were celebrating. After an embarrassing moment, I told her we were celebrating life.Helen's list for living: 1) Live in my own house (almost done), 2) Move to the country (almost done), 3) Get a dog, 4) Play a netball game, again, 5) Recover from chemo on a ridiculously perfect beach (done), 6) See penguins in the South Pole, 7) Go to Paris by Eurostar just for lunch (done), 8) Visit Pompeii and drive along the Amalfi coast, 9) Explore the ancient ruins in Rome, 10) Snorkel on a coral reef, 11) Trek in Nepal, 12) Go to the 2016 Olympics in Rio, 13) See the Northern Lights, 14) Ride a camel across a desert, 15) Drink a mojito in Cuba, 16) See Stonehenge at sunrise (Done), 17) Go into space, 18) Get married, 19) Get my book published, 20) Present a BBC Radio 4 programme, 21) Hold an exhibition of my cow photographs, 22) Do voluntary work, 23) Run a 5K, 24) Skydive, 25) Go gliding, 26) Ride a horse through Hyde Park, 27) Try kite surfing, 28) Zoom down a zip wire (done), 29) Surf somewhere hot, 30) Go coasteering somewhere cold, 31) Take a speed boat down the Thames, 32) Swing on a trapeze, 33) Fly in a hot air balloon, 34) Take a private jet over London, 35) Fly in a stealth airplane, 36) Be driven very fast around a race track in a sports car (done), 37) Sleep under the stars, 38) Get a tattoo, 39) Have a henna crown painted on my baldy head once the hair falls out, 40) Grow my hair long, again, 41) Be a model and work the catwalk (done), 42) Learn to play poker, 43) Pull a pint in a proper pub (done), 44) Hold a party in a castle, 45) Go glass-blowing (done), 46) See puffins in UK, 47) Swim with sharks, 48) Sail alongside a pod of dolphins at sea, 49) Catch fireflies in a jar, 50) Drink champagne in one of the best bars in the world just before Christmas to celebrate still being alive.Helen Fawkes shares her list for living on BBC World Service at 08:06 GMT (09:06 BST on) on Monday 14 OctoberFollow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Do you really need to drink eight cups of water a day?</title>
      <description>Is there any scientific basis for drinking two litres of water a day?</description>

      <body>Drinking eight cups or two litres of water a day is longstanding advice. But is there any scientific basis for it, asks Dr Chris van Tulleken.You know those ads that remind us that even a small drop in hydration levels can massively affect performance so you need to keep hydrated with whatever brand of isotonic super drink they're selling?They seem pretty scientific don't they? Man in white coat, athlete with electrodes attached and so on. And it's not a hard sell because drinking feels right - you're hot and sweating so surely replacing that fluid must be beneficial.Well earlier this year sports scientists in Australia did an extraordinary experiment that had never been done before (British Journal of Sports Medicine, September 2013, Current hydration guidelines are erroneous: dehydration does not impair exercise performance in the heat, Wall BA).This group wanted to find out what happened to performance after dehydration. So they took a group of cyclists and exercised them until they lost 3% of their total body weight in sweat.Then their performance was assessed after rehydration with either 1) nothing, 2) enough water to bring them back to 2% dehydration or 3) after full rehydration.So far nothing unusual, but the difference between this and almost every other study that's ever been done on hydration was that the cyclists were blind to how much water they got. The fluid was given intravenously without them knowing the volume.This is vital because we all, and especially athletes, have such an intimate psychological relationship with water consumption.Remarkably, there was no performance difference between those that were fully rehydrated and those that got nothing. This study was part of a growing movement to "drink to thirst" which hopes to persuade athletes not to over hydrate with the potentially fatal consequence of diluting your sodium level, causing hyponatraemia.Perhaps the result shouldn't be so surprising. Humans evolved doing intense exercise in extreme heat and dryness. We are able to tolerate losses in water relatively well whereas even slight over hydration can be far more dangerous. In simple terms, being too watery is as bad for you as being too concentrated.But what about the rest of us who aren't cycling around the desert in Western Australia?There is a very well accepted idea that we should drink about eight cups of water per day (two to three litres) in addition to our food and other drinks.We are awash with positive messages about the healing properties of water and how it will improve everything from our brains to our bowels. And we know that without it we will die in days.It's a short leap of logic to think that if a lack of water is bad for for you then hydration must be good - purifying, cleansing water washing through your organs must be beneficial, detoxifying. It surely improves your skin, helps you think, reduces your risk of kidney stones and turns your urine a lovely light, straw/champagne colour rather than the fetid orange syrup you produce at the end of a long day where you haven't had time to drink.So I've looked through the literature and I found a review article saying all of this and more. It was written by a group of respected physicians from American and French hospitals and it clearly supported the widely held belief that you should drink two to three litres of water a day.It said that people with a high urine output have a lower rate of kidney stone disease, that the flushing action of the water may reduce the risk of a urinary tract infection (especially in women after sex). Perhaps most importantly, they referenced a surprising study which showed that paradoxically an increased intake of water increased the risk of bladder cancer. But only tap water. And there's the clue.A footnote at the end of the article explained that what you thought was a scientific article in a scientific journal is in fact a supplement, sponsored by a major mineral water manufacturer. All of the authors received honoraria from this company, which also provided medical writing assistance. So this isn't research, it's marketing.And this is one of the reasons we're even discussing this - because increasingly drinking water doesn't just come out of our taps for free. It's sold to us by the same clever people that sell us yoghurts with bacteria in them that probably don't do us much good, something I look at separately in the television series I've been making. And these companies pretty consistently recommend two to three litres of water per day.So where did that number come from and is there any reason to think it correct?Well the grain of truth is this - people in temperate climates who are not doing sustained physical exercise do need around six to eight cups per day but that can be contained in food, alcohol or caffeinated beverages.Yes, beer and coffee do not dehydrate you to any noticeable extent (there's a nice paper where some medical students got to drink quite a lot of beer and had their urine studied - British Medical Journal (Clin Res Ed), December 1982, Acute biochemical responses to moderate beer drinking, Gill GV).There is no evidence that adding the eight cups of water to everything else you drink will do you any good and it could do you harm (American Journal of Physiological - Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology, November 2002, Drink at least eight glasses of water a day. Really? Is there scientific evidence for "8x8"? Valtin H).But the great thing is that just like a top-level athlete you don't need to worry about exactly what that total daily requirement is because your body will sort it all out for you.If you drink too much you pee it out. If you drink too little you get thirsty and pee less. It's all exquisitely well-controlled in the same way that your intake of oxygen is well-controlled.Saying that you should drink more water than your body asks for is like saying that you should consciously breathe more often than you feel like because if a little oxygen is good for you then more must be better.Like most things in life there's a Goldilocks amount - not too little and not too much. With this in mind, next week I'll deal with the health benefits of porridge and how to avoid being eaten by bears.Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on FacebookTrust Me I'm a Doctor is broadcast on 10 October on BBC Two at 20:00 BST, or catch up with iPlayer</body>

      <title>Banksy stall sells his art for $60</title>

      <body>Original signed canvasses by British street artist Banksy have been sold from a stall in New York's Central Park for $60 (£38) each.The elusive artist posted a video on his website showing a man selling what appeared to be fake Banksys.Many of the pieces, estimated to be worth up to £20,000 each, remained unsold at the end of the day.Banksy is in New York for a month-long residency during which he has promised a new piece of street art every day.Entitled Better Out Than In, the public art show has its own website on to which pictures and videos of the art works have been posted.The latest video was accompanied with the words, "Yesterday I set up a stall in the park selling 100% authentic original signed Banksy canvases. For $60 each."The video shows an unknown older man making his first sale mid-afternoon, to a woman who buys two small canvasses for her children after negotiating a 50% discount.Another woman from New Zealand is seen buying two of the paintings, before a man from Chicago buys four.He tells the stall holder he has recently moved house and needs something for the walls.The day's takings came to a grand total of $420 (£263).Underneath the video Banksy added: "Please note: This was a one off. The stall will not be there again today."In a recent interview conducted via email with New York publication the Village Voice, the guerilla artist - whose identity is still a secret - revealed the thinking behind his month-long trip to the city."I know street art can feel increasingly like the marketing wing of an art career, so I wanted to make some art without the price tag attached," he said."There is no gallery show or book or film. It's pointless. Which hopefully means something."Each day in October will see a new piece of either an "elaborate graffiti, large scale street sculpture, video installation or substandard performance art".So far they have included The Sirens of the Lambs, a slaughterhouse delivery truck filled with stuffed animal toys which toured the meatpacking district, and more traditional Banksy art such as a heart-shaped balloon covered in bandages on a Brooklyn wall.</body>

      <body>WH Smith has taken its UK site completely offline until all abuse-themed e-books are removed from its product listings.The move comes after last week's revelations that Amazon, WH Smith, Barnes and Noble, and other retailers were selling pornographic e-books featuring incest, rape and bestiality on their sites.WH Smith said it was "disgusted" by such titles and found them "unacceptable".It takes e-book content from Kobo.com.In a statement Kobo said it was "working quickly to review its catalogue and remove the content, authors and publishers in question"."We are also evaluating new procedures to help ensure that this type of content will not become available... in the future," it said.Meanwhile visitors to the WHSmith.co.uk website were greeted by a holding page statement.The retailer said it had taken the site offline "to best protect our customers and the public"."Our website will become live again once all self published e-books have been removed and we are totally sure that there are no offending titles available", it said."We sincerely apologise for any offence caused."While Kobo said some publishers and authors had violated its self-publishing policies, it maintained that its goal was "not to negatively impact the freedom of expression and the work of the amazing self-published community that has been created at Kobo.com."Over the weekend US retailing giant Barnes and Noble said offending titles were "in violation" of its policy on content offered in the NOOK Bookstore and were in the process of being removed."When there are violations to the content policy that are brought to our attention, either through our internal process or from a customer or external source, we have a rapid response team in place to appropriately categorise or remove the content in accordance with our policy," it said.Self-published e-books have grown massively in popularity along with the growth in digital e-readers and tablet computers, but retailers have been struggling to filter explicit content that breaches their website guidelines.On Friday, technology news site The Kernel revealed how Amazon, Barnes and Noble, WH Smith, Waterstones and Foyles were listing what it called "breathtakingly obscene" books on their websites.But Fiona Allen, spokeswoman for Waterstones, told the BBC: "None of the e-books mentioned in current reporting are now or ever have been available in Waterstones shops or listed on Waterstones' website."She admitted that Waterstones was concerned about some print titles and was investigating those, but that all such printed book data was supplied by Nielsen, a data provider.</body>

      <body>Astronaut thriller Gravity has kept its grip on the North American box office for a second consecutive weekend.The outer space drama starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney took $44.3m (£27.7m) according to early estimates.It easily beat Tom Hanks' latest film, Captain Phillips, which took $26m (£16.3m).The movie tells the true story of the cargo ship captain who was taken hostage by Somali pirates after his ship was hijacked in 2009.Both films have earned critical acclaim with both Bullock and Hanks tipped as likely Oscar contenders.Gravity's successful second week haul brings its total US domestic takings to $123.4m (£77.2m)."They say what goes up must come down, but that's not really true with Gravity," box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian said."To have opened as big as it did last week and only drop 21% [in revenue], that's really an amazing hold. It's a direct testament to the word of mouth on the movie."Animated sequel Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs 2 was at three in its third week of release with $14.2m (£8.9m).The weekend's only other new release, Machete Kills, opened in fourth place with $3.8m (£2.4m).The gun-toting sequel from director Robert Rodriguez and starring Danny Trejo and Michelle Rodriguez is the follow-up to Machete, which earned $11.4m (£7.1m) when it opened in 2010.Runner Runner, starring Ben Affleck and Justin Timberlake, fell two places to five with $3.7m (£2.3m)</body>

      <body>Acclaimed film-maker Ethan Coen has revealed that some of his stage plays might be heading to the UK for the first time.Coen is best known for his movie-making partnership with brother Joel on films such as Fargo, The Big Lebowski and True Grit.But he also has what he describes as a "part-time" career as a playwright.His first full-length stage play, Women or Nothing, has just ended an off-Broadway run in New York.Speaking to the BBC while promoting the Coen Brothers' new film Inside Llewyn Davis at the London Film Festival, Coen said there had been talks about bringing some of his earlier works to the capital."There's nothing definite, but hopefully the first bunch of one-act plays I did with Neil Pepe [artistic director] at the Atlantic Theater Company might be coming here."Almost an Evening, comprising three of Coen's short plays, was staged by Atlantic in New York in 2008. Two other productions of short plays, Offices and Happy Hour, followed.In 2011, Coen's one-act play Talking Cure, along with plays by Woody Allen and Elaine May, appeared on Broadway under the title Relatively Speaking, staged by John Turturro.Speaking to the Associated Press earlier this year, Coen said the reason he began writing plays was a mystery, even to him."I don't know why. You know, it's kind of like doing movies. You see a movie and you go, 'OK, I can try one of those. Maybe I could do that.' It's the same impulse: that would be fun."He added: "It's recreational. It's part-time. I'm a play hobbyist. I'm a gentleman playwright."His debut full-length play, Women or Nothing, had its world premiere at the Linda Gross Theater in August and was extended to 13 October.It tells the story of a lesbian couple and the lengths they go to to have a child without going to a sperm bank.On his future plans as a playwright, Coen told the BBC: "I plan to keep doing it, but I don't know know what the next one will be."The Coen Brothers' Inside Llewyn Davis, which tells the story of a hapless singer-songwriter on the 1960s New York folk music scene, will be out in the UK in January 2014.Joel and Ethan Coen are also executive producing a 10-part television adaptation of Fargo, their Oscar-winning 1996 film, which will star Martin Freeman and Billy Bob Thornton.</body>

      <body>Hollywood actor Hugh Jackman has raised $1.85m (£1.16m) at a charity benefit he held on his birthday in Hollywood.Some 4,500 guests attended the star's One Night Only show at the Dolby Theatre on Saturday.Backed by a 17-member orchestra, the show saw the Les Miserables star sing, dance and tell stories.The evening ended with Jackman auctioning off an electric car, a pair of Wolverine claws and two sweaty vests he wore on the night.The undershirts eventually sold to two lucky bidders for $11,000 (£7,000) each.Stars including Tom Cruise, Cybill Shepherd and director Bryan Singer were among those who paid to attend Jackman's 45th birthday performance."This is probably the most narcissistic way to spend your birthday," the actor said after the show. "I chose my favourite songs and told stories about my life."The show was a variation of Jackman's recent Broadway show, with personal stories, a few film clips and selections from classic Hollywood musicals - with the star performing a tap-dancing routine to Singin' in the Rain.He also talked about his family, sang a tribute to his wife and shared music and images of his native Australia.All the money raised will be donated to the Motion Picture and Television Fund, the entertainment industry charity which provides health care, financial aid and retirement accommodation.Jackman said he chose the charity because it offered "that unconditional helping hand you get in a family"."To be here tonight, supporting this cause - and it couldn't have been a more generous crowd if it tried - in every way it was great."</body>

      <title>Eating popcorn 'disrupts adverts'</title>
      <description>Cinema advertising is rendered ineffective when audiences chew sweets or popcorn, a study from Cologne University claims.</description>

      <body>Cinema advertising is less effective when audiences eat popcorn, according to a study from Cologne University.Researchers found that viewers remember brands by simulating the pronunciation of a new name with their mouths.But this "inner speech" can be disturbed by chewing, rendering adverts redundant, said the research, published in the Journal of Consumer Psychology.It contrasts with previous studies, which suggested chewing gum could aid memory.There is some evidence that the act of chewing gum improves blood flow to the brain, and can make you more alert over long periods of sustained concentration.However, researchers from Cardiff University reported last year that people's ability to recall lists in a specific order is impaired by chewing gum.To investigate the effects of popcorn on memory, researchers at Cologne University invited 96 people to a cinema to watch a movie, preceded by a sequence of adverts.Half of the group was given popcorn, which was replenished throughout the screening, while the rest received a small sugar cube.They were shown genuine commercials for existing products which were, crucially, unfamiliar to the German participants - for example, for the Scandinavian butter Lurpak.A week later, the participants were invited to a laboratory and asked to rate a series of products, including some of those which had been advertised.The sugar cube group displayed preferences for the advertised products, but the popcorn munchers did not.In a second study, 188 people were shown adverts in similar circumstances, then given money to donate to charity.Again, the sugar cube sample tended to give money to charities that had been advertised in the cinema, but the participants who had been eating during the screening showed no such preference."The mundane activity of eating popcorn made participants immune to the pervasive effects of advertising," said Sascha Topolinski, one of the researchers.The study posits that repetition of brand names is essential in imprinting them in our consciousness"Particularly for novel brands, excessive exposure and repetition is necessary to establish the brand name in the first place," wrote the authors."Remember your initial irritation upon encountering the names Yahoo, Google and Wikipedia for the first time; now they are imprinted in your brain."Mr Topolinski goes so far as to suggest that advertisers may try to boycott popcorn."This finding suggests that selling candy in movie theatres actually undermines advertising effects, which contradicts present marketing strategies."In the future, when promoting a novel brand, advertising clients might consider trying to prevent candy being sold before the main movie."Cinema-owners may not be so keen, though. On average, popcorn is sold at a 900% mark-up, according to economics professor Richard McKenzie at University of California - Irvine.</body>

      <title>NHS Savile abuse probe widened</title>
      <description>The probe into Jimmy Savile's abuse of NHS patients has been extended to include more hospitals, says the health secretary.</description>

      <body>The investigation into Jimmy Savile's alleged abuse of patients at NHS hospitals has been extended to other hospitals, the health secretary says.The inquiry, currently focused on Broadmoor, Stoke Mandeville and Leeds General hospitals, as well as a further 10 trusts, will be expanded to include "other hospitals", Jeremy Hunt said.The hospitals were not named. A final report will be published in 2014.The late DJ is believed to have abused hundreds of victims.The former BBC presenter of Top Of The Pops and Jim'll Fix It, who also worked as a Radio 1 DJ and received a knighthood in 1990, died aged 84 in October 2011 - a year before the allegations were broadcast in an ITV documentary.Revelations that the famed fundraiser had sexually abused children prompted hundreds of victims to come forward, including those who said they were attacked on BBC premises and at a number of other institutions.Savile had a bedroom at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, an office and living quarters at Broadmoor, and widespread access to Leeds General Infirmary.Mr Hunt said: "It is vital that the final NHS investigation report is thorough and complete and reflects all the evidence about Jimmy Savile's pattern of offending."A Scotland Yard investigation into Savile's alleged crimes - one of three strands of Operation Yewtree - is due to report in the new year.The BBC understands it will put the number of alleged victims at over 500.The Department of Health investigation into the three hospitals is being overseen by barrister - and former deputy chairman of the Financial Ombudsman Service - Kate Lampard.In a written ministerial statement, Mr Hunt said: "The Metropolitan Police Service, working with Kate Lampard, has established there was further relevant information regarding Jimmy Savile."The Department of Health asked the Metropolitan Police Service, through an agreed information sharing process, to review information it held to ascertain if it included material related to health and care settings."The revelations about Savile have led to a number of inquiries.Firstly, the police investigation, Operation Yewtree, which has three strands.One is looking specifically at the actions of Savile, and the second strand concerns allegations against "Savile and others".The third strand relates to complaints against other people unconnected to the Savile investigations, made by people who came forward after widespread coverage of the scandal.The BBC has also launched three reviews, including the Pollard Review, which has already reported the findings of its investigation into the dropping of a Newsnight report into claims Savile was a paedophile; and a review by Dame Janet Smith into culture and practices during Savile's career and current policies.The director of public prosecutions is also reviewing decisions not to prosecute Savile in 2009.</body>

      <body>American pop singer Miley Cyrus has become the first artist this year to top both the UK album and singles charts in the same week.Wrecking Ball beat Eminem's Berzerk to the top spot of the singles chart.Meanwhile, Cyrus's album Bangerz also beat Chase and Status' Brand New Machine into second place.The last act to achieve the chart double was Olly Murs, with his single Troublemaker and album Right Place, Right Time, last December."I truly appreciate the love I'm getting from the UK," the singer said.

      <body>Gary Barlow has confirmed he will leave X Factor at the end of the current series.He had previously denied rumours he had made a decision to quit the ITV show.But speaking on Saturday night's show he told his group Rough Copy: "I've been here for three years and I'm so glad that for my last year on the show I get to mentor you guys."The Take That frontman will release his first solo album for 14 years in November.Rumours had started circulating about his departure in August, after host Dermot O'Leary said the singer would leave the programme when the present series, the 10th, ended.But speaking at the launch of the series itself at the end of that month, he said he had not made his mind up yet."In all honesty, I honestly don't know, it's too early," he said."Ask me about two weeks into the live shows and I'll give you an answer on that. But it's far too early."As well as his solo album Barlow has also been working on the score for the stage version of Finding Neverland and a new Take That album, to be released next year.There is speculation that Simon Cowell could return to the show to replace him as a judge.Speaking at the series launch he hinted he might return to The X Factor as a guest judge this year.The singing show has suffered falling ratings since Cowell left two years ago, although he has remained hands-on behind the scenes.But when asked about the possibility of his return in 2013, he told the BBC: "I wouldn't rule it out."The ratings for Saturday's first live show were more than one million viewers down on the first live show last year.It had an average of 8.1 million viewers and peaked at 9.5 million.The same episode last year was watched by 9.2 million, with a peak of 10.3 million.It left the show 1.7 million viewers behind the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing - also broadcast on Saturday evening - which had its highest audience of the series with 9.8 million viewers and a peak audience of 10.9 million.</body>

      <body>British actor Charlie Hunnam has pulled out of the film adaptation of the erotic bestseller 50 Shades of Grey.It was announced in September that The Sons of Anarchy actor would play billionaire Christian Grey.Universal Pictures said his departure was a mutual decision due to a scheduling problem with Hunnam's TV commitments.The book's author EL James tweeted her best wishes to the actor.Artist and film-maker Sam Taylor-Johnson will direct the movie version of James' novel, scheduled for release in August 2014.Published in 2011, Fifty Shades of Grey follows the sexually-charged relationship between billionaire Grey and college student Anastasia Steele.US actress Dakota Johnson will play Anastasia and Jennifer Ehle has been cast as her mother.The novel and its two sequels, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed, have become a literary phenomenon that earned James, 50, a reported $95m (£61.5m) last year.There had been intense speculation over who would win the coveted lead roles in the film adaptation.Since winning the role there have been reports that Hunnam had been overwhelmed by the attention and had got cold feet.But the statement from Universal Pictures said his departure was due to "Hunnam's immersive TV schedule which is not allowing him time to adequately prepare for the role of Christian Grey."Matt Bomer, Cilian Murphy, Ian Somerhalder and Alexander Skarsgard are among the actors being tipped as Hunnam's replacement.</body>

      <body>A valuable bronze sculpture by Henry Moore has been stolen from a park in south west Scotland.Standing Figure was one of four pieces by Moore at the Glenkiln Sculpture Park in Lincluden Estate near Shawhead.Police Scotland said the sculpture was of "high value" and have appealed for witnesses to contact them.Standing Figure is among a string of works by the abstract artist, who died in 1986 aged 88, to be targeted by thieves in recent years.Last November, a Henry Moore sculpture worth up to £500,000 was taken from the Henry Moore Foundation at Much Hadham, Hertfordshire.Two men later admitted stealing The Sundial sculpture, which they then sold for £46.The Glenkiln sculpture park was created by local landowner Sir William Keswick between 1951 and 1976.Sir William bought Standing Figure after seeing it in an exhibition, and Moore was personally "thrilled" with the artwork's open air location.Moore said of the project: "I don't know whether he got the idea to put sculpture on his sheep farm after he saw the Battersea Park open-air exhibition, or whether he was inspired by his experiences in China, where he had lived for many years, and where, he said, there are many examples of monumental sculptures in the open air."In any case, he bought this piece to put on his farm in Scotland. He placed the sculpture himself on an existing outcrop of rock."Later I went up there and was thrilled with the beautiful landscape and at how well he had sited 'Yon Figure'."</body>

      <description>A proposed royal charter on newspaper regulation risks a free press, the Society of Editors warns, but a senior Labour MP says they have nothing to fear.</description>

      <body>Press freedom is being put at risk by the government's proposed royal charter on newspaper regulation, the head of the Society of Editors has warned.Bob Satchwell said issues with the charter meant "you wouldn't have a free press any longer".Shadow culture secretary Harriet Harman said newspapers had nothing to fear from the all-party draft charter.Independent self-regulation is to be brought in after recommendations by the Leveson Inquiry.Mr Satchwell, executive director of the Society of Editors, which draws its members from across the press and TV industry, told the BBC there were "key problems" with the charter.He said: "You can't have a new system of regulation which is drawn up by and imposed by politicians."The things which are being proposed at the moment would be totally unconstitutional in the US and other countries."People in other countries, not just journalists, are looking at what's going on here at the moment with horror."Ms Harman - who said the "last thing" the government wanted was a situation "where politicians control the press" - urged newspapers to "try out" the proposed system."It's quite ironic because a system that's quite like this operates in Ireland and applies to our UK press for their Irish editions - they sign up to it and it hasn't caused any problems of politicians controlling the press."The Industry Steering Group, which represents national, regional and local newspaper publishers, said it would "closely study" the proposals.However, it said it was "impossible" to see that a regulator "imposed and controlled by politicians" would be "voluntary or independent"."This remains a charter written by politicians, imposed by politicians and controlled by politicians," it said in a statement.Many in the press are keen to get their own regulator set up as soon as possible.Daily Mail editor-in-chief Paul Dacre said the row between Ed Miliband and his newspaper over an article about the Labour leader's late father showed why politicians should not be involved in press regulation.Mr Dacre also claimed the "hysteria" which followed Geoffrey Levy's article was "symptomatic of the post-Leveson age".In an article published in the Guardian and in his own paper, he said: "Some have argued that last week's brouhaha shows the need for statutory press regulation. I would argue the opposite."The febrile heat, hatred, irrationality and prejudice provoked by last week's row reveals why politicians must not be allowed anywhere near press regulation."Media lawyer Mark Lewis, who represented some of the victims of phone hacking, said newspapers had "failed completely with self-regulation and now they're telling the public this is statutory regulation, this is control over what's in the paper"."It's nothing like that at all," he added.Former News of the World executive editor Neil Wallis told the BBC there was no chance of the charter being implemented.He said: "The idea that politicians can have any say in any way in the running of a free press is simply laughable."He added there had already been a "chilling effect" on the press following the Leveson Inquiry.Cross-party political agreement on regulation comes after months of wrangling since Sir Brian Leveson published his report into press ethics and practices.The Leveson Inquiry was set up amid public and political anger at the extent of phone hacking by journalists, first exposed when it emerged that the now-closed News of the World had accessed the voicemail messages of murdered teenager Milly Dowler.The all-party draft proposals include plans for:The all-party charter states that changes to regulation could be made only with a two-thirds majority in Parliament.Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the deal would safeguard the freedom of the press and the future of local newspapers.Hacked Off, which campaigns on behalf of victims of press intrusion, said changes to the draft proposals meant there was no reason for the press to refuse to back the charter.The proposals will be put to the Privy Council for final agreement on 30 October.</body>

      <body>Canadian author Alice Munro has won the 2013 Nobel Prize for Literature.Making the announcement, Peter Englund, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, called her a "master of the contemporary short story".The 82-year-old, whose books include Dear Life and Dance of the Happy Shades, is only the 13th woman to win the prize since its inception in 1901."I knew I was in the running, yes, but I never thought I would win," Munro told Canadian media.Presented by the Nobel Foundation, the award - which is presented to a living writer - is worth eight million kronor (£770,000).Previous winners include literary giants such as Rudyard Kipling, Toni Morrison and Ernest Hemingway.Mr Englund told The Associated Press that he had not been able to contact Munro ahead of the announcement so left a message on her answering machine, informing her of her win."She has taken an art form, the short story, which has tended to come a little bit in the shadow behind the novel, and she has cultivated it almost to perfection,'' he added.Munro, who began writing in her teenage years, published her first story, The Dimensions of a Shadow, in 1950.She had been studying English at the University of Western Ontario at the time.Dance of the Happy Shades, published in 1968, was Munro's first collection, and it went on to win Canada's highest literary prize, the Governor General's Award.In 2009, she won the Man Booker International Prize for her entire body of work - but she downplayed her achievements."I think maybe I was successful in doing this because I didn't have any other talents," she once said in an interview with Book Lounge.BBC Arts Editor Will Gompertz said Munro had been "at the very top of her game since she started"."Very few writers are her equal," he said, adding "she gets to the heart of what it is to be human"."I thought she might not win because she's not overtly political; and of late the Nobel has tended to go to political writers."The award "probably won't make a commercial difference" to the author, he added, but it "makes a huge difference to how her work will be viewed in historical terms"."If she hadn't won it before she died, I think it would have been a terrible, terrible omission."Often compared to Anton Chekhov, she is known for writing about the human spirit and a regular theme of her work is the dilemma faced by young girls growing up and coming to terms with living in a small town.The Nobel academy praised her "finely tuned storytelling, which is characterised by clarity and psychological realism".Munro, whose daughter woke her to tell her she had won the Nobel, said she was "terribly surprised" and "delighted".Speaking to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), she said she always viewed her chances of winning as "one of those pipe dreams" that "might happen, but it probably wouldn't"."It's the middle of the night here and I had forgotten about it all, of course," she added.Since the 1960s, Munro has published more than a dozen collections of short stories, many of which take place in her native southwest Ontario.Her writing has brought her several awards. She won The Commonwealth Writers' Prize, the National Book Critics Circle prize for Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage, and is a three-time winner of the Governor General's prize.Other notable books include Lives of Girls and Women, Who Do You Think You Are, The Progress of Love and Runaway.In 1980, The Beggar Maid was shortlisted for the annual Booker Prize for Fiction and her stories frequently appear in publications such as the New Yorker and the Paris Review.Several of her stories have also been adapted for the screen, including The Bear Came Over the Mountain, which became Away from Her, starring Julie Christie and Gordon Pinsent.Munro revealed earlier this year that her latest book, Dear Life, published in 2012, would be her last."Perhaps, when you're my age, you don't wish to be alone as much as a writer has to be," she told Canada's National Post.In 2009, Munro revealed she had been receiving treatment for cancer. She also had bypass surgery for a heart condition.Notoriously publicity-shy, Munro shies away from public events.According to American literary critic David Homel: "She is not a socialite. She is actually rarely seen in public, and does not go on book tours.Munro will be presented with her latest award at a formal ceremony in Stockholm on 10 December, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, who established the prize.Last year's recipient was Chinese novelist Mo Yan.</body>

      <title>Fellowes Bard views 'misguided'</title>
      <description>Shakespeare's Globe Theatre has called Julian Fellowes' comments about needing a "Shakespearian scholarship" to understand the Bard's work "misguided".</description>

      <body>Shakespeare's Globe Theatre has called Julian Fellowes' comments about needing a "Shakespearian scholarship" to understand the Bard's work "misguided".The Downton Abbey creator said he adapted the language in his version of Romeo and Juliet to make it accessible.But Fiona Banks from Globe Education said no one should feel excluded from Shakespeare's original prose because of their level of education."Shakespeare's for everybody. We can all understand him," she said.Fellowes, who won a best screenplay Oscar in 2002 for Gosford Park, had been criticised by Shakespeare experts for rewriting certain passages and altering the language used in the Bard's work for his film.However he told the BBC earlier this week the film was never intended to be a straight adaptation of Shakespeare's original play."When people say we should have filmed the original, I don't attack them for that point of view, but to see the original in its absolutely unchanged form, you require a kind of Shakespearian scholarship and you need to understand the language and analyse it and so on," he said."I can do that because I had a very expensive education, I went to Cambridge. Not everyone did that and there are plenty of perfectly intelligent people out there who have not been trained in Shakespeare's language choices."Ms Banks, who is a senior education advisor at the Globe, told the BBC Fellowes' comments were "misguided"."To see Shakespeare in the original, in its absolutely unchanged form, we need nothing more than a performance space and a company of actors who are able to share his stories in a way that engages their audience," she said."Shakespeare's for everybody. If we've ever been in love, or fallen out with a friend or been jealous, we can understand him."Ms Banks added one of the reasons Shakespeare's plays were read so widely was because they dealt with fundamental human issues that affect everyone."Romeo and Juliet is a prime example of that," she said.Much of the work carried out by Shakespeare's Globe involves introducing young people to Shakespeare and his classic plays.Last year, the Globe ran a drama project which introduced the playwright to children as young as three."When I produce a piece of theatre for young people it is really important they feel Shakespeare is something they have a right to and can access, and could be - if they wanted - something they could return to throughout their lives," Ms Banks said."It would be very worrying if anyone read [Fellowes' comments] and felt excluded from Shakespeare's original language because of their level of education.She added Fellowes was a "brilliant" screenwriter and said adaptations had an important role to play in the contemporary production of literary texts."They have the potential to help us re-imagine and re-discover a wealth of wonderful literature. But they are not a prerequisite for their enjoyment by the non-Oxbridge educated members of the population," she said.</body>

      <body>The film based on Nelson Mandela's autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom, has been chosen for this year's Royal Film Performance.Luther's Idris Elba plays Mandela in the biopic, which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival last month.The film tells of the former South African President's rural upbringing and the 27 years he spent in prison.Organisers of the performance said they were "thrilled" to be able to host the royal premiere on 5 December.Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom is directed by Justin Chadwick and stars British actress Naomie Harris as Mandela's second wife Winnie.It charts Mandela's early life as a lawyer, his political activism and the 27 years of imprisonment that preceded his democratic election in 1994.Early scenes in the film show him as a womaniser who was violent to his first wife Evelyn.Speaking in Toronto in September, Elba said the film shows "both sides" of Mandela's character - "the good and the bad".The internationally revered anti-apartheid campaigner, now 95, was released from hospital in September after three months of treatment for a recurring lung infection.Barry Jenkins, the president of the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund, said: "We are thrilled to be able to host the Royal Premiere of this momentous South African/British co-production."She said the fund was "most grateful to the Royal Family for their continued support" of the charity.The Royal Film Performance is the main fundraiser for the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund (CTBF), the trade charity for the UK film and television industries.It provides care and financial help for industry employees and their families who suffer from hardship due to bereavement, illness, redundancy or other misfortunes.The film will be released in UK cinemas on 3 January, 2014.</body>

      <body>Julian Assange refused to meet Benedict Cumberbatch while he was preparing to play the WikiLeaks founder on film, a leaked email has revealed.In the letter, sent in January, Assange described Cumberbatch's film, The Fifth Estate, as "toxic" and "distorted".He also urged the actor: "Reconsider your involvement in this enterprise".The Australian whistle-blower has been living at the Ecuadorean embassy in London after claiming asylum a year ago to avoid extradition to Sweden.Released by Wikileaks, his email was written in response to the actor's request for a meeting, something Assange called "a bad idea"."By meeting with you I would validate this wretched film," he wrote."I cannot permit this film any claim to authenticity or truthfulness. In its current form it has neither, and doing so would only further aid the campaign against me."The Fifth Estate received a standing ovation at its world premiere during the Toronto Film Festival last month and is released this Friday 11 October in the UK and in the US next week.It has received mixed reviews from critics, although they have been favourable towards Cumberbatch's performance.Assange did praise Cumberbatch's previous work and said the two would "forever be correlated in the public imagination"."I believe you are a good person, but I do not believe that this film is a good film," said Assange"It is based on a deceitful book by someone who has a vendetta against me and my organisation."The film draws on a memoir by former WikiLeaks spokesman Daniel Domscheit-Berg, Inside WikiLeaks: My Time with Julian Assange and the World's Most Dangerous Website.It also uses material from WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy, by British journalists David Leigh and Luke Harding.Assange continued: "Feature films are the most powerful and insidious shapers of public perception, because they fly under the radar of conscious exclusion. This film is going to bury good people doing good work, at exactly the time that the state is coming down on their heads."It is going to smother the truthful version of events, at a time when the truth is most in demand."As justification it will claim to be fiction, but it is not fiction. It is distorted truth about living people doing battle with titanic opponents. It is a work of political opportunism, revenge and, above all, cowardice."The email was published in full on a number of websites including Variety.In comments accompanying the release of the letter, Assange said the DreamWorks film, directed by Bill Condon, was "a geriatric snoozefest that only the US government could love."WikiLeaks angered the United States in 2010 by publishing hundreds of thousands of classified documents on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and US diplomatic cables.In June 2012, Assange walked into the Ecuadorean embassy in London when his appeal against extradition to Sweden, for questioning on accusations of sex crimes, was turned down.He denies the allegations and claims they are politically motivated, but Britain refuses to grant him safe passage out of the country, leaving him stuck inside the embassy.In January's email Assange warned Cumberbatch: "You will be used, as a hired gun, to assume the appearance of the truth in order to assassinate it. To present me as someone morally compromised and to place me in a falsified history. To create a work, not of fiction, but of debased truth.""Not because you want to, of course you don't, but because, in the end, you are a jobbing actor who gets paid to follow the script, no matter how debauched."Cumberbatch revealed last month that he had considered quitting the movie after receiving the email, which he called a "considered, thorough, charming and intelligent account" of why he should not take part.</body>

      <body>Rapper Coolio has surprised a group of students by cooking them a meal and performing in their front room.The impromptu performance of his 1995 hit Gangsta's Paradise came after the students met the American star at a gig in Preston.Before performing, he prepared a three-course meal after taking the students to a supermarket to buy ingredients.A film of the performance made by one of the students has received around one million views on YouTube.Fashion student Olivia Johnson-Aley, from Liverpool said it was "such a crazy and surreal moment, I had to film it"."It is amazing how many people have already watched it," she said. "We have been getting calls from media in the UK and America ever since."The 50-year-old hip-hop star had been performing at Macs Bar in Preston when he met the students and offered to cook them a meal.Law student Melissa Bryan, 21, from the Isle of Man said the rapper said he would "cook for us and he was true to his word".She said his "delicious" menu comprised of Coolio's Caprese Salad, Chicken á la Daaaamn, and Peach Crumble.Miss Bryan said that the food was "great and the sing-along was even better"."I was three when Gangsta's Paradise was released but it is a classic."We all knew the words off by heart. Every student does."Coolio, who has sold more than 17 million albums worldwide, has sold more than six million copies of Gangsta's Paradise since its release.Lorcan O'Mahony, who accompanied the rapper on his guitar, said he had "conveniently left" it in the room when he heard the rapper was coming to the house."After dinner, I asked if he would perform Gangsta's Paradise and we all got involved."It is something I will never forget."He added that he had "only learnt the chords a few hours earlier".The rapper eventually left the house at 03:00 BST to catch a flight.</body>

His loved ones are in our thoughts."</body>

      <title>BBC denies bias over Miliband story</title>
      <description>The BBC "completely rejects" the Daily Mail's editor argument that its coverage of the paper's article on Labour leader Ed Miliband's father was "one-sided".</description>

      <body>The BBC "completely rejects" a claim by the Daily Mail's editor that coverage of the paper's article on Labour leader Ed Miliband's father was "one-sided".Paul Dacre has defended his paper over the piece which called Ralph Miliband "the man who hated Britain".He accused the BBC and left-wing commentators of conducting "a full-scale war" against the paper, adding: "Impartiality flew out of the window."The BBC said it "ensured both sides had the chance to express their views".Mr Miliband said he was appalled at the piece about his father - a Marxist academic who died in 1994.After the article appeared, the Mail published a 1,000-word response from the Labour leader in which he said his father, a Jewish refugee who fled Belgium aged 16 to escape the Nazis, "loved" Britain and served in the Navy.Writing in the Guardian and the Mail, Mr Dacre said Mr Miliband's speech to the Labour Party conference on 24 September had prompted the piece.He said the paper was "deeply concerned that in 2013, after all the failures of socialism in the 20th Century, the leader of the Labour Party was announcing its return, complete with land seizures and price fixing".The paper therefore reasoned that "the public had the right to know what influence the Labour leader's Marxist father, to whom he constantly referred in his speeches, had on his thinking", he wrote."The picture that emerged was of a man who gave unqualified support to Russian totalitarianism until the mid-50s, who loathed the market economy, was in favour of a workers' revolution, denigrated British traditions and institutions such as the Royal Family, the Church and the Army and was overtly dismissive of western democracy."Mr Dacre said the headline was "controversial" but "justifiable" when read in conjunction with the article, which he said showed Ralph Miliband was "committed to smashing the institutions that make Britain distinctively British",In his piece on Saturday, Mr Dacre said the "hysteria" that followed the original piece was "symptomatic of the post-Leveson age", and accused the BBC of "leading the charge"."Fair-minded readers will decide themselves whether the hundreds of hours of airtime it devoted to that headline reveal a disturbing lack of journalistic proportionality and impartiality - but certainly the one-sided tone in their reporting allowed Labour to misrepresent Geoffrey Levy's article on Ralph Miliband."Former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell was one of the most vocal critics of the piece, but Mr Dacre attacked the BBC's decision to allow him a platform to speak."But the BBC's blood lust was certainly up. Impartiality flew out of the window. Ancient feuds were settled. Not to put too fine a point on things, we were right royally turned over," Mr Dacre wrote.The BBC said in a statement: "We completely reject any suggestion that our reporting has been biased. We followed the story as it unfolded and ensured both sides had the chance to express their views."As a public broadcaster, we have a responsibility to report the news without fear or favour, providing balanced information and independent analysis, allowing our audiences to make up their own minds."The Daily Mail has refused to apologise for its article, although its sister paper the Mail on Sunday did say sorry after two of its journalists went to a memorial service for the Labour leader's late uncle at which they pressed the family for reaction to the original Daily Mail article.</body>

      <body>Hit US TV series Glee has paid tribute to cast member Cory Monteith, who died in July, in a special episode entitled The Quarterback.Monteith, who died of a drug overdose, played high school football star Finn.Set three weeks after Finn's funeral, the show made no mention of the character's cause of death, but focused on how his friends cope with the grief.Kevin Fallon, writing in The Daily Beast, called it "classy, cathartic, heartbreaking, and a gorgeous homage"."Endless credit... is due to the team that orchestrated The Quarterback, because admirable restraint was shown in not milking a cautionary tale out of Monteith's unhappily ever after," he wrote.But the Washington Post's Hank Stuever disagreed: "It was disappointing to see them [the writers] set aside one of Glee's lasting attributes - cold honesty - as it awkwardly and even sanguinely avoided revealing how Monteith's character died."It came across as a bizarre absence of basic plot in a show that built its reputation on deftly locating comedy in the most uncomfortable personal details."The episode showed characters including Kurt, Puck, Santana and Sue Sylvester dealing with their grief in a variety of ways - although Quinn - a previous onscreen girlfriend, was notably absent."Perhaps it is best to think of Thursday's broadcast as a labour of love, and to presume it worked best for those who are most devoted to the show and its often heady blend of musical flash, after-school-special preachiness and high-and-low humour," wrote Robert Bianco in USA Today."It's almost impossible to do a story about the death of a teenager that doesn't induce tears, particularly when the plot is tied into the real-life loss of a well-liked young actor. One just wishes the writers had put a bit more trust into that natural response, and not tugged at our heartstrings quite so strenuously," he continued.The final act saw Monteith's real-life fiancee, and onscreen girlfriend, Lea Michele, perform Make You Feel My Love, which Fallon called "a testament to her own strength".Monteith had been on the show - about a group of high school misfits who form a singing club - since it began in 2009. The Emmy award-winning show is now it its fifth seriesThe Canadian actor, 31, was found dead in a Vancouver hotel room.Last week, a coroner's report concluded that he had died of a fatal cocktail of heroin and alcohol. Monteith had previously talked frankly about struggling with addiction since he was a teenager.</body>

      <body>Iceland is experiencing a book boom. This island nation of just over 300,000 people has more writers, more books published and more books read, per head, than anywhere else in the world.It is hard to avoid writers in Reykjavik. There is a phrase in Icelandic, "ad ganga med bok I maganum", everyone gives birth to a book. Literally, everyone "has a book in their stomach". One in 10 Icelanders will publish one."Does it get rather competitive?" I ask the young novelist, Kristin Eirikskdottir. "Yes. Especially as I live with my mother and partner, who are also full-time writers. But we try to publish in alternate years so we do not compete too much."Special saga tours - saga as in story, that is, not over-50s holidays - show us story-plaques on public buildings.Dating from the 13th Century, Icelandic sagas tell the stories of the country's Norse settlers, who began to arrive on the island in the late 9th Century.Sagas are written on napkins and coffee cups. Each geyser and waterfall we visit has a tale of ancient heroes and heroines attached. Our guide stands up mid-tour to recite his own poetry - our taxi driver's father and grandfather write biographies.Public benches have barcodes so you listen to a story on your smartphone as you sit.Reykjavik is rocking with writers. It is book festival time. Man Booker Prize winner Kiran Desai and Generation X author Douglas Coupland rub shoulders with Icelandic literary superstars Gerdur Kristny and Sjon. Sjon also pens lyrics for Bjork, Iceland's musical superstar."Writers are respected here," Agla Magnusdottir tells me. "They live well. Some even get a salary."Magnusdottir is head of the new Icelandic Literature Centre, which offers state support for literature and its translation."They write everything - modern sagas, poetry, children's books, literary and erotic fiction - but the biggest boom is in crime writing," she says.That is perhaps no surprise in this Nordic nation. But crime novel sales figures are staggering - double that of any of its Nordic neighbours.So what has led to this phenomenal book boom? I would say it is due to a crop of darn good writers, telling riveting tales with elegant economy and fantastic characters.Iceland's black lava riverbeds, its steaming, bubbling earth, with its towering volcanoes and fairytale streams also make it the perfect setting for stories.No wonder JRR Tolkien and Seamus Heaney were entranced and Unesco designates Reykjavik a City of Literature.Solvi Bjorn Siggurdsson, a tall, Icelandic-sweater-clad novelist, says writers owe a lot to the past."We are a nation of storytellers. When it was dark and cold we had nothing else to do," he says. "Thanks to the poetic eddas and medieval sagas, we have always been surrounded by stories. After independence from Denmark in 1944, literature helped define our identity."Siggurdsson pays homage to Iceland's Nobel Literature Laureate, Halldor Laxness, whose books are sold in petrol stations and tourist centres across the island. Locals name their cats after Laxness and make pilgrimages to his home."When Laxness won the Nobel prize in 1955 he put modern Icelandic literature on the map," Solvi tells me. "He gave us confidence to write."A combination of ash and the crash also put Iceland on the map.The financial crisis - or "kreppa" - of 2008, which helped trigger the world economic crash, came first. The ash cloud from one of Iceland's many active volcanoes created a second in 2010.Hallgrimur Helgason - comedian, painter and writer - tells me the kreppa brought Icelanders down to earth."It made us less complacent and gave artists a creative shot in the arm - as Thatcher did for Britain," he grins. "We address politics too - it is not all about sagas."But some fear a book kreppa, too. Iceland has so many writers there is huge pressure on publishers.This time of year sees the "jolabokaflod", or Christmas Book Flood, when most books are published.About now every household gets a book catalogue through the door. They pore over it like a furniture catalogue. Everyone receives books as Christmas presents - hardback and shrink-wrapped."Even now, when I go the hairdressers," Kristin Vidarsdottir, manager of the Unesco City of Literature project, says, "they do not want celebrity gossip from me but recommendations for Christmas books."But it is a lock of blue hair which alerts me to the presence of Iceland's most famous celebrity. The singer Bjork attends several of the festival events."It is great to see you supporting writers," I say to her."It is a small place. We have grown up together," she replies. "We support each other."If Bjork was, once upon a time, Iceland's biggest cultural brand, she is today joined by a whole bokaflod of authors.From Our Own Correspondent: Listen online or download the podcast.BBC Radio 4: Saturdays at 11:30 and some Thursdays at 11:00BBC World Service: Short editions Monday-Friday - see World Service programme schedule.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <description>'Music is my punch bag' - John Newman on his therapeutic debut</description>

      <body>British soul singer John Newman releases his highly anticipated solo album, Tribute, this week.It follows on from his success as a featured artist on Rudimental's number one hit, Feel The Love, last year.His debut solo single, Love Me Again, went straight to the top of the UK charts when it was released in July.Newman spoke to the BBC about almost becoming a mechanic, a life-changing tumour and music being his punch bag.I don't know. When I make music, I do care about the response because I want to continue what I'm doing and that's the key - that it's successful enough for me to go back into a studio and do the same again.Massively. It is when you're sat in a small studio, songwriting. Even when it hits radio it's incredible. I didn't expect it with any of the tracks - my own or with the Rudimental track - so it does feel pretty crazy.It's always weird when people ask me about it as a collaboration because it genuinely started out as a few guys in a studio having a laugh until people started building it up. We were just mates making music. In terms of it being a platform for me, it was incredible for what I do now and a great introduction to the music industry. I learnt a lot about my live show, about myself and about touring.Well boring! The only thing to do was to get drunk and fight on weekends. We didn't have cinemas, bowling alleys and the swimming pool was horrible. There was nothing to do. In terms of a professional life, you became a plumber or mechanic or plasterer and then got a wife, a kid, a house and I really didn't want that. It was really frustrating for me. It was like a blanket over my eyes.I was fooled into thinking I wanted to be a mechanic by the town I was living in. When I moved to Leeds at the age of 16 I realised I wanted to make music.I still don't think I can sing that well. I don't think I'm technically brilliant at all and I'm not trained very well but maybe that's why I am different to everyone else. The point of development for me was when I was living in Leeds and I lost two of my best friends in a car crash and I was singing and songwriting and playing guitar every day.I was DJing house music and producing bits of jungle and hip hop and I was really into 90s stuff and late disco then too. When I moved to Leeds I started getting into soul and listened to a lot of people like early James Brown and Wilson Pickett. When I was growing up my mum played a lot of Motown compilations, but now after studying soul and looking into the production I learned a lot about it and now she feels a little belittled by my knowledge!No - my family were very supportive, but the people in the town where I grew up thought I was ridiculous and laughed at me when I was playing gigs.I used to work in a bar and my supervisor at the time introduced me to Kesi and they let me move into their house and work on my music. After that I met the guys just to make music with them. That's how organic it was - we just met and made music and chilled out together.I had a brain tumour, which was shocking and I was going blind. It was really scary and I wouldn't ever wish it upon anybody, but it was actually a blessing in disguise for me because it matured me and when I got out I just wanted to smash it with my career and with the Rudimental boys.Definitely - it's upped the level of the album and how much I wanted to pull of an incredible record.We just came through at the same time in the summer. I think the reason it's uplifting is that it's radio friendly.Yes. In terms of it being uplifting in the production, I make my demos first before I write lyrics and I have fun with them. Then I write about 10 pages of lyrics until I think 'ok, now I've got to form this into something'. I'd been through a break up and that's when the album starting coming together because I needed to express myself and music is very therapeutic for me. I think of it like my punch bag and I needed to get it out.Yes but no! It's always difficult to express yourself like that but I'm glad I've got music to be able to do it.Not relief, just happy because I just wanted to be able to make an album - the only reason I want the success is so I can continue doing this. It's not so I can walk around with million dollar chains around my neck and drive around in Ferraris. It's just so I can write the music I enjoy making in incredible studios.I don't think I'll ever stop enjoying making music, although it's hard to say right now because I'm well into it. If I stop enjoying it in the future, I'll stop because it's not music anymore - it's celebrity and that doesn't appeal to me.I've been offered collaboration opportunities left, right and centre but I just didn't want to do it. If this album sells well I want to be proud of it because people I know have bought in to me as an artist and into the music, not into a big name that's on the album.I've already started coming up with the ideas and I'm ready to go now, but my managers want me to do more promos, so that'll have to wait for a while.Tribute is released on 14 October.</body>

      <body>This year's Man Booker shortlist features six writers from across the globe: Canada, Britain, Ireland, New Zealand and, for the first time in the prize's history, Zimbabwe."Global in its reach, this exceptional shortlist demonstrates the vitality and range of the contemporary novel at its finest," said Robert Macfarlane, the chair of the judges."These six superb works of fiction take us from gold-rush New Zealand to revolutionary Calcutta, from modern-day Japan to the Holy Land of the Gospels, and from Zimbabwe to the deep English countryside. World-spanning in their concerns, and ambitious in their techniques, they remind us of the possibilities and power of the novel as a form."Here is a guide to the six shortlisted books, and their authors.By NoViolet BulawayoPublished by Chatto and WindusAbout the book: The story of Darling, a young girl who leaves her Zimbabwe shantytown for a new life in the United States.About the author: NoViolet Bulawayo (her real name is Elizabeth Zandile Tshele) was born in Tsholotsho, Zimbabwe, in 1981. She is currently a Stegner Fellow at Stanford University in California.She is the author of the short story Hitting Budapest (2010), which won the 2011 Caine Prize for African Writing, and Snapshots (2009), shortlisted for the South Africa PEN Studzinsi Award. Her debut novel, We Need New Names, was published on 6 June.The judges said: "This is a novel that fizzes throughout with stylistic verve, each chapter felt to us like a fresh adventure in language and perception."The reviews said: "Bulawayo has created a debut that is poignant and moving but which also glows with humanity and humour." Leyla Sanai, The IndependentBy Eleanor CattonPublished by GrantaAbout the book: Catton's historical novel is about the 19th-century New Zealand gold rush. It is 1866, and Walter Moody has come to make his fortune, but is drawn into a series of complex mysteries.About the author: Eleanor Catton was born in 1985 in Canada and raised in New Zealand. She currently lives in Auckland, New Zealand.Her debut novel The Rehearsal (2008) was shortlisted for the Guardian First Book Award and the Dylan Thomas Prize, and longlisted for the Orange Prize. The Luminaries was published on 5 September.The judges said: "It is an exuberant homage to Victorian sensation novels... with opium dens, fallen women, fortunes lost, found and squandered, murders and blackmail but it's a very knowing and post-modern homage to the sensation novel."I couldn't really think of many novels it was like, in some ways it seemed more like a Kiwi Twin Peaks."The reviews said: "The Luminaries is a dazzling feat of a novel, the golden nugget in this year's Man Booker longlist, a pastiche quite unlike anything I've ever come across, so graceful is its plotting and structure." Lucy Scholes, The ObserverBy Jim CracePublished by PicadorAbout the book: A tale of rural isolation set in an uncertain century, in which the narrator Walter Thirsk sees his village come under threat and fall apart over the course of seven days.About the author: Jim Crace was born in Hertfordshire in 1946. He read English Literature at London University and worked for the VSO in Sudan as an assistant in Sudanese educational television.His first book, Continent (1986), won the Whitbread First Novel Award and the Guardian Fiction Prize. Quarantine (1997) was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. Being Dead (1999) won the Whitbread Novel Award, the National Book Critics' Circle Fiction Award (USA) and was shortlisted for the International Impac Dublin Literary Award.Crace was awarded the EM Forster Award by the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1992 and became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1999. Harvest was published on 14 February.The judges said: "One of its real strengths is that it's very hard to categorise - it's not a period piece, nor is it in any way crudely allegorical. When you think about the eruption of strangers into his closed world you begin to get a glimpse of some the troubling debates of modern life."The reviews said: "Crace writes with a particular, haunting empathy for the displaced. Indeed, displacement doubles as his theme and as his storytelling strategy. By transposing contemporary anxieties onto distant times he allows us to feel them afresh." Rob Nixon, New York TimesBy Jhumpa LahiriPublished by BloomsburyAbout the book: Brothers Subhash and Udayan are inseparable as children in Calcutta. As the years pass - as US tanks roll into Vietnam, as riots sweep across India and the Communist movement begins to take root - Udayan's increasingly radical beliefs create aftershocks within his family and across decades of Indian and American history.About the author: Jhumpa Lahiri was born in 11 July, 1967 in London and raised in Rhode Island. She is a member of the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities, appointed by US President Barack Obama.She is the author of four works of fiction: Interpreter of Maladies (1999), which won the 2000 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction; The Namesake (2003), adapted into the film of the same name; Unaccustomed Earth (2008); and The Lowland, which was published on 8 September. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.The judges said: "This is a novel about distance and separation, it's also about the impossibility of leaving certain kinds of past behind - no matter how you try and flee them. It is calm and lucid in its tone and devastating in the sadness that it gathers over its length."The reviews said: "There is no doubt that The Lowland confirms Lahiri as a writer of formidable powers and great depth of feeling, who makes the business of conjuring a story from the chaos of human lives seem quite effortless." Stephanie Merritt, The ObserverBy Ruth OzekiPublished by CanongateAbout the book: A coming-of-age novel about the nature of time. Ruth discovers a Hello Kitty lunchbox washed up on the shore of her beach home on the Canadian coast. Within it lies a diary that expresses the hopes and dreams of a young girl, Nao. She suspects it might have arrived on a drift of debris from the 2011 tsunami. With every turn of the page, she is sucked deeper into a mystery...About the author: Ruth Ozeki was born in 1956 in New Haven, Connecticut, and raised by an American father and a Japanese mother. She studied English and Asian Studies at Smith College. In June 2010 she was ordained as a Zen Buddhist priest.With a Canadian passport, she divides her time between British Columbia and New York. She is the author of three novels: My Year of Meats (1998), All Over Creation (2002) and A Tale for the Time Being, which was published on 11 March.The judges said: "A Zen novel, it's about dualities at every level... it is incredibly clever and incredibly sweet, it is big hearted and a novel we decided was most likely to make us realise the process of reading 152 books could make us feel Zen, rather than a little tired."The reviews said: "What binds it all together is the voice of Nao, who manages to be both a convincingly self-obsessed Tokyo teenager and a sympathetic and engaging narrator. And as she navigates the end of her childhood (and, perhaps, her life) through a mist of cultural confusion, she provides us with a compelling coming-of-age story." Beth Jones, The TelegraphBy Colm ToibinPublished by VikingAbout the book: At 101 pages, the shortest book on the shortlist, The Testament of Mary presents the mother of Jesus grieving angrily years on from her son's crucifixion. As her life and her suffering begin to acquire the resonance of myth, Mary struggles to break the silence surrounding what she knows to have happened.About the author: Colm Toibin was born in Enniscorthy, Co Wexford, in May 1955 and educated at University College Dublin.His novels include The South (1990); The Heather Blazing (1992); The Story of the Night (1996); The Blackwater Lightship (1999), shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize; The Master (2004), also Booker shortlisted and Brooklyn (2009), which won the Costa Novel Award and was Man Booker longlisted.The judges said: "A beautifully crafted passionate story that most people think they already know, but Toibin turns that story into something wonderfully fresh and strange. This is a short novel but one that lives long in the memory."The reviews said: "Lovely, understated and powerfully sad, The Testament of Mary finally gives the mother of Jesus a chance to speak. And, given that chance, she throws aside the blue veil of the Madonna to become wholly, gloriously human." Annalisa Quinn, NPR Books</body>

      <title>First aid skills can 'save the boy'</title>
      <description>Will hard-hitting advert get first aid message through?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24396890</url>

      <body>A child falls out of a tree with a sickening thud while his father is preoccupied on his mobile phone.In a kitchen, a woman trained in emergency first aid rushes outside to help, but instead of coming to their aid she gathers in washing from the rain. She is not the boy's mother but she would have known what to do.The father is left kneeling by his unconscious son, blood trickling from his lips, screaming for help.The advert, from St John Ambulance, which has been running on television channels in recent weeks is powerful, the message hard-hitting. What parent would not want to know how to save the boy?Yet the first aid charity says that more than half of parents (55%) lack the skills necessary to save their child in the event of a life-threatening accident. It was their reason for commissioning the advert in the first place.More worryingly perhaps, the charity says that although most parents claim to know basic first aid, many say they would not touch or move the boy until an ambulance arrived - which would be the wrong thing to do.It says the correct procedure to save the boy is to follow the important first steps of first aid by checking for injuries and bleeding, opening his airway and checking his breathing. The charity also explains in their video how to put the boy in the recovery position and it says to call 999.So Sue Killen, chief executive of St John Ambulance, is understandably happy that the response to the advertising campaign has been positive.She says: "We know some people were a little shocked by the advert but as one Twitter user said: 'I'd rather be scared by an ad than scared because I couldn't save someone'."We're really pleased with the way people have responded and that tens of thousands more people can be the difference between life and death."But not everyone is convinced that the tone of the advert was correct.Emma Hammett, who is a first aid trainer with her own company, First Aid for Life, said the advert had "quite a scary message" which left her feeling horrible."A lot of people missed the point that the woman in the advert wasn't the mum [of the boy]."The way the advert was presented, it's not an easy thing to share. Mumsnet still isn't talking about it."She says happier stories are easier to talk about, particularly if they have a feelgood factor.But figures from St John Ambulance show that people are responding to the advert. More than 100,000 people have logged on to the charity's website to find out how to 'Save the boy' in the advert.Thousands of new followers of St John Ambulance on Facebook and Twitter suggest that the message has reached a wider audience.And a 62% rise in bookings on St John Ambulance first aid courses since the campaign aired shows that people are actually prepared to learn some new skills.So perhaps the shock tactics in the ad worked? Emma Sheppard, acting director of brand, communications and fundraising at St John Ambulance, thinks so."We don't want to be shocking for the sake of it but we've found that people have an apathy towards first aid and a powerful message is proven to get people to take action."Many people think someone who knows what to do is going to be there."Unfortunately, that's not always going to be the case and that's the point we try and get across in the advert."The thinking behind the ad, she says, is to put people in the characters' shoes and make them confront the idea that no-one could be around to help them in an emergency.Other organisations have used different tactics to get across an important message.In 2012, for instance, the British Heart Foundation used former footballer Vinnie Jones to front a campaign to educate people about hands-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), as opposed to mouth-to-mouth resuscitation which they felt was preventing bystanders from giving vital CPR in a medical emergency.The well-known face of a player with a hardman reputation showing people how to save lives made people laugh - and log on to learn more.The BHF says the advert has now been viewed nearly four million times on YouTube and the training film has clocked up three million views alone.It also says that at least 41 lives that have been saved as a result of the advert and one of those survivors featured in the second TV ad.From the evidence, it appears that both approaches to getting across an important public health message on TV work.In the end, Sue Killen of St John Ambulance says, there is no excuse for not knowing exactly how to save someone's life."It's devastating to find that over half of parents wouldn't have the first aid confidence to save their own child's life."And it's not just parents. Over 40% of people admit that it would take something as severe as the death of a loved one to make them learn first aid."</body>

      <description>Opponents to the development of a type of genetically modified rice enriched with vitamin A are criticised as "wicked" by the environment secretary.</description>

      <body>Opponents of the development of a type of genetically modified (GM) rice enriched with vitamin A are "wicked", the environment secretary has said.In an interview with the Independent, Owen Paterson said they could be condemning millions of people in the developing world to a premature death.Mr Paterson backed a letter from international scientists calling for the rapid development of "golden rice".But campaigners say the benefits claimed for the rice are misleading.Mr Paterson told the newspaper: "It's just disgusting that little children are allowed to go blind and die because of a hang-up by a small number of people about this technology."I feel really strongly about it. I think what they do is absolutely wicked. There is no other word for it."Mr Paterson did not specify any particular groups in his interview but also said opponents of GM technology were "casting a dark shadow over attempts to feed the world".BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said Mr Paterson was known as a strong supporter of GM crops but his language seemed certain to raise hackles with those who took a different view.A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokeswoman said it was Mr Paterson's strong personal view.People in the developed usually world get enough vitamin A from their diet by eating foods like cheese, yoghurts and eggs.But deficiency is a common problem in developing countries, and is estimated to affect between 140 million and 250 million children under the age of five.Vitamin A is needed for healthy skin and eyes and to help strengthen the immune system so that the body can fight infections. Deficiency can lead to blindness, illness and death.Supplements are available and the World Health Organisation advocates routine administration of vitamin A in countries where deficiency is a problem.High doses of vitamin A can be harmful, however, particularly in pregnancyMeanwhile, in a letter to US journal Science, a group of leading academics has accused Western non-governmental organisations of fuelling opposition to the development of GM technologies.They wrote: "If ever there was a clear-cut cause for outrage, it is the concerted campaign by Greenpeace and other non-governmental organisations, as well as by individuals, against golden rice."Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth have said there are more effective solutions to vitamin A deficiency.Mr Paterson also used the interview to defend the government's handling of the badger cull - aimed at preventing the spread of bovine TB - against criticism from animal welfare groups.He said: "I cannot understand anyone wanting to tolerate this disgusting disease."I find it incomprehensible that these badger groups don't see that this is a horrendous disease for the badgers themselves."</body>

      <body>Visa applications for Chinese visitors entering the UK will be simplified, Chancellor George Osborne has announced during his trade trip to China.Under the plan, Chinese nationals visiting the EU will not need to submit separate UK visa applications if they book with selected travel agents.Mr Osborne is trying to persuade more Chinese companies to invest in the UK.But he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that his trip was also about changing British attitudes to China."Many people think of China as a sweat shop on the Pearl River. Yet it is at the forefront of medicine, computing and technology. It's a very rapidly changing country."Earlier, Mr Osborne told an audience of students that his visit was about "much more than a collection of business deals"."What I really want it to be about is strengthening the understanding between our two nations, deepening our friendship, working out where by working together we can improve the lives of all our citizens," he said in a speech to university students in Beijing."Yes, of course, we have differences, different political systems, we attach value to different things, and we shouldn't be afraid of pointing out where we disagree."But let us not do it in a way that is not respectful of each other and tries to understand each other, and let us try to overcome our differences and work together in peaceful co-operation."Because ultimately we want the same thing - a better life for our citizens."Adam Marshall, director of policy at business lobby group the British Chambers of Commerce, said UK businesses would "breathe a collective sigh of relief" at the plans to simplify Chinese visa applications."For too long, Britain has courted Chinese investment and tourism without facilitating the entry of Chinese visitors with the same vigour. A responsive visa system is crucial to demonstrating that the UK is open to trade and investment," he added.During his week-long trip, Mr Osborne has already unveiled a deal in which a Chinese firm took a 20% stake in a new business park in Manchester.And on Sunday came details of the visa changes.Currently, Chinese visitors can apply for a single visa to visit much of Europe but a separate one is required to travel to the UK.It is thought that the extra paperwork is deterring many Chinese visitors from including the UK in a trip to Europe.A mobile visa scheme that already operates in Beijing and Shanghai will be expanded as part of the changes.Under the mobile service, which was first tested by executives at Wanda, the company that bought Sunseeker yachts, officials go out to applicants to collect their paperwork and biometric data.The process can take less than five minutes.A 24-hour "super priority" visa service will also be available from next summer. The moves will be welcomed by UK businesses who want to benefit from Chinese tourists.In his speech, Mr Osborne said: "Let me make this clear to you and to the whole of China, there is no limit to the number of Chinese who could study in Britain."There is no limit to the number of Chinese tourists who can visit. No limit on the amount of business we can do together."According to the government, last year 210,000 visas were issued to Chinese nationals and they contributed about £300m to the UK economy.</body>

      <body>Conservative candidates to be the new deputy to Commons Speaker John Bercow are to set out their stalls in a hustings with Labour MPs later.There has been a vacancy on Mr Bercow's team since Nigel Evans stood down to fight sex offence charges.As a Conservative, Mr Evans can only be replaced by another governing-party MP under Commons rules - although no Lib Dems are known to be applying.Deputy Speakers are elected by their fellow MPs in a secret ballot.The official process for nominating candidates does not begin until 10:00 BST on Tuesday, but seven Conservatives are understood to be mounting a campaign: David Amess, Henry Bellingham, Brian Binley, Simon Burns, Nadine Dorries, Eleanor Laing and Gary Streeter.Each has a contingent of Conservative supporters, reports BBC parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy, so the result will be determined by the candidates' ability to attract Labour votes.The meeting with Labour backbenchers, scheduled to take place in the House of Commons at 19:00 BST, will not be open to the public or press.But our correspondent adds that the candidates have been campaigning on their opposition to the MPs' expenses body, IPSA, the impartiality they will bring to chairing debates, and their team-working skills.The latter can be read as a coded reference to the well-known antagonism between former minister Simon Burns, who once referred to the Speaker as a "sanctimonious dwarf", he continues: "The thought of putting Burns in harness with Bercow tickles many a Tory."In 2009, deputy Speaker candidate Nadine Dorries described Mr Bercow as "oily" and suggested he was "mistrusted by up to half of the House".Each of the seven MPs will make a short speech to the Labour meeting, before facing questions from the floor.They will need to have secured at least six nominations from fellow MPs by 17:00 BST on Tuesday, and voting takes place between 11.30 BST and 14:00 on Wednesday.Mr Bercow, himself formerly a Conservative MP, has three deputies, and Commons rules dictate that the team of four should be equally drawn from governing-party and opposition MPs.Two Labour MPs, Lindsay Hoyle and Dawn Primarolo, retain their places on the team.Ex-deputy Mr Evans has been accused of two counts of indecent assault, five of sexual assault, and one of rape.He denies the allegations, telling MPs after he stood down as a deputy Speaker in September: "I now have the opportunity to robustly defend my innocence and seek acquittal."</body>

      <body>Most women in Holloway prison are there because of something the men in their life have done, recently jailed Vicky Pryce has told the BBC.The former wife of ex-minister Chris Huhne was sentenced to eight months for perverting the course of justice after taking speeding points for him."I did something, I paid the price," she told Radio 4's Today programme.The economist - who had claimed her husband coerced her - has written a book about the economics of prison.Her royalties from the book will go to the charity Working Chance, which helps women with criminal convictions find work.Pryce, who was recently stripped of her Companion of the Order of the Bath, served two months in the north London prison earlier this year.Huhne, the former energy secretary, was also jailed for the same offence.He left Pryce in 2010 as his affair with PR adviser Carina Trimingham was about to be exposed.During the former couple's trial, the court heard Pryce had revealed the speeding points scandal to newspapers in 2011 to seek revenge.Asked whether she agreed with Chris Huhne's assessment that they had fallen victim to the Murdoch press, she said: "I don't begrudge anyone in terms of what's happened - or any of the journalists frankly - in my view one has to just look forward."I did something, I paid the price of it and that is it."On the prospect of going to prison, Ms Pryce said she knew it was "something I simply had to survive and perhaps learn from it obviously, and see what goes on".The worst aspect of prison life was "losing my liberty, but mostly worrying about my children - that they would be worried about me and how do I react to ensure that they feel that 'actually I'm ok'."And of course that meant that I also had to stay strong."On the claim in her book that many women in Holloway were there mostly because of something their husbands, brothers and fathers had done, she said: "Clearly they knew what they were doing but it didn't mean that they necessarily wanted to do what they did."Vulnerable women who often have lost their self esteem - they could be prostitutes, they could be people who are stealing to feed their, but also their other-half's, drug habits."More than 50% of women who enter jail have been physically, sexually, or emotionally abused. And those are statistics quoted by everybody."Of course you are [responsible for your actions] and they were. The thing to remember is that they were very vulnerable at the time they were doing it and they remain vulnerable."The interesting thing is that jail doesn't do anything to take that away from them and they leave prison after a while, go back into society and they find themselves in exactly the same position and they re-offend."She said there had been surprises, such as Holloway's reception area which meant she hadn't felt "threatened" by entering it. "It felt that somebody worried about you," she said.On how well the prison system was coping, she said: "There's been a huge increase in the numbers of prisoners, although crime is going down."The causality doesn't work that way. The causality works in a way that says in fact crime has been reducing because of things to do with technology - making it difficult to break into houses, difficult to break into cars - and all that sort of stuff, and yet the numbers have been going up very, very significantly."Women in particular, the numbers have gone up by 27% between 2000 and 2010, while crime has been coming down."It makes no sense at all. The costs are enormous. There are so many cheaper ways to deal with this whole issue, which is what the Prisonomics book is all about."</body>

      <title>NHS Savile abuse probe widened</title>
      <description>The probe into Jimmy Savile's abuse of NHS patients has been extended to include more hospitals, says the health secretary.</description>

      <body>The investigation into Jimmy Savile's alleged abuse of patients at NHS hospitals has been extended to other hospitals, the health secretary says.The inquiry, currently focused on Broadmoor, Stoke Mandeville and Leeds General hospitals, as well as a further 10 trusts, will be expanded to include "other hospitals", Jeremy Hunt said.The hospitals were not named. A final report will be published in 2014.The late DJ is believed to have abused hundreds of victims.The former BBC presenter of Top Of The Pops and Jim'll Fix It, who also worked as a Radio 1 DJ and received a knighthood in 1990, died aged 84 in October 2011 - a year before the allegations were broadcast in an ITV documentary.Revelations that the famed fundraiser had sexually abused children prompted hundreds of victims to come forward, including those who said they were attacked on BBC premises and at a number of other institutions.Savile had a bedroom at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, an office and living quarters at Broadmoor, and widespread access to Leeds General Infirmary.Mr Hunt said: "It is vital that the final NHS investigation report is thorough and complete and reflects all the evidence about Jimmy Savile's pattern of offending."A Scotland Yard investigation into Savile's alleged crimes - one of three strands of Operation Yewtree - is due to report in the new year.The BBC understands it will put the number of alleged victims at over 500.The Department of Health investigation into the three hospitals is being overseen by barrister - and former deputy chairman of the Financial Ombudsman Service - Kate Lampard.In a written ministerial statement, Mr Hunt said: "The Metropolitan Police Service, working with Kate Lampard, has established there was further relevant information regarding Jimmy Savile."The Department of Health asked the Metropolitan Police Service, through an agreed information sharing process, to review information it held to ascertain if it included material related to health and care settings."The revelations about Savile have led to a number of inquiries.Firstly, the police investigation, Operation Yewtree, which has three strands.One is looking specifically at the actions of Savile, and the second strand concerns allegations against "Savile and others".The third strand relates to complaints against other people unconnected to the Savile investigations, made by people who came forward after widespread coverage of the scandal.The BBC has also launched three reviews, including the Pollard Review, which has already reported the findings of its investigation into the dropping of a Newsnight report into claims Savile was a paedophile; and a review by Dame Janet Smith into culture and practices during Savile's career and current policies.The director of public prosecutions is also reviewing decisions not to prosecute Savile in 2009.</body>

      <title>Labour backs parent-led schools</title>
      <description>Labour says it will support parents who want to set up new schools but the Conservatives say the opposition's policy on school choice has not changed.</description>

      <body>Labour is "on the side" of parents who want to set up schools and would not shut most existing free schools, the new shadow education secretary insists.Tristram Hunt told the BBC Labour backed "enterprise and innovation" when it came to increasing school places.He said a Labour government would push ahead with what it called parent-led academies in areas of educational need.Tory chairman Grant Shapps said Labour's policy was unchanged and it still opposed the "popular" schools.Free schools, set up by parents and other groups and operating outside local authority control, have been established under a policy pioneered by Education Secretary Michael Gove.More than 170 have been opened across England since September 2011.Labour has been accused by the government of sending out mixed messages about the party's support, opposing their roll-out nationally but backing schools locally.Mr Hunt, who has just taken over from Stephen Twigg as the party's education spokesman, said he regretted previously describing free schools as a "vanity project for yummy mummies". He made the comments in 2010 shortly after becoming an MP.Mr Hunt told BBC One's Andrew Marr programme Labour would not open new free schools "along the Michael Gove model", but that the bulk of existing free schools would be kept open as his party wanted to "keep the good free schools".Citing the case of the Al-Madinah free school in Derby, which was closed for a week earlier this month on the first day of an Ofsted inspection, Mr Hunt said Labour would not allow schools to become an "ideological experiment".Education Minister Lord Nash has warned the school would be closed unless "unacceptable" teaching standards improved.Its acting head teacher said there were areas the school needed to address and it was co-operating with Ofsted."What is going on with the Al-Madinah school is a terrifying example of the mistakes of Michael Gove's education policy," he said.New schools, he added, should only be opened in areas where there was a shortage of places, where "properly qualified" staff could be recruited and where institutions were financially accountable.Under Labour's plans, parent-led academies would enable parent groups and other organisations to set up schools outside local authority control, although local authorities would have greater powers to intervene when there were concerns about standards."If you are a group of parents, social entrepreneurs and teachers interested in setting up a school in areas where you need new school places, then the Labour government will be on your side."We are in favour of enterprise and innovation."But a Conservative Party spokesman said shadow chancellor Ed Balls had made it clear in a speech in June that the party would curb new schools in areas where they was an "excess" of places.Mr Balls had suggested a future Labour government would prioritise resources on areas where school places were in "short supply".Mr Shapps told the BBC: "This is the same old Labour policy. Free schools will only be allowed in specific circumstances in specific areas with a whole load of bureaucracy attached."Free schools have been driving up standards. They are hugely popular with parents and up to now Labour have fought tooth and nail against them including voting against them and what they said today has changed absolutely nothing."Journalist Toby Young, who helped set up a free school in west London, said Mr Hunt had been "less than candid" about Labour's policy as it was considering granting councils the power of veto over free schools in their boroughs.Writing in his blog for the Daily Telegraph, Mr Young - who has said he is considering of applying to be a Conservative candidate at the next election - said this would be a "retrograde step" since councils would be unlikely to approve new schools close to existing ones which were under-performing.Mr Hunt said there needed to be more focus on vocational education with support for further education colleges and apprenticeships in industry.</body>

      <title>'Massive' energy investment expected</title>
      <description>Britain's energy sector is close to securing tens of billions of pounds in investment from the Far East, Energy Secretary Ed Davey says.</description>

      <body>Britain's energy sector is close to securing tens of billions of pounds in investment from the Far East, Energy Secretary Ed Davey has said.He said a "massive" wave of investment in nuclear and other technology from China, Japan and Korea would help secure the UK's future power supply.A deal to build new reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset was close, he added.Labour has said the government is not doing enough, but Mr Davey called its record on energy investment "shocking".His comments come amid a fierce political row over household energy bills, with SSE becoming the first of the "big six" energy firms to announce a sharp increase in prices last week.Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Mr Davey said he had made "huge progress" during a recent visit to China - during which he spoke to all of the country's major energy suppliers about boosting two-way investment."The Chinese, along with the Japanese and the Koreans are very interested in the opportunities in the British nuclear sector. I think it is really possible we will see massive Chinese investment, not just in nuclear but across the board.""I think we will see massive Japanese and Korean investment. It is really critical we get that investment," he said.Recent reports have suggested China General Nuclear Power Group could take a 49% stake in the French-led consortium seeking to develop Hinkley Point.Under existing proposals, two new nuclear reactors would replace those set to stop operating in the middle of the next decade.Mr Davey indicated the UK was also "extremely close" to a deal with EDF - one of Britain's big six energy firms - to invest in Hinkley.The government has said the state will not directly subsidise the building of new nuclear plants but has insisted that new generating capacity is essential - alongside other forms of energy - to meet the UK's growing energy needs.Mr Davey told the programme that, when an agreement was finally reached, he was "convinced I will be able to look consumers in the eyes, look businesses in the eyes, and say we have a good deal".The energy secretary also played down suggestions of differences with Tory Chancellor George Osborne - who is currently in China on a trade mission - over energy policy, saying they were "stuck together" on the need to substantially increase levels of investment.Elsewhere in the programme, Mr Davey said he expected other firms to follow SSE and raise energy prices, but he made no apology for seeking to upgrade and modernise the UK's energy system.Energy companies have said one of the reasons they are having to hike prices is to pay for huge investment in the UK's generation and distribution infrastructure.The energy secretary said he had written to the largest firms to ask them what they were doing to simplify their bills, so consumers could understand what they were being charged.He said he expected answers from them by Monday.Ministers have dismissed Labour's pledge of a price freeze on energy bills after 2015, arguing the way to help consumers is to increase competition and make it easier for people to switch supplier in order to access the best possible tariff.Mr Davey told the programme Labour's warnings about a looming energy crisis rang hollow."The lights are going to stay on. Since this government came to power, we have been running to increase energy investment. Labour's energy investment record was frankly shocking."They were negligent with energy and climate change policy. We are the ones delivering the new power stations, the policies to deliver the billions of pounds of investment."Meanwhile, Labour said the government was building false expectations about the benefits of shale gas and was presenting it as an alternative to renewable energy.Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint told Sky News Labour was not opposed to fracking in Britain, but warned it was not yet known at what cost it could be produced."We are not setting our face against it if the conditions are right and the environment is right, but what we do disagree with is polarising shale against renewables that we need as well," she said.</body>

      <title>Disabled child support review urged</title>
      <description>The government is urged by the children's commissioner for England to undertake a review of the adequacy of support for disabled children.</description>

      <body>Ministers are being urged to review care provided for children with disabilities following research into the adequacy of support for families.Children's commissioner for England Maggie Atkinson called the findings "heart-rending" and "disturbing".The report suggested some families were unable to afford basic necessities for "a dignified life".The Department for Work and Pensions said the report contained "a small sample, presenting a partial picture".The study, carried out by the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) for the children's commissioner, found evidence that poverty meant some disabled children were not living lives that met international human rights standards.Ms Atkinson said the research findings were "not an easy read"."This is about voicelessness and powerlessness, as well as about making ends meet," she said. "It's very poignant and very difficult to hear the stories."Money issues are very real and very challenging, but parents are equally saying they have little or no say in the ways services are planned and provided, from transport to access to youth, or play or leisure which is properly adapted for one's disability."The research was based on interviews and group discussions with 78 disabled children and young people and 17 parents.It was co-led by a team of 11 disabled children and young people working with the university.A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions rejected some of the conclusions."In fact, independent reports show how we are world leaders in support for disabled people with the UK's spending on disability-related benefits a fifth higher than the EU average."The UK is also acknowledged as a world leader in supporting independent living for disabled people, having the best overall rating of 55 countries."We continue to spend around £50bn a year on disabled people and their services and our reforms will make sure the billions spent give more targeted support to those who need it most."Ms Atkinson acknowledged the government's response, but stressed some of the "personal stories" she had heard painted a different picture.She said: "I would like some of the officials who have no doubt written that statement to come and meet some of the young people, who will tell the very true story of living with a disability on a very low income, and then I would ask them to say that again."There is a mum quoted in the survey, who because her child needs an adapted home, including a multi-sensory environment... was persuaded to make sure that was available."She will be paying for it until November 2022."There is also a young woman going through everything that adolescence brings with it, who needs incontinence pads."The benefits pay for four-a-day, she needs 10. That is not human dignity and it is not human rights either."Despite the criticism, researchers found "many examples" of disabled children receiving good care and services which they said "demonstrate how low income does not have to be a barrier".But evidence was also found of inadequate services, compounding the problems of some low income families.The authors said that although families with disabled children often have rights to welfare payments and practical support, their basic incomes often do not cover the extra costs of raising and caring for a disabled child.The team analysed three United Nations treaty documents: the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on Persons with Disabilities and the International Covenant on Economic and Social Rights.Between them these treaties specify individuals' rights to food, clothes and heating, to live independently, to be able to decide where to live, to live in their local communities and to the support and services they need to be able to do that.The researchers found the lives lived by some disabled children and young people did not meet these basic rights."There were accounts of some disabled children, young people and their parents not being able to heat their homes properly or afford adequate clothing and food," said the paper."Some were not informed or involved in decisions about changes to where they lived."Some experienced delays in adaptations being made to their homes and some did not have enough space nor support for independent living."</body>

      <body>It will be a "disaster" for Wales if borrowing powers recommended by the Silk Commission are not devolved, First Minister Carwyn Jones has warned.He told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement that without more powers to borrow money, planned £1bn M4 improvements "will not happen".Mr Jones will raise his concerns with the UK Government in Downing Street later this week.Last month, David Cameron denied blocking further devolution.The prime minister told BBC Wales he was attracted by the idea of the Welsh government being able to raise some of its budget.But he said "the bubble in Cardiff is completely obsessed by powers" whereas the real issue was economic recovery.Almost a year ago, the commission set up by the UK government and chaired by former assembly clerk Paul Silk, said ministers in Cardiff should be given the power to vary some tax rates.A decision had been initially expected in the spring.The first minister was asked if he thought that the Silk recommendations had been permanently kicked into the long grass.Mr Jones said: "It'd be far better for everybody if they were simply to say - yes we'll accept the Silk recommendations, we can all move on."I can then say to people in Scotland - this is an example of devolution working and why independence isn't needed. At the moment from a Scottish perspective, all they can see is devolution being blocked by UK government in London."Mr Jones told the programme it would be a disaster for Wales if the Silk proposals were not implemented."We literally could not do things. We could not improve the M4 without borrowing powers - it will not happen."The proposals to ease motorway congestion around Newport, with options of routes swinging south of the existing M4, are currently out to consultation.Chancellor George Osborne has called it one of the most important road schemes in the UK.But there is increasing frustration at waiting for a decision on whether the Welsh government can have the powers to borrow money to finance it."If we don't get sense on this then the M4 relief road can't even be considered, whereas it could be, if it was being built in England, Scotland or Northern Ireland," said Mr Jones."Now, that is for our business community an enormous competitive disadvantage, that we cannot do things to improve jobs in Wales, to improve the economy of Wales, simply because of what's happening in Wales."Why should Wales be discriminated against in that way? That's the point I'll be making."Mr Jones will be attending a meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee Plenary meeting on Wednesday.</body>

      <body>Although London is leading the country out of the recession it is not lifting Londoners out of poverty, a report suggests.The capital has problems with child poverty, young adult unemployment, low pay and high housing costs, according to London's Poverty Profile.The study shows 28% of people in London are in poverty, seven percentage points higher than the rest of England.The report was produced by think tank the New Policy Institute.It was commissioned by Trust for London, an independent charitable foundation.The survey uses the official definition of poverty, which is having a household income that is less than 60% of the national median income that year.Of the 20 English local authorities with the highest levels of child poverty, seven are in London, the study shows.The unemployment rate in London at 7% is still higher than the England average, while in the Olympic boroughs of Newham and Barking and Dagenham it is 10% higher than any of the major English cities.The number of 16 to 24-year-olds living in London has increased to one million but unemployment for this age group has risen from 15% to 25% in the last 10 years, the report adds.At the lower end of the housing market, rents in London are twice as high as the England average.Average monthly rents are £475 in England compared with £950 in outer London and £1,300 in inner London.A quarter of all households in the capital rely on housing benefit to meet their housing costs, compared with a fifth in the whole of England.The level of rents combined with the restrictions on housing benefit mean that large parts of London are now unaffordable to low-income households, the report suggests.Trust for London chief Bharat Mehta said: "London's economy may be doing better than the rest of the country but that obscures the fact it has the highest poverty rate."Londoners are trying hard but are getting stuck; with many being impacted by high housing costs and housing benefit reforms, unemployment and low pay."To tackle London's poverty and inequality, policymakers must focus on solutions such as building more affordable housing and encouraging employers to pay a Living Wage."Author of the report Hannah Aldridge added: "The London most visitors see - the West End, Westminster, the City - has ever less of its poverty."The London they don't see has ever more," she added."More likely to be in work and living in private rented accommodation, London's poor lead ordinary lives which are hidden from view by the extraordinary images conjured up by the Shard and the City."The Mayor of London's office is yet to comment on the findings of the survey.</body>

      <body>Council tax in Wales should be capped to prevent the cost of cuts being passed onto residents, the Conservatives have said.They want the Welsh government to limit the tax from next April after its draft budget saw council funding slashed.The shadow finance minister wants people protected from "the threat of mega council tax rises".But the Welsh government said council tax should be set at a reasonable level and accused the Tories of "hypocrisy".Ministers have previously ruled out caps and set an informal limit of a 5% rise.The call from shadow finance minister Janet Finch-Saunders AM comes at the start of a week which will see all 22 local councils find out the details of how much money they will receive from the Welsh government.She has previously called on local authorities not to cut frontline services or increase council tax bills.Ms Finch-Saunders said: "Over the past three years, hardworking families in Wales have faced the highest council tax bills in the UK because Labour refused to pass on the Conservative council tax freeze."Carwyn Jones's Labour government opposed legislation to allow taxpayers local referendums on excessive council tax rises, so hard-pressed families have no protection, such as that introduced by Conservatives in England, from excessive tax rises."Ms Finch-Saunders called on the government to consider a cap on council tax hikes to "shield hardworking people from the threat of mega council tax rises".Local government settlements are being announced on Wednesday, with each council finding out how much funding they will receive, allowing them to work out how much council tax they will need to charge.Councils already know it will be a tough year ahead, with one senior council figure saying local authorities were in a "very dark place," with at least two facing a possible bail-out.Finance Minister Jane Hutt announced in the draft budget on Tuesday that the local government budget would fall from £4.648bn to £4.466bn in 2014, a cut of 3.91% in cash terms or 5.81% in real terms.She said last week the government had been "supporting and cushioning" local government for the past three years, and that the priority was to protect health, schools and universal benefits such as free prescriptions, school breakfasts and bus passes for older people.A spokesman for Local Government Minister Lesley Griffiths said: "The Welsh Tories are deliberately deceiving the people of Wales."Their hypocrisy knows no bounds. By their own admission, the Tories would slash a whopping 12.5% from local authority budgets next year - a cut that would create unprecedented damage on public services all over Wales."Her spokesman added: "We would expect levels of council tax to be set at a reasonable level, taking into account the challenging financials circumstances for families across Wales."The one thing Wales can be certain of is, if the Tories had their way, vital services across the country would collapse overnight. Mercifully, we are not facing that scenario."The Welsh Local Government Association has previously said councils could not continue delivering the range of services they currently provided, adding there would be a "massive impact for the Welsh public".Chief executive Steve Thomas said once the settlements were known, he feared there would be "more pressure on the council tax".</body>

      <body>The Liberal Democrat MP David Heath is to step down after being sacked from his ministerial job last week.Mr Heath has represented Somerton and Frome since 1997 and before that led the county council.Until the recent reshuffle he was a minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.Mr Heath, 59, said he had promised his wife three years ago he would resign. He will stand aside before the next general election campaign in 2015."It is always difficult to call time on something that has been such a large part of one's life over so many years, but I think the right moment to do so is now approaching," he said.He went on: "I have hugely enjoyed the privilege of representing my community over the many years I have been involved, and I like to think I have made a difference, but now may be the right time for someone else to take on that responsibility."Party leader Nick Clegg said his colleague had been a "huge figure in the Liberal Democrats" in his constituency."He is that rare kind of politician that is genuinely liked and admired on all sides of the House," the deputy prime minister added."David's combination of brilliant oratory and brightly coloured socks visible on the front bench will be missed by people from all parties in Westminster."Lord Ashdown - who led the Lib Dems when Mr Heath was first elected to the Commons - paid tribute to a "formidable voice for Somerset"."His voice in Parliament will be much missed locally. But knowing him I am sure that he will go on making a major contribution to both local and national politics."Before becoming a coalition minister the retiring MP served as deputy leader of the Commons from May 2010 to September 2012.</body>

      <body>The Conservative Party has said councils in Scotland have received more than 2,500 wind farm applications in the past 18 months.The party's figures indicate the local authorities facing the greatest workload in dealing with the proposals are Aberdeenshire, Highland and Orkney.The Conservatives said wind farms have become a "gravy train".The Scottish government said it has given councils additional funding to deal with the applications.The 2,508 applications represented, according to the Conservatives, seven every working day.Conservative energy spokesman Murdo Fraser said: "Alex Salmond has played to the gallery on this one, but the figures show the rush of wind farm applications remains intense."These applications put council planning departments under immense strain, and cause great concern to communities worried about the impact a massive wind farm on their doorstep will have."And even if a council does reject an application, there is a good chance the turbine-hungry Scottish government will overturn the ruling in pursuit of its own overly green policies."Mr Fraser added: "This surge has to stop, and the way to do that is ending ludicrous subsidies for an unreliable and intermittent energy source, and stop inviting companies to develop in areas which are clearly unsuitable."We appreciate that wind farms have a place, but the fact there are seven wind farm applications a day in Scotland proves this is a gravy train threatening to career out of control."The Scottish government has said its policy represents a "balance" between different interests.A spokeswoman said: "We recognise that some planning authorities face pressure from the volume of wind turbine applications they receive, and have identified additional funds to assist them."Seventeen bids were received for additional funds and earlier this year £725,000 was made available to support all of those bids."Our policy on wind farm applications aims to strike an appropriate balance between Scotland's massive green energy potential and the need to satisfactorily address the impacts on communities and the environment."</body>

      <title>Editors warn over press charter plan</title>
      <description>A proposed royal charter on newspaper regulation risks a free press, the Society of Editors warns, but a senior Labour MP says they have nothing to fear.</description>

      <body>Press freedom is being put at risk by the government's proposed royal charter on newspaper regulation, the head of the Society of Editors has warned.Bob Satchwell said issues with the charter meant "you wouldn't have a free press any longer".Shadow culture secretary Harriet Harman said newspapers had nothing to fear from the all-party draft charter.Independent self-regulation is to be brought in after recommendations by the Leveson Inquiry.Mr Satchwell, executive director of the Society of Editors, which draws its members from across the press and TV industry, told the BBC there were "key problems" with the charter.He said: "You can't have a new system of regulation which is drawn up by and imposed by politicians."The things which are being proposed at the moment would be totally unconstitutional in the US and other countries."People in other countries, not just journalists, are looking at what's going on here at the moment with horror."Ms Harman - who said the "last thing" the government wanted was a situation "where politicians control the press" - urged newspapers to "try out" the proposed system."It's quite ironic because a system that's quite like this operates in Ireland and applies to our UK press for their Irish editions - they sign up to it and it hasn't caused any problems of politicians controlling the press."The Industry Steering Group, which represents national, regional and local newspaper publishers, said it would "closely study" the proposals.However, it said it was "impossible" to see that a regulator "imposed and controlled by politicians" would be "voluntary or independent"."This remains a charter written by politicians, imposed by politicians and controlled by politicians," it said in a statement.Many in the press are keen to get their own regulator set up as soon as possible.Daily Mail editor-in-chief Paul Dacre said the row between Ed Miliband and his newspaper over an article about the Labour leader's late father showed why politicians should not be involved in press regulation.Mr Dacre also claimed the "hysteria" which followed Geoffrey Levy's article was "symptomatic of the post-Leveson age".In an article published in the Guardian and in his own paper, he said: "Some have argued that last week's brouhaha shows the need for statutory press regulation. I would argue the opposite."The febrile heat, hatred, irrationality and prejudice provoked by last week's row reveals why politicians must not be allowed anywhere near press regulation."Media lawyer Mark Lewis, who represented some of the victims of phone hacking, said newspapers had "failed completely with self-regulation and now they're telling the public this is statutory regulation, this is control over what's in the paper"."It's nothing like that at all," he added.Former News of the World executive editor Neil Wallis told the BBC there was no chance of the charter being implemented.He said: "The idea that politicians can have any say in any way in the running of a free press is simply laughable."He added there had already been a "chilling effect" on the press following the Leveson Inquiry.Cross-party political agreement on regulation comes after months of wrangling since Sir Brian Leveson published his report into press ethics and practices.The Leveson Inquiry was set up amid public and political anger at the extent of phone hacking by journalists, first exposed when it emerged that the now-closed News of the World had accessed the voicemail messages of murdered teenager Milly Dowler.The all-party draft proposals include plans for:The all-party charter states that changes to regulation could be made only with a two-thirds majority in Parliament.Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the deal would safeguard the freedom of the press and the future of local newspapers.Hacked Off, which campaigns on behalf of victims of press intrusion, said changes to the draft proposals meant there was no reason for the press to refuse to back the charter.The proposals will be put to the Privy Council for final agreement on 30 October.</body>

      <title>Hammond dismisses MoD cuts claims</title>
      <description>The defence secretary strenuously rejects claims he is leading an "overzealous" austerity drive which is forcing unnecessary cuts upon the armed forces.</description>

      <body>Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has strenuously rejected claims he is leading an "overzealous" austerity drive which is forcing unnecessary cuts to be made to the armed forces."Senior commanders", quoted by the Daily Telegraph, have criticised a reported £1.8bn underspend in the Ministry of Defence's 2012-13 budget.But Mr Hammond said his critics had "no idea how the defence budget now works".The Ministry of Defence described the complaints as "financially illiterate".In May 2012, Mr Hammond told Parliament the MoD had finally balanced its books for the first time in a decade, and said the £38bn "black hole" he blamed on the previous Labour government would be eliminated.In recent months, tens of thousands of jobs have been cut, bases closed and equipment contracts cancelled.According to the Telegraph, the MoD's accounts show it spent £37.7bn of its £39.5bn budget in 2012-13.The unspent £1.8bn reportedly included £250m from the budget for new equipment, and £200m from the wage bill which was saved because more personnel than expected chose to leave.The paper quoted one "senior MoD" figure as saying: "Philip Hammond is being overzealous in his pursuit of austerity at the MoD. His cuts to the budget have been unnecessarily hard."Another senior military officer told the paper: "The MoD can hardly expect the Treasury to increase the budget for capital equipment when we can't even spend the budget we've been allocated. It just makes us look incompetent."But in his statement, Mr Hammond said: "These retired 'senior military figures' are presumably the same people who presided over an out of control defence budget that led to the previous government sending troops into battle without the proper equipment needed to protect them."They clearly have no idea how the defence budget now works. Instead of having to delay and cancel programmes as in the past, we now budget prudently and then roll forward any underspend to future years, allowing us to place new equipment orders."An MoD spokesman said the underspend was the result of "better control of equipment projects, the release of contingency funds as projects mature and a conscious decision not to spend money on contracts until we need to"."Rather than rushing money out of the door for the sake of it within a financial year, we are committing money as and when projects require it."Mr Hammond was heckled at the recent Conservative Party conference by a retired Army colonel unhappy at plans to axe the second battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers.Shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker said it was clear senior military figures had "grave concerns about the management of the defence budget and the ability of ministers to take tough decisions".He added: "Morale amongst our troops and their families is at an all-time low. Philip Hammond needs to get a grip. He looks like an out of touch defence secretary and confidence in his leadership is rapidly diminishing."</body>

      <title>The land of hope is Tory - Cameron</title>
      <description>David Cameron says the Tories are the party of "the many, not the few" in a conference speech also trailing possible benefit cuts for young people.</description>

      <body>David Cameron vowed to get behind business to create a "land of opportunity for all", in his big speech to close the Conservative conference.His 50-minute address sought to set out dividing lines with "the 1970s-style socialism" he said Labour now offered.He claimed the economy was "turning the corner" and the "land of hope is Tory", while "the land of despair was Labour".Mr Cameron also hinted that benefits for under-25s could be cut in an effort to get more young people into work.But Labour said the prime minister had failed to address the "cost-of-living crisis" and offered a land of opportunity "for just a privileged few".During the 50-minute speech, Mr Cameron contrasted his own party's philosophy with that of the opposition, saying: "If Labour's plan for jobs is to attack business, ours is to back business."He criticised Labour leader Ed Miliband, who promised in his end-of-conference address last week to freeze energy prices and increase corporate tax on big firms, telling Tory activists that "profits, tax cuts and enterprise... are not dirty, elitist words".Mr Cameron argued that adding more state borrowing and spending to ease the "cost-of-living crisis" would risk putting the UK on the economic trajectory of Greece."It's all sticking plasters and quick fixes cobbled together for the TV cameras - Red Ed and his Blue Peter economy, " said the prime minister.Earlier in the week, Chancellor George Osborne announced plans to make the long-term unemployed undertake work placements if they want to continue receiving benefits.In his speech, Mr Cameron did not make any specific policy announcements, but suggested his party was looking at further changes to the welfare system to include in its manifesto for the 2015 general election.It was wrong that young people could "choose the dole" and right to "offer them something better".Mr Cameron added: "And let no one paint ideas like this as callous."Think about it: with your children, would you dream of just leaving them to their own devices, not getting a job, not training, nothing?"No - you'd nag and push and guide and do anything to get them on their way… and so must we. So this is what we want to see: everyone under 25 - earning or learning."Mr Cameron, who did not repeat previous no-notes speeches, often looked straight into the lens of the TV camera to address directly the audience outside the Manchester conference centre.The BBC's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said it was a surprisingly sober speech in parts, with Mr Cameron stressing there was still much work to do to fix Britain's economy.It was not enough just to clean up Labour's "mess" and pay off the deficit, he wanted to "build something better in its place".He added: "In place of the casino economy, one where people who work hard can actually get on; in place of the welfare society, one where no individual is written off; in place of the broken education system, one that gives every child the chance to rise up and succeed."Mr Cameron invoked the spirit of his predecessor Margaret Thatcher, the winner of three general elections, who died earlier this year, saying she had "made our country stand tall again, at home and abroad".He also made efforts to distance his party, and himself, from the Liberal Democrats, with whom the Tories have ruled in coalition for more than three years.He promised: "When the election comes, we won't be campaigning for a coalition, we will be fighting heart and soul for a majority Conservative government - because that is what our country needs..."This party at its heart is about big people, strong communities, responsible businesses, a bigger society - not a bigger state."To cheers, Mr Cameron attacked the Lib Dems for "trying to take all the credit" for lowering the minimum earnings threshold at which people start paying income tax.He joked: "Well, memo to the Lib Dems: you lecturing us on low taxes is like us lecturing you on pointless constitutional tinkering."We are Tories, we believe in low taxes and, believe me, we will keep on cutting the taxes of hard-working people in our country."Mr Cameron received a standing ovation after the speech, his ninth to conference since becoming leader in 2005.But, afterwards, Labour leader Ed Miliband said the prime minister had offered nothing to address "the cost-of-living crisis facing Britain's hard-working families".The Lib Dems said they, not the Conservatives, had made a manifesto commitment in 2010 to raise the level at which people start paying tax to £10,000.And UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the pro-business message conflicted with the reality that membership of the EU was costing the UK "billions in red tape and direct payments from high taxes".But there was a more favourable response from business groups, with CBI director-general John Cridland saying the prime minister had "sent out a strong message about how vital British business is to the future prosperity of people across the UK".Simon Walker, director-general of the Institute of Directors also welcomed the speech, but warned that firms would "be looking for him to match the sentiment with action - if tax cuts aren't dirty, let's have a few more of them".</body>

      <title>Miliband: We'll freeze energy prices</title>
      <description>Ed Miliband tells his party conference Labour will freeze energy prices if they get into power - but energy firms criticise the plan.</description>

      <body>Labour would freeze gas and electricity bills for every home and business in the UK for 20 months if it wins the 2015 election, Ed Miliband has said.The big energy firms would be split up and governed by a new tougher regulator to give people "a fairer deal".Labour says the move will save average households £120 and businesses £1,800 - but cost the energy giants £4.5bn.But energy companies said the policy could lead to power shortages, and jeopardise investment and jobs.The Labour leader said firms had been overcharging "for too long" and it was time to "reset" the energy market.The Tories accused him of a "sleight of hand", saying people would have to "pay more for their electricity" under the plans.Speaking for more than hour without notes at his party's annual conference in Brighton, Mr Miliband set out his vision of how "Britain can do better" under Labour, with an economy that works for "ordinary people once again".In other developments at Labour's conference:Mr Miliband used his speech to pledge action on what he has called Britain's "cost of living crisis", setting out an alternative vision of Britain's economy to that pursued by the Conservatives, with higher skills and wages."David Cameron talks about Britain being in a global race. But what he doesn't tell you is that he thinks the only way Britain can win is for you to lose."Mr Miliband said that means "the lowest wages, the worst terms and conditions, and the fewest rights at work - a race to the bottom", adding: "The only way we can win is in a race to the top."In an upbeat speech peppered with swipes at David Cameron and George Osborne for being out touch and lacking aspiration for the country, Mr Miliband repeatedly used the phrase "We're Britain, we're better than this" to cheers and applause from Labour activists.He received standing ovations for defending the NHS and promising to axe "the bedroom tax" - and tackled Tory criticism that he lacks leadership skills head-on, saying: "If they want to have a debate about leadership and character - be my guest."Unlike David Cameron, he told the party faithful, he had stood up to vested interests on media regulation and the tobacco lobby and made the right call on Syria. There was no mention in the speech of Mr Cameron's coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats.Explaining what he believes has gone wrong with the economy under the coalition, he said: "Too many of the jobs we're creating in this country are just too low paid, too many of the gains in our economy are just scooped up by the privileged few, including those big bonuses, and too often you are left being charged over the odds."They used to say 'a rising tide lifts all boats'. Now the rising tide just seems to lift yachts."The Labour leader has used his week in Brighton to set out some of the policies on which he will fight the next election but saved what is likely to be one of the centrepieces of the manifesto for his big speech.He vowed to abolish energy watchdog Ofgem and replace it with a new regulatory regime that ensures customers get a "fair deal"."We will legislate for this in our first Queen's Speech and it will come into effect in 2017," the Labour leader told activists."But in the meantime I am not willing to just stand by. So the next Labour government will freeze gas and electricity prices until the start of 2017."Your bills will be frozen, benefitting millions of families and millions of businesses. That's what I mean by a government that fights for you, that's what I mean when I say: Britain can do better than this."The companies won't like it because it will cost them money. But they have been overcharging people for too long because of a market that doesn't work. It is time to reset the market."Labour says the energy giants have been overcharging customers to the tune of £3.9bn since 2010 by not passing on reductions in wholesale prices to consumers.The party denies that the policy is a return to discredited "price controls" of the 1970s, arguing it is a temporary measure aimed at helping consumers while the party sets up a new regulator, which would force firms to openly sell their wholesale energy in a pooled market.But RWE npower, one of the big six energy firms targeted by Labour, criticised what it said were "easy", "simple solutions"."In reality, there are three main factors that influence prices - fixing inefficient housing stock, the investment required to replace the UK's energy infrastructure, and the cost of the buying energy on the global market," said chief executive Paul Massara.Another firm, SSE, said bills were rising because of "well-intentioned" government initiatives, not fuel costs.Chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said: "Instead of price freezes which will lead to unsustainable loss-making retail businesses, the Labour Party should put policy costs into general taxation, taking them off energy bills."Angela Knight, of industry body Energy UK, said freezing prices could hit the sector, making "energy shortages a reality, pushing up the prices for everyone".In his speech Mr Miliband also pledged to help small firms by freezing business rates in England, paid for by halting a planned increase in UK-wide corporation tax for large companies.And he said that by 2020 under Labour 200,000 houses would be built a year, with a fresh generation of new towns and "garden cities".An incoming Labour government would also scrap the £1,3bn Energy Companies Obligation, launched earlier this year to make the energy giants improve efficiency, and replace it with a more "cost-effective" regime.Unite union general secretary Len McCluskey said he was "pleased" with some of the issues raised by Mr Miliband."The most important thing was he highlighted the problems with the minimum wage and low pay and that fact that wage depression is something that needs to be tackled," he added.But John Longworth, from the British Chambers of Commerce, said talking about "controlling prices and wages sends a very bad signal" to businesses.John Cridland, from the CBI, said the plan "will deter much-needed investment" and would be viewed by business as "a setback for Labour's pro-enterprise credentials".Every Labour activist in the hall was given a copy of a book called One Nation Economy after the leader's speech.</body>

      <title>We must stay in government - Clegg</title>
      <description>The Lib Dems must be part of a coalition government after the next election to stop the Tories or Labour "messing up", Nick Clegg tells his party conference.</description>

      <body>Nick Clegg has urged the British people to put the Liberal Democrats back in government in 2015 to curb the excesses of the Tories or Labour."We are the only party that can finish the job of economic recovery, but finish it fairly," he told the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow.After three years of coalition Britain was now a "step closer" to the death of single party government, he claimed.He also spoke at length about his family and personal values.The BBC News Channel's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said Mr Clegg stuck to the argument he has been making all week - namely that coalition government works and the Lib Dems want another go at it.In a 51-minute speech aimed at preventing the Conservatives from claiming all the credit for the economic upturn, Mr Clegg said Lib Dem policies such as infrastructure spending and more apprenticeships had made all the difference."The big question mark that has always hung over the Liberal Democrats - could we handle government? And handle it when the going got tough? - that question mark is now gone."This recovery wouldn't be happening without us."He said Lib Dems had proved wrong the critics who said coalition would never work - but he also looked ahead to the next election, saying that "left to their own devices" Labour or the Tories would "mess it up".Speaking openly about forming a power sharing deal with the two bigger parties - something he avoided doing before the last election - he said: "Labour would wreck the recovery. The Conservatives would give us the wrong kind of recovery."He listed a series of Conservative policies which he claimed the Lib Dems had blocked, including "inheritance tax cuts for millionaires, profit-making in schools, firing workers at will, regional pay for public sector workers, scrapping housing benefit for young people, ditching the human rights act and closing down the debate on Trident".But he stressed that the Lib Dems were "no-one's little brother", adding: "We have our own values and beliefs."The speech contained no new policies, following Tuesday's headline-grabbing announcement on free lunches for all children in their first three years at school in England.Saying Lib Dems would extend the scheme to all primary school children, he said: "Their (the Conservatives) priority is to help some families over others, with a tax break for married couples."That tells you everything you need to know about their values."By contrast, he said his party was helping "young children get the best possible start in life, and that tells you everything about ours".The Lib Dem leadership have seen off challenges from activists to its nuclear weapons and economic policies, although delegates voted for a review of housing benefit rules - what critics call the "bedroom tax".And he scoffed at suggestions that coalition was all about personal chemistry between the party leaders, saying any coalition depended on the result of the election.In what will be seen as a hint that he is thinking of stepping down after the next election, he told activists in Glasgow that he "will not be in politics forever".But he used the speech to set out how his liberal values came to be formed, his "privileged" childhood and his "internationalist" outlook.He said the Lib Dems had always backed "home rule" for Scotland but would be urging a "no" vote in next year's independence referendum to keep the UK together.But he hoped the cross-party consensus would continue after the referendum to push for "the next advance in Scottish devolution".And he said the Lib Dems would be the party of "in" when it came to an EU referendum.Summing up what his pitch would be at the next election, he said: "In the past the Liberal Democrats would eke out an existence on the margins of British politics."Now we hold the liberal centre while our opponents head left and right. I have spent my entire life watching the other two mess it up. We cannot stand idly by and let them do it all over again."Lib Dem colleagues praised Mr Clegg's "intensely personal speech" but Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman said that, far from restraining the Conservatives, the Lib Dems had backed them all the way."He didn't mention the million young people out of work on his watch, the tax cuts for millionaires his party helped to introduce, or the cost of living crisis that means that since he became deputy prime minister wages are down an average of £1,500 a year," she added."Nothing he said today made any difference to the fact that Nick Clegg is propping up a Tory-led government that's making things worse for ordinary families."</body>

      <body>Britain would flourish outside the EU, Nigel Farage has said, predicting UKIP will cause a "political earthquake" in European elections next year.Addressing the party's annual conference, he said leaving the union would "open a door to the world".He described his party as the "true Europeans" as he claimed credit for shifting the terms of the debate on immigration and holding a referendum.But the speech was overshadowed by a row over remarks by MEP Godfrey Bloom.Mr Bloom has had the whip removed after he referred to a group of female activists as "sluts" - although he maintained that it was meant and taken as a joke.UKIP has reached unprecedented heights in the opinion polls under Mr Farage, coming second in the European elections in 2009 and winning hundreds of seats in the May local elections.Mr Farage has refused to predict how the party's Westminster candidates would fare in an election in 2015 but said he wants to turn the next European elections "into a referendum on EU membership"."My ambition and my conviction is that we can come first across the United Kingdom," he told activists."Let us send an earthquake through Westminster politics and let's say we want our country back."The party has sought to broaden its appeal beyond its core message of EU withdrawal, announcing policies in recent days on energy and welfare.But, in a speech dominated by Europe, Mr Farage said the European Commission had "hijacked" the EU's original ideals and the UK would begin a process of "national renewal" by going its own way.Those who warn that British trade would be harmed by a UK exit were the "true voices of Little England", he told party members."Those 10,000 trucks a day coming in from the Continent bringing goods into this country. They won't stop coming," he said."The idea that the EU will start a trade war with Britain is simply not credible. The real reason the EU won't be able or willing to stop trading with us is that the German car industry won't allow it."UKIP was growing in strength and, by the time of the next election, Mr Farage said it would be the third largest party in the country in terms of membership, overtaking the Liberal Democrats.The party is meeting just days after one of its former deputy leaders quit the organisation, frustrated by what he had described as its "totalitarian" leadership.Mike Nattrass, West Midlands MEP and a member for 15 years, accused Mr Farage of silencing dissent and surrounding himself with "cronies".But Mr Farage, by far the party's best-known figure, outlined his popularity with voters, saying in his speech: "They are fed up to the back teeth with the cardboard cut-out careerists in Westminster, the spot-the-difference politicians... the politicians who daren't say what they really mean."While there was no mention of the members who quit in protest at his leadership, he acknowledged internal clashes.Mr Farage told party members he had a "blistering row" with Godfrey Bloom, the UKIP MEP who courted controversy recently by claiming British foreign aid goes to "bongo-bongo land".Alluding to the comments, he referred to "public pronouncements that I would not always choose myself" and urged those with passionate views to focus on the "big messages".Immigration was the "biggest single issue facing" the UK, he said, as he warned of an "even darker side to the opening of the door".He claimed London had been gripped by a "Romanian crime wave"."This gets to the heart of immigration," he said. "We should not be opening our doors on 1 January to Romanian criminal gangs."The "Establishment" had dismissed anyone wanting to debate immigration as "bad and racist", he claimed.UKIP gained 16.5% of the popular vote, second only to the Conservatives, in the 2009 European elections and returned 13 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs).But, at the 2010 general election, support dwindled to 3.1% and UKIP did not win a Westminster seat.Earlier on Friday, the party's energy spokesman Roger Helmer announced it would invest profits from shale gas extraction in a sovereign wealth fund.The two-day conference is also set to discuss plans to ensure migrants have private health insurance and for social housing to be prioritised for people whose parents or grandparents were born locally.</body>

      <title>Poots breached code over gay blood</title>
      <description>Stormont's health minister did not have the power to keep in place a lifetime ban on gay men giving blood in Northern Ireland, a High Court judge rules.</description>

      <body>Stormont's health minister did not have the power to keep an "irrational" lifetime ban on gay men giving blood in Northern Ireland, a judge has ruled.The High Court judge also found that Edwin Poots had breached the ministerial code by failing to take the issue before the Stormont Executive.The Department of Health said Mr Poots would "read and consider" the verdict.The complete ban, put in place during the 1980s, was lifted in England, Scotland and Wales in November 2011.It was replaced by new rules that allow blood from men whose last sexual contact with another man was more than a year ago.The 12-month deferral was left in place following a Government Advisory Committee report.It identified a much shorter period during which infection with blood-borne viruses could not be detected.Mr Poots maintained the ban in Northern Ireland on the basis of ensuring public safety.But a gay man granted anonymity due to his perceived vulnerability launched a judicial review challenge to Mr Poots' position on blood donation.The judge heard claims that the minister had displayed apparent bias that went beyond religious beliefs and into the realms of prejudice.It was revealed in court that despite the unidentified applicant's sexual orientation, he has become a born-again Christian who now disapproves of homosexual practices.Attorney General John Larkin QC, the chief legal adviser to the Stormont Executive, questioned the legitimacy of the challenge.He claimed the challenge was a waste of time because the applicant had previously had sex for money.Mr Larkin rejected arguments that the issue required full executive approval and questioned whether the minister had made a decision to maintain the current ban.However, the judge said that in continuing the lifetime deferral policy the minister had deviated from the position taken in England, Scotland and Wales.He said the decision was made against the secretary of state's recommendation that the report from the advisory committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) should be followed.The judge held that the additional risk from deferring donation for 12 months, instead of permanently, was very minimal.He said: "The minister has decided that MSM (males who have sex with other males) behaviour creates such a high risk of infection to the donor that such donors must be permanently deferred with the result that such blood cannot enter the Northern Ireland blood stock."Importing blood from other places which do accept MSM donors, even in limited quantities, leaves the door open for MSM blood to do just that."There is clearly a defect in reason here."Applying different standards to imported blood defeats the whole purpose of a permanent deferral, he added.Declaring the decision irrational, he said: "If there is a genuine concern about the safety of MSM-donated blood, such that the blood stock must be protected absolutely from such blood, then the security of that blood must actually be maintained absolutely."Dealing with the alleged breach of the ministerial code, the judge said the lifetime ban was both controversial and cross-cutting, taking in equality issues."As such the minister had no authority to act without bringing them to the attention of the Executive Committee which he failed to do."In doing so the minister breached the ministerial code and... had no legal authority to take a decision in breach of the ministerial code."In response to the judgement, a spokesperson for UK Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "We will consider the potential implications of this judgement on UK blood policy."Sinn Féin assembly member Maeve McLaughlin, who is currently the chair of Stormont's health committee, said: "The decision raises in many people's minds serious questions as to whether Edwin Poots has the ability to carry out his duties as health minister for all."She added: "It goes without saying that we need to have robust screening of blood, whoever it comes from. Discriminating against people from within our community who are prepared to give blood, which would be used to save lives, needs to be reversed immediately."Alliance Party health spokesman Kieran McCarthy said the DUP MP's position as health minister had been "seriously compromised" and he should "consider his position"."He has been badly advised and now has serious questions to answer. Not only has he wasted public funds, but he also acted to prejudice one section of society in Northern Ireland," he said.John O'Doherty of the Rainbow Project, a gay advocacy organisation, said: "This ruling is a shocking indictment of the conduct of Minister Poots, who has proven himself incapable of separating his personal prejudices from his public responsibilities."</body>

      <title>Grangemouth strike talks to be held</title>
      <description>The operator of the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical site is to begin talks with union bosses in a bid to avert a planned 48-hour strike.</description>

      <body>The operator of the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical site is to begin talks with union bosses in a bid to avert a planned 48-hour strike.Members of the Unite union are planning to walk out on Sunday in a row over the treatment of a union convener.Ineos, operator of the site, said negotiations would start later at arbitration service Acas, in Glasgow.Unite said it had been "working tirelessly" over the weekend to secure the talks.Ineos has warned that the threatened strike "could effectively shut much of Scotland" by disrupting fuel supply.The strike could potentially disrupt the flow of Brent crude from the North Sea.The Scottish and UK governments have been drawing up contingency plans and had called for more talks between the two sides.Announcing the talks on Sunday night, Ineos Grangemouth chairman Calum MacLean said: "We have always been prepared to go to Acas if this helps to resolve a strike that Grangemouth petrochemical plant and refinery cannot afford."We hope to be able to resolve the dispute and address the financial issues that threaten the survival of the entire site."Previously, the company labelled the union action as "completely irresponsible" while the union accused Ineos of "gunboat irresponsible diplomacy".Unite Scottish Secretary Pat Rafferty said: "We welcome Ineos's change of heart to join us at Acas."We've repeatedly urged the company to sit down with us at the conciliation service to resolve the issues surrounding the unfair treatment of our convenor and the future of Grangemouth."Over the weekend we have been working tirelessly to secure these talks and hope that the company will engage in them in an open constructive manner."UK Energy Secretary Ed Davey said the talks were a "very welcome and encouraging step."He added: "I have worked hard with both sides to persuade them to attend talks with Acas and I am extremely pleased that this is now happening."Acas has the expertise to help both parties reach a sustainable solution for the company, the workforce and the whole economy."A spokeswoman for the Scottish government said contingency planning had been under way since the strike was announced.She said: "Ministers and officials have redoubled efforts to encourage Unite and Ineos to enter talks and we welcome the fact that they are now going to talk this afternoon."It is important that both sides have time and space to progress discussions, resolve the issues between them and move away from strike action."Ineos has said it will do all it can to "minimise the harm" of a strike.The North Sea's Forties pipeline system could be affected because the Kinneil oil processing terminal - where oil from the Forties field comes ashore - relies on Grangemouth for its steam and power.The dispute centres on union convener Stephen Deans, who was involved in the row over the selection of a Labour candidate in Falkirk.Labour cleared Unite after an investigation of trying to rig the selection of a party candidate - claims that led to a major row between the union and Ed Miliband.Mr Deans, who is chairman of both Labour's local constituency party and Unite in Scotland, was suspended by Ineos then reinstated.Ineos said an investigation by "a third party" into Mr Deans' conduct was due to be completed by 25 October.It recently launched a survival plan for Grangemouth, warning that the site would close by 2017 without investment and reduced costs. The company said the plant was losing £10m a month.The Grangemouth refinery processes 210,000 barrels of oil per day and provides most of Scotland's fuel. It is owned jointly by Ineos and PetroChina.</body>

      <title>Junk food tax not ruled out by Plaid</title>
      <description>Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood says she won't rule out introducing a tax on junk food if her party wins power in 2016.</description>

      <body>Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood won't rule out a tax on junk food if her party wins the assembly election in 2016.She told BBC Sunday Politics Wales that money raised from such a tax should subsidise "good quality wholesome food" for people.Ms Wood unveiled at Plaid's conference on Friday a proposal for levy on sugary drinks of up to 20p a litre.She said that policy would finance the recruitment of 1,000 extra doctors.Asked whether she would build on the introduction of a sugary drinks levy and start taxing items like chocolate and crisps, Ms Wood said: "I wouldn't rule out taxing junk food."What I would want to do with any additional monies raised from that is to ensure that good quality wholesome food can be provided cheaper and everywhere for people because that's a big problem at the moment."It's a crazy situation that you can buy poor quality food - food that's bad for you, food that is more likely to make you obese - than you can find good quality food in many parts of Wales."That's a ridiculous situation," Ms Wood said."Governments everywhere use taxation to incentivise and dis-incentivise various behaviours."I'm not announcing now that we are going to introduce a tax on burgers for example but I do think something needs to be done about the proliferation of fast food outlets in our communities."There are far far too many, it's too easy and too cheap and very, very bad for people," said Ms Wood.A spokesman for Wales Labour, responding to the sugary drinks levy idea, said: "Linking the promotion of an unhealthy lifestyle, in order to pay for improved medical services, is a not sensible way forward."This ill-thought idea, shows how out of touch and out of ideas Plaid are."But the Liberal Democrat AM for Mid and West Wales William Powell, who also chairs the assembly petitions committee, said that there could be a role for government in this area."There's certainly merit in looking at a raft of proposals to encourage sensible behaviours in terms of diet," he said."In fact the committee that I chair - the petitions committee - just last year was looking at a petition to create a cordon around all schools to ban hot food takeaways from offering attractive, tasty but ultimately very unhealthy food options to pupils that they would readily take because that's what kids do," said Mr Powell.In January Wales' chief medical officer has suggested banning fast food outlets near schools.Dr Ruth Hussey said keeping children in school at lunchtime and providing healthy meals could help tackle obesity.</body>

      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant?What has happened?Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning.Why the big deal about the speech?Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech.So what did Cameron say?Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech.What sorts of powers does the UK want back?The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK."Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders?The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK.So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU?David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market."What has been the reaction in the UK?Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement.Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party.The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts.What about the reaction around Europe?The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction.What about the reaction from business?A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".Where can I get more detail on the speech?If you click on the link below you can read the whole text, with key bits picked out and analysed by BBC expertsAnnotated transcipt: Key excerpts</body>

      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his October 2013 reshuffle.The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction.He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire.The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011.As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper.Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children.The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign.Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle.

      <title>UK immigration acts through the ages</title>
      <description>At-a-glance guide to a century of British immigration acts</description>

      <body>The government has published its Immigration Bill, which will change the rules on access to the NHS and impose tougher penalties for illegal working. But what legislation has been passed over the last century or so?This targeted "undesirable aliens" - such as paupers, lunatics, vagrants and prostitutes - who could be refused entry.This granted the common status of British subject upon those persons who had specified connections with the Crown's dominions.The Empire's dominions each adopted their separate citizenships, but retained the common status of British subject.This required certain potential migrants to supply proof that either they, their parents or grandparents had been born in Britain.Commonwealth citizens lost their automatic right to remain in the UK, meaning they faced the same restrictions as those from elsewhere. They would in future only be allowed to remain in UK after they had lived and worked here for five years.A partial "right of abode" was introduced, lifting all restrictions on immigrants with a direct personal or ancestral connection with Britain.This act ensured that only one wife or widow of a polygamous marriage had a right to enter the country.It also ensured people with freedom of movement in the European Community did not need leave to enter or remain in the UK.It became a criminal offence to employ anyone unless they had permission to live and work in the UK.The act removed benefits from asylum seekers and created the National Asylum Service to house them, taking pressure off local authorities.This created the first English test and citizenship exam for immigrants and introduced measures against bogus marriages.This act introduced a single form of appeal that remains to this day and made it a criminal offence to destroy travel documents. It limited access to support for those told to leave the UK.A five-tier points system for awarding entry visas was created.Those refused work or study visas had their rights of appeal limited.The act brought in on-the-spot fines of £2,000, payable by employers for each illegal employee, which could include parents taking on nannies without visas.This provided the UK Border Agency with powers to tackle illegal working and automatically deport some foreign nationals imprisoned for specific offences, or for more than one year.It gave immigration officers police-like powers, such as increased detention and a search-and-entry roles.The act brought in the power to create compulsory biometric cards for non-EU immigrants.This act amended the rules so people from outside the European Economic Area had to have residential status for eight years before being eligible for naturalisation.Those seeking naturalisation through wedlock had to be married for five years first.The act also allowed immigration and customs officers to perform some of each other's roles and imposed a duty on home secretaries to safeguard children.</body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Help to Buy mortgage scheme</title>
      <description>How will the new mortgage scheme work?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24447335</url>

      <body>The government says that its Help to Buy scheme will assist people trying to get on the housing ladder who can afford mortgage repayments but are struggling to raise a deposit.But critics say that the government guarantee, that forms part of the second phase of the scheme, could create a housing bubble in the UK.Not all mortgage seekers will be able to sign up, and those who do will still have to go through "rigorous" affordability checks by their lender.Haven't I heard about this for a while?Yes, in fact some parts of the scheme have been operating for a few months.The first phase started in April in England. This sees the government offering a 20% equity loan to buyers of newly-built properties. These buyers must offer a 5% deposit.Similar schemes operate in Wales and Scotland - all of which are aimed at encouraging housebuilding.But that's not all, is it?No, the second phase of the scheme, originally planned for January 2014, has been brought forward so mortgage products are available from now.Under this system, borrowers across the UK can put down a deposit of as little as 5% of the property price. The lender offers a mortgage covering the other 95%.Lenders can sign up to the Help to Buy scheme and pay a fee to the government, which will provide a seven-year taxpayer guarantee covering 15% of the loan value. That guarantee can be called in if the borrower defaults.It is available for properties sold for up to £600,000 in the UK. The scheme is expected to continue for three years.Are the lenders keen?There has been a mixed response so far.RBS and Lloyds Banking Group - both of which are taxpayer backed - are participating in the second phase of Help to Buy.Smaller lenders Virgin Money and Aldermore have announced that they will be involved as well, from January.Barclays and Santander have also said they would join, but have yet to give details. Nationwide Building Society have yet to decide.How much do these mortgages cost?A few lenders have started to reveal the pricing of these 95% mortgages.RBS and NatWest are offering a two-year, fixed-rate mortgage starting at 4.99% for those with a 5% deposit, with no fee.Halifax will be taking applications in a few days at a rate of 5.19% with a £995 fee for those with the same deposit.That is relatively competitive compared with prices outside of Help to Buy, although borrowers are likely to get a better deal if they save up longer for a deposit. These 95% mortgages have all but disappeared from the market since the start of the financial crisis.Is there a chance of a return of irresponsible lending?The government says that various rules have been included to ensure this does not happen.For example, no interest-only or offset mortgages will be allowed. The system cannot be used for the purchase of second homes or for mortgages for buy-to-let investors.In addition, lenders must put these borrowers through new affordability checks. These were brought in for everyone to avoid a return of the reckless lending of the last boom.You mention boom, isn't this just going to create another one?That's the fear from many commentators who say that Help to Buy is simply going to help some relatively well-off people move up the housing ladder.Critics, including Labour, say that this does nothing to tackle the shortage of affordable homes to buy, so it wants more focus on housebuilding.Treasury officials suggest that the system will correct a failure in the market and stimulate builders to get going again with bricks and mortar.</body>

      <title>The reshuffled face of politics</title>
      <description>What impact will the frontbench changes have?</description>

      <body>Reshuffles. Like the old cliché about buses, you wait ages for one then three come along at once. But how much of an impact will the latest changes in personnel have?Inside the coalition, the Conservative and Lib Dem leaders independently decided the fate of their ministers.And Ed Miliband, no longer encumbered with a shadow cabinet chosen by his MPs, had a free hand to promote fresh talent.But has the political territory shifted, or is it just the personalities that have been moved?In some ways, the face of politics is changing.Across the board, women are taking more prominent roles - so far, a net increase of four in government, and 44% of Labour's shadow cabinet are female.Among the beneficiaries are two former stars of GMTV - Esther McVey for the Conservatives, and Labour's Gloria De Piero.The equation telegenic + down to earth = promotion has been proven. Though some rather less telegenic but talented people have done well too.For the Conservatives, the reshuffle has also, in part, been about class as well as gender.That isn't a misprint.For the Conservatives, the reshuffle has also, in part, been about class.What some of our tabloid colleagues have depicted as a process of replacing the "top hats" with the "flat caps".In fact Monday didn't really amount to a revolution in millinery. It's simply that some of those who haven't been to public school are winning more prominence.Racing up the junior ranks is Sajid Javid, son of a bus driver from Rochdale.And Mike Penning - a plain-speaking former soldier and fireman - will welcome the challenge of taking the heat for welfare reforms. As a former spokesman for Iain Duncan Smith, he should, at least, have a good working relationship with his boss.So expect some of the non-cabinet ministers to speak with less expensive accents.Allies of the chancellor have also done well from the reshuffle: the aforementioned Mr Javid; Matthew Hancock, a former chief of staff to George Osborne; and the former Treasury whip Greg Hands, are all moving up.Their careers may be moving forward but their advancement doesn't signal a change in direction.None of the better-known Conservative figures around the cabinet table have been moved - any purge at the top will await the outcome of next year's European parliament elections.It was, in fact, Nick Clegg rather than David Cameron that engaged in the night of the long knives. Or, rather, the long knife.It was plunged into the front rather than the back of Micheal Moore, the Secretary of State for Scotland.He had very competently carried out negotiations on the forthcoming referendum on Scottish independence.But now that thorny issues over timing and, crucially, what question to put to the Scottish people, have had been smoothed over, it was felt that it was time to move on from the constitutional niceties and in to campaigning mode.So step forward the robust figure of the former Lib Dem chief whip Alistair Carmichael, whose job it is now to tweak Alex Salmond's tail.But at more junior level, Jeremy Browne was dismissed. This surprised some at Westminster as he had been seen as close to Nick Clegg, and he could never be described as a coalition-sceptic. Certainly working with Conservative ministers didn't seem to trouble his conscience.So it's possible that the Lib Dem leader - while continuing to liaise closely with David Cameron's colleagues - also wants his own ministers to spell out the differences between the two coalition partners more clearly in the run-up to the next election.But even Lib Dems raised eyebrows at Mr Browne's replacement at the Home Office, the former transport minster Norman Baker, the author of a book alleging a cover-up over Dr David Kelly, the government scientist whose death led to the Hutton inquiry.At first glance Ed Miliband's reshuffle marks more of a shift in position - away from his party's Blairite past.At education, Stephen Twigg - who had praised a "free school" in his area and worked hard to find a way of reconciling Michael Gove's creations with Labour's existing (and more hostile) policy - has been dumped from the shadow cabinet, as has Liam Byrne - the former shadow work and pensions secretary who accepted the principle of a cap on benefits payments.And it just so happens that in an interview with the left-of-centre New Statesman earlier, the leader of the Unite trade union Len McCluskey had described both politicians in unflattering terms.Labour sources, naturally, say that Ed Miliband didn't discuss his reshuffle with union leaders.And certainly Tristram Hunt's appointment to replace Stephen Twigg hardly marks a lurch to the left.He is close to Peter Mandelson and was parachuted into his Stoke constituency at the last election with the blessing of the then leadership.And while he has reportedly described free schools as "a vanity project for yummy mummies", expect him to champion "parent-led academies" in the future .Rather, he represents a bit of generational shift - someone who is younger than the Labour leader (not yet 40) and who can potentially appeal beyond the Westminster village - albeit to viewers of TV history shows on BBC Two and Four, rather than breakfast telly.Labour insiders say they wanted to make space for some of the 2010 intake who could prove to be energetic campaigners. That was more important than whether they were Brownite or Blairite, David or Ed.The new shadow women's and equalities minister Gloria De Piero is an admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as her party leader.And there was additional ballast against the "Blairite purge" stories - which some of the papers will write tomorrow - in the shape of Lord Falconer. He is Tony Blair's former flatmate and he has agreed to advise the party on the transition from opposition to government.The shunting of the former shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle to the environment brief has led to speculation that Labour is preparing to derail HS2.Instead, party sources insist, Mary Creagh's move to transport from shadowing Defra is a tribute to her campaigning flair during the horsemeat scandal.She is now going to be tasked with standing up not for the consumer but the commuter, arguing against higher fares as part of Labour's pre-election theme of tackling what it calls the cost-of-living crisis.But if she is a fan of HS2, she may have to turn her campaigning skills to greater effect against some of her shadow cabinet colleagues who think the money could be better spent.Amongst the sceptics is Ed Balls, supportive of the rail project in principle, but in practice stressing he can't back it "at any price".And the shadow chancellor, like his opposite number, will be pleased to see some of his key allies in important posts - including Rachel Reeves, his former number two, taking over the work and pensions brief, and Vernon Coaker moving to shadow defence.Michael Dugher, a redoubtable attack-dog who initially backed Ed Balls for leader, has been given a key role in planning for the next general election.He will be joined by Douglas Alexander (in addition to his foreign affairs role) and Spencer Livermore - the former Gordon Brown apparatchik who was - he believed unfairly - criticised by some of his colleagues for the handling of the 2007 election-that-never-was.Well, with fixed-term Parliaments now, there is little doubt when the next election will come.But perhaps the wider significance of the Labour reshuffle is what it says about the other Ed.The fact that Messrs Twigg and Byrne accepted demotions, and Jim Murphy moved from defence to international development, suggests that his leadership is secure - that there is no prospect of a shadowy group of Blairites outside of the shadow cabinet waiting - or campaigning - for Ed Miliband's political demise.At least, not this side of an election.So, in the days and months ahead, the battle lines will be more clearly drawn between rather than within the parties.</body>

      <title>EU law and budget: a video guide</title>
      <description>Matthew Price explains EU laws and budget</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23782683</url>

      <body>The EU has a reputation for being slow and cumbersome - largely because of the difficulty of getting agreement among 28 member states with different languages and traditions.Here BBC Europe correspondent Matthew Price gives a video guide to the complex bargaining that results in new EU laws and the EU budget.The right to initiate legislation in the EU belongs to the European Commission - the union's civil service and rule-enforcer.Usually Commission proposals go through many amendments before becoming law - a process that takes years.In most policy areas the Council of Ministers - representing EU governments - and the European Parliament reach joint decisions through negotiation. Their role is called "the ordinary legislative procedure". During their negotiations they come under pressure from lobby groups, for example industrial firms or environmentalists.Often EU laws arise because national governments and MEPs tell the Commission that there is a need for them. Public consultations, scientific research and impact assessments also feed into the legislation.Once a measure becomes EU law the member states have two years to adopt it nationally - "transpose" it, in the jargon. The Commission can fine them for failure to do so.The budget is one of the most contentious policy areas among the member states, whose priorities differ greatly. The 2013 EU budget is 132.8bn euros (£113bn; $178bn).The size of the budget has to be decided annually, but there is also a seven-year budget framework, agreed in advance so that money can be set aside for long-term projects.This year for the first time EU leaders agreed to cut the multi-year budget (for 2014-2020), under pressure from the UK and some other countries, including the Netherlands and Sweden.The eurozone crisis has exacerbated tensions in the budget negotiations. Net contributors to the budget - the richer countries including the UK - argue that it should reflect the tough austerity policies adopted nationally. But net beneficiaries, such as the new member states in Central and Eastern Europe, oppose EU cuts to key areas like agriculture and infrastructure projects.EU spending is a small fraction of what the national governments spend in total, but those governments have to pay for big public sector areas like education and health, which are largely outside the EU's remit.</body>

      <title>NHS Savile abuse probe widened</title>
      <description>The probe into Jimmy Savile's abuse of NHS patients has been extended to include more hospitals, says the health secretary.</description>

      <body>The investigation into Jimmy Savile's alleged abuse of patients at NHS hospitals has been extended to other hospitals, the health secretary says.The inquiry, currently focused on Broadmoor, Stoke Mandeville and Leeds General hospitals, as well as a further 10 trusts, will be expanded to include "other hospitals", Jeremy Hunt said.The hospitals were not named. A final report will be published in 2014.The late DJ is believed to have abused hundreds of victims.The former BBC presenter of Top Of The Pops and Jim'll Fix It, who also worked as a Radio 1 DJ and received a knighthood in 1990, died aged 84 in October 2011 - a year before the allegations were broadcast in an ITV documentary.Revelations that the famed fundraiser had sexually abused children prompted hundreds of victims to come forward, including those who said they were attacked on BBC premises and at a number of other institutions.Savile had a bedroom at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, an office and living quarters at Broadmoor, and widespread access to Leeds General Infirmary.Mr Hunt said: "It is vital that the final NHS investigation report is thorough and complete and reflects all the evidence about Jimmy Savile's pattern of offending."A Scotland Yard investigation into Savile's alleged crimes - one of three strands of Operation Yewtree - is due to report in the new year.The BBC understands it will put the number of alleged victims at over 500.The Department of Health investigation into the three hospitals is being overseen by barrister - and former deputy chairman of the Financial Ombudsman Service - Kate Lampard.In a written ministerial statement, Mr Hunt said: "The Metropolitan Police Service, working with Kate Lampard, has established there was further relevant information regarding Jimmy Savile."The Department of Health asked the Metropolitan Police Service, through an agreed information sharing process, to review information it held to ascertain if it included material related to health and care settings."The revelations about Savile have led to a number of inquiries.Firstly, the police investigation, Operation Yewtree, which has three strands.One is looking specifically at the actions of Savile, and the second strand concerns allegations against "Savile and others".The third strand relates to complaints against other people unconnected to the Savile investigations, made by people who came forward after widespread coverage of the scandal.The BBC has also launched three reviews, including the Pollard Review, which has already reported the findings of its investigation into the dropping of a Newsnight report into claims Savile was a paedophile; and a review by Dame Janet Smith into culture and practices during Savile's career and current policies.The director of public prosecutions is also reviewing decisions not to prosecute Savile in 2009.</body>

      <description>Police investigating Madeleine McCann's disappearance release e-fit images of a man they want to speak to as a matter of "vital importance".</description>

      <body>UK police investigating Madeleine McCann's disappearance have released two e-fits of a man they want to speak to as a matter of "vital importance".They will feature in a BBC Crimewatch appeal later over her disappearance on 3 May, 2007, in Praia da Luz, Portugal.Police said the man "may or may not be key" but had been placed in the area.The images are based on evidence from two witnesses who saw him on the night three-year-old Madeleine, from Rothley, Leicestershire, went missing.The witnesses said the man was white, 20 to 40 years old and of medium build. He had short brown hair, was clean-shaven and of medium height, they added.Det Ch Insp Andy Redwood, the senior Metropolitan Police investigating officer, said: "Whilst this man may or may not be the key to unlocking this investigation, tracing and speaking to him is of vital importance to us."We have witnesses placing him in the resort area around the time of Madeleine's disappearance."This is far from our only line of inquiry and there will be e-fits released of other sightings as well, who we are equally keen to trace."These people were seen on the day of Madeleine's disappearance and the days leading up to it."Madeleine went missing from a holiday flat in Praia da Luz, Algarve, as her parents dined with friends at a nearby restaurant.A Portuguese investigation into the case was dropped in 2008, but Scotland Yard began a review of the case in May 2011.On Sunday the Met said the timeline and "accepted version of events" surrounding Madeleine's disappearance had significantly changed, without giving further details.A detailed reconstruction lasting close to 25 minutes and covering events leading up to and surrounding Madeleine's disappearance will also feature on Monday's Crimewatch.Police say the appeal is based on "substantive" new material including mobile phone records.A short clip released in advance by police shows actors playing Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, leaving their holiday apartment for the nearby tapas restaurant.They are then seen seated outdoors at a large poolside table, greeting friends as they come to join them for dinner.Speaking about the review-turned-investigation, Det Ch Insp Redwood said detectives had been able to "make massive steps forward" by drawing together all the material gathered to date and reviewing it as a whole.He said his team had sought to "try and draw everything back to zero... take everything back to the beginning and then reanalyse and reassess everything, accepting nothing".He added: "Praia da Luz is a popular holiday destination for many nationalities so our requests for help need to be repeated in many different countries."He said he would travel to the Netherlands, Germany and Ireland to seek public support there, and would repeat the appeals in Portugal - "a key country for us to trace any outstanding witnesses".In Germany, a special edition of the crime programme Aktenzeichen XY - Ungeloest which is translated as "File XY - Unsolved", will be aired on Wednesday night and will feature an appeal for information from Mr and Mrs McCann.Det Ch Insp Redwood went on to urge anyone, including from the local community, who was in or around Praia da Luz on Thursday, 3 May 2007, to speak to police if they had not already done so."We still have a lot of material to investigate and much work to do," he added.Meanwhile former Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre head Jim Gamble - who carried out a review into the case in 2010 - said the appeal offered "an opportunity for everyone to help"."It doesn't matter that you were not in Praia da Luz - you may watch something, you may see an e-fit, you may see some other information, they may talk about telephone numbers and something will click with you," he told BBC News."And that you will not know unless you watch."Mr and Mrs McCann are expected to make a live appeal from the studio during the programme.Ahead of its broadcast, Mrs McCann said: "We're not the ones that have done something wrong here."It's the person who's gone into that apartment and taken a little girl away from her family."Meanwhile Robert Murat, the first official suspect in the case but long since cleared of any involvement, told the BBC he hoped the new appeal would produce results."It's gone on and on and every time something new comes up, you know, it brings hope and then it seems to fade away and disappear. So I'm hoping that's not going to be the case again," he said.The Crimewatch appeal will be shown in the UK on BBC One on Monday from 21:00 BST. It will also be broadcast in the Netherlands and Germany.</body>

      <body>The 2013 Nobel Prize in economics has been awarded to Eugene Fama, Lars Peter Hansen and Robert Shiller.It was awarded for their "empirical analysis of asset prices", according to the awarding committee.The committee said the trio's separate pieces of work had "laid the foundation for the current understanding of asset prices".The prize is worth 8m Swedish krona (£775,000; $1.2m), which will be shared equally among the three winners.Eugene Fama from the University of Chicago was praised for demonstrating that share prices are extremely difficult to predict in the short run, with new information quickly incorporated into prices.The committee said Mr Fama's findings had had "a profound impact" on subsequent research, and also changed market practice.Lars Peter Hansen, also from the University of Chicago, was awarded the prize for his development of a statistical method that was able to test theories on asset pricing.Robert Shiller, from Yale University, was included for his 1980s discovery that stock prices fluctuate much more than corporate dividends.The Nobel committees have now announced all six of their annual awards for 2013.The economics award was added to the existing Nobel award in 1968 by Sweden's central bank as a memorial to Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel.Mr Nobel created the other five prizes for medicine, chemistry, physics, literature and peace in 1895.</body>

      <body>Four men are being questioned over an alleged terror plot after they were arrested in a series of raids by armed police officers across London.The men - arrested at about 19:10 BST on Sunday in Whitechapel, Bayswater and Peckham - are being held on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.Searches are continuing at six addresses and on two vehicles.Whitehall officials said the alleged plot was "potentially very serious".But they said it did not appear to be on anything like the scale of earlier major plots, such as the airline liquid bomb plot or the Birmingham rucksack bomb plot, which all resulted in convictions.The men were taken to a south London police station.Two men, both aged 25, were arrested in a car in Mansell Street, Whitechapel, east London, after police fired "Hatton rounds" - ammunition designed to blow out tyres and blow open doors with minimal collateral damage.A 28-year-old man was arrested at premises in Westbourne Grove, Bayswater, west London, and the fourth man, aged 29, was arrested in Peckham Hill Street, Peckham, south-east London.BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said the decision to make arrests was taken on Sunday by a joint committee of senior officers from MI5 and the Met Police's Counter Terrorism Command.As always, they faced a dilemma over whether to hold off longer to gather more evidence but then risk danger to the public, he said.The alleged plot had been monitored for some time, he added.Alistair Gillies, 38, who saw one of the arrests taking place, told the BBC: "I was just going out to try and get something to eat and walking back up Westbourne Grove towards Bayswater and I noticed that a police car had pulled across the road."There was probably in the region of about two dozen officers. The majority of them appeared to be plain clothes but they had on baseball caps with the checkerboard and police marking, apart from that, they were dressed in plain clothes."He added: "It didn't look like they had just pulled a car over or had just picked someone up. It looked like there was a great deal of planning and a great deal of resources had been put on to tackling this situation."</body>

      <body>Google is facing a backlash over plans to put people's faces and comments about products and places into adverts.The "shared endorsements" policy change starts on 11 November and covers the comments, "follows" and other actions people do on Google+.One protest involves people swapping their profile pictures for that of Google boss Eric Schmidt so his image rather than their own appears on ads.Google said it had made it easy for people to opt out of the system.The search giant started alerting people about the upcoming policy change via banners on its main webpage and in a page explaining the change to its "policies and principles".Google also gave examples of how the "shared endorsement" system might work. This showed people's faces and comments appearing below Street View images of a bagel shop and search results for products and places.Many people protested about the change to Google, and some altered their image profiles on the Google+ social network in response.So far, Google has not issued an official comment about the protests over "shared endorsements". However, in its explanatory pages it said it was easy to opt out of the system by clicking a box on the Google+ account settings page.It warned that if people did not want to be part of the programme some of their comments and follows may no longer be visible to others they know on Google+.Social network Facebook faced strong criticism over a similar system called "sponsored stories" it rolled out in 2011.Legal action following the criticism eventually led to Facebook paying out $20m to compensate people whose images it used without permission.</body>

      <title>UK to relax visa rules for Chinese</title>
      <description>The UK government will relax visa rules for Chinese nationals coming to the UK, Chancellor George Osborne announces during his China trade trip.</description>

      <body>Visa applications for Chinese visitors entering the UK will be simplified, Chancellor George Osborne has announced during his trade trip to China.Under the plan, Chinese nationals visiting the EU will not need to submit separate UK visa applications if they book with selected travel agents.Mr Osborne is trying to persuade more Chinese companies to invest in the UK.But he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that his trip was also about changing British attitudes to China."Many people think of China as a sweat shop on the Pearl River. Yet it is at the forefront of medicine, computing and technology. It's a very rapidly changing country."Earlier, Mr Osborne told an audience of students that his visit was about "much more than a collection of business deals"."What I really want it to be about is strengthening the understanding between our two nations, deepening our friendship, working out where by working together we can improve the lives of all our citizens," he said in a speech to university students in Beijing."Yes, of course, we have differences, different political systems, we attach value to different things, and we shouldn't be afraid of pointing out where we disagree."But let us not do it in a way that is not respectful of each other and tries to understand each other, and let us try to overcome our differences and work together in peaceful co-operation."Because ultimately we want the same thing - a better life for our citizens."Adam Marshall, director of policy at business lobby group the British Chambers of Commerce, said UK businesses would "breathe a collective sigh of relief" at the plans to simplify Chinese visa applications."For too long, Britain has courted Chinese investment and tourism without facilitating the entry of Chinese visitors with the same vigour. A responsive visa system is crucial to demonstrating that the UK is open to trade and investment," he added.During his week-long trip, Mr Osborne has already unveiled a deal in which a Chinese firm took a 20% stake in a new business park in Manchester.And on Sunday came details of the visa changes.Currently, Chinese visitors can apply for a single visa to visit much of Europe but a separate one is required to travel to the UK.It is thought that the extra paperwork is deterring many Chinese visitors from including the UK in a trip to Europe.A mobile visa scheme that already operates in Beijing and Shanghai will be expanded as part of the changes.Under the mobile service, which was first tested by executives at Wanda, the company that bought Sunseeker yachts, officials go out to applicants to collect their paperwork and biometric data.The process can take less than five minutes.A 24-hour "super priority" visa service will also be available from next summer. The moves will be welcomed by UK businesses who want to benefit from Chinese tourists.In his speech, Mr Osborne said: "Let me make this clear to you and to the whole of China, there is no limit to the number of Chinese who could study in Britain."There is no limit to the number of Chinese tourists who can visit. No limit on the amount of business we can do together."According to the government, last year 210,000 visas were issued to Chinese nationals and they contributed about £300m to the UK economy.</body>

      <title>Arms team in Syria short-truce plea</title>
      <description>The head of the body tasked with destroying Syria's chemical arsenal tells the BBC fighting is hampering access to sites and calls for truces.</description>

      <body>The head of the body tasked with destroying Syria's chemical weapons says fighting is preventing access to some sites through rebel-held areas.Ahmet Uzumcu, of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, called for local, short-term ceasefires to allow experts to work.He told the BBC he hoped the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to the group last week, would help their work in Syria.Syria officially joins the Chemical Weapons Convention on Monday.The OPCW and the UN have had a team of 60 experts and support staff in Syria since 1 October. They are based in Damascus and have been carrying regular visits to facilities.In his first interview since the OPCW won the prize, Mr Uzumcu told the BBC's Today programme that Syrian officials had been co-operating and facilitating the experts' work.He said they had been taken wherever they wanted to go, and that they had already reached five out of at least 20 facilities capable of producing chemical weapons.However, Mr Uzumcu said, routes to some of the sites went through opposition-held territory and this prevented access."They change hands from one day to another, which is why we appeal to all sides in Syria to support this mission, to be co-operative and not render this mission more difficult. It's already challenging," he said.He said he had called for truces because "in the previous, UN-led mission to investigate allegations of use [of chemical weapons] there were temporary ceasefires of four or five hours which helped this mission".He added that one abandoned site was located in a rebel-held area, and that his team was hoping to access it.It is the first time the OPCW has worked in a war zone since it was set up in 1997.Mr Uzumcu also said that on Saturday mortar shells had fallen "next to the hotel where our team is staying and there are exchanges of fire not far from where they go".Details of the visits have not been released. Syria is believed to possess mustard gas, as well as the sarin and VX nerve agents.Meanwhile, US Secretary of State John Kerry has said a peace conference should be held in Geneva as soon as possible to set up an interim government."There has to be a transition government in Syria to permit the possibility of peace," he said.The dominant group in the main opposition alliance, the Syrian National Council, has said it will not take part in the proposed peace negotiations - known as Geneva II.In Syria itself violence is continuing. On Monday a car bomb killed at least 12 people in the north-western rebel-held town of Darkoush in Idlib province, activists say.The attack came a day after seven workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross were abducted near Saraqeb, a town also located in Idlib province, near the Turkish border.Syrian state TV blamed rebels for the abduction, which correspondents say highlights the threats faced by those working in Syria.In his interview with the BBC, Mr Uzumcu said the Nobel prize had been "very big boost" to the morale of his teams. "They are working in very challenging circumstances in the field," he said.The OPCW, based in The Hague, was established to enforce the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. Its main role to monitor and destroy chemical weapons.The disarmament deal on Syria's chemical weapons was sparked by a poison-gas attack in Damascus on 21 August in which hundreds were killed. Western nations blamed the forces of President Bashar al-Assad, but he blamed rebel fighters.Syria later agreed to join the global Chemical Weapons Convention, and the UN said it would bound by the treaty from 14 October.Under a UN resolution, Syria's chemical weapons production equipment must be destroyed by 1 November and stockpiles must be disposed of by mid-2014.</body>

      <body>A day of events marking the 100th anniversary of Britain's worst mining disaster is taking place in Senghenydd.Hundreds are turning out in the streets of the Caerphilly county village where an explosion killed 439 miners and a rescuer at the Universal Colliery on 14 October, 1913.A new memorial has been unveiled to mark the event and other mining tragedies in Wales.Relatives of the men and boys who died will be among those attending.The day of ceremony is marking the explosion which happened just after 8am on 14 October, 1913.It had been caused by a build up of firedamp (methane) gas being ignited.The blast disturbed coal dust on the mine floor, raising clouds that then also caught alight, spreading the destruction further.The fire was mainly confined to the west side of the mine, with the east side blocked with noxious gases. The result was over 400 men trapped underground.It was not the first time tragedy had hit the village which is a few miles along the Aber Valley from Caerphilly.An explosion at the colliery in 1901 killed 81 men and there was criticism that the pit owners did not learn lessons from it.A report following that explosion recommended certain safety procedures be followed. An extended deadline of September 1913 to implement the safety measure was missed by the mine bosses.Just six weeks later, 439 miners and one rescuer died when another blast ripped through the colliery.There had been 950 men down Universal's three pits that day.Over the fortnight that followed those trapped were helped to safety with the last 18 men rescued more than two weeks later.Funerals for those who died took place over the next month.One hundred years later, the Wales National Mining Memorial was unveiled to remember the Senghenydd disaster and 150 other mining tragedies in Wales including the most recent, when four men died at Gleision in the Swansea Valley in 2011.The memorial is a bronze statue of a rescue worker helping a miner.The day of events in Senghenydd started with the sounding of the original Universal Colliery pit hooter at 08:10 BST, exactly as it did a century ago when it sounded to alert the village to what had happened in the pit.As part of the memorial event, a walled garden was also opened with tiles inscribed with the details of those killed in the two Senghenydd disasters as well as a "path of memory," which marks the other colliery tragedies in Wales.Patron Roy Noble paid tribute to "the men who paid the ultimate sacrifice in their quest for coal" and added it was a "tragic end to the stepping stones leading to disaster".A hoooter marked the end of the service.The Aber Valley Heritage Group has been behind fundraising for the memorial.Jack Humphreys, group chairman, said: "It has been a hundred years since the disaster at the Universal Colliery, but the impact that the explosion had on this small mining community is still felt today."We hope the event is a fitting tribute to the victims of the explosions in Senghenydd and mining disasters across Wales."He told BBC Radio Wales: "It's very important for local people and people nationally. It's surprising the number of people who have come from far and wide to be with us this morning."There will be many people here today who have had family connections with those who were killed in the disasters of 1901 and 1913."Hilary Barbrook, a local florist from Caerphilly, lost both her grandfathers at Senghenydd."We've spoken for years over the tragedy that has happened in this pit, but it's 100 years and it's nice that we're going to honour the people who died," she said."The village was grown around the pit because beforehand it was farm land and when they sunk the pit, they built the houses around it so everyone was involved."My grandmother had a lot of work, she had eight children and was eight months pregnant with the last one when my grandfather died."She used to take in washing, ironing, clean houses. She made all of her own clothes for the children so they didn't go without. She worked tremendously hard to keep the family together."Hundreds of people attended the unveiling of the memorial, including First Minister Carwyn Jones.Wales' footballers were wearing black armbands in training to mark the disaster. They fly to Belgium later for their final World Cup qualifying game.A BBC One Wales programme, Senghenydd - Britain's Worst Mining Disaster, will be shown on BBC One Wales at 22:45 BST on Monday 14 October.</body>

      <body>Police in Russia have arrested more than 1,200 people in a raid targeting migrants after major riots in Moscow.The "preventative raid" targeted workers at a vegetable warehouse, which was attacked by demonstrators on Sunday, Russian news agencies reported.Angry protesters overran the market searching for migrant workers.The rioting began during a protest over the death of an ethnic Russian man on Thursday allegedly by a Muslim migrant from the North Caucasus.Ethnic Russian Yegor Shcherbakov, 25, was killed in front of his girlfriend in the capital's Biryulyovo district.Police have released a security camera photo of the suspect, but have not identified him.Media said the image suggested the man was of "non-Slavic appearance", leading nationalists to conclude the killer was a Muslim migrant from the Russian North Caucasus.Some 380 people were detained during the rioting that began on Sunday, but most have been released without charge.It is unclear what charges, if any, those detained in Monday's raid against migrants in the vegetable warehouse would face, RIA Novosti reported. Police were quoted as saying that they were investigating "involvement in criminal activity", without elaborating.The issue of immigration and internal migration was one of the main issues in Moscow's recent mayoral election won by Sergei Sobyanin.The BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Moscow says the violence reflects Russian nationalism, and the growing tension between ethnic Russians and migrants from the Caucasus region and from former Soviet republics.</body>

      <body>A Muslim free school in Derby has said it will support female staff who do not want to wear head coverings.It follows a letter warning the Al-Madinah School it faced closure unless discrimination against female staff and pupils stopped.Education Minister Lord Nash laid out 17 issues for the school to consider, which included an end to "unacceptable" teaching standards.The letter said if steps were not taken by Tuesday, funding would be pulled.Parent-governor Abdullah Shahjan told BBC Radio Derby: "We are amending policies to make sure we support staff, who if for their cultural, ethical, or faith do not wish to cover their hair."Another governor Fasal Hussain said: "We are very open, very flexible."However, with regard to Lord Nash's letter and female staff wearing head scarves he added: "We would have appreciated some consultation."We have never received any complaints from our staff."During an earlier interview on Newsnight, Mr Shahjan said: "The very first question we ask everybody is 'Would you be prepared to cover your hair if you came into the school as part of the uniform policy?'."To this date, of all those who have come none has ever refused."Head of Islamic studies at the school, Mohammad Burhaan, told Newsnight: "This is the code of dress we have adopted."If you look at an air hostess, for example, a female wears a different code of dress."We are not saying they are discriminated against, that's a choice made by the business."He added: "We are not saying by wearing a head scarf you are changing your religious identity at all... this is the code of dress we would like our female staff to adopt and this is the decision as an organisation we have made."Is it possible to review that - yes it is."The government has told the school to write to all female members of staff telling them they do not have to wear a hijab if it is in conflict with their religion, or beliefs.In the letter outlining concerns, Lord Nash wrote: "The trust has manifestly breached the conditions of its funding agreement by:"I will not tolerate breaches of the commitments you gave when entering into the funding agreement."He has urged the school's trust to take five "urgent steps" by 15 October, including providing written confirmation that "you have ceased any practices and procedures that have as their reason, cause or effect that women and girls are treated less favourably than men and boys".The school has been given a deadline of 22 October to address nine further action points and must provide a plan setting out a clear management structure by the start of November.</body>

      <title>Most women jailed due to men - Pryce</title>

      <body>Most women in Holloway prison are there because of something the men in their life have done, recently jailed Vicky Pryce has told the BBC.The former wife of ex-minister Chris Huhne was sentenced to eight months for perverting the course of justice after taking speeding points for him."I did something, I paid the price," she told Radio 4's Today programme.The economist - who had claimed her husband coerced her - has written a book about the economics of prison.Her royalties from the book will go to the charity Working Chance, which helps women with criminal convictions find work.Pryce, who was recently stripped of her Companion of the Order of the Bath, served two months in the north London prison earlier this year.Huhne, the former energy secretary, was also jailed for the same offence.He left Pryce in 2010 as his affair with PR adviser Carina Trimingham was about to be exposed.During the former couple's trial, the court heard Pryce had revealed the speeding points scandal to newspapers in 2011 to seek revenge.Asked whether she agreed with Chris Huhne's assessment that they had fallen victim to the Murdoch press, she said: "I don't begrudge anyone in terms of what's happened - or any of the journalists frankly - in my view one has to just look forward."I did something, I paid the price of it and that is it."On the prospect of going to prison, Ms Pryce said she knew it was "something I simply had to survive and perhaps learn from it obviously, and see what goes on".The worst aspect of prison life was "losing my liberty, but mostly worrying about my children - that they would be worried about me and how do I react to ensure that they feel that 'actually I'm ok'."And of course that meant that I also had to stay strong."On the claim in her book that many women in Holloway were there mostly because of something their husbands, brothers and fathers had done, she said: "Clearly they knew what they were doing but it didn't mean that they necessarily wanted to do what they did."Vulnerable women who often have lost their self esteem - they could be prostitutes, they could be people who are stealing to feed their, but also their other-half's, drug habits."More than 50% of women who enter jail have been physically, sexually, or emotionally abused. And those are statistics quoted by everybody."Of course you are [responsible for your actions] and they were. The thing to remember is that they were very vulnerable at the time they were doing it and they remain vulnerable."The interesting thing is that jail doesn't do anything to take that away from them and they leave prison after a while, go back into society and they find themselves in exactly the same position and they re-offend."She said there had been surprises, such as Holloway's reception area which meant she hadn't felt "threatened" by entering it. "It felt that somebody worried about you," she said.On how well the prison system was coping, she said: "There's been a huge increase in the numbers of prisoners, although crime is going down."The causality doesn't work that way. The causality works in a way that says in fact crime has been reducing because of things to do with technology - making it difficult to break into houses, difficult to break into cars - and all that sort of stuff, and yet the numbers have been going up very, very significantly."Women in particular, the numbers have gone up by 27% between 2000 and 2010, while crime has been coming down."It makes no sense at all. The costs are enormous. There are so many cheaper ways to deal with this whole issue, which is what the Prisonomics book is all about."</body>

      <body>Original signed canvasses by British street artist Banksy have been sold from a stall in New York's Central Park for $60 (£38) each.The elusive artist posted a video on his website showing a man selling what appeared to be fake Banksys.Many of the pieces, estimated to be worth up to £20,000 each, remained unsold at the end of the day.Banksy is in New York for a month-long residency during which he has promised a new piece of street art every day.Entitled Better Out Than In, the public art show has its own website on to which pictures and videos of the art works have been posted.The latest video was accompanied with the words, "Yesterday I set up a stall in the park selling 100% authentic original signed Banksy canvases. For $60 each."The video shows an unknown older man making his first sale mid-afternoon, to a woman who buys two small canvasses for her children after negotiating a 50% discount.Another woman from New Zealand is seen buying two of the paintings, before a man from Chicago buys four.He tells the stall holder he has recently moved house and needs something for the walls.The day's takings came to a grand total of $420 (£263).Underneath the video Banksy added: "Please note: This was a one off. The stall will not be there again today."In a recent interview conducted via email with New York publication the Village Voice, the guerilla artist - whose identity is still a secret - revealed the thinking behind his month-long trip to the city."I know street art can feel increasingly like the marketing wing of an art career, so I wanted to make some art without the price tag attached," he said."There is no gallery show or book or film. It's pointless. Which hopefully means something."Each day in October will see a new piece of either an "elaborate graffiti, large scale street sculpture, video installation or substandard performance art".So far they have included The Sirens of the Lambs, a slaughterhouse delivery truck filled with stuffed animal toys which toured the meatpacking district, and more traditional Banksy art such as a heart-shaped balloon covered in bandages on a Brooklyn wall.</body>

      <body>Ferrari's Fernando Alonso said he was happy to have broken the all-time Formula 1 points record but admitted this year's championship is over.The Spaniard finished fourth in the Japanese Grand Prix to pass Michael Schumacher in the all-time points list.But he is 90 points behind race-winner Sebastian Vettel with 100 available."Even if Vettel doesn't finish all of the races I need to win nearly all, so it's a matter of time [until Vettel is champion]," Alonso said.On his own accomplishment, he admitted he had benefited from the fact that slightly more of his career than Schumacher's had come after 2010 when points awarded were more than doubled and extended to 10th place.Alonso has now scored 1,571 points in his 12-year career, two more than Schumacher. Vettel is third on 1,351."We have different goals now and they told me I have the record for the most amount of points in F1 history, so it's a happy day. Leading points scorer in F1 is something great," he said."I know the points system changed, but when someone overtakes me in the points no-one will remember the points system changed."To win the title, however, Alonso - who has won 32 grands prix in his career to Vettel's 34 - would have to win three of the remaining four races and finish second in the other, with Vettel retiring from them all.Alonso acknowledged his Ferrari did not have enough pace to do that."We struggle a little bit to do so," he said, "so it is matter of time. We continue to try to do out best on Sundays. When it is mathematically settled we [will] congratulate him."In fact, Vettel will clinch the title in the next race in India on 27 October as long as Alonso does not outscore him by at least 16 points."Regarding the championship, as I said, I think obviously we have a very, very good gap but we still keep pushing," said Vettel."I think we've proven in the last couple of years that we never give up. I think we've won one or two championships because of that."Obviously this year it looks very good at this stage - but it's not over before it's over."Alonso's aim is now to secure second in the drivers' championship and do the same for Ferrari in the constructors' competition.The Italian team extended their lead over Mercedes to 10 points after a bad race for the German team, who saw Lewis Hamilton retire with damage caused by a puncture and Nico Rosberg take eighth after a drive-through penalty for an unsafe release from a pit stop.Lotus are also in the running for second place - they are 33 points behind Ferrari after Romain Grosjean took third in Suzuka and Kimi Raikkonen fifth.Team boss Eric Boullier said: "Two weekends in a row we have gained some points on them. If we can keep it going it's possible."The four remaining races are in India, Abu Dhabi, the United States and Brazil.Full race results</body>

      <body>Former world champion Phillips Idowu is one of a number of high-profile GB athletes to lose their lottery funding for 2013-14.Idowu, who won triple jump gold in 2009 in Berlin, took a break from the sport last year and missed the World Championships in Moscow.Also among those to miss out are fellow former world medallists Andy Turner, Jenny Meadows and Lisa Dobriskey.But the women's 4x100m relay team have been rewarded for their world bronze.The sprint quartet of Ashleigh Nelson, Annabelle Lewis, Hayley Jones and Dina Lewis-Asher join the funding programme along with Anyika Onuora after the progress they made in the last 12 months following the failure to qualify a team for the 2012 Olympics.On the Paralympic side, world champion Sophie Hahn, 16, gets funding for the first time after triumphing in the T38 100m at the IPC Athletics World Championships in Lyon in June.Lyon silver medallist Jonathan Broom-Edwards (high jump) is funded for the first time along while sprinter Sophie Kamlish is promoted from the potential squad and veteran Stephen Miller returns to the podium funding programme.Meadows and Dobriskey won 800m bronze and 1500m silver respectively at the 2009 World Championships while two years later in Daegu, Turner claimed 110m hurdles bronze.Yamile Aldama, the 41-year-old Cuba-born triple jumper who won world indoor gold last year, has also left the programme.UK Sport, the body which distributes the funding, has narrowed its criteria, meaning only athletes considered realistic medal contenders for the Rio 2016 Olympics are eligible for 'podium' funding. Previously the emphasis had been on the likelihood of making a final.The result is a smaller crop of 22 athletes on top-level funding, plus 16 on relay funding.The 44 younger athletes on the lower-level 'podium potential' support had to have proved their potential to win a medal in Tokyo in 2020.In addition, there are 25 Paralympic athletes on podium funding, plus two on relay support, and 23 on podium potential."Our immediate focus is firmly on medals in 2016, followed by London 2017 when we will host both the IAAF and IPC World Athletics Championships," said British Athletics performance director Neil Black. "From there attention shifts to Tokyo 2020. Our selections absolutely reflect that focus."2013 was an excellent year for the British team across both the Olympic and Paralympic programmes. I'm confident 2014 will bring further success in what will be another extremely busy indoor and outdoor season."Podium programmesOlympic: Holly Bleasdale, Lawrence Clarke, James Dasaolu, Hannah England, Jessica Ennis-Hill, Mo Farah, Adam Gemili, Robbie Grabarz, Dai Greene, Sophie Hitchon, Katarina Johnson-Thompson, Christine Ohuruogu, Andrew Osagie, Tiffany Porter, Andy Pozzi, Shara Proctor, Greg Rutherford, Perri Shakes-Drayton, William Sharman, Chris Tomlinson, Laura Weightman, Nathan Woodward.Paralympic: Ola Abidogun, Hollie Arnold, Graeme Ballard, Paul Blake, Jonathan Broom-Edwards, Mickey Bushell, Libby Clegg , Hannah Cockroft, Aled Davies, David Devine, Kyron Duke, Dan Greaves, Sophie Hahn, Beverley Jones, Sophie Kamlish, Stephen Miller, Jonnie Peacock, Josie Pearson, Gemma Prescott, Stefanie Reid, Nathan Stephens, David Weir, Richard Whitehead, Rob Womack, Bethany WoodwardOlympic relay:Mens 4x100m: Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, James EllingtonWomen's 4x100m - Dina Asher-Smith, Hayley Jones, Annabelle Lewis, Ashleigh Nelson, Anyika OnuoraMen's 4x400m - Michael Bingham, Jamie Bowie, Jack Green, Nigel Levine, Martyn Rooney, Conrad Williams,Women's 4x400m: Margaret Adeoye, Eilidh Child, Shana CoxParalympic relay:Katrina Hart (Rob Ellchuk), Jenny McLoughlin (Keith Antoine)Podium Potential programmesOlympic: Meghan Beesley, David Bolarinwa, Dan Bramble, Lucy Bryan, Ashley Bryant, Katie Byres, Chris Clarke, Luke Cutts, Mark Dry, Zane Duquemin, James Gladman, Emelia Gorecka, Charlie Grice, Abigail Irozuru, JJ Jegede, Jessica Judd, Richard Kilty, Jade Lally, Eilish McColgan, Sophie McKinna, Mukhtar Mohammed, Brett Morse, Laura Muir, Ross Murray, Chris O'Hare, Asha Philip , Isobel Pooley, Julian Reid, Leon Reid, Andrew Robertson, Sebastian Rodger, Jazmin Sawyers, James Shane, Lynsey Sharp, Allan Smith, Serita Solomon, Gemma Steel, Danny Talbot, Deji Tobais, Lorraine Ugen, Chijindu Ujah, Bianca Williams, Delano Williams, Jodie Williams.Paralympic: Joshua Bain, Olivia Breen, Jamie Carter, Josh Clark, Meggan Dawson-Farrell, Jordan Howe, Jade Jones, Rhys Jones, Andy Kaar, Samantha Kinghorn, Erin McBride, Dean Miller, Maxine Moore, Stephen Morris, Holly Neill, Mel Nicholls, Georgina Oliver, Stephen Osborne, Ben Rowlings, Will Smith, Laura Sugar, Isaac Towers, Kieran Tscherniawsky.</body>

      <title>18,000 Poland fans 'to boost Wembley'</title>
      <description>England defender Leighton Baines is unconcerned by the FA's decision to sell 18,000 World Cup qualifier tickets to Poland fans.</description>

      <body>England left-back Leighton Baines has defended the Football Association's decision to sell 18,000 tickets to Poland fans for Tuesday's decisive World Cup qualifier at Wembley.The FA hope doubling the 9,000 seats Poland are entitled to will prevent away fans from buying home tickets.It was a move used for recent games with Scotland and Republic of Ireland.Baines said: "If away fans add to the atmosphere the home fans produce, it just adds to the occasion."England lead Group H on 19 points and will guarantee a place at Brazil 2014 if they follow Friday's 4-1 win over Montenegro with another victory.A draw or defeat would open the door for Ukraine, who are second on 18 points, to top the group, providing they win their final qualifier against pointless San Marino.That eventuality would see England head into a two-leg play-off against one of the other seven best runners-up from the European qualifying groups.Poland held Roy Hodgson's side to a 1-1 draw in Warsaw earlier in the qualifying campaign.Wembley has not been filled to its 90,000 capacity during England's qualifying campaign, with attendances fluctuating from under 70,000 during their first home fixture against Ukraine, to almost 87,000 for the win over San Marino.Poland are entitled to 10% of the capacity but the FA took the decision to offer Polish fans 18,000 tickets in an attempt to stop them buying seats among home support.Baines will win his 21st cap after Chelsea's Ashley Cole was ruled out with a rib injury and does not expect the enhanced away following to intimidate England's players."It could work in that manner, but to put a more positive spin on it you'd rather play in a stadium with a good atmosphere rather than it be a half-empty stadium," added the Everton defender."I remember when we played Ghana - and I don't know how many there were there - they were amazing and it just made it better."If it adds to the atmosphere, it's great."It is understood the FA took the decision to increase the away allocation after discussions with police."With high demand for tickets from the large Polish community in England the FA took the decision, based on safety grounds, to ensure Polish fans were allocated space in a specific area of the ground rather than attempting to buy tickets in home areas," said and FA Spokesman."This is the same process that was employed for the successful Scotland and Republic of Ireland fixtures earlier this year."</body>

      <body>A place at Brazil 2014 might be in their own hands but England have been here before, and the omens are against them.It is almost exactly 40 years since the Three Lions last needed to beat Poland in a make-or-break World Cup qualifier - and the man who stopped them then is back in town.Jan Tomaszewski will be watching at Wembley on Tuesday, where he entered footballing folklore with a virtuoso, if unorthodox, goalkeeping performance on 17 October 1973.Famously dubbed a "circus clown in gloves" by Brian Clough on TV before kick-off, his heroics helped Poland hold England in a game Sir Alf Ramsey's side needed to win to reach the 1974 World Cup finals.None of the England team were laughing at the end of a completely one-sided match that saw them take 36 shots to Poland's two, force 26 corners, hit the woodwork twice and have four efforts cleared off the line.But Tomaszewski has much happier memories."I have never watched the game again," he told BBC Sport. "But if you have a game like this, you always remember it in your heart. I can wake up in the middle of the night and remember every minute."Poland had gone top of a three-team group with one game to go after beating England in a bad-tempered match in Chorzow in June and Ramsey was coming under pressure from the press.Nobody was panicking, however. After all, England had been at every World Cup finals since they entered for the first time in 1950, had won the tournament less than eight years earlier, and had been one of the best teams at the 1970 finals in Mexico too."It was win or bust but I don't think anybody seriously thought England would fail," said Barry Davies, who was at Wembley commentating on the game for the BBC."This was still in the age when everybody felt we had an entitlement to be in the World Cup finals, and it was simply unthinkable that we wouldn't be there."Poland boss Kazimierz Gorski thought otherwise. He knew his players saw Wembley as an impenetrable fortress and, according to Tomaszewski, used that to inspire them.In the dressing room before kick-off, Gorski told his players: "Win against a weak team and there is no joy. You can play for 20 years and in 1,000 games and nobody will remember you. But tonight, in one game, against a team like England and at a place like this, you have the chance to put your names in the history books."They did."As we walked out, the England fans shouted 'animals' at us," Tomaszewski recalled. "It was referring to our win in Chorzow. To be honest we had played very violently there."Most of the 100,000 crowd were expecting England to get their revenge. So were some of the Poland side."I wasn't just afraid of England - I was terrified," Tomaszewski added. "They had beaten Austria 7-0 a month earlier and when I was in front of the royal box with the national anthems being played, I was just thinking 'I hope we are not the next Austria'."If it was not for the exploits of the then 25-year-old LKS Lodz keeper, it might indeed have ended up being a similar scoreline. But his first eccentric save, after two minutes, was almost his last."I was feeling the pressure and did not notice that Allan Clarke was standing two metres away from me when I rolled the ball out," Tomaszewski explained."I dived at his feet to make a save but he kicked me instead of the ball and I broke five tiny bones (his metacarpals) in my left wrist, like glass."They were frozen during the game and the adrenaline meant I did not feel the pain. Afterwards, one of my team-mates Adam Musial told me 'it was good that he kicked you because he woke you up'."Chance after England chance followed but, whether it was Tomaszewski's legs, arms or hands, he continued to keep the ball out, even if he dived the wrong way.When he was beaten, the posts or a team-mate came to his rescue, and the score was goalless at the break.Highlights of the game were being shown on BBC but the match was live on ITV and Clough, who had resigned as Derby boss just two days previously, was one of their pundits.At half-time he refused to back down on his description of Tomaszewski, and told the nation: "Keep calm. Put the kettle on, mother. Don't worry - the goals are going to come."In a sense, Clough was right; a goal did arrive early in the second half. Sadly for England, it was Poland who scored it."I had spent quite a lot of time watching the Poles in training before the game," said veteran commentator Davies."I could see how they were going to play. They knew they would be under pressure but they thought they had the pace to catch England on the break."That is exactly what happened. Norman Hunter, preferred to Bobby Moore in central defence, came across to pick up the ball on the left touchline near the halfway line but got his feet tangled up.Robert Gadocha was left free to surge towards the area before playing in Jan Domarski, who was arriving like a train to his right, to hit a low shot that skidded past Emlyn Hughes' challenge and went under Peter Shilton's dive.Hunter took the blame, and would describe the incident as "the worst moment of his career", but Shilton also accepted he should have done better."I tried to make the perfect save," he said. "Had I been more experienced, I'd have stuck a foot or knee out."Eight minutes later, England were given a glimmer of hope.Martin Peters burst down the right wing and went down inside the area under a challenge from Adam Musial. Peters later admitted to diving, in desperation for England's cause. It worked - Belgian referee Vital Loraux awarded a penalty.Shilton could not bear to watch as Allan Clarke stepped up to take the spot-kick, crouching on his haunches with his back to the opposition goal.But he had no need to worry. The Leeds striker had scored three of his nine goals for England from the spot, and a fourth was to follow."I was trying to read which side Clarke would shoot," said Tomaszewski. "But when the whistle went, he just came up to the ball as if he was training with kids and slotted it past me."He was so cool. If I could have done, I would have applauded him at the time for doing that under so much pressure."England still needed another goal, but they could not get it.Tomaszewski's favourite stop of a memorable night came in the last 10 minutes, again from Clarke, who turned away to celebrate in the belief he had scored the winner."He hit a beautiful shot and I did a blind save on my left-side," Tomaszewski explained. "I have to admit I did not save that ball, I was just in the right place at the right time and the ball bounced off me."England thought they had scored but they only had a corner. It was funny because when I looked up, Clarke was crouched down with his eyes wide open - he could not believe what had happened."In the 88th minute, Ramsey belatedly made a change, sending on Kevin Hector for the ineffective Martin Chivers.It almost worked - Hector had a header hacked off the line in the dying seconds - but Poland held on. The final score was 1-1, and England were out."There was a stunned silence in the stadium at the final whistle," recalled Davies. "It was more disbelief than anything else."Hunter trudged off the pitch looking utterly dejected, and there were more tears from several other players in a desolate England dressing room afterwards.Meanwhile, Poland's party was just beginning, but not for Tomaszewski."How did I celebrate? I was the only one who didn't," he said. "The team went out all night but I was in pain with my wrist and stayed in my hotel room to take medicine."In the morning, I saw the newspapers and felt extremely satisfied because I was on the front pages."They called me the 'man who stopped England' but it was not just me. It was Gorski and the 11 people he positioned on the pitch. Against England, I made mistakes but they were not punished because of my team-mates."Poland would go on to finish third at the 1974 World Cup, with Tomaszewski excelling.Wembley was just the start of a golden period in Poland's footballing history, but for Ramsey it was the beginning of the end. By the time the finals started the following June, England's only World Cup-winning manager had been sacked.Tomaszewski, who is now a 65-year-old politician, had the last laugh on his critic Clough too."Years later we met at the BBC in Manchester," he said. "Clough apologised for what he had said about me. We shook hands and I said thank you, because only great people can admit to mistakes."With thanks to Jan Krzesimowski, who acted as a translator for Jan Tomaszewski.</body>

      <title>Tendulkar's role in a nation's renaissance</title>
      <description>An icon for a nation, Sachin Tendulkar embodied the rise of a new India, with cricket helping to revive its fortunes</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/24514726</url>
      <date>1381702967</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70456000/jpg/_70456307_sachin.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Forget cricket for a moment. What was Sachin Tendulkar's historical significance?Tendulkar's career has coincided with the emergence of India as a world power and an economic giant. So, by a quirk of history, the Little Master has for 24 years been a symbol of the rise of India. Perhaps he did more than that, and helped to inspire it.Twenty-four years is a long time in sport. To find out just how long, watch some footage of Tendulkar's early career. His maiden Test hundred against England in 1990 proves the point.A boyish Michael Atherton, himself less than a year into international cricket, bowls Tendulkar some friendly leg-spinners. Atherton, after collecting over 100 Test caps, is now 12 years into his second career as a journalist and broadcaster. David Gower looks on wryly from the slip cordon.The bowler whom Tendulkar hit for three runs to bring up his hundred was Angus Fraser. I played in a cricket match with Gus this summer: he's lost a yard or two over the last 24 years.Here is a measure of Tendulkar's longevity: the senior opponents Tendulkar played against in 1989 are up to 40 years older than kids he shares the field with today. Lamb and Botham have given way to Bairstow and Root; Tendulkar has been there all the way through.The changes in India have been no less profound over the period of Tendulkar's career. In 1989, the Indian economy languished in protectionism and introversion. Major international companies either ignored India altogether or tried and promptly gave up. Coca-Cola, for example, disappeared from India in 1977 (only to return in 1993).We forget just how much India has changed in 20 years. When I started playing cricket in India in the 1990s, the airports were abysmal; now they have some of the best in the world.The beginning of India's economic recovery was almost exactly the moment of Tendulkar's emergence as a global talent. Bankrupted by the rise in oil prices caused by the first Gulf War, India had to turn to the International Monetary Fund for an emergency bail-out in 1991.Humiliation led to renaissance. Manmohan Singh, given a licence to reform as finance minister, dismantled trade restrictions and opened up India to foreign investment.Anticipating economic revolution, Singh quoted Victor Hugo: "No power on Earth can stop an idea whose time has come."This was the backdrop of Tendulkar's career, and it fell to the Little Master - whether or not he craved the role - to embody and inspire a new India.Cricket increasingly provided India with a way of proving itself on the world stage. Indeed, never in the history of cricket has one nation possessed the following triple (as India does today): the World Cup trophy, the most lucrative domestic league and by far the greatest political clout in the game's international governance. Even English cricket, in the heyday of the MCC's hegemony, had to settle for two of those three prizes.Cricket has also become an engine of domestic growth. Without cricket, it is unlikely India would have evolved such sophisticated and lucrative television networks.As James Astill points out in his new book The Great Tamasha,  cricket is what Indians pay to watch. In 2011, Indian advertisers spent $3bn (£1.9bn) to buy airtime on televised cricket, a quarter of the total spent on TV advertising. Cricket hasn't just reflected Indian modernisation, it has also driven it.Sporting greatness is not just about talent, or even achievement. There is always context. For 24 years, Tendulkar has carried the passionate and irrational expectations of a billion people. When India won the World Cup in 2011, Virat Kohli captured a deep truth: "He has carried the burden of our nation on his shoulders for the past 21 years. So it is time that we carried him."Tendulkar's risk-averse personality evolved partly in response to the epic scale of his responsibilities. He is both reassuringly conservative - quietly spoken, understated, middle class - and yet relentlessly brilliant.The previous generation of Indian fans tended to favour either the polished reliability of Sunil Gavaskar or the everyman heroism of Kapil Dev. Tendulkar appealed to both constituencies. In a country prone to deep regional bias, Tendulkar had a uniquely total appeal.Last year, the historian Ram Guha sat on a committee to determine the 'Greatest Indian Since Gandhi'. There were two strands of the selection process, one an expert "jury", the second an online poll. The jury put Tendulkar in the top 10 greatest Indians; the popular vote went even further, placing him even higher than Nehru.In retrospect, success takes on an air of inevitability. With all that talent, how could Tendulkar have failed to achieve greatness? With so much cultural support, surely he was bound to stay committed to his country? After the fact, India's economic successes can also look deceptively predetermined. Given all its human and natural resources, surely it had to become an economic powerhouse?History was kind enough to give us a telling cricketing counter-factual: the Tendulkar who didn't fulfil his destiny. His name is Vinod Kambli.It was Kambli with whom Tendulkar put on an unbeaten stand of 664 on the Azad Maidan in 1988. In his first seven Tests, Kambli made four hundreds, including two doubles. Ramakant Achrekar, who coached both of them as schoolboys, argued he was the more naturally talented.The reasons Kambli disappeared provide a telling counterpoint to Tendulkar. Kambli never overcame a dual susceptibility: a weakness against high-class fast bowling and an equally problematic weakness for the good life.Kambli was discarded from Test cricket as a 23-year-old, never to return. Tendulkar only now bids farewell. Greatness is never fully predestined; it has to be earned.As the icon of a massive nation hungry for success, Tendulkar has faced more pressure than any sportsman in history. And he has endured it all, mostly with great dignity and restraint.Along the way, he made 100 international hundreds, always batting for India, in every sense of the term.</body>

      <title>IMF chief warns of recession risk</title>
      <description>The head of the International Monetary Fund warns a US default could spark a global recession, as the deadlock in Congress continues.</description>

      <body>The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, has warned that a US default could tip the world into recession.In a US TV interview she said a default would result in "massive disruption the world over".The US Treasury will start to run short of funds on Thursday if no agreement is reached for it to raise its debt limit.Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate held direct talks for the first time in weeks on Saturday.But there is little sign of any breakthrough, correspondents say.In an interview with ABC's Meet the Press Christine Lagarde said America must now raise the debt ceiling before Thursday's deadline."If there is that degree of disruption, that lack of certainty, that lack of trust in the US signature, it would mean massive disruption the world over and we would be at risk of tipping yet again into recession," she said.The president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, has also expressed his concern over the situation.He warned that the United States is just "days away from a very dangerous moment" because of the government's borrowing crisis.Mr Kim urged US policymakers to reach a deal to raise the government's debt ceiling before Thursday's deadline.He warned this could be a "disastrous event" for the world."The closer we get to the deadline the greater the impact will be for the developing world."Inaction could result in interest rates rising, confidence falling and growth slowing," said Mr Kim, speaking at the World Bank's annual meeting in Washington."If this comes to pass it could be a disastrous event for the developing world and that will in turn greatly hurt the developed economies as well," he added.If the US does run short of cash, this could cause it to default on its debts, a development which would be likely to have a severe effect on financial markets around the world.The BBC's Andrew Walker said that finance ministers from other countries think the US probably won't default, but they are uneasy and want the crisis resolved very soon.Republicans and Democrats failed to come to an agreement on Saturday, but Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat, said the aim was to reach a deal on extending the debt limit before markets reopen on Monday.The White House rejected a deal for a short-term increase to the borrowing limit."It wouldn't be wise, as some suggest, to just kick the debt ceiling can down the road for a couple of months, and flirt with a first-ever intentional default right in the middle of the holiday shopping season," said President Barack Obama.The US government has been in partial shutdown since Congress missed a 1 October deadline to pass a budget, with politicians being unable to agree funding for current spending.This has resulted in hundreds of thousands of federal employees being sent home and government offices closing.Republicans refused to approve the new budget unless President Obama agreed to delay or eliminate the funding of the healthcare reform law of 2010.US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has estimated that each week the government is shut down, 0.25% is shaved off economic growth, which was already expected to be a sluggish this quarter.Mr Lew has also has warned that letting talks over the debt ceiling go down to the wire "could be very dangerous".The current debt limit of $16.699 trillion was reached in May.Since then the US Treasury has been using what are called extraordinary measures to keep paying the bills, but those measures run out on 17 October.Every week, the Treasury also has to refinance $100bn worth of debt in the form of US government bonds known as treasuries.The US also has to pay interest on its huge debt burden.An inability to pay that interest, or pay back debt if required, would put the US into default.On Saturday, Jamie Dimon, boss of the American bank JP Morgan said the possible repercussions did not bear thinking about."You don't want to know [what would happen]," he said."It would ripple through the world economy in a way that you couldn't possibly understand."</body>

      <title>GM 'golden rice' opponents 'wicked'</title>
      <description>Opponents to the development of a type of genetically modified rice enriched with vitamin A are criticised as "wicked" by the environment secretary.</description>

      <body>Opponents of the development of a type of genetically modified (GM) rice enriched with vitamin A are "wicked", the environment secretary has said.In an interview with the Independent, Owen Paterson said they could be condemning millions of people in the developing world to a premature death.Mr Paterson backed a letter from international scientists calling for the rapid development of "golden rice".But campaigners say the benefits claimed for the rice are misleading.Mr Paterson told the newspaper: "It's just disgusting that little children are allowed to go blind and die because of a hang-up by a small number of people about this technology."I feel really strongly about it. I think what they do is absolutely wicked. There is no other word for it."Mr Paterson did not specify any particular groups in his interview but also said opponents of GM technology were "casting a dark shadow over attempts to feed the world".BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said Mr Paterson was known as a strong supporter of GM crops but his language seemed certain to raise hackles with those who took a different view.A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokeswoman said it was Mr Paterson's strong personal view.People in the developed usually world get enough vitamin A from their diet by eating foods like cheese, yoghurts and eggs.But deficiency is a common problem in developing countries, and is estimated to affect between 140 million and 250 million children under the age of five.Vitamin A is needed for healthy skin and eyes and to help strengthen the immune system so that the body can fight infections. Deficiency can lead to blindness, illness and death.Supplements are available and the World Health Organisation advocates routine administration of vitamin A in countries where deficiency is a problem.High doses of vitamin A can be harmful, however, particularly in pregnancyMeanwhile, in a letter to US journal Science, a group of leading academics has accused Western non-governmental organisations of fuelling opposition to the development of GM technologies.They wrote: "If ever there was a clear-cut cause for outrage, it is the concerted campaign by Greenpeace and other non-governmental organisations, as well as by individuals, against golden rice."Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth have said there are more effective solutions to vitamin A deficiency.Mr Paterson also used the interview to defend the government's handling of the badger cull - aimed at preventing the spread of bovine TB - against criticism from animal welfare groups.He said: "I cannot understand anyone wanting to tolerate this disgusting disease."I find it incomprehensible that these badger groups don't see that this is a horrendous disease for the badgers themselves."</body>

      <description>Some carers looking after cancer patients in the UK are carrying out vital healthcare tasks without always having adequate training, says a charity.</description>

      <body>Some carers looking after cancer patients in the UK are carrying out vital healthcare tasks without always having adequate training, according to Macmillan Cancer Support.They asked more than 2,000 past and current carers about support they gave.Twenty-two per cent said they had dealt with specific healthcare tasks like administering medicine and pain relief, while others had to give injections.The charity wants the NHS to do more to support carers of people with cancer.There are estimated to be around 240,000 carers looking after family members with cancer in the UK.Some of the carers surveyed by Macmillan said they had to change dressings or even manage a catheter.Fewer than half said they had received training from a healthcare professional.Macmillan Cancer Support is pressing for an amendment to the Care Bill, which is due in the Commons later this month, placing a specific duty on the NHS in England to help cancer carers.A spokesperson from the Department of Health agreed that there needed to be better joint working."Proposals already in the Care Bill will mean that local authorities will have to co-operate and work closely with the NHS to identify and support carers."We have also provided £400m to the NHS for carers' breaks and given over £1.5m of funding to help develop initiatives with GPs, nurses and carers organisations to train people to help support them in their caring roles."In the survey carried out by YouGov for Macmillan Cancer Support, 63% of cancer carers who did not receive any training or said their training was not enough, were left feeling distressed and frightened.One in three of this group said they were scared that their lack of knowledge could result in the person they care for being admitted to hospital.A spokesperson for NHS England said not enough had been done in the past to ensure carers get the right training and support."Closer partnership working is already under way and the Integration Transformation Fund will act as a further catalyst for this."Health and Wellbeing Boards have been established, which bring together local clinical commissioning groups and local authorities to gain a shared understanding of the health and wellbeing needs of the community and develop a more responsive health and social care system which delivers better services and reduces health inequalities."Ciarán Devane, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support, said cancer carers took on a huge responsibility and deserved more help."Not only do cancer carers give hours of emotional support and practical help, they are performing clinical duties. Families and carers are the backbone of society and they deserve to be supported."The Care Bill legislation must be amended to ensure the NHS in England has a responsibility to work with local authorities to identify and signpost cancer carers to appropriate services."As the number of people diagnosed with cancer doubles in the next 20 years, there will also be a surge in the number of people caring for them."</body>

      <title>Labour backs parent-led schools</title>
      <description>Labour says it will support parents who want to set up new schools but the Conservatives say the opposition's policy on school choice has not changed.</description>

      <body>Labour is "on the side" of parents who want to set up schools and would not shut most existing free schools, the new shadow education secretary insists.Tristram Hunt told the BBC Labour backed "enterprise and innovation" when it came to increasing school places.He said a Labour government would push ahead with what it called parent-led academies in areas of educational need.Tory chairman Grant Shapps said Labour's policy was unchanged and it still opposed the "popular" schools.Free schools, set up by parents and other groups and operating outside local authority control, have been established under a policy pioneered by Education Secretary Michael Gove.More than 170 have been opened across England since September 2011.Labour has been accused by the government of sending out mixed messages about the party's support, opposing their roll-out nationally but backing schools locally.Mr Hunt, who has just taken over from Stephen Twigg as the party's education spokesman, said he regretted previously describing free schools as a "vanity project for yummy mummies". He made the comments in 2010 shortly after becoming an MP.Mr Hunt told BBC One's Andrew Marr programme Labour would not open new free schools "along the Michael Gove model", but that the bulk of existing free schools would be kept open as his party wanted to "keep the good free schools".Citing the case of the Al-Madinah free school in Derby, which was closed for a week earlier this month on the first day of an Ofsted inspection, Mr Hunt said Labour would not allow schools to become an "ideological experiment".Education Minister Lord Nash has warned the school would be closed unless "unacceptable" teaching standards improved.Its acting head teacher said there were areas the school needed to address and it was co-operating with Ofsted."What is going on with the Al-Madinah school is a terrifying example of the mistakes of Michael Gove's education policy," he said.New schools, he added, should only be opened in areas where there was a shortage of places, where "properly qualified" staff could be recruited and where institutions were financially accountable.Under Labour's plans, parent-led academies would enable parent groups and other organisations to set up schools outside local authority control, although local authorities would have greater powers to intervene when there were concerns about standards."If you are a group of parents, social entrepreneurs and teachers interested in setting up a school in areas where you need new school places, then the Labour government will be on your side."We are in favour of enterprise and innovation."But a Conservative Party spokesman said shadow chancellor Ed Balls had made it clear in a speech in June that the party would curb new schools in areas where they was an "excess" of places.Mr Balls had suggested a future Labour government would prioritise resources on areas where school places were in "short supply".Mr Shapps told the BBC: "This is the same old Labour policy. Free schools will only be allowed in specific circumstances in specific areas with a whole load of bureaucracy attached."Free schools have been driving up standards. They are hugely popular with parents and up to now Labour have fought tooth and nail against them including voting against them and what they said today has changed absolutely nothing."Journalist Toby Young, who helped set up a free school in west London, said Mr Hunt had been "less than candid" about Labour's policy as it was considering granting councils the power of veto over free schools in their boroughs.Writing in his blog for the Daily Telegraph, Mr Young - who has said he is considering of applying to be a Conservative candidate at the next election - said this would be a "retrograde step" since councils would be unlikely to approve new schools close to existing ones which were under-performing.Mr Hunt said there needed to be more focus on vocational education with support for further education colleges and apprenticeships in industry.</body>

      <body>WH Smith has taken its UK site completely offline until all abuse-themed e-books are removed from its product listings.The move comes after last week's revelations that Amazon, WH Smith, Barnes and Noble, and other retailers were selling pornographic e-books featuring incest, rape and bestiality on their sites.WH Smith said it was "disgusted" by such titles and found them "unacceptable".It takes e-book content from Kobo.com.In a statement Kobo said it was "working quickly to review its catalogue and remove the content, authors and publishers in question"."We are also evaluating new procedures to help ensure that this type of content will not become available... in the future," it said.Meanwhile visitors to the WHSmith.co.uk website were greeted by a holding page statement.The retailer said it had taken the site offline "to best protect our customers and the public"."Our website will become live again once all self published e-books have been removed and we are totally sure that there are no offending titles available", it said."We sincerely apologise for any offence caused."While Kobo said some publishers and authors had violated its self-publishing policies, it maintained that its goal was "not to negatively impact the freedom of expression and the work of the amazing self-published community that has been created at Kobo.com."Over the weekend US retailing giant Barnes and Noble said offending titles were "in violation" of its policy on content offered in the NOOK Bookstore and were in the process of being removed."When there are violations to the content policy that are brought to our attention, either through our internal process or from a customer or external source, we have a rapid response team in place to appropriately categorise or remove the content in accordance with our policy," it said.Self-published e-books have grown massively in popularity along with the growth in digital e-readers and tablet computers, but retailers have been struggling to filter explicit content that breaches their website guidelines.On Friday, technology news site The Kernel revealed how Amazon, Barnes and Noble, WH Smith, Waterstones and Foyles were listing what it called "breathtakingly obscene" books on their websites.But Fiona Allen, spokeswoman for Waterstones, told the BBC: "None of the e-books mentioned in current reporting are now or ever have been available in Waterstones shops or listed on Waterstones' website."She admitted that Waterstones was concerned about some print titles and was investigating those, but that all such printed book data was supplied by Nielsen, a data provider.</body>

      <title>Warming makes El Nino 'more intense'</title>
      <description>New research says that the El Nino weather phenomenon will be more intense as a result of rising temperatures.</description>

      <body>Scientists say they are more certain than ever about the impact of global warming on a critical weather pattern.The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) occurs in the Pacific Ocean but plays an important part in the world's climate system.Researchers have until now been unsure as to how rising temperatures would affect ENSO in the future.But this new study suggests that droughts and floods driven by ENSO will be more intense.The ENSO phenomenon plays a complicated role in the global weather system.The El Nino part of the equation sees a warming of the eastern and tropical Pacific, while its cooler sister, La Nina, makes things chillier in these same regions.Like water in a bathtub, the warmer or cooler waters slosh back and forth across the Pacific Ocean. They are responsible for rainfall patterns across Australia and the equatorial region, but their effects are also felt much further away.During the Northern Hemisphere winter, for example, you can get more intense rainfall over the southern part of the US in a warmer El Nino phase.For years, scientists have been concerned about how this sensitive weather system might be changed by rising temperatures from global warming.Now, in this new paper, published in the journal Nature, researchers give their most "robust" projections yet.Using the latest generation of climate models, they found a consistent projection for the future of ENSO.According to the lead author, Dr Scott Power from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, global warming interferes with the way El Nino temperature patterns affect rainfall."This interference causes an intensification of El Nino-driven drying in the western Pacific and rainfall increases in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific," he said.According to Dr Wenju Cai, a scientist at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), who was not involved with the study, the paper is "significant"."Up until now, there has been a lack of agreement among computer models as to how ENSO will change in the future," he explained."This paper is significant in that there is stronger agreement among different climate models in predicting the future impact."This study finds that both wet and dry anomalies will be greater in future El Nino years. This means that ENSO-induced droughts and floods will be more intense in the future."Follow Matt on Twitter.</body>

      <body>Astronaut thriller Gravity has kept its grip on the North American box office for a second consecutive weekend.The outer space drama starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney took $44.3m (£27.7m) according to early estimates.It easily beat Tom Hanks' latest film, Captain Phillips, which took $26m (£16.3m).The movie tells the true story of the cargo ship captain who was taken hostage by Somali pirates after his ship was hijacked in 2009.Both films have earned critical acclaim with both Bullock and Hanks tipped as likely Oscar contenders.Gravity's successful second week haul brings its total US domestic takings to $123.4m (£77.2m)."They say what goes up must come down, but that's not really true with Gravity," box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian said."To have opened as big as it did last week and only drop 21% [in revenue], that's really an amazing hold. It's a direct testament to the word of mouth on the movie."Animated sequel Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs 2 was at three in its third week of release with $14.2m (£8.9m).The weekend's only other new release, Machete Kills, opened in fourth place with $3.8m (£2.4m).The gun-toting sequel from director Robert Rodriguez and starring Danny Trejo and Michelle Rodriguez is the follow-up to Machete, which earned $11.4m (£7.1m) when it opened in 2010.Runner Runner, starring Ben Affleck and Justin Timberlake, fell two places to five with $3.7m (£2.3m)</body>

      <title>Why I shun the Champs Elysees</title>
      <description>The Champs Elysees - a triumph of modern-day town planning - has become a crowded tourist trap argues Hugh Schofield.</description>

      <body>I think I'm getting a reputation as the local eccentric. Down the end of the street where the BBC office is situated, on the corner with the Champs Elysees, someone recently got authorisation to run an on-street business venture that has my blood boiling.Every morning there are three or four ultra-expensive brightly-coloured open-top sports cars - Lamborettis or Maserghinis or something - with the words "Drive Me" painted on the side.Some rapper-style individuals lounge around in garments bearing the logo "Dream on Board". (Can you think of a more clunking, ugly slogan than "Dream on Board?" That's the new globalised English for you.)Anyway, it obviously works, because there's a constant small crowd of tourists gathered round, taking pictures of themselves and their friends in front of these garish totems of abject ostentation, and occasionally one of them will shell out the 90 euros (£76, $121) and go for a closely-supervised spin round the block.So why am I becoming the local eccentric? Because every morning when I cycle past I cannot help grinding my teeth and snarling - a bit like the elderly Clint Eastwood in the film Gran Torino - and muttering, not-so-sotto voce, pathetic interjections such as "It's only a car!" in the direction of the gawking tourists and the preening minders, who when they hear me stare back in total bewilderment. What planet is he on? is the general drift.But you see, Dream on Board - to me - is the modern Champs Elysees. Crass, style-less: expensive but naff.A year or two ago, I spotted a long line of people outside an elegant early 19th Century building down the bottom end near Avenue Montaigne. Aha, I thought. Maybe a new gallery. Or some rich philanthropist has opened his mansion for the elevation of the masses.But no, this particular hotel particulier had been acquired by a well-known American clothing company, and to this day the queues of shoppers (some of them, oddly, Americans) still stretch round the block, while the narcissistic boy greeters, turning vanity into an art-form, pose with swooning young females from Colombia or Taiwan.Lest you take this as the cantankerous rambling of a xenophobic sourpuss, let me assure you that most Parisians feel exactly the same way. Most Parisians don't go to the Champs Elysees (except maybe at Christmas to see the lights). They know it's crowded, stressful, overpriced - essentially a place for people not from the city to get a glimpse of an imaginary Paris that doesn't actually exist.Indeed it's a standing joke at the BBC, that if you want to go through that essential journalistic ritual known as the "vox pop" (interviewing passers-by) what the French call micro-trottoir what you don't do is go to Paris's most famous street. Why? Because you'll find it hard to identify anyone on the Champs-Elysees who's actually French.One person who I know agrees with me is Florian Anselme, author of a recent book called the Hidden Life of the Champs-Elysees. He bemoaned to me the loss of the old Champs, where Parisians would come and flaner - stroll beneath the plane trees, take a coffee, meet friends, go window shopping outside the luxury stores. All rather charming and French.Thirty years ago, he said, when Jacques Chirac was mayor, it all started changing. The big brands came in. Gulf Arabs began buying up the property. The flaneurs "flanned" away.And what they left behind is also, in parts, increasingly insalubrious. The Rue de Ponthieu for example, a side-street of the Champs-Elysees, though taking its romantic-sounding name from a northern French dukedom that was once the appanage of mediaeval kings of England, now has a line of nightclubs favoured by footballers, the banlieue drug-rich and escort girls.Transplanted to modern-day Paris, the caricaturist William Hogarth could have done a wonderful drawing there on the evils of cocaine, violence and electronic music played at very loud volumes. The young woman I saw urinating in the gutter at 7am last Sunday would probably have featured.It's all a great shame, because the Champs Elysees - the Elysian Fields - is in its conception a majestic piece of town planning. The long vista is still breathtaking, and in the lower part where the gardens are it remains pretty much unchanged. But too long has it rested on its laurels, like some corrupt late Roman emperor.Today if I'm asked by first-time visitors where they should go in Paris, my advice is clear. Love the Louvre. Marvel at the Marais. Elate at the Ile de la Cite. Get an eyeful of the Eiffel. But as Lewis Carroll said of the frumious bandersnatch: shun the Champs Elysees.From Our Own Correspondent: Listen online or download the podcast.BBC Radio 4: Saturdays at 11:30 and some Thursdays at 11:00BBC World Service: Short editions Monday-Friday - see World Service programme schedule.Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Whose science is it anyway?</title>
      <description>Progress in science has never observed national borders, says Lisa Jardine.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24477064</url>

      <body>Science can only develop by ignoring national borders, says Lisa Jardine.Since its modern beginnings in the 17th Century, science has been the most global of pursuits. Information and experimentation have criss-crossed national borders, as the curious have tried to explain the properties of natural phenomena.Marie Curie, discoverer of radium and winner of two Nobel prizes, put the matter characteristically bluntly: "Science is essentially international. It is only through lack of a historical sense that national qualities have been attributed to it."Not that you would think so if you have followed the science news this week. As the Nobel prizes for 2013 have been announced, each nation's media have rushed to claim the winners as their own."Three Americans win joint Nobel prize for medicine," shouted the headline in the New York Times. "A German and two Americans win the Nobel prize for medicine," counter-claimed Der Spiegel.One of this year's winners is indeed German born and trained, though he has worked for many years in the United States.On Tuesday the prize for physics went, as expected, to Britain's (or should that be Scotland's) Peter Higgs.Of the five other physicists who could lay claim to having made crucial early theoretical breakthroughs in relation to the Higgs-Boson particle, it was Francois Englert of Belgium alone who shared the prize with Higgs.Predictably, every Belgian newspaper I consulted on Wednesday morning ran a banner headline along the lines of "Belgian wins Nobel prize for physics", relegating Higgs to the second or third paragraph.Higgs and Englert published their theories of how certain particles acquire mass independently in 1964 - Higgs working in Edinburgh, and Englert and his long-term colleague Robert Brout in Brussels.It has been characteristic of advances in science since the beginning that a single problem is worked on - and ultimately solved at about the same time - by individuals and teams in different countries, who read the same papers, correspond and meet intermittently at academic conferences.An example on a much more modest scale from the period closest to my own heart as a historian, the 17th Century, is the investigation of a phenomenon known today as Prince Rupert's drops. As it happens, this too linked scientists in Britain and the Low Countries.If a globule of molten glass is dropped into a bucket of cold water, it cools to form a tear-shaped drop of a size that fits into the palm of your hand with a long, slender tail.This tadpole-shaped drop has extraordinary properties. The main body of the tear is remarkably strong - you can stand on it, or hit it with a hammer, without it breaking.But if the tiniest fragment is broken from the tail, the entire drop shatters and explodes with a loud bang, disintegrating into dust. This combination of strength and weakness, and its potential explosive possibilities, demanded an explanation.Prince Rupert's drops seem first to have attracted scientific interest in Germany in the 1640s. By the 1650s they were being examined and discussed in France and the Netherlands, with a whole range of theories being produced concerning the drop's strange properties. One of the earliest recorded attempts at an explanation involved the Dutch polymath Sir Constantijn Huygens and the amateur scientist Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle.Cavendish was domiciled in Antwerp at the time, exiled from Britain during the Commonwealth period. In a letter to her following a visit, Huygens recorded a conversation they had about the drops - at the time known as "Dutch tears" - in her private chemistry laboratory. There, each week, she apparently "dirtied several white petticoats" worn as overalls to protect her clothing while she conducted experiments.Enclosing several specimens, Huygens begs her to investigate their properties. "The King of France is as yet unresolved in the question, notwithstanding he hath been curious to move it to an assembly of the best philosophers of Paris."The duchess replied a week later. She expressed her gratitude to Huygens for seeking her opinion. In her view, the cause of the explosion when the tip of the drop was broken was that there was a tiny quantity of volatile material trapped inside which reacted violently on contact with air.With a nice feminine touch, she observed that if liquid had somehow been inserted into the drops (actually, the drops contain no liquid) it would have required no greater skill than that employed to make fashionable glass earrings."Women wear at their ears for pendants as great wonders, glass bobs with narrow necks as these glasses have tails, and yet it is filled with several colours silks and coarse black cotton-wool, which to my sense is more difficult to put into these glass pendants, than liquor into these glass guns."The correspondence continued for some weeks, though neither party could come up with anything like an acceptable explanation.In 1661, the properties of the "glass bubbles" were demonstrated at a meeting of the recently formed Royal Society in London. Several of its founding members had recently returned from continental Europe at the Restoration of Charles II - including the king's German cousin Prince Rupert, who gave his name to the drops. So it is not surprising that specimens of what diarist Samuel Pepys called "Chymicall glasses" came with them."The king sent by Sir Paul Neile five little glass bubbles," the minutes of the meeting record, "in order to have the judgement of the society concerning them."Anxious to impress the king (whose financial support the society was actively seeking) the members responded immediately. More drops were produced and experimented on two days later, and a full report of the experiments given to the society at its weekly meeting by the president.These were shared with the French traveller Balthasar de Monconys when he attended the Royal Society. He made his own French translation of the report, and discussed the drops and their properties with the scientific community in Leiden when he visited shortly afterwards.It was my scientific hero Robert Hooke, the society's curator of experiments - the person in charge of those experiments recorded in 1661 - who made an important early contribution to explaining this strange phenomenon, based on the differential cooling of the glass itself after it was plunged into water, and drawing an analogy with the way the locked stones in brick arches collapse instantaneously and violently once the keystone is removed.Hooke used his new microscope to examine drops which had been shattered, but held intact with strong glue. His contributions to a theoretical explanation cover 11 closely-argued pages in his 1665 Micrographia.In the 19th Century the great Lord Kelvin added his contribution. But the behaviour of these "Dutch tears" was not fully explained until the 1920s. So multiple connections between at least four European nations contributed to the eventual properly scientific understanding of "Prince Rupert's drops".I might add that Margaret Cavendish's involvement in the story is not her only appearance in early modern science. Pepys described in his diary a sensational London social event in 1667, when the duchess paid a ceremonial visit to the Royal Society at the invitation of its president and fellows - the only woman to do so before the modern era. Among the experiments carried out for her were several involving Robert Boyle's famous "evacuating engine" or air pump.It is tempting for the historian to claim landmark events in science on behalf of the nation to which he or she belongs. I have come close to doing as much myself, when I hinted that Hooke might have been the first to provide an explanation for the behaviour of Prince Rupert's drops. Brian Cox begins his recent Science Britannica TV series by announcing: "In these films I want to explore Britain's pivotal role in creating modern science."But science has always ignored national borders, in pursuit of the fullest possible understanding of nature. Even at the height of the Anglo-Dutch wars in the mid-17th Century, correspondence full of information and data continued to be exchanged uncensored between Dutch scientists and the Royal Society in London.Higgs and Englert have been quick to point out that the crucial experimental work at CERN that confirmed their Nobel-prize winning theoretical breakthrough was the result of global teamwork, involving thousands of researchers and almost 100 nationalities.To be true to the benefits of a scientific future we have to honour its equally international past.Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <description>Letting agents in London are prepared to discriminate against would-be tenants on the grounds of race, a BBC undercover investigation reveals.</description>

      <body>Letting agents in London are prepared to discriminate against would-be tenants on the grounds of race, a BBC undercover investigation has revealed.Under the Equality Act 2010, it is illegal for businesses to refuse to provide a service based on ethnicity.But 10 firms told a reporter posing as a landlord they would not let to African-Caribbean people at his request.A black researcher was denied viewings, yet his white counterpart was welcomed.BBC London was initially tipped off certain letting agents were willing to discriminate against African-Caribbean people on behalf of landlords, with the alleged misdoing rife in parts of west London.To expose the practices, a plush three-bedroom flat in north Kensington was acquired. Letting agents from 10 firms were invited to assess its rental value.All 10 were recorded on secret camera saying they would be prepared not to show the flat to African-Caribbean people - and many detailed how they had done it before.The lettings manager at A to Z Property Services, in Dollis Hill, said: "We cannot be shown discriminating against a community. But obviously we've got our ways around that."99% of my landlords don't want Afro-Caribbeans or any troublesome people."The lettings manager at National Estate Agents, Willesden, said: "When someone [African-Caribbean] comes in, we won't advise them of this property."Even if it does get [asked about] we make up an excuse, to be honest with you."When a black researcher asked to view the property, the National agent told him: "I'm sorry, that one's gone."The property was still on the market - and a white researcher got offered a viewing.The A to Z agent told the black researcher he would call him to arrange a viewing. Despite a second inquiry, the agent never got back in touch.The agent had previously explained how he could deter unwanted tenants, saying: "We don't say no there and then. We just don't call them back (laughter)."Once again, the white researcher received an appointment with no fuss.Figures shared with the BBC suggest perception of discrimination remains widespread.A survey of 750 adults by the Runnymede Trust found 29% of black people seeking private housing had experienced discrimination - compared to 1% of white respondents.Rob Berkeley, director of Runnymede, said: "It's shocking that in 2013 outright racism is stopping people from finding a home."Many people think the days of landlords hanging 'No Blacks' signs outside properties are long gone - but discrimination clearly still exists."Despite repeated approaches, National Estate Agents made no comment.When confronted in his office, the A to Z Property Services agent said it was "pointless taking on a property" if the landlord "doesn't like" the client's ethnicity.He continued: "We have plenty of Afro-Caribbean clients - I can show you our files."We've got nothing to hide. We don't discriminate against anybody."The investigation comes 45 years after race relations laws banning discrimination in housing first came in.After viewing the BBC's evidence, equality lawyer Arpita Dutt said: "These individuals know what they're doing and know what they're doing is wrong."Equally, they know how to get round it."There's no defence that 'I did it because somebody told me to' - it's absolutely unlawful and in this case there was clear discrimination."Don Foster MP, who was the housing minister between 2012 and 2013, said: "I was horrified. Discrimination has no place in London, it has no place in the rest of the country. We've got firm legislation against it."What it will rely on is people who've been the victim of discrimination coming forward."But BBC London has learned that, although 36 people told the Property Ombudsman they were the victim of racial discrimination in the past three years, not one single complaint was upheld.Only two allegations resulted in a full investigation.Mr Foster said existing enforcement was robust and the government was making membership of industry redress schemes mandatory for letting agents.During its investigation the BBC spoke to letting agents who condemned the practices exposed.Nicola Humphries, of Maida Vale Properties, said: "I'm appalled by the behaviour of some agents in the industry."There are some agents who will say anything and do anything to close a deal."We need to change the culture - but like any sales business it's a cut throat world and maintaining integrity is not easy."Inside Out London is broadcast on BBC One at 19:30 BST and nationwide on the iPlayer for seven days thereafter</body>

      <body>A woman convicted of murder 20 years ago believes new evidence being examined by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) will clear her name.Susan May, 68, served 12 years in prison for the murder of her aunt, Hilda Marchbank, at her home in Royton, Greater Manchester, in 1993.The prosecution's case hinged on a "blood-stained handprint" at the scene.But a fingerprint expert has said there is "overwhelming evidence" the marks were not made in blood.Ms May, who was the first person in the UK to be released at her earliest parole date without admitting guilt, has had two failed appeals. Her campaign to clear her name is backed by 100 MPs and peers.Now the CCRC, set up to review possible miscarriages of justice, has agreed to investigate whether her case should be referred back to the Court of Appeal for a rare third time.It is looking into a report - commissioned by campaigners - by fingerprint analyst Arie Zeelenberg, former head of the Dutch national police fingerprint service.He examined high resolution photographs - which were not seen by the jury - of the marks on the wall.His report concludes: "There is no evidence that the finger marks... attributed to Susan May were placed in blood."In fact there is overwhelming evidence that they were not comprised of blood but instead of sweat and a minor residue of another unknown substance."The original trial jury was told Ms May's fingerprint was found in a "blood-stained hand print". One police officer told the court it was made by "quite a lot" of blood when she allegedly beat her aunt about the face and suffocated her with a pillow.The jury was shown photographs of the bedroom wall after it had been treated with chemicals including iodine.The pictures examined by Mr Zeelenberg, which came to light when they were requested from Greater Manchester Police (GMP) by the CCRC in the past year, show that prior to treatment they [the prints] were "almost invisible" to the naked eye."They are clearly very faint marks, hardly attributable to having been made the night before with hands covered in blood so that it ran down the wall," Friends Of Susan May (FOSM) campaigner Geoff Goodwin said.Ms May said: "To date there is no [conclusive] scientific proof that the marks were in blood despite prosecution claims."I sincerely hope now that the commission will see fit to refer my case back to the Court of Appeal because it undermines the whole prosecution case."Campaigners have also asked the CCRC to consider critical reviews of the police investigation into Mrs Marchbank's murder written by the former deputy head of Hampshire CID, Des Thomas.In one report, commissioned by the campaign, he states he found "anomalies" in the police inquiry that "may point to an investigation, the principle purpose of which was to prove, by the selective use and non-disclosure of evidence, the hypothesis that Susan May was guilty of murdering her aunt".The police chief in charge of the original investigation was previously said by the CCRC to have given "inconsistent accounts" and "apparently mistaken recollections", impacting on his credibility.Evidence the jury never heard includes a witness claiming a red car was outside Mrs Marchbank's house with its engine running at around the time of the murder.A transcript of the police actions log also shows that an anonymous call was made to police the following morning naming a well-known convicted burglar as the killer.Ms May said: "All this new evidence points to the fact that my conviction is unsafe. If the jury heard the case as it is now, with some witnesses discredited and without the main plank of their case - the so-called blood marks - they couldn't come to the same conclusion."The CCRC said it was considering Mr Zeelenberg's report and seeking the opinion of other experts.A spokesman said: "This is one of a number of lines of enquiry we are pursuing."We continue to work as quickly as we can and we are making good progress with the investigation."A Greater Manchester Police (GMP) spokesman said: "As this appeal is ongoing it would not be appropriate to comment."</body>

      <title>Grangemouth strike talks to be held</title>

      <body>The operator of the Grangemouth refinery and petrochemical site is to begin talks with union bosses in a bid to avert a planned 48-hour strike.Members of the Unite union are planning to walk out on Sunday in a row over the treatment of a union convener.Ineos, operator of the site, said negotiations would start later at arbitration service Acas, in Glasgow.Unite said it had been "working tirelessly" over the weekend to secure the talks.Ineos has warned that the threatened strike "could effectively shut much of Scotland" by disrupting fuel supply.The strike could potentially disrupt the flow of Brent crude from the North Sea.The Scottish and UK governments have been drawing up contingency plans and had called for more talks between the two sides.Announcing the talks on Sunday night, Ineos Grangemouth chairman Calum MacLean said: "We have always been prepared to go to Acas if this helps to resolve a strike that Grangemouth petrochemical plant and refinery cannot afford."We hope to be able to resolve the dispute and address the financial issues that threaten the survival of the entire site."Previously, the company labelled the union action as "completely irresponsible" while the union accused Ineos of "gunboat irresponsible diplomacy".Unite Scottish Secretary Pat Rafferty said: "We welcome Ineos's change of heart to join us at Acas."We've repeatedly urged the company to sit down with us at the conciliation service to resolve the issues surrounding the unfair treatment of our convenor and the future of Grangemouth."Over the weekend we have been working tirelessly to secure these talks and hope that the company will engage in them in an open constructive manner."UK Energy Secretary Ed Davey said the talks were a "very welcome and encouraging step."He added: "I have worked hard with both sides to persuade them to attend talks with Acas and I am extremely pleased that this is now happening."Acas has the expertise to help both parties reach a sustainable solution for the company, the workforce and the whole economy."A spokeswoman for the Scottish government said contingency planning had been under way since the strike was announced.She said: "Ministers and officials have redoubled efforts to encourage Unite and Ineos to enter talks and we welcome the fact that they are now going to talk this afternoon."It is important that both sides have time and space to progress discussions, resolve the issues between them and move away from strike action."Ineos has said it will do all it can to "minimise the harm" of a strike.The North Sea's Forties pipeline system could be affected because the Kinneil oil processing terminal - where oil from the Forties field comes ashore - relies on Grangemouth for its steam and power.The dispute centres on union convener Stephen Deans, who was involved in the row over the selection of a Labour candidate in Falkirk.Labour cleared Unite after an investigation of trying to rig the selection of a party candidate - claims that led to a major row between the union and Ed Miliband.Mr Deans, who is chairman of both Labour's local constituency party and Unite in Scotland, was suspended by Ineos then reinstated.Ineos said an investigation by "a third party" into Mr Deans' conduct was due to be completed by 25 October.It recently launched a survival plan for Grangemouth, warning that the site would close by 2017 without investment and reduced costs. The company said the plant was losing £10m a month.The Grangemouth refinery processes 210,000 barrels of oil per day and provides most of Scotland's fuel. It is owned jointly by Ineos and PetroChina.</body>

      <body>Police investigating the death of a man who was hit by an HGV and then dragged underneath it for three miles have traced the vehicle's driver.Robert Finlayson, 22, was found dead on a road in Lanarkshire on 23 September.Officers and Mr Finlayson's mother Angela had appealed for the driver of the Mercedes Actros to come forward.The driver has now been found, as has the driver of a car which struck Mr Finlayson after he had been carried under the Mercedes.Neither motorist has been charged by police.Insp Calum Maider of Motherwell Road Policing Unit said he was still looking for the driver of another vehicle which is also thought to have struck Mr Finlayson.He said: "We have now traced the driver of a Mercedes Actros heavy goods vehicle which was travelling on the B7078 and struck Mr Finlayson. This vehicle is now the subject of a forensic and mechanical examination. The driver will be interviewed in due course."We have also traced and interviewed the driver of Suzuki Ignis which struck Mr Finlayson after he had been carried under the Mercedes. However there is still a vehicle outstanding."A silver coloured Renault Traffic Crew cab Sport Van, or Vauxhall Movano which is similar in style, was travelling between the Suzuki Ignus and the Mercedes Actros and I am keen to trace the driver."He may be unaware that he has struck Mr Finlayson and it is important that he comes forward."Anyone with further information regarding Mr Finlayson's death, and in particular the driver of the vehicle still being sought, has been asked to telephone the non-emergency number 101.Mr Finlayson, from Hamilton, was seen on CCTV at about 04:10, standing on the north side of the over bridge of the M74 motorway Junction 10 and then heading north on the northbound carriageway of the B7078, where it appears he was attempting to hitchhike.The road was busier than normal because of a diversion from the motorway.More than 40 vehicles, many of them heavy goods vehicles delivering to large retail outlets, were diverted onto the B7078 between 04:00 and 04:30.Several northbound vehicles were seen moving onto the opposite lane to pass Mr Finlayson safely, but police said he was then struck by a vehicle and carried underneath it for three miles to Blackwood, where his body was found.Officers said the the driver of the Mercedes Actros may not have known his vehicle had struck Mr Finlayson.</body>

      <body>The M1 motorway has fully reopened following a security alert that caused major traffic disruption on Monday morning.The motorway was closed in both directions for more than eight hours between the Lisburn/Saintfield turn-off and Stockman's Lane.The M1 re-opened country-bound just before 10:30 BST, and the remainder opened a short time later.It followed an alert on the Black's Road off-slip, west Belfast.A diversion was in place via Stockman's Lane and the Saintfield Road junction at Lisburn.Apart from long delays at both ends of the closure, during rush hour the alert also caused severe tailbacks leaving the M1 at Moira as drivers took an alternative route via the A26 through Nutts Corner.There was also a tailback of city-bound traffic back to Lurgan and country-bound to the Broadway roundabout.The alert had a knock-on effect on traffic coming into Belfast on the Lisburn road, Andersonstown Road, the Hillhall Road, Upper Malone Road and Milltown Road.Speaking from the M1 at about 07:00 BST, BBC Northern Ireland's Barra Best said the roads were busier than usual as hundreds of vehicles were being forced off the motorway due to the alert."Right in front of me buses, lorries, lots of cars having to make the diversion through Lisburn, instead of making their journey down through the motorway to Belfast," he said.This was the latest in a series of alerts in the past week that have caused major travel disruption.Traffic on part of the M1 was badly disrupted on Saturday following the discovery of a suspicious object.Police later described the object as "an elaborate hoax".A section of the motorway was also closed on Monday last week because of a security alert.</body>

      <body>Relatives of Claudy bomb victims have said they will continue their fight for justice after police confirmed they were suspending their investigation.Nine people were killed when three bombs exploded in the County Londonderry village in July 1972.On Friday, the PSNI told relatives of the victims their inquiries would not resume unless new information or evidence was received.One woman injured in the bombing said she still wanted to find out the truth.Ulster Unionist councillor Mary Hamilton said: "They are hoping, maybe, that we get fed up and forget about it, but to this day I carry the injuries that I had."I have shrapnel in both my legs and I suffer every day with it."It makes me think, here we are ten miles down the road, Bloody Sunday got so much money spent on them and the people of Claudy are just forgotten about."Both Protestants and Catholics were killed in the Claudy blasts.The youngest victim was eight-year-old Kathryn Eakin who was cleaning the windows of her family's grocery store when the first bomb exploded.On Sunday, Ulster Unionist assembly member Tom Elliott, who was at Friday's meeting, said the families felt let down by the police."It came like a bolt out of the blue to the victims and indeed to me and others who were there as well," Mr Elliott said."We didn't see any of that coming, had no hint of it beforehand at all."I have to say it has left the victims deeply frustrated and angry - the families do feel very let down."TUV leader Jim Allister said in a statement it was "astounding and utterly unacceptable that the police investigation has been abandoned"."Their haste to move on and forget about Claudy is symptomatic of a reluctance to investigate anything capable of disturbing the peace process," he added.Police have called on anyone who knows anything to come forward.In 2010, a Northern Ireland police ombudsman's report said detectives had concluded that the late Father James Chesney, who was later moved to the Republic of Ireland, was a suspect.It said the police, the state and the Catholic Church had covered up Fr Chesney's suspected role in the bombing.No action was ever taken against Fr Chesney, who died in 1980.</body>

      <title>Bone marrow donor campaign launches</title>
      <description>A campaign to raise awareness about becoming a bone marrow donor in Wales, joining 75,000 already registered, is launched.</description>

      <body>A new campaign to raise awareness about becoming a bone marrow donor in Wales is being launched.There are an estimated 20,000 people worldwide desperately searching for a possible match to an unrelated donor.In Wales, more than 75,000 people have already joined a database of potential marrow donors, but the Welsh Blood Service says many more are needed.As part of the campaign, a choir of donors, patients and medical staff has been brought together to perform.The '2nd Chance Choir' will be making their debut at the Wales Millennium Centre later on Monday, as the campaign kicks off.It is the first time the Welsh Blood Service has run a bone marrow donor awareness programme.Dr Keith Wilson, consultant haematologist at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, said with bone marrow donors it is always about having a choice from as many people as possible."What are the chances of you walking down your street and meeting your exact double, who is like you in every way," he explained."It is not very likely. But if you are searching for that double among thousands and thousands of different people, perhaps you will find that match."That is what the bone marrow donor register is about."It is a worldwide register - the person who needs treatment here in Wales, may be a match to a donor in Europe, America, Asia - anywhere in the world."So we need as many people as possible to sign up for the register to see if they can help."He said he was treating one patient who would be getting a donor matched from Japan or China."Basically, the bigger the pool of people who are registered as donors, the better the chance of a match," he added.Dr Wilson said Wales was already doing well in the league table of donors registered but even more could be done.The Wales bone marrow register is asked to make about 30,000 searches a year to find a possible donor match, and since 1989, more than 850 people in Wales have gone on to become donors.Anyone who is already registered as a blood donor can become part of the marrow register, and a small sample of blood is taken at a donation session.The bone marrow can be used to treat a wide-range of cancers, as well as help rebuild damaged immune systems.The procedures for actual donation if a match is found have also changed dramatically.It used to mean an operation involving anaesthetics and painful injections.Now the preferred method is to collect the marrow from blood."We can collect the donor marrow much more efficiently this way - it just means being hooked up to a machine for four or five hours" added Dr Wilson, who is chair of the south Wales blood and marrow transplantation project."So it's not painful - perhaps boring - you just need a long book."</body>

      <title>Taylor challenges UK jail sentence</title>
      <description>Liberian ex-President Charles Taylor asks to serve his 50-year war crimes sentence in Rwanda, rather than the UK, where he is due to be transferred.</description>

      <body>Ex-Liberian President Charles Taylor has asked to serve his 50-year sentence for war crimes in Rwanda, rather than the UK.In a letter sent to the court that convicted him, he says it would be easier - and less expensive - for his family to visit him in Africa.He also said he feared being attacked in a British prison.Taylor was convicted of aiding rebels who committed atrocities in Sierra Leone during its civil war.Last week, a UK minister confirmed that Taylor would be transferred to a British prison.He was convicted by the UN-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL), but his trial was held in The Hague in case it sparked renewed unrest in West Africa.The Netherlands only agreed to host the trial if he was imprisoned elsewhere.In a letter seen by the BBC, Taylor wrote:"My position is that serving my sentence in Rwanda, in my home continent of Africa, would be substantially more humane not only on my own account, but also on account of the impact on my family."He noted that the court's statutes said access for prisoners' relatives should be taken into account when deciding where they should serve their sentence.He said that it would be cheaper and easier to travel to Rwanda - and that Liberian nationals could obtain visas at the airport, unlike in the UK.Taylor, 65, was convicted on 11 crimes including terrorism, rape, murder and the use of child soldiers by rebel groups in neighbouring Sierra Leone during the 1991-2002 conflict, in which some 50,000 people died.He was found to have supplied weapons to the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels in exchange for so-called blood diamonds.The rebels were notorious for hacking off the limbs of civilians to terrorise the population.Taylor has always insisted he is innocent and his only contact with the rebels was to urge them to stop fighting.He is the first former head of state convicted by an international war crimes court since World War II.In his three-page letter, dated 10 October, Taylor continued: "My name is now associated with horrendous atrocities. Prison inmates, whether from the region or not, are likely to be inclined to inflict their own brand of justice by attacking me."He pointed out that "a significant number of individuals from Sierra Leonean background are in detention in prisons in the UK" and noted that in 2011, Bosnian war criminal Radislav Krstic was attacked in a British jail by three Muslim men, apparently in revenge for his role in the Bosnian conflict.Taylor argued that the UK authorities "may also simply be unaware of the groups that might be particularly motivated to attack me in prison"."In short, incarceration in the United Kingdom will likely - and very soon - lead to me being seriously injured or killed."Some other people convicted by the SCSL are already serving their sentences in Rwanda.Last week, UK Justice Minister Jeremy Wright noted that the British offer to host Taylor had enabled his trial to proceed in The Hague.He told parliament: "The conviction of Charles Taylor is a landmark moment for international justice.""It clearly demonstrates that those who commit atrocities will be held to account and that no matter their position they will not enjoy impunity."Taylor's appeal against his conviction was rejected last month and he remains in The Hague, awaiting transfer.</body>

      <title>Italy steps up migrant boat patrols</title>
      <description>Italy says it is stepping up sea and air patrols in the southern Mediterranean following the deaths of hundreds of migrants sailing from North Africa.</description>

      <body>Italy is stepping up sea and air patrols following the deaths of hundreds of migrants sailing in overcrowded boats from North Africa.Prime Minister Enrico Letta said an "air and naval package" would start on Monday south of Sicily.On Friday at least 33 people died when their boat capsized between Malta and the Italian island of Lampedusa.A week earlier, more than 350 migrants died in another shipwreck off Lampedusa.Italy has previously called for EU help in dealing with the thousands of desperate migrants who wash up on its beaches every year. Many are families fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East who hope for a better life in Europe.But the recent loss of life has led to further calls for EU action.Italian Defence Minister Mario Mauro said the country intended to triple its presence in the southern Mediterranean.It had become necessary "in part by the fact that Libya is currently a 'non-state'," he told Italian newspaper Avvenire."We need strong action to stop these shipwrecks," he added.Italian media reported that unmanned drone aircraft based in Sicily could also be used to identify boats in trouble.Foreign Minister Emma Bonino said the patrols would be to rescue migrants rather than "telling them to stay where they are".In addition to coastguard and border police vessels, the Italian navy currently has three ships supported by four helicopters patrolling the area. It can also call on two surveillance aircraft with night-vision capabilities.A spokesman for the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, in Lampedusa told the BBC that Italy is also planning to increase its capacity for receiving migrants from 8,000 to 16,000."[Migrants] should be transferred to the mainland, to the proper reception system. It's a huge effort [Italy] is making... the reception capability will be raised starting from next January," Maurizio Molina said.Migrants who survived Friday's capsize say they were were shot at as they left Libya.One survivor told the BBC that some on board were shot and that bullet holes caused the boat to start sinking.Some have suggested that the Libyan coast guard had fired at the boat, though other accounts suggested that rival trafficking gangs or Libyan militiamen may have been to blame.Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat visited Libya on Sunday where he discussed the issue of migrant boats with his Libyan counterpart Ali Zeidan."We are determined to deal with the problem," Mr Zeidan said."Several measures have been taken in terms of equipment and the addition of maritime police to increase the monitoring of our shores," he added."But, as you know, human traffickers have gained considerable expertise on this matter and despite tightening measures sometimes it is out of the hands of the authorities."Armed militias still hold some power in parts of Libya since they helped topple Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Mr Zeidan was himself seized by militiamen last Thursday and held for several hours before being released.Mr Muscat has called on EU states to act over the migrant boats, saying that a "cemetery" was being created in the Mediterranean.According to the UN, some 32,000 migrants have arrived in Malta and Italy this year.</body>

      <body>The death toll from a stampede at a Hindu festival in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh has risen to 115, local officials have said.Many were crushed after panic broke out on a bridge near the Ratangarh temple. Others drowned when they jumped from the bridge into river waters below.Officials said the stampede may have been sparked by a rumour that the bridge had been about to collapse.Hundreds of thousands had gathered for the festival of Navratra (nine nights).Funeral pyres burned throughout the night, with many of the victims already cremated by Monday morning."The death toll has now gone up to 115 and more than 110 injured," news agency AFP quoted senior police official DK Arya in Datia district as saying on Monday."Ten of those [injured] are in a very critical state," he added.Earlier, officials said they had recovered bodies of people who had been crushed to death from the river.Meanwhile, relatives gathered outside hospitals to take away the bodies of the dead after post mortems had been carried out.Many were still searching for loved ones among the dead and the injured.The BBC's Zubair Ahmed in Datia said thousands of devotees were still thronging the temple on Monday.Many took a bath in the Sindh river before going into the temple to offer prayers.The accident happened at about 09:00 (03:30 GMT) on Sunday. The victims were mostly women and children, officials said.The narrow bridge is about 500m long and had only recently been rebuilt following another stampede in 2006 in which more than 50 people had died.Local official Sanket Bhondve said the immediate priority was to provide relief to the injured.Stampedes occur relatively frequently at religious festivals in India, which attract large crowds.In the past year, dozens have died in similar tragedies.In 2011 more than 100 died at a festival in the southern state of Kerala.Inside Jodhpur's Mehrangarh Fort, more than 220 people were killed in 2008 in a stampede at the Chamunda Devi Hindu temple.</body>

      <body>Hundreds of thousands of people who were evacuated before Cyclone Phailin crashed into eastern India have begun returning to their homes.But many will remain in shelters as their homes and businesses were wrecked by the strongest cyclone in 14 years.As the storm weakened a vast relief operation got under way in Orissa and Andhra Pradesh states, where officials say up to one million were displaced.Mass evacuations managed to keep the death toll to a bare minimum.Officials said 22 people were killed - all but one of the deaths were in Orissa.The cyclone flattened many coastal homes, uprooted trees and blocked roads in the two states but the evacuation effort - described by officials as "the biggest in India's history for such an event" - ensured the death toll remained low.Correspondents say before the cyclone hit, the authorities moved - sometimes forcibly - nearly one million people into temporary shelters set up in schools and government buildings.The move has earned the Indian authorities rare praise for their preparedness.In 1999 a cyclone killed more than 10,000 people in Orissa.Thousands of families have started going back to their homes on Monday morning, the BBC's Sanjoy Majumder reports from Berhampur in Orissa.Many, however, remain in temporary shelters since their villages and homes have been destroyed or inundated, our correspondent adds.The authorities have promised that power and road access would be restored in the state by Monday evening, except in the worst-hit Ganjam district.The massive storm made landfall on Saturday evening, with winds of about 200 km per hour (125mph).It began weakening on Sunday as it made its way north-west.But the intense storm has made more than half-a-million people homeless, state government officials said.The storm tore down power and communication lines and knocked out road and rail links, making an assessment difficult.An estimated 5,000 sq km of mostly paddy crops have been destroyed, causing a loss of some $320m (£220m).Meanwhile, 28 sailors, who went missing after their ship sank in the cyclone, have been rescued from the Bay of Bengal, a defence spokesman told the BBC.They were rescued from lifeboats north-east of Orissa's Balasore district, he said.Send your pictures and videos to yourpics@bbc.co.uk or text them to 61124 (UK) or +44 7624 800 100 (International).

      <title>German 'luxury bishop' in Pope plea</title>
      <description>A German Roman Catholic bishop accused of lavish spending flies to Rome for talks at the Vatican about whether he can stay in office.</description>

      <body>A German bishop has flown - reportedly with a budget airline - to the Vatican in Rome to discuss his lavish spending.Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst - dubbed the "Luxury Bishop" - is facing calls for his resignation after spending 31m euros (£26m; $42m) on his residence.He is also accused of lying about the over-spend on the property in Limburg.In Rome, he will meet the head of the Catholic Church in Germany, Archbishop Robert Zollitsch. It is not clear if Pope Francis will intervene.Since taking office in March, Pope Francis has urged the Church to promote a lifestyle of frugality and simplicity.The allegations have stoked controversy among Catholics in Germany, where Martin Luther launched the Reformation in Europe five centuries ago in response to what he said were excesses and abuses within the Church.German Catholics also pay a compulsory tax to the Church as part of their income tax, and many are shocked by the apparent financial waste - prompting some to stage demonstrations outside the bishop's residence in Limburg, a town in Hesse near Frankfurt-on-Main."The bishop has made it clear that any decision about his service as a bishop lies in the hands of the Holy Father (Pope Francis)," said a statement issued by the diocese on Saturday."The bishop is saddened by the escalation of the current discussion. He sees and regrets that many believers are suffering under the current situation," it said.Bishop Tebartz-van Elst is also accused of twice lying under oath about a flight he took to India on a trip to visit poor children.The 53-year-old had filed a civil court claim against Der Spiegel magazine, which is based in Hamburg, for reporting that he had flown first-class on the trip.After being forced to print a retraction, the magazine filed a legal complaint of its own. As evidence, it published mobile phone video (in German) of its interview with Bishop Tebartz-van Elst, in which he clearly stated that he had flown business class.Asked by the German daily Bild about the high cost of his new residence, the bishop said: "I understand that the high cost of 31m euros sounds frightening. Those who know me know that I don't have a pompous lifestyle."Archbishop Zollitsch said he had set up a commission to investigate the finances of Limburg diocese.He said he would "speak to the Holy Father and the relevant people" about the issue in Rome.</body>

      <title>Cancer costing Europe 'billions'</title>
      <description>Cancer costs countries in the European Union 126bn euro (£107bn) a year, according to an analysis.</description>

      <body>Cancer costs countries in the European Union 126bn euro (£107bn) a year, according to the first EU-wide analysis of the economic impact of the disease.The charity Cancer Research UK said it was a "huge burden".The figures, published in the Lancet Oncology, included the cost of drugs and health care as well as earnings lost through sickness or families providing care.Lung cancer was the most costly form of the disease.The team from the University of Oxford and King's College London analysed data from each of the 27 nations in the EU in 2009.The showed the total cost was 126bn euro and of that 51bn (£43bn) euro was down to healthcare costs including doctors' time and drug costs.Lost productivity, because of work missed through sickness or dying young, cost 52bn (£44bn) euro while the cost to families of providing care was put at 23bn (£19.5bn) euro.Overall, richer countries, such as Germany and Luxembourg, spent more on cancer treatment per person than eastern European countries such as Bulgaria and Lithuania.Lung cancer accounted for more than a tenth of all cancer costs in Europe. The deadly cancer tends to affect people at an earlier age than other cancers so the lost productivity through early deaths is a major factor.However, the overall economic burden is behind the costs of dementia and cardiovascular disease.An EU-wide study, by the same research group, showed cardiovascular diseases, including high blood pressure and stroke, cost 169bn euro (£144bn) a year while dementia cost 189bn euro (£169bn) in just 15 countries in Western Europe.Dementia has very high costs associated with long-term care while cardiovascular diseases include such a wide range of conditions it affects many more people than cancer.One of the researchers, Dr Ramon Luengo-Fernandez, from the Health Economics Research Centre at the University of Oxford, said: "By estimating the economic burden of several diseases it will be possible to help allocate public research funding towards the diseases with the highest burden and highest expected returns for that investment."Prof Richard Sullivan, from King's College London, said: "It is vital that decision-makers across Europe use this information to identify and prioritise key areas."More effective targeting of investment may prevent health care systems from reaching breaking point - a real danger given the increasing burden of cancer - and in some countries better allocation of funding could even improve survival rates."Sara Osborne, head of policy at Cancer Research UK, said: "The financial impact that cancer has on the economy across Europe due to people dying prematurely from the disease and time off work remains a huge burden."This study reinforces why research is vital to improve our understanding of the causes of cancer - so that we lessen the impact of the disease and develop better ways to prevent and treat the illness."We also need to understand why the UK's cancer mortality rates remain higher than many EU countries despite a similar spend on cancer care."</body>

      <body>Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has left hospital five days after having surgery to remove a blood clot on her brain.President Fernandez, 60, was in high spirits and had already returned to her official residence, a government spokesman said.She suffered a head injury in August and was told last week to halt her congressional election campaign.Doctors have advised her to have "strict rest" for 30 days.She has also been advised to avoid air travel for the next month."She remains in high spirits. Constantly recovering. She sends her love", presidential spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro said shortly before Ms Fernandez was driven away from Favaloro Foundation hospital in Buenos Aires."Due to the favourable post-operative evolution of the president, it has been decided to discharge her today," the medical report read.It is not clear when the president will reassume her duties.A day after doctors discovered the subdural haematoma, Ms Kirchner complained of loss of sensitivity in her left arm.Her two-hour emergency operation meant she was forced to abandon a campaign before congressional elections on 27 October.Her party is facing the prospect of losing control of Congress.While she was in hospital, dozens of supporters camped outside.Her public duties are being carried out by Vice-President Amado Boudou.President Fernandez was first elected in 2007 and was returned to power by a comfortable majority in 2011.Her health has been followed closely since the sudden death of her husband, former President Nestor Kirchner, from a heart attack in 2010.She has been admitted to hospital on a number of occasions during her presidency. She has low blood pressure and had to have a thyroid gland removed in 2012.</body>

      <body>Rescue workers searching the rubble of a collapsed block of flats in north-west Colombia for at least 11 missing people say they have found one body.The 24-storey tower in the city of Medellin collapsed on Saturday night having been evacuated on Friday after cracks were found in its structure.A team of construction workers and at least one resident were in the block when it came down.Neighbouring towers could be at risk and have been cleared, officials say.The collapse of tower six in The Space condominium happened shortly before 20:30 local time (01:30 GMT) on Saturday, officials say.Residents of the neighbouring building told local media it sounded as if bombs had exploded.Most of the missing are workers who had been sent by construction company CDO Constructora to assess and repair the structural damage.A resident believed to have been in the building's car park when the accident happened was also reported missing.Medellin Mayor Claudia Restrepo said on Sunday that a body had been located on the third floor of the building.The body has not yet been identified or removed, she added.Around 60 people with sniffer dogs have been searching the rubble but heavy rain and fears of another collapse have hampered the rescue effort.Earlier, emergency officials said that one of two people rescued early on Sunday could be paralysed.The Space flats were completed earlier this year and cost between $100,000 (£67,000) and $265,000 (£166,000).The Medellin authorities have launched an inquiry into the cause of the collapse.CDO Constructora said a flaw had been found in a concrete column.</body>

      <title>Iran rejects shipping out uranium</title>
      <description>Iran will not allow any of its enriched uranium to be shipped abroad, the deputy foreign minister says, rejecting a key demand of Western powers.</description>

      <body>Iran will not allow any of its enriched uranium to be shipped abroad, the deputy foreign minister says, rejecting a key demand of Western powers.Abbas Araqchi was quoted by state media as saying that "shipping the material abroad is our red line".The comments come ahead of key talks this week in Geneva between Iran and international negotiators over the nuclear dispute.The talks will be the first since President Hassan Rouhani took office.US Secretary of State John Kerry said on Sunday that the window for diplomacy was "cracking open"."But I want you to know that our eyes are open, too," he added, addressing a summit of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee by video link from London. "Words must be matched with actions."Western negotiators have demanded Iran halt production and stockpiling of uranium enriched to 20% - a step away from achieving a nuclear weapons capability - and send some of its stockpiles abroad.They have also demanded Iran shut down the Fordo production site near Qom, where most of the higher-grade enrichment work is done.But Mr Araqchi insisted on Sunday that there could be no question of Iran relinquishing its stockpiles of enriched uranium."We will not surrender or suspend uranium enrichment in any situation...We will not allow even a gram of uranium to go out of the country," he said, quoted on the website of Iranian state TV.He did, however, say Tehran would negotiate the form, amount and levels of uranium enrichment.His comments seemed to contradict those of Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani, who was reported last week as telling several Western news agencies that the country had a surplus of enriched uranium and might use this as a bargaining tool at nuclear talks.However, Iran's Parliament later denied the claims, saying parts of Mr Larijani's interview with Associated Press were "false and fundamentally inaccurate".The West suspects Iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons but Iran maintains its programme is entirely peaceful.Iran, which has been negotiating with the P5+1 group ( the UK, China, France, Russia and the US plus Germany) over the nuclear issue since 2006, wants the lifting of UN sanctions.The sanctions were imposed over concerns that it is seeking to build nuclear weapons clandestinely - an allegation Tehran denies.President Rouhani, who is seen as a moderate, has said he wants to reach a deal on the nuclear dispute in three to six months and has vowed to send a plan to the two-day talks due to begin on 15 October.The US has said there will be no major concessions on sanctions until the Iranians take concrete steps to reassure the world they are not seeking nuclear weapons.</body>

      <body>Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's Twitter feed briefly followed a Persian erotica account before unfollowing it on Sunday, The Times of Israel reports.The PM's Twitter account, @Netanyahu, followed some 90 accounts, mainly of Israeli embassies and the government, at the time, the paper said.But one of the most recent it was following was @PersianHotBook, it said.The PM's Likud party later said it managed the page and that it was investigating a "malfunction"."It was a malfunction and the issue will be checked. In any case, the account was removed immediately," Likud is quoted as saying by reporter Chico Menashe from Israel Radio in a tweet.The page @PersianHotBook describes itself as "the first library of hot sex books [in the] Persian language".Early on Sunday, the page only had 15 followers, one of which was the prime minister's account, the newspaper reported.But later the prime minister's Twitter feed no longer followed @PersianHotBook, it said, and had also stopped following other feeds, bringing down to 81 the number of feeds it was following.This gave rise to amused comments on social media sites, with one user interpreting the interest as a desire to want "to see the real Iranian weapon of mass destruction".Last week, in an interview with the BBC Persian service, Mr Netanyahu said that if Iranians were free they would wear blue jeans, and listen to Western music.His comments led to reactions from Iranians in Iran and abroad on social media sites, with many posts showing mainly young Iranians wearing jeans and listening to Western music, some in comic poses.</body>

      <body>Egypt's public prosecutor has ordered an inquiry into the death of a US citizen found dead in a police cell.He said the man, named as retired US military officer James Henry, was found hanging from a bathroom door by his belt and shoe laces.Mr Henry, 66, was reported to have been heading for the Gaza Strip in August, when he was detained in North Sinai for violating a curfew.A US embassy official in Cairo said the death was "an apparent suicide".According to local reports, the retired army officer's death came a day after the authorities told him they were extending his detention by a further 30 days.Officials told the AFP agency that a US embassy delegation had visited James Henry in his cell in the city of Ismailiya last week.The prosecutor said Mr Henry was arrested on 29 August on the road between El Arish and Rafah in North Sinai, for breaking a dusk-to-dawn curfew.The curfew was put in place across large parts of Egypt under a decree by the interim government, to quell unrest following the ousting in July of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.In a statement, the prosecutor said Mr Henry had been carrying a map of Egypt and an advanced electronic device.US embassy officials in Cairo said they were in contact with the Egyptian authorities and were providing all appropriate consular services.Mr Henry is the second foreign citizen to die in police custody in as many months, reports BBC Cairo correspondent Orla Guerin.A French national was found dead in a Cairo police station in September after allegedly being beaten to death by fellow prisoners following a row.</body>

      <body>The Cuban-American writer Oscar Hijuelos - the first Latino to win the Pulitzer Prize - has died aged 62.Hijuelos's agent, Jennifer Lyons, said he had died of a heart attack in New York City while playing tennis.Hijuelos won the award in 1990 for his second novel, The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love, which was later adapted as a Hollywood film.Like many of his novels, it focused on the lives of immigrants and their quest for the American dream.Hijuelos was born in New York City in 1951 to Cuban immigrant parents.He enrolled in local community colleges before studying creative writing under tutors included Susan Sontag, Donald Barthelme and Frederic Tuten.Hijuelos was also exposed to Cuban and Latin American writers including Jose Lezama Lima, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Carlos Fuentes, whose work inspired him.He published his first novel, Our House in the Last World, in 1983.In his 2011 memoir, Thoughts Without Cigarettes, Hijuelos said he had struggled against being labelled an "ethnic" writer.The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love tells the story of two Cuban brothers who travel from Havana to New York to start an orchestra.In 1992 the book was turned into a film starring Armand Assante and Antonio Banderas.Hijuelos is survived by his wife, Lori Marie Carlson.</body>

      <body>As the world's second largest economy, the fastest growing economy in the G20 and with more than a trillion dollars sitting in various sovereign wealth funds, China has quite a bit of cash to invest.And as the chart below shows, in recent years it has begun loosening the purse strings - in 2005, the Chinese government and Chinese companies collectively invested about $17bn (£11bn) in global assets, according to The Heritage Foundation. Last year they invested almost $130bn.That sounds like a lot of money, but in the context of global world trade or the economic output of developed economies, it is small change. For example, the total amount of money invested by China into Britain over the past nine years amounts to just 0.7% of the UK's total GDP in 2012.And Britain is one of the more popular destinations for Chinese investment. It is in the top 10 nations globally and attracts more than double the investment of any other nation in Europe. Globally, Australia comes out top, but even here Chinese investment last year equated to just 0.6% of the country's annual GDP. In developing nations, Chinese investment is more significant. In Nigeria, for example, inflows from China equated to 2% of GDP in 2012.Almost half of all the money invested overseas by China and Chinese companies in the past nine years went into the energy and power sector. China's demand for energy is expected to triple by 2030 so countries with abundant natural resources will continue to attract the most money from China.While more Chinese money is invested in the energy sector than in any other in Britain, China holds a number of investments elsewhere, including in Barclays Bank, BP, Diageo and Thames Water. Most are minority stakes, but it does have a controlling interest in some household names. For example, Bright Foods owns a 60% stake in Weetabix, the Wanda conglomerate owns 92% of Sunseeker boats, while Geely Automobile owns Manganese Bronze, the company that makes London taxis.Some of the companies listed below are not British firms, but the investments shown refer to assets based in Britain. For example, last year China Investment Corporation paid Ferrovial $700m to buy a 10% stake in Heathrow airport, and paid $400m to Deutsche Bank to take a stake in the bank's London offices.There are four other UK companies that have received monies from China, but are not included in the list as the money went into divisions based overseas. The China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOCC) invested almost $1.5bn to take a 33% stake in Tullow Oil's Ugandan operations in 2011. In 2010, CNOCC spent $270m on a 5% stake in BG's energy interests in Australia.In 2008 and 2009, Aluminium Corporation of China (Chinalco) made two investments totalling $14.3bn in Rio Tinto to take a 12% stake in the mining giant's aluminium operations in Australia, and two years later paid another $1.4bn to Rio for a share of its steel business in Guinea.Finally, in 2008, oil trader Sinochem paid $470m for a stake in oil and gas exploration company Soco International for a stake in its oil business in Yemen.Download the full data from the Heritage Foundation.</body>

      <title>Can science fiction ever get the science right</title>
      <description>What science fiction film makes the most mistakes?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24518305</url>

      <body>Alfonso Cuaron's new film Gravity promises to rekindle the debate over how "hard" - or accurate - science fiction should be. Should film-makers adhere to basic scientific principles, or should audiences just feel the magic instead, asks Peter Ray Allison.The relationship between science and science fiction has always been tempestuous.Gravity focuses on two astronauts stranded in space after the destruction of their space shuttle. Since Gravity's US release (it comes to the UK in November) many critics have praised the film for its scientific accuracy.But noted astrophysicist Dr Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, had several issues with the accuracy of Gravity's portrayal of space.Through a series of posts on Twitter, Tyson - who later emphasised that he "enjoyed the film very much" - highlighted various errors.He noted the Hubble space telescope (orbiting at 350 miles above sea level), the International Space Station (at 250 miles), and a Chinese space station could never be in line of sight of one another. On top of that, most satellites orbit west to east, yet in the film the satellite debris was seen drifting east to west.Tyson also noted how Sandra Bullock's hair did not float freely as it would in zero-gravity. This is arguably not so much an error in physics, but a reflection of the limitations of cinematic technology to accurately portray actors in zero-gravity. That is, of course, without sending them into space for the duration of the film.There has always been a drive for scientific accuracy within science fiction, especially within the "hard science fiction" literary sub-genre. But sci-fi, especially in film, tends to have a more flamboyant approach, where realism is often dispensed with in favour of visual flair.The Michael Bay film Armageddon is known for its woeful number of inaccuracies, from the space shuttles separating their rocket boosters and fuel tanks in close proximity to each other (risking a collision) and to objects falling on to the asteroid under a gravitational pull seemingly as strong as the Earth's. More than one interested observer tried to work out how big the bomb would have to be to blow up an asteroid in the way demanded in the movie. Answer: Very big indeed.Nasa is reported to have even used Armageddon as part of a test within their training programme, asking candidates to identify all the scientific impossibilities within the film.Despite the presence of physicist Prof Brian Cox as a scientific adviser on Danny Boyle's Sunshine, artistic licence seeped in. There's a communications "dead-zone" around the Sun - not something easily explicable using real world rules.Despite claims to the contrary, Red Planet was riddled with scientific implausibilities, from the compatibility between modern equipment and 30-year old Russian technology (imagine attempting to connect a modern PC with a Sinclair Spectrum), to the Martian "nematodes" which had been eating algae that had been sent from earth for the past 30 years. The nematodes should have been worms but looked closer to beetles. And there was no explanation as to how they had evolved to eat non-Martian algae nor what they had eaten before.The science across the film was so "creative" that Nasa refused to act as scientific adviser on the film.But perhaps the biggest example of scientific licence occurs in a plethora of space-based dramas."The most commonly lauded example of 'bad science', intentionally placed into science fiction, is that of sound," says Ed Trollope, spacecraft operations engineer at technology firm Telespazio VEGA Deutschland. "Because space is a vacuum, there is no sound, which means all those explosions and engine noises shouldn't be there."There's a simple cinematic reason for having the sound of an explosion when a spacecraft blows up - it feels right to the viewer. But other conventions are more difficult for scientists to accept."My pet peeve is inertia," says Trollope. "There are many good reasons for keeping your engines on in space, but 'maintaining speed' is not one of them. If you turn your engines off, you don't stop."Some do it slightly better than others. "I'd prefer not to single out a single film/book/series for this particular error, because it's so common - but I will laud the old television show Babylon 5, for doing a wonderful job of representing the mechanics of spaceflight inertia so nicely," explains Trollope.2001: A Space Odyssey's silent scenes of space craft, with their rotating Stanford torus design, were closer than many later examples to the reality of travelling in space."A classic case of scientific inaccuracy was the first edition of Ringworld by Larry Niven, a novel which won both the Hugo and Nebula awards in 1971," suggests science fiction author Charles Stross. "The author inadvertently set up a series of scenes which implied that the Earth spun on its axis in the wrong direction." Niven fixed it in the second printing.The Duncan Jones film Moon was lauded for a reasonably accurate portrayal of what lunar mining for Helium-3 could look like in the future. Helium-3 is rare on Earth but less rare on the Moon, and using an automated method with a human overseer might be possible. But the economics behind the mining is not explained.The alien signal in Contact is a prime example of what Seti (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) is looking for. This is perhaps not surprising as Contact was written by astronomer Carl Sagan. The use of mathematics in the transmission of the message seems reasonable and the time lag in the sending and receiving of the signal is also accurately represented in the film.Science fiction is not just expected to accurately portray science but also to anticipate future developments."Science fiction hits some predictive targets," says science fiction author Neal Asher, "but rather in the way that a clip fired from an assault rifle will hit some of the enemy hidden in the jungle, but mostly hits trees and leaves.""One of the past criticisms of science fiction has been that it's all 'zap-guns and rocket ships'," suggests Asher. "Now the science fiction writer can smugly point out the LaWs - the US navy laser system - knocking down drones, and then wax lyrical about the X Prize, Virgin Galactic and Elon Musk's SpaceX."Richard Blott, principal consultant at Space Enterprise Partnerships, recalls an early episode of Star Trek ("Spock's Brain", 1968) where the latest space ship is described as having an "ion drive"."Nowadays most new communications satellites have ion engines and they have powered missions to Vesta and Ceres," says Blott."In the end," Asher concludes, "science fiction is not there to make accurate predictions about the future, it is there to entertain and stimulate the imagination. There is absolutely no doubt that many of the imaginations it stimulates belong to scientists. To some extent it drives and directs science."Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <body>Iceland is experiencing a book boom. This island nation of just over 300,000 people has more writers, more books published and more books read, per head, than anywhere else in the world.It is hard to avoid writers in Reykjavik. There is a phrase in Icelandic, "ad ganga med bok I maganum", everyone gives birth to a book. Literally, everyone "has a book in their stomach". One in 10 Icelanders will publish one."Does it get rather competitive?" I ask the young novelist, Kristin Eirikskdottir. "Yes. Especially as I live with my mother and partner, who are also full-time writers. But we try to publish in alternate years so we do not compete too much."Special saga tours - saga as in story, that is, not over-50s holidays - show us story-plaques on public buildings.Dating from the 13th Century, Icelandic sagas tell the stories of the country's Norse settlers, who began to arrive on the island in the late 9th Century.Sagas are written on napkins and coffee cups. Each geyser and waterfall we visit has a tale of ancient heroes and heroines attached. Our guide stands up mid-tour to recite his own poetry - our taxi driver's father and grandfather write biographies.Public benches have barcodes so you listen to a story on your smartphone as you sit.Reykjavik is rocking with writers. It is book festival time. Man Booker Prize winner Kiran Desai and Generation X author Douglas Coupland rub shoulders with Icelandic literary superstars Gerdur Kristny and Sjon. Sjon also pens lyrics for Bjork, Iceland's musical superstar."Writers are respected here," Agla Magnusdottir tells me. "They live well. Some even get a salary."Magnusdottir is head of the new Icelandic Literature Centre, which offers state support for literature and its translation."They write everything - modern sagas, poetry, children's books, literary and erotic fiction - but the biggest boom is in crime writing," she says.That is perhaps no surprise in this Nordic nation. But crime novel sales figures are staggering - double that of any of its Nordic neighbours.So what has led to this phenomenal book boom? I would say it is due to a crop of darn good writers, telling riveting tales with elegant economy and fantastic characters.Iceland's black lava riverbeds, its steaming, bubbling earth, with its towering volcanoes and fairytale streams also make it the perfect setting for stories.No wonder JRR Tolkien and Seamus Heaney were entranced and Unesco designates Reykjavik a City of Literature.Solvi Bjorn Siggurdsson, a tall, Icelandic-sweater-clad novelist, says writers owe a lot to the past."We are a nation of storytellers. When it was dark and cold we had nothing else to do," he says. "Thanks to the poetic eddas and medieval sagas, we have always been surrounded by stories. After independence from Denmark in 1944, literature helped define our identity."Siggurdsson pays homage to Iceland's Nobel Literature Laureate, Halldor Laxness, whose books are sold in petrol stations and tourist centres across the island. Locals name their cats after Laxness and make pilgrimages to his home."When Laxness won the Nobel prize in 1955 he put modern Icelandic literature on the map," Solvi tells me. "He gave us confidence to write."A combination of ash and the crash also put Iceland on the map.The financial crisis - or "kreppa" - of 2008, which helped trigger the world economic crash, came first. The ash cloud from one of Iceland's many active volcanoes created a second in 2010.Hallgrimur Helgason - comedian, painter and writer - tells me the kreppa brought Icelanders down to earth."It made us less complacent and gave artists a creative shot in the arm - as Thatcher did for Britain," he grins. "We address politics too - it is not all about sagas."But some fear a book kreppa, too. Iceland has so many writers there is huge pressure on publishers.This time of year sees the "jolabokaflod", or Christmas Book Flood, when most books are published.About now every household gets a book catalogue through the door. They pore over it like a furniture catalogue. Everyone receives books as Christmas presents - hardback and shrink-wrapped."Even now, when I go the hairdressers," Kristin Vidarsdottir, manager of the Unesco City of Literature project, says, "they do not want celebrity gossip from me but recommendations for Christmas books."But it is a lock of blue hair which alerts me to the presence of Iceland's most famous celebrity. The singer Bjork attends several of the festival events."It is great to see you supporting writers," I say to her."It is a small place. We have grown up together," she replies. "We support each other."If Bjork was, once upon a time, Iceland's biggest cultural brand, she is today joined by a whole bokaflod of authors.From Our Own Correspondent: Listen online or download the podcast.BBC Radio 4: Saturdays at 11:30 and some Thursdays at 11:00BBC World Service: Short editions Monday-Friday - see World Service programme schedule.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Thalidomide: Were more affected?</title>
      <description>A new group of people battle for compensation</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24472269</url>

      <body>New scientific research appears to suggest the drug Thalidomide may have caused a wider range of deformities than previously thought. A new group of "Thalidomiders" now believe they should get compensation for their disabilities.Gary Grayson, from Ipswich, shows me the very first pair of wooden legs he had to wear as a child. They are painted pink, but are heavy and ungainly.The feet are not hinged and there is a complicated harness of steel and leather."They used to call me peg leg and wooden leg. They didn't have a lot of imagination!" he says about some of his former schoolmates.He was born in 1961 with extensive deformities to his lower limbs. His mother says that staff at the hospital reacted with horror."When I was born she heard the nurse gasp and leave the room."Before he was two years old he was admitted to hospital and had both his lower legs amputated. He was walking on artificial limbs within months.His mother has signed an affidavit stating that she took Thalidomide, but he has never received any compensation for his injuries.Thalidomide was originally marketed as a sedative, but from the late 1950s was prescribed to women around the world to combat morning sickness.By 1961 it was clear that it was causing serious birth defects and by late 1961 it was withdrawn in the UK.Ten thousand children were born worldwide with terrible disabilities. It is thought many more died in the womb.After a 10-year legal battle in 1973 the British distributors Distillers agreed to pay compensation in the UK.The Thalidomide Trust was set up and more than 400 children were admitted to the group as beneficiaries.The German manufacturers Grunenthal have never admitted liability to the British victims nor have they contributed to the Thalidomide Trust.A statement from Grunenthal said: "Thalidomide is part of our history and always will be and we have accepted a responsibility to offer help. We have no legal responsibility to compensate individuals affected.Gary Grayson's parents applied to the Thalidomide Trust but doctors said his injuries weren't typical of Thalidomide.He did not let his disability hold him back and did well at school before joining the Ministry of Defence.The 52-year-old's work took him around the world, he rode motorbikes, married and had children. He's now an information security specialist."In my younger years I did not see myself as a victim," he says.But now he has researched deeper into his own medical history and believes the proof is there.He said: "Compensation in today's world, must naturally follow."His case has been taken up by several law firms under the banner of the Thalidomiders legal group, which is representing a number of other clients in the UK.The legal action has temporarily stalled over funding and insurance, but elsewhere in the world other cases continue.As those affected get older, their health is failing.Today in Spain 185 people affected by Thalidomide are taking Grunenthal to court. They have never received compensation from the German company and are now seeking more than £175m in damages.In Australia last year the distributors of the drug agreed to pay damages to fifty-year-old Lynette Rowe. More cases are expected to be settled later this year.In Britain the legal picture is complex.The Thalidomide Trust receives money from both the UK Government and Diageo the company which acquired Distillers. Since 2006 Diageo has put in an average of £7.5 million per year and has committed to do so until 2037.The Trust has only admitted one new beneficiary in the last year and applies strict criteria for inclusion.Those who feel they were harmed by the drug, but do not qualify for the Trust turn to legal action in the hope of getting compensation.Their cases may be assisted by new research being carried out at the University of Aberdeen by Dr Neil Vargesson.His work involves observing the effect of Thalidomide on the development of chick and fish embryos.He has in the past written expert reports for two of the solicitors acting for the new cases.In the 1960s, experts decided that babies were damaged by the drug during a very short period in pregnancy - between 20 and 36 days after conception.Dr Vargesson says questions can be raised about this time-sensitive window and the way the medicine reacted on each individual."The time-sensitive window was based on interviews with parents of severely affected children and relates to outward damage and severe internal damage."He concludes that: "Given the range of damage in Thalidomide survivors and given animal studies that show in one litter each foetus is damaged differently it's clear to me the drug acts differently in each individual and embryo."That would mean that it is possible Thalidomide caused a wider range of damage than was first thought.But he admits that: "We will never know the true range, it's so difficult to go back 55 years and say well let's have a look at these people, because most of them, we don't even know who those people are."His work though is highly controversial. Other experts in the field disagree with his conclusions.Gary Grayson is busy with his career in IT and does all his own DIY.But he can see a time in the future when his health may deteriorate and he'll need more help.For that reason he is determined to continue with his legal action, but also for a much more personal reason too."It would mean the world to me, to be able to ring my mother and say they've admitted they've made a mistake."</body>

      <title>Cooking up a successful food business</title>
      <description>How driving to Asia inspired a successful ready meals business</description>

      <body>Inspiration can often come from strange places. For UK ready meals boss Charlie Bigham it was being unable to sleep at the border between Iran and Pakistan.Mr Bigham was 28 years old at the time, and he and his then girlfriend were travelling from the UK to India by camper van."It was very, very hot, and we were in a really tough place," he says. "I couldn't sleep, so I just laid there restlessly thinking about what I was going to do for a living when we got back home."I decided there and then that I was going to set up a food business, and it was going to look a bit like this."Mr Bigham had previously worked as a management consultant in London, before he and his girlfriend quit their jobs to go travelling for nine months.His ambition was to set up his own company when they returned to the UK, and now he had his idea - he was going to establish a business that made upmarket ready meals.Mr Bigham was not going to let the fact that he had never worked in the food industry before put him off, and instead he decided he would quickly set about gaining the knowledge and skills he needed.And so upon his return to the UK he got a job at a delicatessen in London's fashionable Notting Hill area."I've always been really interested in food, but I had no food industry experience, so I knew I had to get some cheese under my fingernails, so to speak," he says.He ended up spending almost four months at the deli, and at the same time did lots of research, and working on recipes."It became clear that the idea of making meals which are then sold via shops was a very good idea for a business because it was a massive market, yet one which was very straightforward to start up in," says Mr Bigham."I knew we could start under the radar before any bigger rivals could crush us, and then build quite quickly."In November 1996, 11 months after his return from travelling, and now married to his girlfriend, Mr Bigham launched the business with £25,000 of savings, calling it simply "Charlie Bigham's".To begin with, it was just him and one chef based at a small facility in London's Park Royal business estate.Mr Bigham says: "We had just three product lines to start with - zesty Caribbean lamb, Cajun chicken with salsa, and salmon with a dill and cream sauce. I think we made just 20 meals in total in that first week."To get sales moving, Mr Bigham, now 47, says he simply started "knocking on people's doors"."I went round all the posh delis in London, and the big department stores with food halls. Everyone was approachable, and said, 'Yeah we'll give you a go'."I just had to be mildly persuasive, and I'm not a salesman."What greatly helped us, is that you have to remember that at the time, most ready - or convenience - meals, as I prefer to call them, were pretty dreadful."We were one of the first to make quality ones without anything artificial. This set us apart and made shops interested in stocking us."But while selling to posh stores in London was pleasing, Mr Bigham realised that in order to grow the business he needed to win a contract with one of the UK's supermarket groups. And so he cold-called Waitrose."I just picked up the phone and rang the Waitrose switchboard. I managed to persuade a lovely woman on the phone to put me through to a buyer. I got a meeting, and the buyer said she would give us a go."Charlie Bigham's meals have been stocked by Waitrose ever since, initially at 40 stores for a successful trial period, and then nationwide. Online supermarket Ocado, and Booths, the north of England supermarket chain, have since followed suit.The company now employs 200 people across two sites at the Park Royal business park, and has an annual turnover of £20m, which is now growing at 19% per annum.Mr Bigham says his former job as a management consultant helped him manage the company's growth over the past 17 years.But he is the first to admit that luck and good timing played a major role in his success."The only way you can ever set up a successful business is to be lucky," he says. "It is the thing you need more than anything else. Anyone who says otherwise is just lying."Mr Bigham says that most important piece of luck was all to do with timing."I set up a food business just as interest in food was blossoming in this country. Suddenly there was a wealth of TV chefs, and the national newspapers all added food sections at weekends."And the supermarkets were all being brave and looking outwards towards new suppliers. There was no planning or forethought about all this on my part, it was pure luck."Mr Bigham today gives himself the job title "chairman and creative director". This followed his decision back in 2010 to bring in someone else to handle the chief executive role."It has enabled me to focus on the bits of the business I'm really interested in - product development, and the big strategic picture - working out plans for the next three to five years," he says."The bit in the middle [the day-to-day financial decisions etc] I'm easily bored by, and is best done by someone else."Looking ahead, Mr Bigham says the company has no plans to start exporting, because the freshness, and therefore limited shelf life of his products, makes it too expensive.Nor does he ever intend to move production away from London to somewhere cheaper, because he says he is loyal to his hard-working staff."I'm proud of what we have done to date, but I'm in no way complacent. Owning your own business is a hugely privileged position to be in, because I work with people I have chosen - not many people can say that."</body>

      <title>The nun teaching taekwondo to sick children</title>
      <description>Singapore nun dusts off black belt to teach taekwondo</description>

      <body>Sister Linda Sim gave up taekwondo when she joined a convent. Years later, she's dusted off her black belt at a Singaporean hospice to teach children recovering from cancer.When she was much younger, Linda Sim wanted to join the army, but was told she was too small."Next I thought I could be a policewoman - to protect people," she says, but she didn't make the weight requirements for the police force, either.Instead, she discovered taekwondo in 1971, and it seemed to fulfil her need to help other people. "If I had a black belt I thought I could be a bodyguard and protect somebody." Within a few years, she achieved just that.Though the sport gave her great mental strength, she didn't find a practical use for her martial art for more than three decades.Much to the chagrin of her parents, Sim met the Franciscan Missionaries of the Divine Motherhood, and decided to join them by becoming a Catholic nun."Being the only daughter, my mum was very upset when I said I would give my life to God and be a missionary," she says. Her parents had hoped she would provide them with grandchildren.Since the group's headquarters were on the other side of the world in Britain, she would disappoint them further by leaving Singapore."I spent 17 years in England and three more in Africa, where I ran a hospital in Zimbabwe," she says.During her absence, a relationship developed between the Singapore Taekwondo Federation and Mount Alvernia hospital in the centre of the country.Ming Wong, secretary general of the federation explains that an employee of the hospital thought some of its patients - young children being treated for cancer - could benefit from the sport. They were "stuck inside playing snakes and ladders", she says, and the organisation agreed to provide training sessions for them.It was not until 2004, when Sim's mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, that she felt she had to return to Singapore.When she saw the classes taking place, she knew she wanted to be involved. "That was what I had to leave behind in order to be a sister, and so I thought 'now I'm reunited'," she says.Today she runs a weekly class for about 20 people, all of whom have brain tumours or childhood leukaemia. Most are young children, although three are now in their 20s, having trained under Sim for many years.One of the older students, Ng Wei Hau, was diagnosed with a brain tumour at the age of 12 and given just six months to live by his doctors. "When I first met him he was in a wheelchair. When he reached 21 he was walking with a frame, when he reached 23 he had a stick, and now he walks unaided," she says. Despite being partially deaf and blind, Wei Hau became a black belt last year under Sim's tutelage."These children try to do their best however they can, despite their sickness," says Wong. "I think because they want to live life for the fullest because they want to enjoy whatever time they have."The federation's charitable work is not just limited to children from the hospital. The organisation works with children's homes and other disadvantaged groups to offer free taekwondo classes to others who would not usually come into contact with the sport.For Sim, religion is central to her motivation. Whereas most sisters teach religious education in quite a traditional way, she thinks the taekwondo classes allow her to lead by example instead."For me I can actually be a presence and a witness to God's love without actually quoting scripture," she says. "It gives me a lot of peace and satisfaction. It's about evangelising without having to mention going to church."Video produced by Zarina Hussain.

      <description>US stalemate casts long shadow over IMF meeting</description>

      <body>There is often some cloud of economic uncertainty hanging over the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank.This time the shadow was cast by the political developments just down the road at the White House and the US Congress - the political stalemate over the federal government's finances.The mood here among finance ministers from the IMF's 188 member countries is best described as wary. The big anxiety is, as has been widely reported, whether the US would default on its debts in the financial markets, an event that would send massive shockwaves through the global financial system.Everybody here thinks that surely the US would not let that happen.The IMF's latest global economic forecasts, issued just before the annual meetings, are based on the assumption that it won't.Still, there is just a hint of unease that the US political system has walked up to the edge of the precipice and might just trip and fall off.Many ministers and central bankers here have taken the opportunity to remind their American counterparts that they really don't want that to happen. Please, they say, get it fixed quickly.That kind of pressure won't be decisive in the American political wrangling, but it might just help a little.Beyond that there's not much that visiting finance officials can do, apart from watch what one of them described as a pantomime, hoping that every day is the last performance.Despite the importance that absolutely everybody at these meetings attaches to an agreement, it doesn't seem to have taken up very much of their time.The US government's financial crisis gets just one sentence in a 1,200-word communique issued after the IMF meeting.There are, after all, plenty of other things to think about.First on the list is another American policy issue, tapering as it's called - when and how quickly will the Federal Reserve cut back on its quantitative easing programme of spending $85bn (£53bn) a month in the financial markets.Even though the Fed hasn't even started to cut back, the mere expectation that it will do sooner or later has already caused significant disturbances in global financial markets.I'm told it has also been disruptive for some central banks, even in low-income countries trying to manage their foreign exchange reserves. Many officials here want the Fed to be very careful about communicating its intentions so as not to cause excessive volatility in the markets.Nonetheless, there isn't the same sense of exasperation with the Fed as there is with the current political logjam in Washington over the budget and the debt limit.Everybody recognises that the Fed's monetary policy is going to have to get back to normal sooner or later. Quantitative easing is, after all, a truly exceptional response to the economic weakness that followed the financial crisis.Cutting it back would be a sign that the US economy is healing, which is what everybody at these meetings wants to see.It is striking that the two most immediate concerns are about the United States and not, for once, Europe. Not that the IMF thinks the eurozone is repaired - far from it.It's just that there are other more clear and present dangers.</body>

      <description>Police investigating Madeleine McCann's disappearance release e-fit images of a man they want to speak to as a matter of "vital importance".</description>

      <body>UK police investigating Madeleine McCann's disappearance have released two e-fits of a man they want to speak to as a matter of "vital importance".They will feature in a BBC Crimewatch appeal later over her disappearance on 3 May, 2007, in Praia da Luz, Portugal.Police said the man "may or may not be key" but had been placed in the area.The images are based on evidence from two witnesses who saw him on the night three-year-old Madeleine, from Rothley, Leicestershire, went missing.The witnesses said the man was white, 20 to 40 years old and of medium build. He had short brown hair, was clean-shaven and of medium height, they added.Det Ch Insp Andy Redwood, the senior Metropolitan Police investigating officer, said: "Whilst this man may or may not be the key to unlocking this investigation, tracing and speaking to him is of vital importance to us."We have witnesses placing him in the resort area around the time of Madeleine's disappearance."This is far from our only line of inquiry and there will be e-fits released of other sightings as well, who we are equally keen to trace."These people were seen on the day of Madeleine's disappearance and the days leading up to it."Madeleine went missing from a holiday flat in Praia da Luz, Algarve, as her parents dined with friends at a nearby restaurant.A Portuguese investigation into the case was dropped in 2008, but Scotland Yard began a review of the case in May 2011.On Sunday the Met said the timeline and "accepted version of events" surrounding Madeleine's disappearance had significantly changed, without giving further details.A detailed reconstruction lasting close to 25 minutes and covering events leading up to and surrounding Madeleine's disappearance will also feature on Monday's Crimewatch.Police say the appeal is based on "substantive" new material including mobile phone records.A short clip released in advance by police shows actors playing Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, leaving their holiday apartment for the nearby tapas restaurant.They are then seen seated outdoors at a large poolside table, greeting friends as they come to join them for dinner.Speaking about the review-turned-investigation, Det Ch Insp Redwood said detectives had been able to "make massive steps forward" by drawing together all the material gathered to date and reviewing it as a whole.He said his team had sought to "try and draw everything back to zero... take everything back to the beginning and then reanalyse and reassess everything, accepting nothing".He added: "Praia da Luz is a popular holiday destination for many nationalities so our requests for help need to be repeated in many different countries."He said he would travel to the Netherlands, Germany and Ireland to seek public support there, and would repeat the appeals in Portugal - "a key country for us to trace any outstanding witnesses".In Germany, a special edition of the crime programme Aktenzeichen XY - Ungeloest which is translated as "File XY - Unsolved", will be aired on Wednesday night and will feature an appeal for information from Mr and Mrs McCann.Det Ch Insp Redwood went on to urge anyone, including from the local community, who was in or around Praia da Luz on Thursday, 3 May 2007, to speak to police if they had not already done so."We still have a lot of material to investigate and much work to do," he added.Meanwhile former Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre head Jim Gamble - who carried out a review into the case in 2010 - said the appeal offered "an opportunity for everyone to help"."It doesn't matter that you were not in Praia da Luz - you may watch something, you may see an e-fit, you may see some other information, they may talk about telephone numbers and something will click with you," he told BBC News."And that you will not know unless you watch."Mr and Mrs McCann are expected to make a live appeal from the studio during the programme.Ahead of its broadcast, Mrs McCann said: "We're not the ones that have done something wrong here."It's the person who's gone into that apartment and taken a little girl away from her family."Meanwhile Robert Murat, the first official suspect in the case but long since cleared of any involvement, told the BBC he hoped the new appeal would produce results."It's gone on and on and every time something new comes up, you know, it brings hope and then it seems to fade away and disappear. So I'm hoping that's not going to be the case again," he said.The Crimewatch appeal will be shown in the UK on BBC One on Monday from 21:00 BST. It will also be broadcast in the Netherlands and Germany.</body>

      <body>A Muslim free school in Derby has said it will support female staff who do not want to wear head coverings.It follows a letter warning the Al-Madinah School it faced closure unless discrimination against female staff and pupils stopped.Education Minister Lord Nash laid out 17 issues for the school to consider, which included an end to "unacceptable" teaching standards.The letter said if steps were not taken by Tuesday, funding would be pulled.Parent-governor Abdullah Shahjan told BBC Radio Derby: "We are amending policies to make sure we support staff, who if for their cultural, ethical, or faith do not wish to cover their hair."Another governor Fasal Hussain said: "We are very open, very flexible."However, with regard to Lord Nash's letter and female staff wearing head scarves he added: "We would have appreciated some consultation."We have never received any complaints from our staff."During an earlier interview on Newsnight, Mr Shahjan said: "The very first question we ask everybody is 'Would you be prepared to cover your hair if you came into the school as part of the uniform policy?'."To this date, of all those who have come none has ever refused."Head of Islamic studies at the school, Mohammad Burhaan, told Newsnight: "This is the code of dress we have adopted."If you look at an air hostess, for example, a female wears a different code of dress."We are not saying they are discriminated against, that's a choice made by the business."He added: "We are not saying by wearing a head scarf you are changing your religious identity at all... this is the code of dress we would like our female staff to adopt and this is the decision as an organisation we have made."Is it possible to review that - yes it is."The government has told the school to write to all female members of staff telling them they do not have to wear a hijab if it is in conflict with their religion, or beliefs.In the letter outlining concerns, Lord Nash wrote: "The trust has manifestly breached the conditions of its funding agreement by:"I will not tolerate breaches of the commitments you gave when entering into the funding agreement."He has urged the school's trust to take five "urgent steps" by 15 October, including providing written confirmation that "you have ceased any practices and procedures that have as their reason, cause or effect that women and girls are treated less favourably than men and boys".The school has been given a deadline of 22 October to address nine further action points and must provide a plan setting out a clear management structure by the start of November.</body>

      <title>NHS Savile abuse probe widened</title>
      <description>The probe into Jimmy Savile's abuse of NHS patients has been extended to include more hospitals, says the health secretary.</description>

      <body>The investigation into Jimmy Savile's alleged abuse of patients at NHS hospitals has been extended to other hospitals, the health secretary says.The inquiry, currently focused on Broadmoor, Stoke Mandeville and Leeds General hospitals, as well as a further 10 trusts, will be expanded to include "other hospitals", Jeremy Hunt said.The hospitals were not named. A final report will be published in 2014.The late DJ is believed to have abused hundreds of victims.The former BBC presenter of Top Of The Pops and Jim'll Fix It, who also worked as a Radio 1 DJ and received a knighthood in 1990, died aged 84 in October 2011 - a year before the allegations were broadcast in an ITV documentary.Revelations that the famed fundraiser had sexually abused children prompted hundreds of victims to come forward, including those who said they were attacked on BBC premises and at a number of other institutions.Savile had a bedroom at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, an office and living quarters at Broadmoor, and widespread access to Leeds General Infirmary.Mr Hunt said: "It is vital that the final NHS investigation report is thorough and complete and reflects all the evidence about Jimmy Savile's pattern of offending."A Scotland Yard investigation into Savile's alleged crimes - one of three strands of Operation Yewtree - is due to report in the new year.The BBC understands it will put the number of alleged victims at over 500.The Department of Health investigation into the three hospitals is being overseen by barrister - and former deputy chairman of the Financial Ombudsman Service - Kate Lampard.In a written ministerial statement, Mr Hunt said: "The Metropolitan Police Service, working with Kate Lampard, has established there was further relevant information regarding Jimmy Savile."The Department of Health asked the Metropolitan Police Service, through an agreed information sharing process, to review information it held to ascertain if it included material related to health and care settings."The revelations about Savile have led to a number of inquiries.Firstly, the police investigation, Operation Yewtree, which has three strands.One is looking specifically at the actions of Savile, and the second strand concerns allegations against "Savile and others".The third strand relates to complaints against other people unconnected to the Savile investigations, made by people who came forward after widespread coverage of the scandal.The BBC has also launched three reviews, including the Pollard Review, which has already reported the findings of its investigation into the dropping of a Newsnight report into claims Savile was a paedophile; and a review by Dame Janet Smith into culture and practices during Savile's career and current policies.The director of public prosecutions is also reviewing decisions not to prosecute Savile in 2009.</body>

      <title>Letting agents 'block black tenants'</title>
      <description>Letting agents in London are prepared to discriminate against would-be tenants on the grounds of race, a BBC investigation reveals.</description>

      <body>Letting agents in London are prepared to discriminate against would-be tenants on the grounds of race, a BBC undercover investigation has revealed.Under the Equality Act 2010, it is illegal for businesses to refuse to provide a service based on ethnicity.But 10 firms told a reporter posing as a landlord they would not let to African-Caribbean people at his request.A black researcher was denied viewings, yet his white counterpart was welcomed.BBC London was initially tipped off certain letting agents were willing to discriminate against African-Caribbean people on behalf of landlords, with the alleged misdoing rife in parts of west London.To expose the practices, a plush three-bedroom flat in north Kensington was acquired. Letting agents from 10 firms were invited to assess its rental value.All 10 were recorded on secret camera saying they would be prepared not to show the flat to African-Caribbean people - and many detailed how they had done it before.The lettings manager at A to Z Property Services, in Dollis Hill, said: "We cannot be shown discriminating against a community. But obviously we've got our ways around that."99% of my landlords don't want Afro-Caribbeans or any troublesome people."The lettings manager at National Estate Agents, Willesden, said: "When someone [African-Caribbean] comes in, we won't advise them of this property."Even if it does get [asked about] we make up an excuse, to be honest with you."When a black researcher asked to view the property, the National agent told him: "I'm sorry, that one's gone."The property was still on the market - and a white researcher got offered a viewing.The A to Z agent told the black researcher he would call him to arrange a viewing. Despite a second inquiry, the agent never got back in touch.The agent had previously explained how he could deter unwanted tenants, saying: "We don't say no there and then. We just don't call them back (laughter)."Once again, the white researcher received an appointment with no fuss.Figures shared with the BBC suggest perception of discrimination remains widespread.A survey of 750 adults by the Runnymede Trust found 29% of black people seeking private housing had experienced discrimination - compared to 1% of white respondents.Rob Berkeley, director of Runnymede, said: "It's shocking that in 2013 outright racism is stopping people from finding a home."Many people think the days of landlords hanging 'No Blacks' signs outside properties are long gone - but discrimination clearly still exists."Despite repeated approaches, National Estate Agents made no comment.When confronted in his office, the A to Z Property Services agent said it was "pointless taking on a property" if the landlord "doesn't like" the client's ethnicity.He continued: "We have plenty of Afro-Caribbean clients - I can show you our files."We've got nothing to hide. We don't discriminate against anybody."The investigation comes 45 years after race relations laws banning discrimination in housing first came in.After viewing the BBC's evidence, equality lawyer Arpita Dutt said: "These individuals know what they're doing and know what they're doing is wrong."Equally, they know how to get round it."There's no defence that 'I did it because somebody told me to' - it's absolutely unlawful and in this case there was clear discrimination."Don Foster MP, who was the housing minister between 2012 and 2013, said: "I was horrified. Discrimination has no place in London, it has no place in the rest of the country. We've got firm legislation against it."What it will rely on is people who've been the victim of discrimination coming forward."But BBC London has learned that, although 36 people told the Property Ombudsman they were the victim of racial discrimination in the past three years, not one single complaint was upheld.Only two allegations resulted in a full investigation.Mr Foster said existing enforcement was robust and the government was making membership of industry redress schemes mandatory for letting agents.During its investigation the BBC spoke to letting agents who condemned the practices exposed.Nicola Humphries, of Maida Vale Properties, said: "I'm appalled by the behaviour of some agents in the industry."There are some agents who will say anything and do anything to close a deal."We need to change the culture - but like any sales business it's a cut throat world and maintaining integrity is not easy."Inside Out London is broadcast on BBC One at 19:30 BST and nationwide on the iPlayer for seven days thereafter</body>

      <description>A woman convicted of murder 20 years ago believes new evidence being examined by the Criminal Cases Review Commission will clear her name.</description>

      <body>A woman convicted of murder 20 years ago believes new evidence being examined by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) will clear her name.Susan May, 68, served 12 years in prison for the murder of her aunt, Hilda Marchbank, at her home in Royton, Greater Manchester, in 1993.The prosecution's case hinged on a "blood-stained handprint" at the scene.But a fingerprint expert has said there is "overwhelming evidence" the marks were not made in blood.Ms May, who was the first person in the UK to be released at her earliest parole date without admitting guilt, has had two failed appeals. Her campaign to clear her name is backed by 100 MPs and peers.Now the CCRC, set up to review possible miscarriages of justice, has agreed to investigate whether her case should be referred back to the Court of Appeal for a rare third time.It is looking into a report - commissioned by campaigners - by fingerprint analyst Arie Zeelenberg, former head of the Dutch national police fingerprint service.He examined high resolution photographs - which were not seen by the jury - of the marks on the wall.His report concludes: "There is no evidence that the finger marks... attributed to Susan May were placed in blood."In fact there is overwhelming evidence that they were not comprised of blood but instead of sweat and a minor residue of another unknown substance."The original trial jury was told Ms May's fingerprint was found in a "blood-stained hand print". One police officer told the court it was made by "quite a lot" of blood when she allegedly beat her aunt about the face and suffocated her with a pillow.The jury was shown photographs of the bedroom wall after it had been treated with chemicals including iodine.The pictures examined by Mr Zeelenberg, which came to light when they were requested from Greater Manchester Police (GMP) by the CCRC in the past year, show that prior to treatment they [the prints] were "almost invisible" to the naked eye."They are clearly very faint marks, hardly attributable to having been made the night before with hands covered in blood so that it ran down the wall," Friends Of Susan May (FOSM) campaigner Geoff Goodwin said.Ms May said: "To date there is no [conclusive] scientific proof that the marks were in blood despite prosecution claims."I sincerely hope now that the commission will see fit to refer my case back to the Court of Appeal because it undermines the whole prosecution case."Campaigners have also asked the CCRC to consider critical reviews of the police investigation into Mrs Marchbank's murder written by the former deputy head of Hampshire CID, Des Thomas.In one report, commissioned by the campaign, he states he found "anomalies" in the police inquiry that "may point to an investigation, the principle purpose of which was to prove, by the selective use and non-disclosure of evidence, the hypothesis that Susan May was guilty of murdering her aunt".The police chief in charge of the original investigation was previously said by the CCRC to have given "inconsistent accounts" and "apparently mistaken recollections", impacting on his credibility.Evidence the jury never heard includes a witness claiming a red car was outside Mrs Marchbank's house with its engine running at around the time of the murder.A transcript of the police actions log also shows that an anonymous call was made to police the following morning naming a well-known convicted burglar as the killer.Ms May said: "All this new evidence points to the fact that my conviction is unsafe. If the jury heard the case as it is now, with some witnesses discredited and without the main plank of their case - the so-called blood marks - they couldn't come to the same conclusion."The CCRC said it was considering Mr Zeelenberg's report and seeking the opinion of other experts.A spokesman said: "This is one of a number of lines of enquiry we are pursuing."We continue to work as quickly as we can and we are making good progress with the investigation."A Greater Manchester Police (GMP) spokesman said: "As this appeal is ongoing it would not be appropriate to comment."</body>

      <body>Two men who pleaded guilty to more than 50 "appalling" child sex offences will not face trial over 14 other allegations, prosecutors have said.Anthony Marsh and Lee Davis, both from South Yorkshire, have admitted abusing boys as young as 13.The Crown Prosecution Service said a trial on the additional charges was not in the victims' "best interests" and asked for the charges to lie on file.Marsh, 53, and Davis, 39, will be sentenced on 2 December.Last month Marsh, from Hatfield, and Davis, from Conisbrough, appeared at Sheffield Crown Court where they pleaded guilty to a string of offences.Marsh, also known as Tony Taylor and Tony Smith, admitted 34 charges, including having sexual activity with a child and possessing and distributing indecent images of children.Davis, also known as James Parkin, pleaded guilty to 20 charges, including rape, sexual activity with a child, and taking indecent photographs of a child.Both admitted a joint charge of conspiracy to commit sexual activity with children.The offences, which date back to 2005, involved boys aged between 13 and 17 years old, from South Yorkshire, East Yorkshire, the North East, North West and the Midlands.Det Insp Delphine Waring, of South Yorkshire Police, said: "Marsh and Davis committed many appalling crimes against young, vulnerable boys over many years."They searched various websites trawling for impressionable, young, vulnerable boys and, having engaged in conversation, then made arrangements to meet them.District Senior Crown Prosecutor Chris Hartley said Marsh and Davis both faced possible life sentences."We've spoken to the remaining victims and explained the current position. We've listened to their views and found that a trial for these offences would not be in their best interest. They have agreed with our decision."As both of the men pleaded guilty to conspiracy to share the details of the victims, and Davis also pleaded guilty to rape, the judge has the option to sentence both of them to a maximum of life imprisonment."</body>

      <body>Four men are being questioned over an alleged terror plot after they were arrested in a series of raids by armed police officers across London.The men - arrested at about 19:10 BST on Sunday in Whitechapel, Bayswater and Peckham - are being held on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.Searches are continuing at six addresses and on two vehicles.Whitehall officials said the alleged plot was "potentially very serious".But they said it did not appear to be on anything like the scale of earlier major plots, such as the airline liquid bomb plot or the Birmingham rucksack bomb plot, which all resulted in convictions.The men were taken to a south London police station.Two men, both aged 25, were arrested in a car in Mansell Street, Whitechapel, east London, after police fired "Hatton rounds" - ammunition designed to blow out tyres and blow open doors with minimal collateral damage.A 28-year-old man was arrested at premises in Westbourne Grove, Bayswater, west London, and the fourth man, aged 29, was arrested in Peckham Hill Street, Peckham, south-east London.BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said the decision to make arrests was taken on Sunday by a joint committee of senior officers from MI5 and the Met Police's Counter Terrorism Command.As always, they faced a dilemma over whether to hold off longer to gather more evidence but then risk danger to the public, he said.The alleged plot had been monitored for some time, he added.Alistair Gillies, 38, who saw one of the arrests taking place, told the BBC: "I was just going out to try and get something to eat and walking back up Westbourne Grove towards Bayswater and I noticed that a police car had pulled across the road."There was probably in the region of about two dozen officers. The majority of them appeared to be plain clothes but they had on baseball caps with the checkerboard and police marking, apart from that, they were dressed in plain clothes."He added: "It didn't look like they had just pulled a car over or had just picked someone up. It looked like there was a great deal of planning and a great deal of resources had been put on to tackling this situation."</body>

      <title>Horsemeat crisis 'could be repeated'</title>
      <description>A drop in the number of food samples sent for testing could lead to a repeat of the horsemeat scandal, an expert warns.</description>

      <body>A drop in the number of food samples sent for testing could lead to a repeat of the horsemeat scandal, an expert has told BBC Inside Out.Figures obtained from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) show reports of food fraud have risen.At the same time fewer food samples are being analysed by trading standards.In the wake of the horsemeat scandal a National Audit Office report published on Thursday criticised the "confusion" surrounding food policy.It said a 2010 reorganisation had blurred the division of responsibilities between the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the FSA.Local authorities use their trading standards teams to test foods for authenticity - the results are then passed on to the FSA.According to annual reports by the FSA, the number of food samples sent for analysis in England has dropped by 30%, from 74,702 in 2009-10 to 52,186 in 2011-12.Andrew Foster, from the Trading Standards Institute, said the drop was due to cuts to local authority trading standards teams.He said: "We've lost a third of our inspectorate and talking to colleagues recently they are expecting to slash by a further 60% in some cases."He said there was a risk that within three years there would be no trading standards teams in some areas."In my view the horsemeat scandal could happen again," he said."There's always somebody, particularly in times of austerity, prepared to cut corners."And when we're faced with an inspectorate that is creaking and is fragmented - that's a perfect opportunity for someone to exploit those divisions."In January Irish food inspectors announced they had found horsemeat in frozen beefburgers made in Ireland and the UK.The scandal grew as stores and companies across Europe began removing products after finding horsemeat.The FSA said reports of food fraud - which can include deliberately mislabelling products or selling food which is unfit for consumption - had risen from 899 in 2010 to 1,385 in 2012.Early indications for the first six months of 2013, when the horsemeat scandal first emerged, show reports of fraud have risen by 28% compared with the same period the previous year.Andrew Rhodes, who is the chief operating officer at the FSA, said he did not believe the horsemeat scandal was a "wake-up call"."This is an area in terms of food authenticity that we've been working on with local authorities for many years," he said."This incident is one that has really raised the public awareness about authenticity and about thinking what is in your food."Dr Mark Woolfe, who is the former head of authenticity at the FSA, said the agency relied on local authority tests results to operate effectively.He said: "The amount of sampling that [local authorities] are doing has been quite severely reduced, so I think the whole system is really quite severely weakened."Inside Out is broadcast on BBC One England at 19:30 BST and nationwide on the iPlayer for seven days thereafter.</body>

      <title>Met 'picks up 9% of trafficking'</title>
      <description>The Metropolitan Police has picked up only 36 of London's 389 identified cases of human trafficking, a report says.</description>

      <body>The Metropolitan Police has picked up only 36 of London's 389 identified cases of human trafficking this year, a report has said.The research by Tory London Assembly Member Andrew Boff said in one case three police stations turned away a trafficked man who managed to escape.And one council told a Chinese boy, thought to have been sex trafficked, to look on the Gumtree website for help.The Met said it was disappointed in the report's conclusions.As well as the police human trafficking victims are indentified by local authorities, non-governmental organisations and charities, the report said.Mr Boff's research, called Shadow City - Exposing Human Trafficking in Everyday London, said the capital accounted for 39% of indentified cases in Britain this year.But the report said authorities were "blind" to slavery taking place in everyday environments such as construction sites, mobile soup runs for the homeless, Chinese and Indian takeaways and Vietnamese nail bars across the capital."All the evidence I have suggests that human trafficking is a very complex crime with many hidden and informal cases taking place in everyday environments such as domestic trafficking of Nigerian children under the guise of informal fostering, the exploitation of Latin Americans in the au pair industry and the sex grooming of British boys on the internet."An overstretched anti-trafficking unit and figure-driven culture means police are focusing on large-scale organised cases and neglecting the informal trafficking cases that take longer to find, but are sometimes more serious."The report also said a fifth of trafficked victims identified in London so far this year were men, and Mr Boff has called for more rape support services for them.His recommendations include the Met's Human Trafficking Unit (HTU) being protected from further integration into other units after being merged with vice, fraud, and extradition.He also wants additional human trafficking units to be established in other police forces the so Met's HTU is not overstretched by assisting investigations outside the capital.A Met Police spokesman said it welcomed the report but it was "disappointed" by the conclusions."Since the launch of the HTU in April 2010, it has carried out 146 complex and lengthy operations and charged 282 people," he said."The HTU and local policing teams do - and will continue to - investigate those who traffic or coerce men and women into and within London for sexual exploitation."</body>

      <body>Photographs of road signs damaged by "indiscriminate" shooting in Devon and Cornwall have been published on a website.Matt Seiber, a former Royal Marine from Buckinghamshire, said he took the "chilling" photographs over the summer.The damage to one sign - for a hotel on Dartmoor - appeared to have been caused by a high velocity rifle, he said.Devon and Cornwall Police said anyone with information about criminal damage to roadside signs should report it.Mr Seiber said as a "shooting sportsman" he found the safety implications horrific, which was why he had set up his Gunfire Graffiti website."I'm very familiar with the damage guns cause - and these have been done by rifles, handguns and shotguns," he told BBC News."My job as a corporate driving trainer has given me the opportunity to go to a lot of places in the UK and worryingly in the five years I've been doing this I haven't found anywhere there's not damage."Mr Seiber said he was "staggered" to discover several damaged road signs on a relatively short stretch of road off the A30 in Cornwall."Maybe there are more instances in rural areas because people think they're less likely to get caught, but it really shocked me to find 13 shot-damaged signs over about a 15-mile area," he said.In the Devon town of Chudleigh, the Chamber of Commerce and a local councillor are paying £500 to have a damaged sign replaced.Town councillor Richard Keeling said he was "horrified" by the "50 small indentation shots and five or six large pot-shots" at the sign."I don't think it's a local person. Local people wouldn't do this, they are a good sort," he added.Cornwall Council said it was not aware of a particular issue with damaged road signs.Devon County Council also said it was not aware of a "widespread" problem.However a spokesman said anyone who witnessed incidents should report it, adding: "Shooting at road signs is clearly irresponsible and there are serious safety implications."Mr Seiber said it was impossible to say if there was a particular "type" who would cause the damage, although he hoped the perpetrators were not legal licence holders."I haven't really got a clue who'd do it, but it's nobody I'd like to share a pint with," he added.</body>

      <body>An investigation has been launched after a "pup" version of a charity Gromit statue was found for sale on an auction website.The statue, which was not authorised for sale, was removed from eBay after the seller was contacted.The half-sized Gromit was decorated by Bristol schoolchildren as part of a public art trail around the city.Grand Appeal director Nicola Masters said they were looking into how the Gromit ended up with a private seller.When the auction was suspended it had reached a price of £280.Additionally, the charity said other items such as paint-your-own Gromit kits were also appearing for sale."For people to be buying them privately on eBay is very disappointing," said Ms Masters."The whole Gromit Unleashed trail was to raise money for Bristol Children's Hospital."We can only assure people that you don't need to pay those vast vastly inflated prices that they're currently achieving on eBay."Ms Masters said that the Grand Appeal would be selling more smaller Gromit figurines and appealed for people to buy those rather than from auction websites.During the arts trail, schools had the chance to get involved in the project by decorating one of about 80 smaller Gromit statues.Some of them were auctioned, with 50% of the profit going to the school and the other 50% going to the Grand Appeal, which supports Bristol Children's Hospital.Other statues were kept by the schools.</body>

      <body>A collection of letters written by historic figures, including Admiral Horatio Nelson, Florence Nightingale and Charles Dickens, has sold for more than £30,000 at auction in Essex.The 75-strong lot, including cards and autographs, was amassed by a Billericay collector over 30 years.The letter by Nelson, written while on HMS Victory in 1804, was to Sir John Acton, prime minister of Naples.It sold for £7,000 at the auction in Colchester on Saturday.It was thought the letter would sell for between £4,000 and £6,000.The letter was signed Nelson and Bronte, which refers to the fact he was made Duke of Bronte by King Ferdinand of Sicily.It also mentions Dr Alexander John Scott, a friend of the Norfolk-born naval hero who was to attend the admiral's fatal wounds at the Battle of Trafalgar.The private collection was released for auction by the family of the late Captain A.S. Court, who spent much of his life in Romford.A captain in the former Essex Regiment, he was a "collector by nature" said his family.The £30,000 raised by the sale was double what had been expected.Michael Bowles, from auctioneers Reeman Dansie, said interest in the autographs had been worldwide."It was a lovely auction of one-off autographs of famous people," he said."It's very rare to get such an accumulation [of autographs] and very nice to have."Other items in the auction included letters signed by English poet William Wordsworth, which sold for £700 after being given an estimate of between £100 and £200, one from Hawley Harvey Crippen of Dr Crippen notoriety, which was sold for £240 - more than double its estimate - and a letter signed by Florence Nightingale which went for £500.</body>

      <body>A lollipop man has resigned after being threatened with suspension for high-fiving children who were crossing a road.Bob Slade, 65, helped children to cross a road leading to Manadon Vale Primary School, in Plymouth.Parent Barbara Laws said his actions were "not dangerous" and it was a "ridiculous" situation.Plymouth City Council said those on patrols can be "friendly", but their "full attention must be on the road".Ms Laws: "He had his hand out anyway to hold back the traffic and as the children crossed they would pat the hand that he was holding out."In my opinion that's not dangerous. I think if you spoke to any of the parents they wouldn't think it was dangerous - if we had we would have asked him to stop."Mr Slade could not be reached for comment but speaking to the Plymouth Herald, he said he had been doing the job for more than four years without a single accident.Ms Laws said he was "doing the job very well" and following his resignation no-one was patrolling the road."It was all down to a decision which we [parents] don't understand," she added.A council spokesperson said: "We take the safety of children very seriously and school crossing patrols exist to make sure children can cross roads as safely as possible."To do this they must hold out the lollipop with one arm and hold their other arm outstretched to signal that all traffic must stop - this is well established signalling that should be understood by all drivers."While patrols can be friendly, their full attention must be on the road and they must watch the traffic closely at all times."The authority added that it would be recruiting a replacement "as quickly as possible".</body>

      <body>Bury have sacked manager Kevin Blackwell with the Shakers lying fourth from bottom of League Two.Blackwell, 54, had been out of football for more than two years when he took charge at Gigg Lane in September 2012.He was unable to keep Bury in League One as the club battled against severe financial issues for much of last term.Blackwell made 23 signings after a takeover was completed in May, but defeat by Morecambe on Saturday signalled the end of his tenure.Bury have taken just two points from their last six league games and lie just a single point above League Two's relegation zone.Former Leeds, Luton and Sheffield United boss Blackwell arrived at Bury - a club at which he had previously been assistant manager to Neil Warnock - with the Shakers rooted to the foot of League One and without a win from their first nine matches in all competitions. It took another seven attempts before they finally registered a victory.But it soon became clear that the problems ran far deeper than on the pitch when, in December, the Football League imposed a transfer embargo on the club for taking a short-term loan from the Professional Footballers' Association.The embargo was lifted weeks later, but then reinstated in February when the PFA were again asked for financial help.At one stage the club's existence looked in serious danger, with the club appealing for £1m of urgent investment to survive just days before their relegation was confirmed in April.The arrival of property developer Stewart Day as Bury's new owner began a significant rebuilding process for Blackwell, who lost a large percentage of his squad at the end of the 2012-13 campaign as a result of the club's financial problems.But the influx of new signings have failed to deliver the expected results, with Bury winning only two of their first 11 league games.</body>

      <body>Surrey have appointed South African Graham Ford as their new head coach on a three-year deal.The 52-year-old will start work at his new club in February when his contract with the Sri Lanka national team comes to an end.Ford has previously enjoyed spells coaching Natal, South Africa and Kent."I have, for a long while, been an admirer of Surrey and see it as a great privilege to be actively involved in such a fine club," he said."I am delighted to once again be involved in English cricketing system. I look forward to the exciting times ahead."Surrey have been without a head coach since they parted company with team director Chris Adams and first-team coach Ian Salisbury in June.Executive director Alec Stewart had been overseeing first-team affairs, with bowling coach Stuart Barnes working with the side on a day-to-day basis.Surrey were relegated to Division Two of the County Championship this year after a campaign which new captain Graeme Smith missed the vast majority of through injury.Stewart will continue serving on the club board with the new title of director of cricket.The former England captain described Ford's appointment as "outstanding"."Graham has a tremendous reputation for improving players and teams," Stewart told BBC London 94.9."He has worked at international level and domestic level over here. People at Kent have spoken in glowing terms about him."He is definitely the right man, so Surrey should feel very, very lucky that we have got someone of his calibre."His work ethic is great and he has an idea of what he wants to do and the direction he wants the club to go in."</body>

      <description>England's David Lynn ends a nine-year wait for a European Tour title with victory at the Portugal Masters.</description>

      <body>England's David Lynn shot a final-round 63 to win the Portugal Masters and give him a first European Tour title since his KLM Open win nine years ago.The 39-year-old was eight under for his round to set a clubhouse target of 18 under that proved unbeatable.South Africa's Justin Walters finished just a shot behind in second place.Overnight leader Paul Waring of England shot a level-par round to tie for third with Scotland's Stephen Gallacher and Austrian Bernd Wiesberger.Jamie Donaldson of Wales was among those who shared sixth place at the Oceanico Victoria course in Vilamoura, with England's Ross Fisher a shot further back.Scotland's Scott Jamieson failed to back up his stunning third-round of 60, suffering three bogies on the back nine for a one-over par 72 to fade to a tie for 13th."It's emotional," said Lynn, from Stoke, who still has close ties with Trentham, the Staffordshire course where he grew up."To go nine years without a victory and come close so many times you start to question whether you can do it again."It feels fantastic. This one's special as it's been so long since a win and it's just a week before my 40th birthday."To get another win before I turn 40 is an early birthday present."Lynn banks a winner's cheque for €333,330 (£282,905), but that is still dwarfed by the $865,000 (£541,645) he earned for finishing runner-up to Rory McIlroy at the 2012 US PGA Championship - his most rewarding week's work to date.He started the fourth round in 16th place, but made nine birdies as he came from six shots off the pace,Having birdied the 17th, he then enjoyed a stroke of fortune on the 18th after his approach narrowly escaped the water, before safely two-putting - then enduring a long wait before knowing that his score had been good enough to win."I was half-heartedly watching on TV," he said. "You don't wish bad on other golfers out there but you do start to feel a bit selfish, hoping their putts don't go in."But I've had to bide my time, and now I've finally got my hands on a trophy again."</body>

      <title>Is Southampton in China's hands?</title>
      <description>Is trade with China keeping ports like Southampton afloat?</description>

      <body>Trade with China is of increasing importance in the UK, no more so than in Southampton where the city's port is investing £150m to improve its infrastructure. But is the port in danger of putting too much faith in China?A plastic remote-controlled motorcycle in a box on a toy shop shelf may not appear a symbol of commercial might. But when you see thousands of them stacked in a Southampton cargo warehouse you realise you are looking at a billion pound industry.It is mostly down to this booming business from China that the city's port is willing to invest £150m."China is enormously important here at the port," said deputy manager Clive Thomas. "China represents about 60% of what we do through the container terminal."Without the surge of demand from the Chinese economy we wouldn't be progressing with the level of investment we have at present here."He says the port is a "good barometer" of the impact of Britain's business with China.This has grown to such an extent in Southampton that the port is having to cater for larger vessels bringing the cargos in. Some ships are now capable of transporting up to 18,000 containers which are 40ft (12m) long and nine ft (2.8m) high.In an effort to compete with rivals, Associated British Ports, the port the harbour authority, has started constructing a new 500m berth in Southampton capable of handling the world's largest container ships. The project also includes four new ship-to-shore gantry cranes worth £26m and a substantial dredging effort to to allow larger vessels to come through.John Eynon, the managing director at Import Services, which processes three million boxes each year at its warehouses, said "around 95% of products" it handles comes from China.He added: "It just seems as though the Chinese have taken over entirely the manufacturing of products. This time of year it is every hour, 24 hours a day, seven days a week that these cartons are coming down here."On the flip side, the port is also changing to accommodate a growing export market from Britain back to China.It is opening its fifth multi-storey car park this month to house orders of Minis and Land Rovers. Plans are already afoot for a sixth multi-storey.Dr Hui-Chi Yeh, lecturer in China and Global Politics at Southampton University, said: "Southampton now handles 40% to 45% of the UK's deep sea trade from major economies in the Far East and China, and continues to attract trade delegations, notably from major Chinese ports, such as Qingdao."These meetings have contributed to trade in excess of £2.5bn in business deals alone this year. Provisional funding from the Regional Growth Fund for the City of Southampton's infrastructure projects has been made available to help develop these links further."About 12,000 jobs are directly and indirectly dependent on the port's import and export industry, from dockworkers at the port to the hauliers delivering the goods to the shops.But does this mean Southampton is entirely dependant on its business with China to survive?Clive Thomas does not think so."South America and the Indian sub continent are two places beginning to grow in popularity and importance to the manufacturers as well," he said."The capacity improvements we're making here at the port will ensure we're well prepared for the future."</body>

      <title>'Twenty-year fight to clear my name'</title>
      <description>One woman's battle to overturn her conviction for murder</description>

      <body>For the past two decades Susan May says one goal has consumed her every waking thought - to clear her name and overturn her conviction for the murder of her aunt.The 68-year-old was jailed in 1993 for the murder of Hilda Marchbank, found suffocated at her home in Royton, Greater Manchester."That people could think I could do that to the aunt I loved was the worst thing, and that justice wasn't being done for her," she says.As her carer, Ms May visited her aunt several times a day and it was she who called police on discovering the body.Initially the murder was thought to be a burglary gone wrong, but the finger of suspicion turned on Ms May and weeks later she was arrested at her home."I just thought 'I'm innocent, this will all be sorted out'. I was very naive," she says."When the jury said 'guilty' I was numb, I remember banging on the glass box shouting 'no, no, no' and saying to my children 'help me'. It was the beginning of a nightmare."When I got to prison I just kept saying to the staff that I'd be out of there soon and I refused to decorate or personalise my cell."I really did think that each time my cell door opened it would be someone to take me home."I spent every day of my 12 years inside writing letters to anyone I could think of - MPs, campaign groups, newspapers."During the course of her campaign, Ms May estimates she and her supporters have written thousands of letters and compiled hundreds of dossiers of legal documents.Originally a hairdresser in a small market town bringing up three children, Ms May has become something of a legal expert. She says she has instructed high profile barristers, including Michael Mansfield QC, and found what she believes to be new evidence through her own research and determination.Her mother, who believed in her innocence, died when she was in prison.Now her main supporters are Dorothy Cooksey, 68, a Royton woman whose house is now filled with legal files, and Geoff Goodwin, 65, a former builder who has become a self-taught expert in forensics.They spent months combing through the evidence to help build the case for the Criminal Cases Review Commission's (CCRC) latest investigation."I'll be on the phone to them every day asking 'what about this', 'have we checked that'," Ms May says."There's so much to wade through and every now and again we come across something that gives us a spark of hope that it could prove the key to overturning the conviction."Now the group hope they have found that key in a new report by fingerprint expert Arie Zeelenberg, former head of the Dutch national police fingerprint service.Having examined recently unearthed police photographs of marks on the wall, said by the prosecution to be Ms May's "handprints in blood", he concluded there was "overwhelming evidence" they could not have been made in blood at all. No tests have proved what the substance is.The broken lines of the ridges and spots around the pores are characteristics found in sweat marks, he said. If the finger was covered in blood it would have spread evenly over the ridges.Mr Zeelenberg also points to the lack of photographs of the marks before treatment as evidence that police did not initially think they were important to the case, as obvious "bloody handprints" would have been."It's all-important," Ms May said. "When I saw [the report] I couldn't believe it, I was jumping up and down for joy."Him saying it was sweat marks and not blood marks, and further to say 'I'm not even happy to say it's Susan's print, the photos aren't good enough'…that's what I've been saying all along."The findings have been passed to the CCRC, which will decide whether to send Ms May's case back to the Court of Appeal.She said: "I'm weary and tired of waiting. Can't they rush it because I've got this report which is fantastic, it's powerful - the best thing that's happened in 21 years."Ms May was released from prison on parole in 2005 but told reporters at the prison gates: "I will never be free until I get justice for my aunt and prove I am not a murderer."Since then her campaigning has stepped up a gear and seen her help others fighting their own convictions.Having experienced first-hand the "loopholes, hurdles, bureaucracy and barriers" of the justice system, Ms May is also lobbying for its reform."When I tried to appeal the first time I was told I couldn't use any evidence that had been available at time of trial - even if my original solicitor hadn't used it, and nor could I use a complaint about representation as a basis for an appeal," she said."I've personally had to seek out other experts and beg them to look at my case - fortunately people have been very supportive."The CCRC has already agreed some witnesses have been discredited, but still said it's not enough for a jury to return a different verdict - I can't understand it but I won't give up."After every knock down I get straight back up and pick up my pen."Ms May is currently fighting a recurrence of cancer - which she believes is due to two decades suffering the stress of trying to prove she is the victim of a "terrible miscarriage of justice"."It's destroyed my family in some respects," she said. "It's certainly destroyed my health."I've had a few scares, but the fight to clear my name will help me overcome that because I'm determined to see it through."I can't give in and I can't let it go. I won't rest until I've got justice for my aunt."</body>

      <title>Thalidomide: Were more affected?</title>
      <description>A new group of people battle for compensation</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24472269</url>

      <body>New scientific research appears to suggest the drug Thalidomide may have caused a wider range of deformities than previously thought. A new group of "Thalidomiders" now believe they should get compensation for their disabilities.Gary Grayson, from Ipswich, shows me the very first pair of wooden legs he had to wear as a child. They are painted pink, but are heavy and ungainly.The feet are not hinged and there is a complicated harness of steel and leather."They used to call me peg leg and wooden leg. They didn't have a lot of imagination!" he says about some of his former schoolmates.He was born in 1961 with extensive deformities to his lower limbs. His mother says that staff at the hospital reacted with horror."When I was born she heard the nurse gasp and leave the room."Before he was two years old he was admitted to hospital and had both his lower legs amputated. He was walking on artificial limbs within months.His mother has signed an affidavit stating that she took Thalidomide, but he has never received any compensation for his injuries.Thalidomide was originally marketed as a sedative, but from the late 1950s was prescribed to women around the world to combat morning sickness.By 1961 it was clear that it was causing serious birth defects and by late 1961 it was withdrawn in the UK.Ten thousand children were born worldwide with terrible disabilities. It is thought many more died in the womb.After a 10-year legal battle in 1973 the British distributors Distillers agreed to pay compensation in the UK.The Thalidomide Trust was set up and more than 400 children were admitted to the group as beneficiaries.The German manufacturers Grunenthal have never admitted liability to the British victims nor have they contributed to the Thalidomide Trust.A statement from Grunenthal said: "Thalidomide is part of our history and always will be and we have accepted a responsibility to offer help. We have no legal responsibility to compensate individuals affected.Gary Grayson's parents applied to the Thalidomide Trust but doctors said his injuries weren't typical of Thalidomide.He did not let his disability hold him back and did well at school before joining the Ministry of Defence.The 52-year-old's work took him around the world, he rode motorbikes, married and had children. He's now an information security specialist."In my younger years I did not see myself as a victim," he says.But now he has researched deeper into his own medical history and believes the proof is there.He said: "Compensation in today's world, must naturally follow."His case has been taken up by several law firms under the banner of the Thalidomiders legal group, which is representing a number of other clients in the UK.The legal action has temporarily stalled over funding and insurance, but elsewhere in the world other cases continue.As those affected get older, their health is failing.Today in Spain 185 people affected by Thalidomide are taking Grunenthal to court. They have never received compensation from the German company and are now seeking more than £175m in damages.In Australia last year the distributors of the drug agreed to pay damages to fifty-year-old Lynette Rowe. More cases are expected to be settled later this year.In Britain the legal picture is complex.The Thalidomide Trust receives money from both the UK Government and Diageo the company which acquired Distillers. Since 2006 Diageo has put in an average of £7.5 million per year and has committed to do so until 2037.The Trust has only admitted one new beneficiary in the last year and applies strict criteria for inclusion.Those who feel they were harmed by the drug, but do not qualify for the Trust turn to legal action in the hope of getting compensation.Their cases may be assisted by new research being carried out at the University of Aberdeen by Dr Neil Vargesson.His work involves observing the effect of Thalidomide on the development of chick and fish embryos.He has in the past written expert reports for two of the solicitors acting for the new cases.In the 1960s, experts decided that babies were damaged by the drug during a very short period in pregnancy - between 20 and 36 days after conception.Dr Vargesson says questions can be raised about this time-sensitive window and the way the medicine reacted on each individual."The time-sensitive window was based on interviews with parents of severely affected children and relates to outward damage and severe internal damage."He concludes that: "Given the range of damage in Thalidomide survivors and given animal studies that show in one litter each foetus is damaged differently it's clear to me the drug acts differently in each individual and embryo."That would mean that it is possible Thalidomide caused a wider range of damage than was first thought.But he admits that: "We will never know the true range, it's so difficult to go back 55 years and say well let's have a look at these people, because most of them, we don't even know who those people are."His work though is highly controversial. Other experts in the field disagree with his conclusions.Gary Grayson is busy with his career in IT and does all his own DIY.But he can see a time in the future when his health may deteriorate and he'll need more help.For that reason he is determined to continue with his legal action, but also for a much more personal reason too."It would mean the world to me, to be able to ring my mother and say they've admitted they've made a mistake."</body>

      <body>Ronnie O'Sullivan has Stephen Hendry's record of seven world snooker titles in his sights.The 'Rocket' clinched his fifth championship at the Crucible in Sheffield despite playing only one competitive match in the previous 10 months.He has recently courted controversy with his comments over match-fixing - the latest chapter in a rollercoaster career analysed in his new autobiography, Running.Here, he speaks to BBC Sport about his snooker ambitions, his father's imprisonment and the psychiatrist who helped turn his life around.Victory in May brought O'Sullivan his fifth title following triumphs in 2001, 2004, 2008 and 2012."I've got five world titles. I was happy with four. I haven't set myself a mental target. It's something I would like to achieve, it would be a dream for me to get to seven, possibly eight," said the 37-year-old."It is definitely one of the main motivations why I still keep playing. It does drive you on. If I get to six, I'd be with Steve Davis and if I get to seven I'm there with Stephen Hendry, the greatest to have played the game."When you're 70 or 80 and they call you back to the Crucible as a seven-times world champion, seven sounds better than five. So there's definitely an incentive to want to win more. But the competition's tough, there's some great players out there and everyone wants to be world champion."I start to think, I'm nearly 40, I'm an old man. I'm getting grey hairs now. I look around and everyone's 25, 26, and I'm nearly 38 and I'm giving them a run for their money. I'm like dad on the circuit."I feel like I've broken the mould of players that got to their 30s and never managed to win any more titles. Maybe the next generation will think you don't hit your peak until you're 37 because Ronnie's proved it."O'Sullivan's father Ronnie senior, who had encouraged him to embark on a snooker career, was jailed for murder in 1992 after a nightclub row and released in 2010.The year after he was imprisoned, his 17-year-old son brought the UK Championship trophy to him in jail  after becoming the youngster winner of a ranking tournament."He was telling everybody when I was 10 that I was going to be world champion," said O'Sullivan. "He has a massive amount of confidence in me."I was blessed with a good work ethic because of my father's influence. He always pushed me to make the most of my time at the snooker club."If I was caught playing the fruit machine or playing cards, I was either banned from going to the club for a while or got a stiff telling off."O'Sullivan graduated to the professional snooker tour alongside subsequent world champions John Higgins and Mark Williams, but felt pressure to perform with his dad in prison."I had a really good first qualifying season at Blackpool [in 1992] where I won 74 out of 76 matches and then straight after that my dad got sent down and it sunk in that he wasn't going to come out for 20 years," he reflected."When I won my first UK tournament, it was the worst thing that could happen to me because I got success early and the spotlight was on me."There was always pressure on me to win and I learned to deal with that, but what I couldn't deal with was my dad had gone away and I didn't want him to feel the guilt of me failing, so there was that extra pressure to succeed."It was really hard - the most difficult time of my life, to be honest with you. It was make or break for me - I could have gone one way or the other."At one stage I was on a downward spiral for about six or seven years. I was present at tournaments, but I was really struggling to deal with things."After a spell in the Priory Clinic during 2000 to kick a drugs habit, O'Sullivan later found a new focus with running."I got myself in the Priory - which was a good start - and then found running, which is the biggest thing that has kept me together," he said."Snooker tournaments became a chance to visit different running clubs and running friends. It became a hobby for me around 2004 or 2005. As long as I had my running kit, I'd take my cue and think running comes first."When I turned up and won a five-mile race and got my £80 voucher, I was buzzing, The very first race I did I came about 100th out of 200 and then six years on I won it - and I was pretty chuffed with myself."In some ways, I got more sense of achievement out of my running because there was always something to gain."In snooker, if I didn't win it was always that I hadn't fulfilled my true potential or everyone else's expectations. I think I've got far more satisfaction out of running, and doing good races, than I have out of my snooker."O'Sullivan credits much of his current stability to the help of psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters, who has helped top cyclists including Sir Chris Hoy and Sir Bradley Wiggins.Peters works with clients on what he calls their 'inner chimp' - controlling their emotional side during competition."I owe everything to Steve. I wasn't going to continue playing. I'd had enough come 2011 with some poor results, a lot of off-the-table stuff and I just fell out of love with the whole thing," said O'Sullivan."Steve turned my thinking around. I found a new zest for the game, a new enthusiasm, I was much more able to put whatever was going on in my head aside, while I was playing."Before, I'd just be overrun with 'I've had enough, I don't want to be here, I hate this place, I've had enough of snooker' and play snooker like I just wanted out. Now, I still think that, but we'll deal with that later, not during the match."O'Sullivan says he keeps a diary, makes notes during sessions with Peters, records them and listens back. He feels more in control - "machine-like" - at the table."I wasn't sure if it was going to work for me because I'd tried everything else. Steve came at it from a different angle."Very rarely would we talk about snooker, but how the mind functions. He's been able to give me a better idea of how that works, so now I'm able to go away and do it all for myself.""Snooker player. I have a degree in snooker and I am a genius.. ha." So says O'Sullivan's profile on his Twitter account. "That description - 'most naturally talented player' - yeah, I have talent to play the game, but there were a lot more juniors around that were more talented than me who didn't apply themselves," he said."I've worked really, really hard and anyone who's seen me practise will know how hard I work. They realise it's something that does not come easily."When my dad went away that always stuck with me - the work ethic, to keep fit, and to balance it with my life as a professional snooker player which meant playing four or five hours a day."O'Sullivan is self-critical, but says he played his best snooker at the 2012 World Championship."I got really ill with glandular fever just before I won the championship. I could hardly practise. I left my cue on the table at the club and didn't have it in me to do two or three hours' practice," he recalled."There were times in every match where I hit a ball and thought I couldn't miss. Every time I came to the table, I thought about clearing up."To have that confidence was unbelievable. That's how I was as a young boy, and that confidence has come back."I played OK in 2013, not great. I struggled through to the final. Then I played a really good final."To go and win it was a fairytale and is probably one of my greatest achievements."I was pushed internally. My mind was on one ball at a time. There were times when I felt I wasn't up for this, lacking the match practice and had to dig deep. Come the final I actually started to feel like a snooker player again, started to play from instinct."Interview: Jamie Broughton Words: Frank Keogh</body>

      <title>Worst pit tragedy centenary marked</title>

      <body>A day of events marking the 100th anniversary of Britain's worst mining disaster is taking place in Senghenydd.Hundreds are turning out in the streets of the Caerphilly county village where an explosion killed 439 miners and a rescuer at the Universal Colliery on 14 October, 1913.A new memorial has been unveiled to mark the event and other mining tragedies in Wales.Relatives of the men and boys who died will be among those attending.The day of ceremony is marking the explosion which happened just after 8am on 14 October, 1913.It had been caused by a build up of firedamp (methane) gas being ignited.The blast disturbed coal dust on the mine floor, raising clouds that then also caught alight, spreading the destruction further.The fire was mainly confined to the west side of the mine, with the east side blocked with noxious gases. The result was over 400 men trapped underground.It was not the first time tragedy had hit the village which is a few miles along the Aber Valley from Caerphilly.An explosion at the colliery in 1901 killed 81 men and there was criticism that the pit owners did not learn lessons from it.A report following that explosion recommended certain safety procedures be followed. An extended deadline of September 1913 to implement the safety measure was missed by the mine bosses.Just six weeks later, 439 miners and one rescuer died when another blast ripped through the colliery.There had been 950 men down Universal's three pits that day.Over the fortnight that followed those trapped were helped to safety with the last 18 men rescued more than two weeks later.Funerals for those who died took place over the next month.One hundred years later, the Wales National Mining Memorial was unveiled to remember the Senghenydd disaster and 150 other mining tragedies in Wales including the most recent, when four men died at Gleision in the Swansea Valley in 2011.The memorial is a bronze statue of a rescue worker helping a miner.The day of events in Senghenydd started with the sounding of the original Universal Colliery pit hooter at 08:10 BST, exactly as it did a century ago when it sounded to alert the village to what had happened in the pit.As part of the memorial event, a walled garden was also opened with tiles inscribed with the details of those killed in the two Senghenydd disasters as well as a "path of memory," which marks the other colliery tragedies in Wales.Patron Roy Noble paid tribute to "the men who paid the ultimate sacrifice in their quest for coal" and added it was a "tragic end to the stepping stones leading to disaster".A hoooter marked the end of the service.The Aber Valley Heritage Group has been behind fundraising for the memorial.Jack Humphreys, group chairman, said: "It has been a hundred years since the disaster at the Universal Colliery, but the impact that the explosion had on this small mining community is still felt today."We hope the event is a fitting tribute to the victims of the explosions in Senghenydd and mining disasters across Wales."He told BBC Radio Wales: "It's very important for local people and people nationally. It's surprising the number of people who have come from far and wide to be with us this morning."There will be many people here today who have had family connections with those who were killed in the disasters of 1901 and 1913."Hilary Barbrook, a local florist from Caerphilly, lost both her grandfathers at Senghenydd."We've spoken for years over the tragedy that has happened in this pit, but it's 100 years and it's nice that we're going to honour the people who died," she said."The village was grown around the pit because beforehand it was farm land and when they sunk the pit, they built the houses around it so everyone was involved."My grandmother had a lot of work, she had eight children and was eight months pregnant with the last one when my grandfather died."She used to take in washing, ironing, clean houses. She made all of her own clothes for the children so they didn't go without. She worked tremendously hard to keep the family together."Hundreds of people attended the unveiling of the memorial, including First Minister Carwyn Jones.Wales' footballers were wearing black armbands in training to mark the disaster. They fly to Belgium later for their final World Cup qualifying game.A BBC One Wales programme, Senghenydd - Britain's Worst Mining Disaster, will be shown on BBC One Wales at 22:45 BST on Monday 14 October.</body>

      <title>Bone marrow donor campaign launches</title>
      <description>A campaign to raise awareness about becoming a bone marrow donor in Wales, joining 75,000 already registered, is launched.</description>

      <body>A new campaign to raise awareness about becoming a bone marrow donor in Wales is being launched.There are an estimated 20,000 people worldwide desperately searching for a possible match to an unrelated donor.In Wales, more than 75,000 people have already joined a database of potential marrow donors, but the Welsh Blood Service says many more are needed.As part of the campaign, a choir of donors, patients and medical staff has been brought together to perform.The '2nd Chance Choir' will be making their debut at the Wales Millennium Centre later on Monday, as the campaign kicks off.It is the first time the Welsh Blood Service has run a bone marrow donor awareness programme.Dr Keith Wilson, consultant haematologist at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, said with bone marrow donors it is always about having a choice from as many people as possible."What are the chances of you walking down your street and meeting your exact double, who is like you in every way," he explained."It is not very likely. But if you are searching for that double among thousands and thousands of different people, perhaps you will find that match."That is what the bone marrow donor register is about."It is a worldwide register - the person who needs treatment here in Wales, may be a match to a donor in Europe, America, Asia - anywhere in the world."So we need as many people as possible to sign up for the register to see if they can help."He said he was treating one patient who would be getting a donor matched from Japan or China."Basically, the bigger the pool of people who are registered as donors, the better the chance of a match," he added.Dr Wilson said Wales was already doing well in the league table of donors registered but even more could be done.The Wales bone marrow register is asked to make about 30,000 searches a year to find a possible donor match, and since 1989, more than 850 people in Wales have gone on to become donors.Anyone who is already registered as a blood donor can become part of the marrow register, and a small sample of blood is taken at a donation session.The bone marrow can be used to treat a wide-range of cancers, as well as help rebuild damaged immune systems.The procedures for actual donation if a match is found have also changed dramatically.It used to mean an operation involving anaesthetics and painful injections.Now the preferred method is to collect the marrow from blood."We can collect the donor marrow much more efficiently this way - it just means being hooked up to a machine for four or five hours" added Dr Wilson, who is chair of the south Wales blood and marrow transplantation project."So it's not painful - perhaps boring - you just need a long book."</body>

      <body>Seven former Remploy workers are back in work after investing their redundancy money in a co-operative on the same site in Swansea.The Forestfach plant was one of seven Remploy factories in Wales shut after the UK government decided they were not financially viable.Accommodation Furniture Solutions will assemble and make furniture for public and private sectors customers.The firm hopes to employ at least 25 people within two years.The seven workers back at work were among 52 who lost their jobs when the factory in Fforestfach shut last year.Two hundred and eighty workers lost their jobs when the Remploy plants in Wales closed.It marked the end of an era which began in 1946 when the company opened its first factory in Bridgend employing disabled ex-miners to make furniture and violins.Ray Donovan, one of the ex-employees who has invested in the business at Fforestfach, said: "It's a job. It's a long-term sustainable job. It's in the ashes of Remploy. There's a business here. There's a market here."Remploy was a huge industry in Great Britain. They closed that industry. The market place was still there for the factories supplying that market. It was a shame."Accommodation Furniture Solutions managing director Kevin Edwards said: "It was a huge blow, both for everybody that was here - there was 52 here originally - that was very upsetting for them and the community."But we were absolutely convinced we could make a business out of this and that's what we wanted to do."Rhian Edwards, from Wales Cooperative Centre, which is supporting the firm, said: "Their business plan shows they will employ about 25 people so we want to help them get to that size."There's definitely a trade. They've had lots of local authority interest, public sector interest and private sector interest, so the future's really bright for this business."Their first job for the workers is to begin assembling kitchen cabinets.</body>

      <title>Cap council tax, Welsh Tories urge</title>
      <description>Council tax should be capped in Wales to prevent the cost of cuts being passed onto "hardworking people", say the Conservatives.</description>

      <body>Council tax in Wales should be capped to prevent the cost of cuts being passed onto residents, the Conservatives have said.They want the Welsh government to limit the tax from next April after its draft budget saw council funding slashed.The shadow finance minister wants people protected from "the threat of mega council tax rises".But the Welsh government said council tax should be set at a reasonable level and accused the Tories of "hypocrisy".Ministers have previously ruled out caps and set an informal limit of a 5% rise.The call from shadow finance minister Janet Finch-Saunders AM comes at the start of a week which will see all 22 local councils find out the details of how much money they will receive from the Welsh government.She has previously called on local authorities not to cut frontline services or increase council tax bills.Ms Finch-Saunders said: "Over the past three years, hardworking families in Wales have faced the highest council tax bills in the UK because Labour refused to pass on the Conservative council tax freeze."Carwyn Jones's Labour government opposed legislation to allow taxpayers local referendums on excessive council tax rises, so hard-pressed families have no protection, such as that introduced by Conservatives in England, from excessive tax rises."Ms Finch-Saunders called on the government to consider a cap on council tax hikes to "shield hardworking people from the threat of mega council tax rises".Local government settlements are being announced on Wednesday, with each council finding out how much funding they will receive, allowing them to work out how much council tax they will need to charge.Councils already know it will be a tough year ahead, with one senior council figure saying local authorities were in a "very dark place," with at least two facing a possible bail-out.Finance Minister Jane Hutt announced in the draft budget on Tuesday that the local government budget would fall from £4.648bn to £4.466bn in 2014, a cut of 3.91% in cash terms or 5.81% in real terms.She said last week the government had been "supporting and cushioning" local government for the past three years, and that the priority was to protect health, schools and universal benefits such as free prescriptions, school breakfasts and bus passes for older people.A spokesman for Local Government Minister Lesley Griffiths said: "The Welsh Tories are deliberately deceiving the people of Wales."Their hypocrisy knows no bounds. By their own admission, the Tories would slash a whopping 12.5% from local authority budgets next year - a cut that would create unprecedented damage on public services all over Wales."Her spokesman added: "We would expect levels of council tax to be set at a reasonable level, taking into account the challenging financials circumstances for families across Wales."The one thing Wales can be certain of is, if the Tories had their way, vital services across the country would collapse overnight. Mercifully, we are not facing that scenario."The Welsh Local Government Association has previously said councils could not continue delivering the range of services they currently provided, adding there would be a "massive impact for the Welsh public".Chief executive Steve Thomas said once the settlements were known, he feared there would be "more pressure on the council tax".</body>

      <body>A walker has been killed after falling from a cliff at a well known mountain spot in Snowdonia.The man, in his 30s and believed to be from the south of England, died after dropping up to 330ft (100m) from above Devil's Kitchen in the Ogwen Valley.The alarm was raised by a party of five walkers in the area, who saw the casualty fall on to the path.His body was recovered by about 20 members of the Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue team, and airlifted to hospital.The incident happened at about 18:00 BST on Saturday.Mountain rescuers say the individual was an experienced lone walker who regularly visited the area."It is an unfortunate tragic accident," said Chris Lloyd, from the Ogwen Valley team."It looks as though this individual made a navigational error in low cloud, and walked off a cliff."The mountain rescue team said it was clear to the walkers who found the man that the fall had been fatal.His body was finally recovered by the rescue team at about 20:30, before being airlifted to hospital at Bangor by an RAF Sea King helicopter from 22 Squadron at RAF Valley on Anglesey.Devil's Kitchen, or Twll Du (Black Hole) in Welsh, is a very well known route above Cwm Idwal in the Ogwen Valley.It marks a tricky crack in rocks which can be scrambled up to reach the Glyder range of peaks and Y Garn.The route can prove challenging for many walkers, especially if there is poor weather and mist, as the path through the rocks and cliffs is ill-defined.It was the second serious incident of the day for the Ogwen Valley team, after an earlier rescue at Pen yr Ole Wen on Saturday morning.A climber suffered life-changing injuries when a stone block collapsed, severing his leg below the knee.The rock then fell some 500ft (150m) on to the A5 main road below.Walkers in the area assisted the injured climber, until a party of 18 from the Ogwen Valley team arrived on the scene.The climber was airlifted to a specialist unit in Stoke, where surgeons were attempting to save his leg."I think that is the first time with a mountain rescue that I have come across an incident like that," added Mr Lloyd, from the Ogwen team.</body>

      <description>Chris Coleman praises James Collins after the defender returned to play a vital role in Wales' 1-0 win over Macedonia.</description>

      <body>Chris Coleman has praised James Collins for the way he marshalled Wales' young defence in Friday's 1-0 win against Macedonia in their World Cup qualifier.The West Ham centre-back was back in the squad before the clash after settling his differences with Coleman."He [Collins] was brilliant. I could sense it before the game that he would stand strong," manager Coleman said.Wales' unsuccessful qualifying campaign ends against Belgium at Brussels' King Baudouin Stadium on Tuesday.Coleman will be hoping Collins, 30, can repeats his stand-out performance for an injury-hit Wales side against the Group A winners."He had a young back four around him and his organisation was superb. He was an absolute rock," said Coleman.Wales climbed off the bottom of Group A with the victory at Cardiff City Stadium and leapfrogged Macedonia and Scotland into fourth place.Coleman was without 11 senior players because of injury and suspension, but his options were improved in midweek when Collins met the national coach for peace talks and was subsequently added to the squad.The Wales boss had accused the former Cardiff City and Aston Villa defender of rejecting the chance to join the Wales squad before their game against Serbia in September, a claim Collins had denied.The timely return of Collins for his 42nd cap saw him paired alongside Chris Gunter - normally a full-back - in the centre of defence, with Cardiff City's 18-year-old full-back Declan John making his debut and Swansea left-back Neil Taylor switching to the right.Coleman added: "It took courage for him [Collins] to pick up the phone. He could have easily left it."A lot of people would have looked at it and thought, 'Macedonia at home, 10 pull-outs, then Belgium away'."He could have had an excuse as we needed a centre-back and we were going into a cauldron, but he came down."We had a good conversation. I promise you it wasn't a laugh or a joke or a pat on the back."We both had it out and were honest. It's how you get things sorted."</body>

      <title>Bennett fears for Welsh regions</title>
      <description>Former Wales and Lions fly-half Phil Bennett says the Welsh regions could go bust without European rugby next season.</description>

      <body>Wales legend Phil Bennett fears his country's regions could go bust if they are left without European competition.English and French clubs will quit the Heineken Cup next year and have proposed a rival Rugby Champions Cup.No agreement has yet been reached as to whether Rabodirect Pro12 teams - involving sides from Wales, Ireland, Scotland and Italy - will be included if the new competition goes ahead."Without the European Cup the regions could fold," Bennett warned."It's now time that the Welsh Rugby Union got together with the regions and say, 'this mustn't happen - you've got to be strong'."The WRU have to have money coming in, they've handled their monies remarkably well - they've brought the debt down greatly - but at the end of the day we must have strong regional rugby in Wales."We can have the... Pro12 which is great, but I can see the English and French clubs have got a point that most of the teams qualify and go straight into Europe."Believe me, to see the games against Munster we've [Scarlets] had at Stradey Park and Parc y Scarlets, Clermont and all these stars there, without European rugby we're going to die."Former fly-half Bennett, who won 29 caps for Wales and eight for the British and Irish Lions between 1969 and 1978, also fears that the greater financial strength of English and French clubs, married to the row over the future of Europe's cross-border tournament, is affecting the thinking of players who are close to the end of their contracts."There are a load of players up for contract at the end of the season. Typical example: Northampton, loads of money - all the English clubs are loaded - they pinch our star player George North," said the 64-year-old."Guys like Jonathan Davies, our centre, who made the big furore on the Lions tour and got in instead of [Brian] O'Driscoll, he's out of contract this season."Jonathan needs to be paid well and he wants to be in a side that's challenging for trophies."So it's a big season for the Welsh Rugby Union to get their act together for the regions, all of us to get together and even at the grassroots level where we're struggling we've got to be united."As a small nation, united we're strong but split us apart and we're useless, so I'm hoping for the best."Knowing the English clubs like I do... it's going to be hard, some hard bargaining done at the table."But if the competition is to be a success I think it needs the Celtic nations in it to have the flavour that it has now."I think a deal will be done. I think it'll go down to the very last minute and I think the English clubs and the French clubs will come out of it very well, but I think the Celtic nations have to realise it's a bit lop-sided at the moment."</body>

      <body>Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood won't rule out a tax on junk food if her party wins the assembly election in 2016.She told BBC Sunday Politics Wales that money raised from such a tax should subsidise "good quality wholesome food" for people.Ms Wood unveiled at Plaid's conference on Friday a proposal for levy on sugary drinks of up to 20p a litre.She said that policy would finance the recruitment of 1,000 extra doctors.Asked whether she would build on the introduction of a sugary drinks levy and start taxing items like chocolate and crisps, Ms Wood said: "I wouldn't rule out taxing junk food."What I would want to do with any additional monies raised from that is to ensure that good quality wholesome food can be provided cheaper and everywhere for people because that's a big problem at the moment."It's a crazy situation that you can buy poor quality food - food that's bad for you, food that is more likely to make you obese - than you can find good quality food in many parts of Wales."That's a ridiculous situation," Ms Wood said."Governments everywhere use taxation to incentivise and dis-incentivise various behaviours."I'm not announcing now that we are going to introduce a tax on burgers for example but I do think something needs to be done about the proliferation of fast food outlets in our communities."There are far far too many, it's too easy and too cheap and very, very bad for people," said Ms Wood.A spokesman for Wales Labour, responding to the sugary drinks levy idea, said: "Linking the promotion of an unhealthy lifestyle, in order to pay for improved medical services, is a not sensible way forward."This ill-thought idea, shows how out of touch and out of ideas Plaid are."But the Liberal Democrat AM for Mid and West Wales William Powell, who also chairs the assembly petitions committee, said that there could be a role for government in this area."There's certainly merit in looking at a raft of proposals to encourage sensible behaviours in terms of diet," he said."In fact the committee that I chair - the petitions committee - just last year was looking at a petition to create a cordon around all schools to ban hot food takeaways from offering attractive, tasty but ultimately very unhealthy food options to pupils that they would readily take because that's what kids do," said Mr Powell.In January Wales' chief medical officer has suggested banning fast food outlets near schools.Dr Ruth Hussey said keeping children in school at lunchtime and providing healthy meals could help tackle obesity.</body>

      <body>A rock climber has had his leg amputated after a large block of stone collapsed in Snowdonia, crashing into the main A5 road below.The climber had been on a route at Pen yr Ole Wen in the Caerneddau range in the Ogwen Valley.Mountain rescuers say the man-sized rock came away as the mountaineer stood on it, sending it some 500ft (150m) on to the A5 carriageway.The climber suffered serious leg injuries and was airlifted to hospital.The man, one of two climbers from the south of England, is currently being treated at a specialist unit in Stoke.Members of the Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Team said they were alerted at about 10:30 BST on Saturday.They were joined by and RAF rescue team climbing in the area, and the group of about 18 reached the casualty, who is understood to be in his mid-40s."Two rock climbers had just started up a rock climb," said Chris Lloyd, from Ogwen Mountain Rescue."The lead climber stood on a block that came away and caused serious leg injuries."Two passing walkers went to assist: one helped the injured man and the other made the 999 call."Once the team was cleared they called for the RAF Valley helicopter."Mr Lloyd later confirmed the climber suffered a leg amputation.He said it was the "first time in mountain rescue" that he had come across an incident like it.An RAF Sea King helicopter from 22 Squadron at Valley on Anglesey was then able to come under cloud cover to winch the man off the mountainside.</body>

      <title>Patient has 'fine tune' heart device</title>
      <description>A woman describes taking her "first deep breath in two years" after becoming the first patient in Wales to have a new procedure to control her heart.</description>

      <body>A woman has described taking her "first deep breath in two years" after becoming the first person in Wales to have a new procedure to control her heart.Because of her scarred heart, Gaynor Wright's original pacemaker was not effective.But its replacement can be "fine-tuned" to her needs by her consultant at the University Hospital of Wales, who can even upload data from it transmitted wirelessly via the internet.Mrs Wright, 65, from Beddau, near Pontypridd said: "I'm back to normal."Her problems started in May 2011 when she ended up in hospital while on a holiday in Cyprus for her 40th wedding anniversary.On her return she underwent tests and it was eventually found she had a serious heart problem and by October 2012 she had her first pacemaker fitted.She said that although it was supposed to "kick in" if anything serious happened to her heart, it did not improve her health and left her breathless.The retired nurse had to give up a rambling group and enjoying long walks over Pembrokeshire Coast Path.Eventually, walking her grandchildren to school or even walking up the stairs became difficult.Mrs Wright's problem was complicated because her heart has scar tissue which means that the original pacemaker could not really improve her day-to-day condition.But her cardiologist Dr Zaheer Yousef was awaiting approval for a new treatment and said she could be a suitable candidate.The replacement pacemaker fitted in May has a new type of system to control her heartbeat and keep the whole muscle beating in synchronisation.It has improved her heart's overall effectiveness as all sections of her heart were not previously working in unison.Dr Yousef, a consultant at University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, has more flexibility to pace the heart so if ever a new problem presents itself then there will be a better chance of being able to adapt to it without surgery.And the pacemaker is fitted with a tiny device that connects wirelessly to a transmitter in Mrs Wright's home to upload data over the internet to Dr Yousef.Now she is enjoying life again and her husband David, 70, says she is no longer "blowing like a whale" as she used to struggle for breath."Within an hour after the procedure I took my first deep breath in two years," said Mrs Wright."After about four weeks I was walking to school to collect my grandchildren."Dr Yousef had been working for three years on clinical trials involving 45 patients in the Cardiff area along with other trials elsewhere and they were awaiting formal approval before it could be used on patients.At that time Mrs Wright was referred to him after having her original pacemaker fitted at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital.He says the adaption to the resynchronisation (biventricular) pacemaker allows cardiologists to "fine tune" or individualise the device.While the pacing configuration was right first time for Mrs Wright other patients may need to have their pacemaker's pacing reconfigured before it suits their needs.He reckons it will help about 20% of the 100 patients with similar conditions referred to him annually as well as countless others."She has really seen the benefit," he said."The additional pacing options will not only give us the opportunity to offer this treatment to patients like Gaynor with very scarred hearts, but the additional pacing options will also allow us to individualise pacing configurations for all patients."Mrs Wright says she is enjoying life again and finding pleasure in small things like doing away with a mountain of pillows as she used to try to sleep while sitting up in bed so she could breathe."It's absolutely amazing," said Mrs Wright.</body>

      <title>Falls on 'optical illusion' pavement</title>
      <description>A £10.5m town centre make-over is blamed for more than 20 people being taken to hospital for falls after new paving stones "hid" a pavement kerb.</description>

      <body>A £10.5m town centre make-over has been blamed for more than 20 people being taken to hospital for falls after new paving stones "hid" a pavement kerb.The new pattern of pavers on part of Taff Street in Pontypridd has created an "optical illusion", disguising the drop to road level, locals say.It has led to a series of trips, mainly for elderly people, according to a shop manager who has helped many of them.Rhondda Cynon Taf council said the regeneration had made streets safer.The stretch of pavement on the main shopping street drops to a loading bay at road level, which has similar colour paving stones to the pavement.It means that people - many rushing to a nearby bus stop - do not see where the kerb is.The Welsh Ambulance Service said it had been called to the pavement 20 times since 1 May, when the improved streetscape was completed, all for injuries related to falls.Cheryl Hull, manager of Shaws the Drapers, which is opposite the loading bay, says she has personally helped and called an ambulance for about 10 people in recent months, with the latest on Tuesday."The loading bay used to be the same colour as the road but when they did the regeneration they made the pavement and loading bay similar colours and this is what's causing what I would say is an optical illusion. It tends to blend into one," she said."Some people see the edge of the kerb but others don't."Depending on what angle you come at it, it can look as if it's all one level and I think when older people are rushing for the bus, they might not see it, especially as their eyesight tends to be bad."And at that age they fall quite heavily and some of the people I've helped have been quite badly hurt. At that age, it can really be a big deal too."She said she did not feel the council had done anything wrong as there were no loose pavers or broken stones but added: "Surely they can do something to try to highlight the pavement."It's such a shame as Pontypridd's much nicer since the regeneration and it's not good that this is distracting from the work that's been done."Morfydd Jenkins, 75, from Pontyclun, Rhondda Cynon Taf, had been going to Pontypridd once a fortnight until she fell in August. Now she said she has lost confidence in going out alone."I was going to the bus stop and all I remember is falling over the kerb - I didn't see it," she said."The woman in Shaws took me into the shop and called an ambulance. I was taken to hospital and had X-rays and I had a lot of bruising and cuts to my face and neck."I'm feeling alright now but I'm much more cautious about going out on my own."A Rhondda Cynon Taf council spokesman said safety had been a matter of "paramount importance" throughout the regeneration, "creating a safer and more attractive environment for all town centre users"."Throughout the town improvements have been made removing clutter from the street, introducing more accessible floor surfaces, and introducing flat surfaces where possible which greatly assists those with mobility issues," he said."There are some areas in the town that do require a kerb to ensure services such as buses and deliveries to shops can continue to be provided, and it is important that pedestrians are suitably protected from vehicles in these areas."Accessibility throughout Pontypridd has been greatly improved due to the regeneration scheme and with an increased amount of visitors to the town centre month-on-month, clearly the project has been a huge success."Recently the innovative free hire of mobility scooters and wheelchairs has been introduced, a scheme that would not have been possible previous to the regeneration project taking place.

      <body>A project to help boost the night-time economy in rural parts of Conwy is hosting what claims to be north Wales' largest drive-in cinema event.Up to 150 cars are expected at the screening of Disney's The Lion King II near Trefriw.Organisers are setting up a 22ft (7m) screen for the Saturday evening event on fields at Nant Conwy rugby club.The drive-in, run by the council's Goleuo project, follows a similar smaller project in 2011 at Conwy Falls.The EU funded scheme has been running for three years and will come to an end next month, making Saturday's event one of Goleuo's last big ventures.Iwan Williams from the project, which is Welsh for 'Enlightenment', said it was an opportunity to get people in rural parts of Conwy out into their communities."It's also about trying to get some money moving in those communities," he said."We've been holding events like this and smaller cultural events at pubs, restaurants and clubs, in a bid to stimulate the evening economy in rural parts of the Conwy borough."The event is free - but on a first come, first served basis, with cars asked to arrive from 18:30 GMT for the start of the film at 19:00.Money raised through a raffle and refreshments will go to a local nursery group, Cylch Meithrin Bro Cernyw.</body>

      <body>Memorials are planned to mark the deaths of five World War II airmen who died when their plane crashed in Conwy.Deganwy historian Gwyn Hughes has been researching the incident after learning of the deaths almost 70 years ago.Over the years he has interviewed eye witnesses and found archives to piece together details of the 1944 crash which he said was not well documented.A memorial park is being opened at Llandudno Junction Community Club near to the crash site at Marl Woods.And a separate plaque near the site and memorial service are also being arranged"It's a tragic story," said Mr Hughes whose research published on the website of Deganwy History Group explains how the men had been on a training flight from north Wales when they ran into difficulty.The airmen, including three from Britain and two from Poland and New Zealand, had left Mona Airfield, Anglesey, en route to Lancashire when the Avro Anson MK1 plane were seen in difficulty over Llandudno.Mr Hughes explained how school children were among the witnesses that February afternoon in 1944 and they described loud noises and debris falling from the sky before the plane crashed."There was no explosion, just a thud," said Mr Hughes.In his research he found medical officer's report said the crash was one day, while the graves of some of the airmen say it was another day.Mr Hughes said this shows there was not a comprehensive report into the crash and he is at a loss to explain why.The transcribed medical report says: "On the afternoon of the 16.2.44 the ambulance was called out to a flying accident near Llandudno Junction. On arrival there it was found that the crew of five were all dead and had been established as personnel from this unit. They were conveyed back to RAF Station Mona Sick Quarters Mortuary. Two of the funerals were carried out here, the rest elsewhere."Over the years Mr Hughes has traced the families of three of the five airman and they will be invited to a memorial service due to be held next February.A new plaque is also due to installed by Deganwy History Group near to the scene once permission is granted."There are people who still remember the crash," said Mr Hughes."Some have thought for years that we need to remember these men."</body>

      <body>Barnet and Wrexham drew a bad-tempered match that saw three men sent off.Anthony Acheampong gave Barnet an early lead, heading in Jack Saville's cross.But in the final few minutes Barnet player-manager Edgar Davids, the former Netherlands international, clashed with Wrexham's Stephen Wright in an incident that saw both men shown red cards.Wrexham skipper Dean Keates equalised from the resulting free-kick, but the Dragons then had Johnny Hunt sent off for a poor tackle on Curtis Weston.Wrexham manager Andy Morrell told BBC Radio Wales:"I don't think there's a bad tackle in the game up to that point [the sending off of Davids and Wright], I thought the game was played fairly."It was our free-kick. Wrighty has gone in and tried to get the ball back, there's nothing in it - he's not tried to punch him to get the ball off him or anything like that - and Davids has reacted to it and belted him in the face."I think he's a straight red and if Wrighty gets a yellow I'm disappointed, we'll definitely have a look but I think we'll have an appeal there for us."Johnny Hunt is probably frustrated, but it's a bad tackle. He's late, he's new to the game and he knows that if he stands up the guy just goes round him and he shields him out or away but you can't do that."Our disciplinary record is not good at the minute and we need to curb it and get people that are playing on the pitch for the right reasons."</body>

      <body>A dog-free zone in Welshpool might be extended to include a cemetery following complaints the animals have been fouling on graves.Dogs have been banned from some public areas in the Powys town since March after owners were accused of failing to clean up after their pets.Welshpool Town Council is now planning to ask cemetery owners Powys council if the zone could include the graves.Powys council urged dog owners to clean up after their pets.Welshpool town clerk Robert Robinson said the dog ban had worked in the town but officials were now considering further action following "constant complaints" about the graveyard."Dog controls in several areas in the town have seen conditions improve but the graveyard is not our land," added Mr Robinson."We have a dog committee and it is considering approaching Powys council to see if our control area can be extended to include the graveyard. We will monitor the situation and if things don't improve then the committee will make a decision."Dogs are allowed in the graveyard and we have received complaints that they are fouling on people's graves and we've even had cases where people have been tending a loved one's grave only for their dog to mess on a nearby grave."Powys council asked people to report incidents of dog fouling and warned that action would be taken against those flouting the law.The town council imposed its dog ban in March following persistent warnings, campaigns and CCTV to target the culprits.Last year Football Association of Wales Trust development officer Tim Broome said dog owners who allowed their pets to foul on sports pitches should be named and shamed.Mr Broome said some pitches had to be cleared of mess before youth teams could play.His comments followed complaints by Powys sports clubs who said dog fouling was a growing problem in towns like Welshpool and Newtown.</body>

      <title>Plaid call for youth jobless EU cash</title>
      <description>Plaid Cymru Euro MP Jill Evans is calling for European Union money to tackle long-term youth unemployment in Wales.</description>

      <body>Plaid Cymru MEP Jill Evans has called for European Union cash to tackle long-term youth unemployment in Wales.At the party's annual conference she said the EU had committed six billion Euros to areas with more than 25% youth unemployment but Wales is excluded because its figure is 22.2%.She said Plaid would lobby in Europe and elsewhere to access the funding."Ending long-term youth unemployment is crucial in developing a better society for Wales," she said.Speaking before her speech on the second day of the conference in Aberystywth, she said: "The number of young people out of work for more than 12 months has quadrupled in Wales over the past two years - from around 1,400 people to 5,700."Access to funding from this European scheme could be the difference between a lifetime of work and a lifetime out of work for these young people, with all that this entails."Being out of work for a long period damages self-confidence and life chances for the future, meaning that the potential of these young people may never be realised.Addressing party members on Saturday, Ms Evans said there was "nothing to fear" from a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU.The poll has been promised by Prime Minister David Cameron if the Conservatives win the general election in 2015.But Ms Evans said it was vital that the debate in Wales focused on Wales' interests, and that EU membership was clearly of benefit to its people.And she said a number of structural changes were needed to make the EU function more effectively, including a second chamber for the European parliament representing nations and regions.Mrs Evans also predicted Plaid would achieve its "best ever result" in next May's European elections.After lunch the new assembly member for Ynys Mon, who retained the seat for Plaid Cymru emphatically over the summer in a by-election, said the party was aiming to form a majority Welsh government at the 2016 assembly election and "nothing less".Rhun ap Iorwerth made the ambitious claim at his first speech from the conference stage.He accused the other main political parties in Wales of being "UK-focused" while those at Westminster had "no understanding" and "seemingly no real desire" to understand the needs of Wales.Mr ap Iorwerth said the Welsh Labour government was unimaginative and merely following a UK agenda with a "Welsh twist".Later Plaid Cymru parliamentary group leader Elfyn Llwyd called for a new law to protect crime victims from ill-treatment by the justice system.He said robust action was needed to reduce online crimes, including cyber-crimes and trolling, and that anybody charged with serious violent or sexual offences should only be given bail in "very exceptional circumstances".Mr Llwyd, a barrister on the Commons Justice Select Committee, said: "Too often victims are not taken seriously by those charged with investigating the crimes committed against them."This is a problem frequently cited by victims of abusive crimes, including rape and domestic violence."We should be doing all we can to engender confidence in our justice system, so people feel their situations will improve if they report their perpetrators' behaviour."That is why our conference has called on the UK government to introduce a bill of rights for victims, which would bring victims of crime back to the centre of the justice process."Courts should also be compelled to take risks to victims and their children into account when sentencing perpetrators," he argued.On Friday Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood pledged to create an arms-length company to cut energy bills and promised to recruit 1,000 extra doctors, funded by sugary drinks tax, if she is first minister after the next assembly election in 2016.</body>

      <body>For every one person who is happier to splash out at the shops than they were six months ago, there are at least two more who are not, a survey has found.Consumer confidence remained static for more than half of people (56%) according to a Beaufort Research poll of more than 1,000 across Wales.Retailers say good summer weather was a boost to trade.Cardiff Retail Partnership said there was "definitely an air of confidence from consumers".Experts said the mixed findings reflected different economic effects.More than 1,000 people were surveyed last month for the latest quarterly poll, commissioned by Beaufort for the Western Mail.It found:Newport-based University of South Wales business lecturer Dr Jonathan Deacon said the results showed "very subtle improvements" in Wales' economy were being felt in different ways in different places.He said: "Some will feel the benefit earlier than others. It is no surprise places like Cardiff and Aberystwyth - with students and tourism - feel buoyant."They will feel the benefits sooner than in areas like the valleys that are reliant on secondary or primary industries. It takes a while to work through the system."David Hughes-Lewis, of Cardiff Retail Partnership and Jonathan David Jewellers, said his trade was showing a "very good year-on-year rise" which he partly attributed to sunny days.He said: "The weather has been so much better than we had last summer. Clothes stores have enjoyed a good summer. When the sun shines, the tables and chairs in the city centre are full."Everyone is still finding it tough but there is definitely an air of confidence as far as consumers are concerned."He added that he was "cautiously optimistic" that stores could expect good Christmas takings.Chris Mackenzie-grieve, chair of Aberystwyth Chamber of Commerce, which represents about 70 shops and businesses, said Aberystwyth was proving "quite resilient" economically.He said the town benefited from being a "micro climate" with a large student population and Welsh and local government offices in the area.He said: "A lot of it is founded on the public sector which is always a worry with the cuts coming up but generally I get the impression things are picking up."I'm not saying it's anywhere near back to 2007 but my sense is business confidence is picking up."Mr Mackenzie-grieve said one positive indicator was the low retail unit vacancy rate in the town, at around 7%.He said: "Those that become available tend to go fairly quickly. That tells you that people are becoming more confident about the economic environment and are starting to spend a little bit more."It's marginal growth but it's coming back. I'm fairly upbeat."The Beaufort Wales Omnibus survey interviewed a representative sample of 1,019 adults in 69 locations across Wales between 13-24 September 2013. 4.

      <body>Preservation work has started on two buildings at Swansea's historic Hafod copperworks site.The copperworks opened in 1810 and it was the largest copper works in the world during the 19th Century.The remains of the Grade II-listed buildings are on a 12-acre site by the River Tawe and close to Swansea City and the Ospreys' Liberty Stadium home.Work on the former laboratory and power house buildings will help prevent future decay.Rotten timbers are being removed, loose brickwork is being reconstructed and overgrown vegetation is being cleared.The two buildings are among 12 Grade II-listed buildings and structures on the site.Professor Huw Bowen, who is leading the project team on behalf of Swansea University, said: "The Hafod-Morfa copperworks site was once at the epicentre of the world's copper industry."Many thousands of people across Swansea will have family who once worked there but the site had fallen into disrepair over the years, meaning there was a danger its story and legacy would be lost for generations to come."This is why we're now working so closely with Swansea council on a project that will preserve and celebrate the site."The copperworks was owned by the Vivian family and by 1886, Vivian and Sons was employing 3,000 people, of which 1,000 worked at the site.It continued rolling copper until it closed in 1980.Two years ago, Swansea University was named as the city council's preferred partner in developing the 12-acre site.Funding to the tune of £540,000 has come from Welsh heritage body Cadw to restore some of its features and create tourist trails.As well as the preservation works, the first phase has also included the clearance of overgrown vegetation and the opening up of trails and paths for guided tours in future.Information panels detailing the site's history and a piece of public art at the gateway to the site will also be added.Nick Bradley, Swansea council's cabinet member for regeneration, said: "The plan in the long-term is for a mixed-use, heritage-led destination on site that will become a key feature of Swansea's cultural and educational tourism offer."We need to be doing all we can to protect our culture, especially at a time when we're on the shortlist to become UK City of Culture 2017 - a status that could generate millions of pounds for the local economy."</body>

      <description>Scarlets open their Heineken Cup campaign with a win as they cling on for a well-earned 33-26 victory over Harlequins at the Stoop.</description>

      <body>Scarlets opened their Heineken Cup campaign with a thrilling win as three superb tries, combined with dogged defence, overcame Harlequins in London.The Welsh side scored the first 13 points through Rhys Priestland's boot and Rhodri Williams' team score.Scott Williams' sparkling solo score gave Scarlets a healthy half-time lead, before Jordan Williams' dazzling try.Quins' Mike Brown went over with 12 minutes left to close the gap to seven, but the visitors, down to 14, held on.With last year's runners-up Clermont Auvergne and big-spending Racing Metro making up the rest of Pool Four, the result is an immediate boost to Scarlets' chances of making the knockout stages, with Quins' hopes already badly dented.This was a third home defeat of the season and a third straight loss in a stuttering start, and they were immediately put under pressure.The visitors' streetwise tactics of using Priestland's booming kicks to buy field position and then choosing their moment to run the ball paid dividends after just seven minutes when Rhodri Williams rounded off a fine try.The scrum-half's score owed much to the good work of his half-back partner, with Priestland changing the point of attack after Liam Williams fielded a towering kick and then looping round to inject pace and give the scoring pass.The Welsh side's fierce counter-rucking and deft offloading posed Harlequins problems both in and out of possession and Priestland added two penalties before the hosts finally got on the board with a kick from Nick Evans in the 20th minute.The New Zealander's boot put Quins back to within three points when his perfectly weighted chip found a pocket of space behind Liam Williams and a cruel bounce gave Brown a free run under the posts.But the half ended with Bread of Heaven (Cwm Rhondda)  ringing around the stands as Scott Williams invoked memories of his match-winning try against England at neighbouring Twickenham en route to Wales' 2012 Grand Slam.The centre hinted at a pass outside to midfield partner Jonathan Davies to burst through the initial defensive line, before a second dummy fixed Danny Care and allowed him to scamper over unchallenged.Simon Easterby's men were slightly fortunate to be reduced to 14 men for only 10 minutes after prop Samson Lee scraped his studs across the face of Care in apparent pursuit of the ball shortly after the break.Evans made immediate use of the numerical advantage by potting a drop-goal, but Priestland's two penalties, the second after a Quins pack shorn of summer departures James Johnston and Olly Kohn were sent backwards at the scrum, outweighed that effort during Lee's sin-bin period.Quins slowly fought their way into the ascendancy and two more Evans penalties brought them to within seven points at 19-26 with less than 20 minutes left.But Wales Under-20 international Jordan Williams relieved the pressure with a sensational stepping run that took him pinballing through a clutch of defenders to score when apparently pinned to the touchline.It was a try that deserved to win the match and it proved decisive when Brown's dummy and dart for his second score, and Rob Evans' yellow card for persistent infringement, left the away side with some late pressure to withstand.Veteran Paul Sackey had a try disallowed in the left corner for a foot in touch that would have left Evans with a kick for a draw, but Quins were instead left to rue their slow start.Harlequins director of rugby Conor O'Shea: "I'm angry. I thought we were terrible."We made so many basic errors. I'm furious. We can talk about injuries and about various different things but I'm annoyed."When you have a bloke who dances along a touchline to score a try when he's easier to blow into touch, that shouldn't happen."There were some individuals out there who gave everything like Mike Brown, Nick Easter and Chris Robshaw, but it's not a game of touch. At times it looked like that with some of the tries they scored."Harlequins: Brown, Williams, Hopper, Botica, Smith, Evans, Care, Marler, Buchanan, Collier, Merrick, Robson, Fa'asavalu, Robshaw, Easter.Replacements: Walker for Hopper (66), Sackey for Smith (52), Dickson for Care (52), Ward for Buchanan (57), Sinckler for Collier (66), Guest for Merrick (55), Wallace for Fa'asavalu (21).

      <title>Court orders girls' MMR vaccination</title>
      <description>A High Court judge has ruled that two sisters aged 15 and 11 must be given the MMR vaccine, despite their objections, BBC Newsnight learns.</description>

      <body>A judge has ruled that sisters aged 15 and 11 must have the MMR vaccine even though they and their mother do not want it, BBC Newsnight has learned.The High Court decision, made last month, came after the girls' father brought a case seeking vaccination.The parents, now divorced, had agreed when married not to vaccinate the girls in the wake of the MMR controversy.But the discrediting of concerns about an MMR autism link and recent measles outbreaks changed the father's view.This is the third time this issue has come before the court.In 2003 a mother was ordered to have her child immunised against measles, mumps and rubella after the court ruled the benefits of vaccination outweighed the risks. In 2011, children in care were ordered to have the MMR jab against the wishes of their parents.When outlining her decision in the latest case, Mrs Justice Theis emphasised it was a specific case "only concerned with the welfare needs of these children", but lawyers say as one of a series it confirms there is no longer any debate about the benefits of the vaccine.Measles is a highly contagious disease characterised by a high fever and a rash.In one in 15 cases it can lead to severe complications, such as pneumonia, and in a very small number of cases it can cause encephalitis - inflammation of the brain - which can cause brain damage or even death.MMR is a combined vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella, three common infectious diseases of childhood. It was introduced in the UK in 1988 to replace single vaccines for each disease.The first MMR vaccine is given as a single injection to babies as part of their routine vaccination schedule, usually within a month of their first birthday, then a second injection of the vaccine, known as the MMR booster, is given before starting school.The first gives about 95% protection against measles, while two doses give 99-100% protection.In 1998, a study by Dr Andrew Wakefield was published in the respected medical journal The Lancet raising the possibility that the MMR jab was linked to autism and bowel disease.The report and the media furore that followed prompted many parents to decide against having their children vaccinated with the three-in-one injection, including the parents of the two girls at the heart of this case.The elder daughter was given the first injection, but not the booster vaccine; the younger daughter did not receive any vaccinations at all - decisions made jointly by both parents at the time.However, in 2010 Dr Wakefield's research was found by the General Medical Council to have been "dishonest" and has since been entirely dismissed.The father of the two girls says that this change, combined with an outbreak of measles in Swansea late last year, changed his mind in January 2013 about whether his daughters should be given the MMR jab. He says he was worried these diseases could have serious consequences.According to the text of the court decision, seen by BBC Newsnight, the father's solicitor wrote to the girls' mother in January seeking her agreement that they should now be vaccinated, and saying that if she did not agree he would take the matter to court.The mother did not agree and the matter eventually came before the Family Division of the High Court.A court-appointed welfare officer who spoke extensively to the girls said that neither of them wanted the vaccination.The children were particularly concerned about the ingredients in the vaccine, which include animal-based materials; one of the girls is a vegan.However, the officer said that when she asked them what would happen if they became ill with measles, mumps or rubella and needed medicine, they clearly had not thought about what the ingredients in that medicine might be.The welfare officer said both children had been strongly influenced by their mother, who was very anxious about the jab.Mrs Justice Theis decided that it was in the best interests of the children that they were vaccinated."I am aware that this is against the girls' wishes but that it is not the only factor," she wrote. "The court also has to consider their level of understanding of the issues involved and what factors have influenced their views. I do not consider there is a balanced level of understanding by them of the issues involved."The mother's lawyer Philippa Dolan told Newsnight that the girls had not yet been vaccinated despite the deadline to do so having passed on Thursday.She said: "There are practical difficulties in enforcing the order and that is at the moment an ongoing issue. There's not a legal deadline that's a serious issue the parents are in discussion and everyone hopes it will be resolved without any more litigation."</body>

      <description>Exeter score six tries to beat Cardiff Blues, who claim a bonus point, in their Heineken Cup pool opener at Sandy Park.</description>

      <body>Exeter racked up six tries in a rampant opening Heineken Cup win over a fitful Cardiff Blues at Sandy Park.The Chiefs had a bonus point inside half an hour as Tom Johnson, Dean Mumm, Matt Jess and Fetu'u Vainikolo scored.A fifth try for Ben White made it 36-3 at half-time, but the Blues hit back on the resumption to claim a losing bonus point for scoring four of their own.Lloyd Williams, Robin Copeland, Alex Cuthbert and Harry Robinson all crossed to earn a measure of respectability.But a penalty from replacement Henry Slade five minutes from time saw Exeter - who were reduced to 13 men after two yellow cards inside a minute early in the final quarter - have the last word.They will head to Glasgow next weekend in buoyant mood after their best European win to date, while the Blues must regroup swiftly for the visit of defending champions Toulon after an embarrassingly one-sided first half on Sunday.In a debut campaign last season that included two narrow losses to three-time champions Leinster and home-and-away wins over the Scarlets, the Chiefs showed a relish to broaden their horizons.Their early ambition - attacking from deep with ball in hand - almost cost them when Gareth Steenson's pass was intercepted by Cory Allen in the sixth minute, but the Blues centre could not hold onto the ball.Undeterred, the Chiefs launched another multi-phase attack which ended in a try for England international Johnson, one of four capped players in the home line-up compared with the 13 on duty for the Blues.The flanker was driven over by centre Jason Shoemark from close range and, with next to no possession, the Blues were grateful for Leigh Halfpenny's long-range penalty to make it 5-3.It proved a momentary aberration though as the one-way traffic continued for the rest of the half.With fly-half Steenson controlling matters and full-back Phil Dollman a constant threat with his incisive running and support work, Exeter were in total command.Steenson kicked a penalty before a whirlwind spell of four tries in 14 minutes left the visitors reeling.First Exeter were allowed to take a line-out unopposed and Australia lock Mumm broke away from the back of a ruck to cruise through a gaping hole for his fourth try of the season.The Blues were unable to contain the pace and verve of Exeter's attack, and after Dollman's break, right wing Jess exploited a splintered defence and more weak tackling for the third try.Tonga international Vainikolo, making his first competitive start for Exeter, stepped inside four defenders to score the fourth.Flanker White, discarded by the Blues two years ago, could scarcely conceal his delight as he dived over with barely a hand laid on him for the fifth.Steenson's first conversion came back off an upright, but he landed his next four with aplomb as the Chiefs established a 36-3 half-time cushion.The only downside was seeing try-scorer Johnson limp off, but they barely missed a beat initially.Steenson's neat dummy and dart saw Whitten cross for the sixth try 12 minutes into the second half.As Steenson's conversion came back off an upright for a second time, Wales and Lions wing Cuthbert took a frustrated kick at the rebounding ball and proceeded to fall over, neatly encapsulating the Blues' humiliation.But as Exeter, perhaps inevitably, stepped off the gas, the Blues rallied with two tries in four minutes, scrum-half Williams scampering over and replacement back-rower Copeland bounding through another big hole.Halfpenny converted both and suddenly there was further cause for optimism as Exeter were reduced to 13 men inside a minute, with Whitten - for a deliberate knock-on - and replacement Sireli Naqelevuki, for a high tackle on Robinson, sent to the sin-bin.The Blues exploited their numerical advantage as Cuthbert crossed in the right corner and Robinson darted over on the opposite flank.They created two further chances to increase anxiety in the home ranks but Exeter composed themselves to finish the job.Exeter head coach Rob Baxter:"In the first half we played with real intent and the attitude that we took on to the pitch following last week was absolutely fantastic - not just to attack the game but also the physicality and strength of the carries."Obviously the battle for us is to keep the quality for longer periods. When you go down to 13 men you put yourself under a bit of pressure and we got ourselves down to 13 pretty unnecessarily. That flipped the whole game."Blues director of rugby Phil Davies:"We didn't do anything that we said we would do inthe first half, particularly for our kicking game, and that gave them too many opportunities to come back at us."I think we had to make 100 tackles and we missed 20 and that is not good enough at this level."We have to give Exeter credit for the way that they played but we had far more control on the game in the second half. To get four tries was pleasing to give us some momentum going into next week."Exeter Chiefs: Phil Dollman, Matt Jess, Ian Whitten, Jason Shoemark, Fetu'u Vainikolo, Gareth Steenson, Dave Lewis; Brett Sturgess, Chris Whitehead, Hoani Tui, Dean Mumm (capt), Damian Welch, Tom Johnson, Ben White, Dave EwersReplacements: Jack Yeandle for Whitehead (48), Carl Rimmer for Tui (51), Don Armand for Welch (62), Kai Horstmann for Johnson (30), Haydn Thomas for Lewis (48), Henry Slade for Steenson (56), Sireli Naqelevuki for Shoemark (57)Not Used: Ben Moon.Sin Bin: Whitten (61), Naqelevuki (62).Cardiff Blues: Leigh Halfpenny, Alex Cuthbert, Cory Allen, Dafydd Hewitt, Harry Robinson, Rhys Patchell, Lloyd Williams; Gethin Jenkins, Matthew Rees (c), Taufa'ao Filise, Bradley Davies, Filo Paulo, Josh Navidi, Sam Warburton, Andries PretoriusReplacements: Marc Breeze for Rees (77), Sam Hobbs for Jenkins (76), Scott Andrews for Filise (51), Lou Reed for Paulo (51), Robin Copeland for Pretorius (51), Lewis Jones for Patchell (76), Gareth Davies for L.

      <title>Cap council tax, Welsh Tories urge</title>
      <description>Council tax should be capped in Wales to prevent the cost of cuts being passed onto "hardworking people", say the Conservatives.</description>

      <body>Council tax in Wales should be capped to prevent the cost of cuts being passed onto residents, the Conservatives have said.They want the Welsh government to limit the tax from next April after its draft budget saw council funding slashed.The shadow finance minister wants people protected from "the threat of mega council tax rises".But the Welsh government said council tax should be set at a reasonable level and accused the Tories of "hypocrisy".Ministers have previously ruled out caps and set an informal limit of a 5% rise.The call from shadow finance minister Janet Finch-Saunders AM comes at the start of a week which will see all 22 local councils find out the details of how much money they will receive from the Welsh government.She has previously called on local authorities not to cut frontline services or increase council tax bills.Ms Finch-Saunders said: "Over the past three years, hardworking families in Wales have faced the highest council tax bills in the UK because Labour refused to pass on the Conservative council tax freeze."Carwyn Jones's Labour government opposed legislation to allow taxpayers local referendums on excessive council tax rises, so hard-pressed families have no protection, such as that introduced by Conservatives in England, from excessive tax rises."Ms Finch-Saunders called on the government to consider a cap on council tax hikes to "shield hardworking people from the threat of mega council tax rises".Local government settlements are being announced on Wednesday, with each council finding out how much funding they will receive, allowing them to work out how much council tax they will need to charge.Councils already know it will be a tough year ahead, with one senior council figure saying local authorities were in a "very dark place," with at least two facing a possible bail-out.Finance Minister Jane Hutt announced in the draft budget on Tuesday that the local government budget would fall from £4.648bn to £4.466bn in 2014, a cut of 3.91% in cash terms or 5.81% in real terms.She said last week the government had been "supporting and cushioning" local government for the past three years, and that the priority was to protect health, schools and universal benefits such as free prescriptions, school breakfasts and bus passes for older people.A spokesman for Local Government Minister Lesley Griffiths said: "The Welsh Tories are deliberately deceiving the people of Wales."Their hypocrisy knows no bounds. By their own admission, the Tories would slash a whopping 12.5% from local authority budgets next year - a cut that would create unprecedented damage on public services all over Wales."Her spokesman added: "We would expect levels of council tax to be set at a reasonable level, taking into account the challenging financials circumstances for families across Wales."The one thing Wales can be certain of is, if the Tories had their way, vital services across the country would collapse overnight. Mercifully, we are not facing that scenario."The Welsh Local Government Association has previously said councils could not continue delivering the range of services they currently provided, adding there would be a "massive impact for the Welsh public".Chief executive Steve Thomas said once the settlements were known, he feared there would be "more pressure on the council tax".</body>

      <body>It will be a "disaster" for Wales if borrowing powers recommended by the Silk Commission are not devolved, First Minister Carwyn Jones has warned.He told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement that without more powers to borrow money, planned £1bn M4 improvements "will not happen".Mr Jones will raise his concerns with the UK Government in Downing Street later this week.Last month, David Cameron denied blocking further devolution.The prime minister told BBC Wales he was attracted by the idea of the Welsh government being able to raise some of its budget.But he said "the bubble in Cardiff is completely obsessed by powers" whereas the real issue was economic recovery.Almost a year ago, the commission set up by the UK government and chaired by former assembly clerk Paul Silk, said ministers in Cardiff should be given the power to vary some tax rates.A decision had been initially expected in the spring.The first minister was asked if he thought that the Silk recommendations had been permanently kicked into the long grass.Mr Jones said: "It'd be far better for everybody if they were simply to say - yes we'll accept the Silk recommendations, we can all move on."I can then say to people in Scotland - this is an example of devolution working and why independence isn't needed. At the moment from a Scottish perspective, all they can see is devolution being blocked by UK government in London."Mr Jones told the programme it would be a disaster for Wales if the Silk proposals were not implemented."We literally could not do things. We could not improve the M4 without borrowing powers - it will not happen."The proposals to ease motorway congestion around Newport, with options of routes swinging south of the existing M4, are currently out to consultation.Chancellor George Osborne has called it one of the most important road schemes in the UK.But there is increasing frustration at waiting for a decision on whether the Welsh government can have the powers to borrow money to finance it."If we don't get sense on this then the M4 relief road can't even be considered, whereas it could be, if it was being built in England, Scotland or Northern Ireland," said Mr Jones."Now, that is for our business community an enormous competitive disadvantage, that we cannot do things to improve jobs in Wales, to improve the economy of Wales, simply because of what's happening in Wales."Why should Wales be discriminated against in that way? That's the point I'll be making."Mr Jones will be attending a meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee Plenary meeting on Wednesday.</body>

      <body>Energy giant SSE has been accused of being "out of touch" after announcing a hike in gas and electricity prices.The energy giant SSE, which owns Welsh supplier Swalec, announced it was putting up prices by an average of 8.2% next month.But Shadow Welsh Secretary Owen Smith said the rise was "breathtaking," given the difficulties customers were facing.The company blamed the rising cost of wholesale energy and the cost of delivering it.SSE also said it had to pay for more infrastructure, for UK government schemes to help those most in need and green levies.Its price rises will affect about 4.4 million domestic electricity customers and 2.9 million domestic gas customers in the UK.The other big five energy suppliers are expected to follow suit.The UK government said it was disappointed but said greater competition was the long term answer.Labour flicked the switch on the debate when the party promised to freeze energy prices for two years if they won the next general election.Mr Smith said: "It's breathtaking that they can be so out of touch with the difficulty that consumers, electricity customers, gas customers, are experiencing in Wales right now and that, on the back of making record profits last year, they can tell us they need to put up prices by a further 8.2%, having put them up 9% last year."Mr Smith, who was speaking on BBC Radio Wales, said communities and and society in Wales was suffering at the moment and the energy companies were making it worse.Labour leader Ed Miliband, who pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election, described SSE's price rise as a "scandal". He accused the UK government of "letting energy companies get away with this".SSE's Will Morris said on Thursday he understood customers' frustration."We're sorry we have to do this," he said."We've done as much as we could to keep prices down, but the reality is that buying wholesale energy in global markets, delivering it to customers' homes, and government-imposed levies collected through bills - endorsed by all the major parties - all cost more than they did last year."</body>

      <body>Liverpool Academy defender Lloyd Jones has rejected a possible Wales future, telling them he wants to play for England instead.Wales Under-21 head coach Geraint Williams made the announcement ahead of their European Championship qualifier against San Marino on Tuesday.Liverpool's website describes Jones, who joined their Under-16s from Plymouth in 2011, as a Welshman.Jones, 18, has played for Wales at Under-17 and Under-18 level.His decision comes in the wake of Williams stating that striker Tom Bradshaw is no longer available to Wales after the 21-year-old elected to play for Shrewsbury Town instead of playing in the Wales U21 2-0 win over Lithuania U21 on Friday.Wales U21 take on their San Marino counterparts at Bangor's Book People Stadium with a 14:00 BST kick-off.</body>

      <title>Hook not focusing on Wales chances</title>
      <description>James Hook says he is concentrating on playing for Perpignan and hopes his chances of a Wales recall will take care of itself.</description>

      <body>James Hook has said he is not focusing on his chances of a Wales recall for next month's autumn internationals.The Perpignan utility back has only started one international since 2011.He converted his own try in the first minute of Saturday's 27-22 Heineken Cup defeat at Gloucester and said: "I want to keep on playing for Wales."It is important for me to keep playing well for Perpignan and not think too much about Wales. Hopefully that will take care of itself by playing well."He added: "If they are going to notice you it is going to be in this competition."I think every player in Wales who is there or thereabouts know they are under the microscope especially in the Heineken Cup, so you don't need the coaches to tell you."The 28-year-old has won 70 caps for his country, but his only start since the 2011 World Cup was against the Barbarians in 2012.Other Welsh players have been linked with moves abroad and Hook told BBC Radio Wales: "It is a personal thing. They have got to look where they are in their careers and how old they are."At the age of 22 or 23 I wasn't ready to move to France, but when I came to 26 it was a perfect opportunity to move my family."It is an individual thing and they must think about the balance of the team they are going to and if they can get selected for internationals."Hook, captaining Perpignan, opened the scoring in his side's loss at Kingsholm and he said: "It was nice to get an opportunity so early and I enjoyed playing full-back tonight. I'm obviously happy with my performance but it was so frustrating at the end."We were holding on in fairness in the last four, five, 10 minutes but we could have buried the game early in the second half."We had an opportunity in the top left-hand corner which probably would have sealed the game."The French side's other group opponents are Edinburgh and Munster and Hook added: "It is a tough group but it's wide open."The two home teams won and there were bonus points picked up by both losing teams and it will go right down to the wire."</body>

      <description>Cardiff Blues boss Phil Davies wants to take the momentum from his side's second-half display at Exeter into next week's game with Toulon.</description>

      <body>Cardiff Blues boss Phil Davies tried to take the positives out of his side's 44-29 Heineken Cup defeat at Exeter.The Blues earned a losing bonus point after a positive second-half display in which they hit back from 36-3 down."In the second half we were a bit more like it and I was pleased to get that point," he told BBC Radio Wales."We had far more control of the game in the second half, far more momentum and we are happy with that. But overall we are not pleased with the outcome."Exeter scored six tries in the match and earned their own bonus point in the first half-hour.Director of rugby Davies added: "We didn't do anything we really said we would do in the first half, particularly from our kicking game, and that gave them too many opportunities to come back at us."I think we had to make 100 tackles and missed 20 and that's not good enough at this level, although you have got to give credit to Exeter who are a good attacking side."We can't do anything about it now, but we could do something at half-time which we did and at least we have got a bit of momentum going into Toulon next week."We want to start and play for 80 minutes in the way we played in the last 40 today."We will get a bit of work done on the defence. We have been working hard on it - you wouldn't perhaps think that in the first half - but we have put a lot of effort and work into it and that's got to continue and we have got to get back on the bike and move forward again."Davies denied that the result had left him under any pressure, although the Blues next face defending Heineken Cup champions Toulon at the Arms Park next Saturday."Everything always comes back to me," he said. "We are all in this together and Exeter are a tough nut to crack."We have just got to do what we have got to do and making rash decisions and pointing fingers is no good."We have got to stick together and get on with it and we will do."</body>

      <body>One hundred years ago, the UK's worst mining disaster happened when 440 people were killed by an explosion which ripped through the coal mine at Senghenydd, near Caerphilly.It was the morning of Tuesday 14 October 1913. The 950 miners working at the Universal Colliery had just started their shift.Among them was Thomas Jones, who was working on the Nine Feet seam.At 8.10am he heard "a roar or rumble… coming from some distance" and then a terrific and distinct bang. Then the roar went on, "but more vigorously than previously."Miner William Vizard was loading rubbish into one of the mine's trams (rail carts) when it happened."I shouted into the next heading because I knew the man that worked there and his two sons. Not a sound, nor a light. Well, I thought, something has happened. So I went on creeping out to the double-parting."When I got to the straight to go to the double-parting, I could hear a boy shouting for his father: 'Where's my father? I want my father.'"I went on down to the parting. There, I felt a horse down. Then I felt a man. Felt his legs. I felt his face. He had his scarf over his mouth."And he spoke to me. And we knew one another's voices. Of course, I knew him. 'It's an explosion,' he said."The blast was so strong, it lifted a two-ton lift cage hundreds of yards up one of the mineshafts into the headgear. Windows were smashed on Coronation Terrace, half a mile away and the blast was heard many miles beyond that.First on the scene at the pithead was Mr Shaw, the mine manager, who had been in the lamp room at the surface when the explosion occurred.According to the inquiry following the disaster:"He was joined by Mr Thomas, the overman, and together they got into the cage at the top of the upcast shaft, examined the air for a distance of 50 yards and found it foul with smoke and fumes."Signals were being sent from below, so, being joined by others, they descended the shaft. When half-way down, they saw the body of a man in a tram in the upcoming cage with his legs hanging on the crossbars. This man had been practically blown into the tub in the cage at the pit bottom."Underground, the doors on the west and east side were on fire, but the scene on the east side looked less severe.The explosion had been caused by a build up of firedamp (methane) gas. The blast had disturbed coal dust on the mine floor, raising clouds that then also caught alight, spreading the destruction further.The fire was mainly confined to the west side of the mine, with the east side blocked with noxious gases. The result was over 400 men trapped underground.Mr Thomas described how when he worked his way along towards the west "It was exactly like looking into a furnace."The first rescuers on the scene battled to control the fire, initially hampered by difficulties with water supplies and a lack of breathing apparatus on site."It was like a living hell," one of the rescue team told The South Wales Daily News. "The heat was simply intense. Scorching. It was like a street of fire."The blast had brought the whole community to the pithead."Within an hour, hundreds of men, women and children had assembled at the pit head, too eager and anxious for tears, and many inarticulate with fear of early confirmation of the doom of husbands and sons in the great underworld," the newspaper reported.As a clearer picture emerged, it was apparent that miners on the west side who were not killed by the explosion, were trapped behind a wall of fire, and were likely to be killed by the noxious gases.Miners from the east side were gradually returned to safety at the top.Rescuers battled on for days to recover the wounded and the dead. Six days later, the death toll had reached 439 mine workers and one member of the rescue team. Eighteen men came out alive.The official inquiry into the disaster heard 13 days of evidence, with 21,837 questions put to witnesses. It closed on 21 February, 1914.The report failed to identify a definite cause, however it was agreed the explosion involved highly-flammable firedamp gas found in the area being ignited.It was clear there had been several breaches of the safety measures introduced by the Coal Mines Act of 1911, including ventilation not meeting required standards, inadequate removal of coal dust from the roof and sides, the use of "open sparking" signalling equipment and inadequate fire provisions.Shockingly, it was not the first time such a tragedy had struck at Senghenydd - an explosion on 21 May 1901 saw 81 miners lose their lives and only one man saved.But lessons were not learned. The 1914 report stated: "I should have thought, in view of the fact that the colliery was such a gassy one, and it had already been devastated by an explosion, that the management would have made arrangements for a supply of water adequate to meet an emergency of the kind that actually occurred."It said: "Some of the breaches, compared with those to which I have already given especial prominence may appear trivial, but taken in the aggregate they point to a disquieting laxity in the management of the mine."Both the mine manager Edward Shaw and the owners, Lewis Merthyr Consolidated Collieries, were prosecuted. Shaw was fined £24, prompting a local newspaper headline "Miners' Lives at 1s 1½d". Today, that sum would equate to around five and a half pence.The mine owners were fined £10 with £5 5s costs for not fitting the required reversible ventilation fans.William Hyatt, a miner who survived the explosion, said: "My father always said there was more fuss if a horse was killed underground than if a man was killed. Men came cheap - they had to buy horses."The impact on the community was devastating. It left behind 205 widows, 542 children and 62 dependent parents.The Universal Colliery closed in 1928. A memorial to those who died in the two explosions was erected on the site in 1981. On the centenary of the disaster, the people of Senghenydd will unveil a new memorial to commemorate the event.</body>
