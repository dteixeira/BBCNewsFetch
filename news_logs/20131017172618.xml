      <body>The Chancellor, George Osborne, has announced that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.The announcement also said that Chinese firms might eventually be allowed to take majority stakes in British nuclear plants.Mr Osborne made the announcement on the last day of a trade visit to China.The first China deal could be as early as next week, with the go ahead for a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site.Also on Thursday, a report commissioned for the prime minister warned of a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years.The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits".Supply is expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15.Most existing coal-fired plants are expected to be closed in 2015 to meet European Union pollution directives, while many gas-fired power plants are not being used at the moment because gas is so expensive.These would take time and money to bring back on stream.The Hinkley C project, in Somerset, will be the first new nuclear power station since 1995.Hinkley C's construction will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EDF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs.EDF has been negotiating with three Chinese nuclear giants on the Hinkley C project - CGN, CNNC and SNPTC - all of which have been seen by the chancellor this week.Our business editor, Robert Peston, says he has been told that one or two of these will end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C.A DECC spokesperson said talks about a contract were underway: "Negotiations remain ongoing between the government and EDF on the potential terms of an investment contract for Hinkley Point C. No agreement has as yet been reached."A contract will only be offered if it is value for money, fair and affordable, in line with government policy on no public subsidy for new nuclear and consistent with state-aid rules."Mr Osborne made the announcement while on a visit to a nuclear plant in southern China on Thursday which is itself a collaboration between EDF and the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG).He said: "Today is another demonstration of the next big step in the relationship between Britain and China, the world's oldest civil nuclear power and the world's fastest growing civil nuclear power."The memorandum of understanding also includes roles for British companies in China's nuclear programme.China has 17 nuclear reactors in operation, which provide about 1% of its electricity production capacity.In the future, Chinese firms might be allowed more than just minority stakes in UK plants. The government said that "over time, stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes".At the weekend, the Energy Minister, Ed Davey, said he believed that a "massive" wave of investment from China, Japan and Korea would secure UK's power supply into the future.Securing future energy supplies is a major challenge.A portion of energy bills is being diverted to alternative energy investment in wind farms and solar energy.But these, renewable, energy sources cannot provide enough power for the country's energy needs.The industry regulator, Ofgem, has also warned of the "unprecedented challenge" to secure power supplies.It said spare electricity power production capacity could fall to 2% by 2015, increasing the risk of blackouts.</body>

      <title>British Gas raises prices by 9.2%</title>

      <body>British Gas is to increase prices for domestic customers, with a dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2% from 23 November.The increase, which will affect nearly eight million households in the UK, includes an 8.4% rise in gas prices and a 10.4% increase in electricity prices.The company said it "understands the frustration" of prices rising faster than incomes. The average annual household bill will go up by £123.PM David Cameron has urged consumers to switch suppliers for the best deal.Energy Minister Ed Davey has described the latest price rise as "extremely disappointing news" for customers.Rival SSE has already announced an 8.2% increase in bills from 15 November.On average, customers will see a dual-fuel bill increase to £1,444 a year.However, there are significant regional variations. On average, the biggest increase in a dual-fuel bill is an 11.2% rise in the north of Scotland, in the Scottish Hydro Electric region. The smallest is a 6.8% increase in the south west of England.The company said that the cost of buying energy on the global markets, delivering gas and electricity to customers' homes, and the government's "green" levies, were all factors in the decision to put up prices."I know these are difficult times for many customers and totally understand the frustration that so many household costs keep on rising when incomes are not keeping pace," said Ian Peters, managing director of British Gas Residential Energy."We haven't taken this decision lightly, but what is pushing up energy prices at the moment are costs that are not all directly under our control."The company, which operates as Scottish Gas in Scotland, said it made a profit of five pence in the pound after tax.British Gas, the UK's biggest energy supplier, said in May that a profit boost would be used to delay future price rises. This came because customers used 18% more gas in the first four months of the year owing to the cold weather.At the time, a spokesman said: "We will use that [cold weather benefit] to effectively hold prices for as long as possible."Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%.Caroline Flint, shadow energy secretary, said: "These latest price rises show clearer than ever why Labour's price freeze is needed." Party leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election.But the prime minister branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas.Mr Cameron also said he was disappointed with the British Gas' announcement."I would encourage customers who are not happy with the service they're getting, are not happy with the prices, to go to the switching sites online and see whether they can get a better deal," he said.Pressed on whether the government could do more to tackle the underlying issues, Mr Cameron added: "What we can do, which is what we are doing, is to try to get new suppliers into the market."Energy Minister Ed Davey also described the latest price rise as "extremely disappointing news" for customers of British Gas. He questioned the claim that costs imposed by the government were increasing as much as bills and told the Commons that unhappy consumers should consider switching suppliers.However, industry analysts expect other suppliers to announce price rises in the coming weeks, which could affect consumers' switching decisions."The question now is whether it will be a trickle or a stampede. However, the fact is that households will be struggling to afford to keep warm this winter," said Tom Lyon, of price comparison website Uswitch.com.Personal finance commentator and campaigner Martin Lewis said it was important that, if consumers do decide to switch, they should focus on fixed rate tariffs.Because only two of the energy companies have currently put their prices up, those who switch now are likely to be hit with price rises if they switch to another variable rate tariff.He said people can "beat the price hikes" by going to fixed tariffs.Adam Scorer, of watchdog Consumer Futures, said: "We would urge anyone worried about their energy costs to shop around to try to find a better deal and ensure they are on the cheapest payment method, such as direct debit."There are also some discounted insulation and heating measures available and we would encourage people to take advantage of this to cut their bills."Mr Davey said that British Gas would need to justify its decision "openly and transparently".Many of British Gas's customers made their annoyance at the price rise known during a Twitter question and answer session with customer service Bert Pijls earlier this afternoon.</body>

      <body>SNP leader Alex Salmond opened his party's conference by saying he believed people would choose the "hope of yes" rather than the "fears of no".The first minister's speech comes with the Scottish independence referendum 11 months away.He told delegates in Perth that Thursday 18 September 2014 was Scotland's "date with destiny".On that day, voters will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country".Mr Salmond said that the people of Scotland had their biggest opportunity to choose a better future.He told delegates on the first day of the four-day conference: "I believe that people will choose the hope of a yes vote, rather than the fear offered by no."And no-one now denies the reality that Scotland has got what it takes to be a successful, independent country."We know that 'project fear' - as people in the no campaign christened it - will say anything to talk down Scotland's abilities."They peddle nonsense such as mobile phone roaming charges after independence, the threat to annex Faslane, no whisky in embassies - nonsense which even they are forced to retract."The party leader went on to say that people in the no camp could not deny the economic viability and potential of "people-talented, resource-rich Scotland".He added that per head of population, Scotland had more top universities than any other country; was the EU's largest oil producer and had a thriving creative industries sector.Mr Salmond said: "When even the most bitter opponents of Scottish independence agree that Scotland has got what it takes, then it's clear that the only thing people have to fear is 'project fear' itself."At the start of his conference speech, Mr Salmond addressed the on-going dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant.He confirmed that he would be holding further talks with both the facility's operator Ineos and the Unite union.The facility remains shut down despite Unite calling off a planned strike.</body>

      <description>Working parents in Britain no longer earn enough to "escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn warns in his first report.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24553611</url>

      <body>Working parents in Britain "simply do not earn enough to escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn has warned.Two-thirds of poor children are now from families where an adult works, his report found.Many low and middle-income children face being "worse off" than their parents because of falling earnings and rising prices, Mr Milburn added.Wealthier pensioners' benefits should be cut and minimum pay raised, he said.The former Labour health secretary suggested some benefits currently protected from cuts - such as free TV licences and winter fuel allowances for pensioners - could be means tested in order to share the burden of austerity more fairly.But a spokesman for David Cameron said: "The prime minister believes it is right to make commitments to pensioners in relationship to state provision."The government has pledged to safeguard such benefits until the next general election.In its first report, the government's Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission warned the target of ending child poverty by 2020 would "in all likelihood be missed by a considerable margin" - leaving as many as two million children in poverty.Poverty is defined as having a household income that is less than 60% of the national median income.The latest government figures on poverty, released in June, show the median UK household income for 2011/2012 was £427 a week - 60% of that figure was £256 a week.In that year, 17% of children, or 2.3 million, were classed as being in poverty while 15% of working-age adults, or 5.6 million, were in poverty.For pensioners, meanwhile, that figures was 16% - or 1.9 million.The report said Britain still had "high levels of child poverty and low levels of social mobility" with a rising number of children in "absolute poverty" coming from working families.Two thirds of children officially deemed as being poor now came from a family where at least one parent was working - and in three out of four of those cases, at least one of their parents was working full time, the report found.It also said the "twin problems of high youth unemployment and falling living standards" were storing up problems for the future.Among its key recommendations the report urged the government to:"Just as the UK government has focused on reducing the country's financial deficit it now needs to redouble its efforts to reduce our country's fairness deficit," the report said.Single mother Judith Healy, who works from home as a telemarketer, said that, while her wages had not gone up, her expenses had continued to increase.She said she was worried about paying energy bills this winter."We didn't ask to get in this situation, we are doing the best that we can in the circumstances that we have and that's really what it's about - it's survival now," she told BBC News.Mr Milburn told the BBC: "Today child poverty is a problem for working families rather than the workless or the work-shy."Around five million people in the country, mainly women, were earning less than the living wage, which is about £7.45 an hour outside of London, he said."These are the people frankly who do all the right things, they go out to work, they stand on their own two feet, they look after their families - they're the strivers not the shirkers - and yet they're all too often the forgotten people of Britain and I think they desperately need a new deal."Mr Milburn said that while ministers and employers could do more, it was unrealistic to expect the government to continue topping up low pay using working tax credits.He advocated a scheme for pairing bright children with the best teachers in an effort to raise attainment.Mr Milburn has previously said social mobility - the idea that individuals can better themselves in terms of educational opportunity, job prospects and salaries from one generation to the next - is "flat-lining".Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg welcomed the report, but warned that "punishing pensioners isn't going to help a single child achieve more in life".Enver Solomon, of the National Children's Bureau charity, said the report was "a wake-up call for all political parties by stating that our country is dramatically polarised between the haves and have- nots"."As the commission states, there is an urgent need to rebalance the distribution of resources so that the burden of austerity is more equally shared," he said.Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said the "powerful report" showed "ordinary families' living standards [were being] squeezed and social divisions [were] deepening as a result of this government's decisions to put a privileged few first".On Wednesday, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed the number of unemployed people in the UK fell by 18,000 to 2.49 million in the June-August period.</body>

      <body>Gloria de Piero, the shadow minister for women and equalities, has accused a news agency of trying to obtain topless pictures of her taken when she was 15.In a blog post, the Labour MP said the agency claimed to be acting on behalf of a national newspaper and was offering thousands of pounds to people who might have copies of the pictures.She would find it "humiliating" if they were published, she told the BBC.She had grown up in poverty and had posed topless for the money, she added."It's part of me, it's part of my life, it's part of my story," she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour."I've got an amazing mum and dad, but after the age of about 10, no-one worked in my household due to my father's ill health."My parents had jobs, they never had careers, and they were very, very ambitious for their daughter to have a better life than them."The Ashfield MP said she had played truant on days when pupils were able to wear their own clothes, because she was ashamed of her wardrobe."I wanted some money, like my friends," she said of her decision to pose topless."There are reasons why I thought that they might be a way out for me, but I would respectfully say that I hope they are not published."I would find it embarrassing, humiliating."The existence of the pictures "says something about poverty, growing up in poverty", she added."I'm not going to be a victim here," she said, adding that she did not want to see politics full of people "who, at 15, are thinking 'Ooh, I might be a politician one day'"."Goodness, if someone had suggested that to me, at 15, I'd have thought they were absolutely barking."In her blog, she elaborated: "I don't think anyone wants politics to be open only to those people who were planning their political careers in their teens. I would like to see a politics that represents our country, including many more women from all walks of life, and that is something I am passionately committed to help bring about."No one should have to worry that something they did when they were young might prevent them from serving their community or getting involved in politics at a local or national level."Ms de Piero concluded: "It is now time to call off the hunt for these pictures and let me get on with the job I was elected to do, representing the people of Ashfield and serving in the shadow cabinet."</body>

      <title>Housing benefit review begins</title>
      <description>The government has commissioned independent firms to conduct research into the impact of its changes to housing benefit rules.</description>

      <body>A government commissioned review by independent firms has begun into the impact of housing benefit changes.Under reforms that took effect in April, council or housing association tenants of working age will lose some housing benefit if they are deemed to have more bedrooms than they need.The independent review of the policy was promised when the bill became law.Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was "responsible" to check on how any new policy worked in practice.In an exchange in the House of Commons on Tuesday deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman claimed that "for 96% of [affected] tenants, there is no smaller home to go to".Mr Clegg told her: "Lots of wildly different figures have been cited about the policy's impact. That is why we are commissioning independent research to understand its impact."I suspect that it varies enormously between one part of the country and another, and one local authority and another."He was asked about the review during his weekly phone-in on London's LBC radio, saying: "What I confirmed in the House of Commons is something that is not new, it's something that we announced back in March.With a "big policy like this, it'd be irresponsible for a government to say 'oh well, it's happening' and not work out or try and assess how it's actually being implemented on the ground", he said."So we've commissioned a number of independent bodies to provide an ongoing review about exactly how it's unfolding on the ground. The picture is really quite unclear at the moment."Nick Clegg's fellow Liberal Democrats signalled their dissatisfaction with the changes - called a bedroom tax by critics and a spare room subsidy by supporters - when they voted for a review of the policy at their party conference in September.A government spokesman said: "The Department of Work and Pensions routinely commissions research on their new policies."The deputy prime minister was referring to evaluation work already being carried out by an independent consortium into this policy."The research is being carried out by Ipsos-MORI and the Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research, a division of the University of Cambridge.The initial findings will be available in 2014 and the final report in late 2015, according to the Department of Work and Pensions.</body>

      <body>Lord West, the Labour peer and former security minister, has revealed that he was court-martialled about 30 years ago for losing confidential material.The former First Sea Lord and head of the navy was commenting on the government's move to simplify how government documents are classified.The designations Unclassified, Protect, Restricted and Confidential are to go, but Secret and Top Secret are to stay.The peer said it was a subject that went "straight to my heart".On the BBC's Daily Politics programme, he explained: "Some thirty years ago I was court-martialled for losing something that was classified, so as you can no doubt imagine, I pay particular attention to classification of these issues."The new regime will have just three classifications: Official, Secret and Top Secret.Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude noted that the previous system had been designed "decades ago".The reforms would "speed up decisions, make it easier to share information and save hard-working taxpayers' money," he added."There has been a tendency to over mark documents rather than to manage risk properly. This can devalue the basic security principles."We think the most important and sensitive materials should be protected as Top Secret or Secret but for other information the new Official category, with its renewed emphasis upon personal responsibility and accountability, will be appropriate for most of what government does."Lord West said: "It's time that this was done, and it's right that this was done."He continued: "It's quite clear that we have too much that's over-classified, and when you're working in an area where quite a lot of things are secret people think: 'Hmm, I'd better make that secret just in case.'"We end up with a plethora of these documents, and handling them, either on computers or sending them to someone else, is incredibly complex and expensive. You have to have special rules for doing it, specials ways of doing it."I did discover... that if I really wanted a minister to look at something I didn't just have it top secret, I would make a code word."And then they had to be indoctrinated into it, you would make them sign a piece of paper, and then they really wanted to see it."But if you gave them something that just said confidential, then they weren't so fussed."</body>

      <title>Labour plans levy on payday lenders</title>
      <description>Labour pledges to introduce a levy on the profits of payday lenders to help support credit unions and other low-cost borrowing alternatives.</description>

      <body>Labour has pledged to impose a levy on the profits of payday lenders to help support lower-cost lending from credit unions and boost money advice services.If elected in 2015, it would introduce an extra charge on the lenders, which charge up to 4,000% interest, on top of fees already paid by all finance firms.Shadow business minister Stella Creasy told the BBC it was "payback time for these payday lenders".Payday lenders say they provide a valuable service to their customers.But Ms Creasy, who became Labour's shadow consumer and competition minister in the recent reshuffle, said: "Some of these companies are making a million pounds a week."They need to pay their share for the damage they're doing."She said the firms were "aggressively targeting people, and once they've got them in their claws, they keep squeezing and squeezing them".Ms Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, added: "Many other industries have set up voluntary organisations, like Drink Aware and Gambling Aware, when their products are causing problems. Yet this industry sits around saying there's no damage being done."These companies need to take responsibility for the damage that they are causing in communities like mine, where I've got 18 of these companies on my high street alone."So we're proposing to put a levy on them that can be used to fund the expansion of credit unions, who need more capital to be able to lend, and also debt and money advice services to help people with their finances, because we are struggling with the cost of living in this country."Ms Creasy's interview preceded a speech by Labour leader Ed Miliband, in which he said the measure was designed to help those already in "desperate need" and people at risk of racking up huge debts they cannot repay in future.The industry has been referred to the Competition Commission and regulators have promised a tightening of the rules, with all borrowers set to be offered an "affordability" check before being given a loan.Mr Miliband claimed that the squeeze on living standards was causing a "personal debt crisis" with a third of those taking out payday loans currently doing so to meet the cost of heating their homes."The prices families have to pay keep on rising faster and faster than the wages they are paid," he said on a visit to south London. "For too many families the end of the month is now their own personal credit crunch."Labour has already said it will cap the cost of credit and give local authorities new powers to limit the spread of payday lending shops in town centres.But Mr Miliband added: "We must protect the most vulnerable people in our society from the worst of exploitation by payday lenders."And it is right that the companies that benefit from people's financial plight, accept their responsibilities to help ensure affordable credit is available."He said the party would consult on the rate of the levy and how it will be implemented.Payday lenders, along with all financial service providers, already pay fees to the Financial Conduct Authority to help fund services such as debt advice.The government currently spends £13m on supporting the growth of credit unions but Labour says these organisations do not have the capacity nor the resources to offer help to all those who need it.Labour says the "explosion" in the payday lending market - with it says has doubled in size to £2.2bn in the last four years - is directly related to what it says is a "cost of living crisis".As many as five million families plan to borrow money from payday lenders in the next six months, and more than 1.5 million households spend more than 30% of their income on unsecured credit repayments, it says.Ministers say proposals announced by the Financial Conduct Authority earlier this month, including a ban on some products and a limit on the times loans can be rolled over, will "call time" on unscrupulous lenders.The Church of England has condemned the practices and ethics of some payday lenders and pledged to launch its own credit service to force many of them out business.But lenders say they are helping people in genuine need with no-one else to turn to and that firms who are members of Consumer Finance Association are heavily regulated already.</body>

      <title>Whitehall close to 'data revolution'</title>
      <description>A senior civil servant promises a "revolution" in the amount and quality of data published by government in the next two years.</description>

      <body>A senior civil servant has promised a "revolution" in the amount and quality of data published by government in the next two years.Cabinet Office official Paul Maltby said information "rarely seen" outside of Whitehall would soon be available.The "big prize" for Whitehall was to move to a default position of open data, he told a meeting in London.The coalition government has insisted it is the most transparent in history in terms of releasing data.Mr Maltby told a meeting organised by the Institute for Government that senior officials were looking for a "different mechanism" to encourage data transparency in government departments.In the past, he suggested officials had had to be chivvied along by a "big stick or a letter from the prime minister".But he suggested that attitudes had changed in recent years and a more pro-active approach to what data could and should be released had transformed the culture of a number of departments.He cited the departments of transport and work and pensions as examples of where progress had been made and looked forward to a day where information was published as a matter of course unless there was a reason not to."I don't think we are that far away. It is not a matter of weeks or months, but in the next 18 months or two years I think you will see a real difference in the quality and quantity of open data out there."He added: "In not that much time, we will see a really great revolution in how data is available. Data rarely seen outside government will be available and can be seen seen outside government."More than 9,000 data sets have been published since a new unit for open data and government innovation, which Mr Maltby heads, was set up in the Cabinet Office in 2011. Each department has also published its own data strategy.Julian McCrae, a former deputy director of the No 10 Strategy Unit, urged the media against over-interpretation and "dressing up" of raw data, saying there had to be a "grown-up debate" about the process.In the past, there had been cases of "great data being killed off before it becomes great data", he said.Mr McCrae, now deputy director of the Institute for Government, said Whitehall had a responsibility to work out what it was trying to achieve by releasing material and to provide "insight" as well as basic figures.The Cabinet Office promised a "quantum leap" in transparency in 2011, with information about hospital complaints, school performance and court sentencing trends among details released for the first time.Details of all local government spending above £500 and the salaries of the top earners in Whitehall were also released.But Jeni Tennison, from the Open Data Institute, told the same meeting that the government must show more resolve as it was "astonishing" the amount of datasets published in 2010 and 2011 which had not been updated since.Service providers and government contractors, as well as the public, were relying on out of date data, she said.</body>

      <title>Crime falls 7% to record low - ONS</title>
      <description>Crime in England and Wales fell 7% in the year to June - a record low - official figures show.</description>

      <body>Crime has fallen 7% to a record low in the last year, the Crime Survey for England and Wales has shown.There were 8.5m incidents in the year to the end of June, compared with 9.1m the previous year.The drop comes despite a 9% rise in sexual offences, which was partly driven by the Jimmy Savile revelations of abuse.Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said England and Wales are safer than they have been "for decades".The headline crime figure is the lowest since the survey began in 1981, and has now fallen to half its peak level, recorded in 1995.However, the Office for National Statistics, which collates the survey, said the number of historical sexual offences - those which took place more than 20 years ago - recorded by the police has doubled.The Savile inquiry has encouraged greater numbers of people to report historical sexual offence to the police.The ONS said that in the last five years there has been a 35% rise in the number of rape offences recorded by the police - partly due to new guidance on the way in which such crimes are recorded.An increase in theft was also recorded by the Crime Survey, with offences up by 8% in the last year.Evidence suggests the rise was driven by the theft of smart phones, and involve pick-pocketing rather than violence or threats.The majority are counted as stealth thefts - where the victim is unaware items are being stolen.Meanwhile, though credit card fraud levels remained flat, overall fraud offences have jumped by 21% in the last year.The ONS said the cause of this rise would become clearer in the next one or two years, but it could be down to a new centralised method of recording fraud.Max Chambers, head of crime and justice at the think-tank Policy Exchange, said: "Whether you believe it's as the result of an ageing population, better policing and prevention, or the impact of the internet, there is little doubt that Britain is becoming a safer place to live, do business and raise a family."But crime is still too high and there are pockets of the country which remain blighted by anti-social behaviour and gang activity."While the latest figures show that the police have been able to cut crime substantially even with fewer resources, they must now redouble their efforts to tackle the hardcore of prolific offenders who commit offences that can often disproportionately hit the poor and the vulnerable."While welcoming falling crime rates, Jon Collins, deputy director of the Police Foundation - an independent policing think-tank - said it was important not to be "blind to new and emerging challenges".He said: "The police and the government should be wary of resting on their laurels."While crimes such as burglary and car crime are clearly not the problem that they once were, it's possible that the official crime figures are just not picking up the extent to which new opportunities for crimes like fraud and counterfeiting have emerged, particularly online."Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said: "Police reform is working and crime is falling."This is really positive news. Forces are rising to the challenge of making savings whilst cutting crime and delivering a better service to the public."England and Wales are safer than they have been for decades but we will continue to deliver measures which keep pace with the changing nature of crime and improve our ability to combat emerging issues."The Crime Survey for England and Wales asks people aged 16 and over living in households in England and Wales about their experiences of crime in the last 12 months. These experiences are used to estimate levels of crime in England and Wales.</body>

      <title>'Plebgate' draft report later changed</title>
      <description>A report that advised against disciplining police over a meeting with "Plebgate" MP Andrew Mitchell had initially said there was a case to answer, it emerges.</description>

      <body>An internal report that found no misconduct case to answer by police over a meeting with "Plebgate" MP Andrew Mitchell had initially proposed disciplinary action, it has emerged.The Independent Police Complaints Commission said police chiefs had overruled the recommendation.Home Affairs committee chairman Keith Vaz has demanded to see both versions.The prime minister has said police owe Mr Mitchell an apology over the fallout from a row in Downing Street last year.David Cameron's intervention came as the row deepened between West Mercia, West Midlands and Warwickshire police forces on one side and the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) and supporters of the former cabinet minister on the other.Mr Mitchell had been accused of calling police officers "plebs" after being prevented from riding his bicycle through Downing Street's main gates in September 2012.In an attempt to heal relations with the police he met local representatives of their union, the Police Federation, in his constituency.Speaking after the meeting, one of the officers, Insp MacKaill, called for the then-Conservative chief whip's resignation, claiming he had not provided a proper account of what happened.However, Mr Mitchell recorded the meeting and a transcript issued by the IPCC showed he had spoken at length about what happened, and, while he admitted swearing, had denied using the word "pleb" or insulting the police.A subsequent internal investigation into the officers' account of the meeting initially found there was a "case to answer for misconduct" - but the final version recommended no action be taken against the officers.The differing conclusions were revealed in a letter from IPCC chairwoman Deborah Glass to Warwickshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Ron Ball."It is certainly being portrayed as though it is sinister," Mr Ball told the BBC."I think it may be, and I think there may be a perfectly innocent explanation for it... It may simply be that two individuals have looked at it - one has come to one judgement and one has come to another."He also criticised the IPCC after the watchdog questioned the West Midlands officers' "honesty and integrity"."I expect the IPCC to behave judiciously and to use judicious language and I don't think they have in this case."On Tuesday, the watchdog said the officers who attended the private meeting with Mr Mitchell last October should have faced misconduct hearings for misrepresenting what he has said.The chief constables of West Mercia, Warwickshire and West Midlands forces, who decided not to discipline the officers, will appear before the Home Affairs Select Committee on 23 October.Mr Vaz has requested that the committee see both the version which recommended disciplinary action and the subsequent one which did not."We didn't until today know that there was a first draft which suggested officers may well have been involved in misconduct and a final draft which removed that," he told the BBC."We want to be extremely fair to all sides. At the moment we just have the report that has been prepared by the IPCC which is pretty damning."He added that it was "another twist to a very sorry saga".IPCC chairwoman Dame Anne Owers, deputy Ms Glass, and Police Federation chairman Steve Williams have also been asked to appear before the select committee.In a statement on Tuesday, the three chief constables said they welcomed the opportunity to speak.Earlier at Prime Minister's Questions Mr Cameron said "these things should be properly investigated".Home Secretary Theresa May has said the IPCC's report "made troubling reading".Mr Cameron said: "I agree 100% with what the home secretary said. What's being discussed here is the fact that... the former chief whip had a meeting with Police Federation officers in his committee."Fortunately this meeting was recorded, so he has been able to prove that what he said was true and what the police officers said was untrue."The Police Federation of England and Wales has said it was "shocked" by the IPCC's comments, which it said "will naturally undermine the considered findings of the investigation in the eyes of the public".In a statement it said: "Either the IPCC are capable of supervising investigations or they are not. If they feel that they are capable of doing so... the proper and responsible course must be to accept the investigation findings."West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner Bob Jones said comments attributed to Ms Glass in the IPCC statement about the chief constables was "gratuitous and in my opinion an abuse of process".He said: "I will be writing to the IPCC asking for an apology for what I consider an unwarranted attack on the integrity of the investigating officers and the senior officers who sat in judgement."</body>

      <title>Probe into spying hears from public</title>
      <description>Parliament's intelligence watchdog is to hear evidence from the public as part of a widening of its inquiry into UK spy agencies' intercept activities.</description>

      <body>Parliament's intelligence watchdog is to hear evidence from the public as part of a widening of its inquiry into UK spy agencies' intercept activities.The Intelligence and Security Committee is examining whether laws governing intercept are "still fit for purpose".The impact on people's privacy will also now be considered by the inquiry.Concerns arose over "snooping" by the state after data-gathering centre GCHQ was cited in leaks by ex-US security contractor Edward Snowden.The controversy sparked by Mr Snowden's leaks to the Guardian newspaper prompted the ISC inquiry.In July, after reviewing GCHQ reports produced with material including US intelligence from its controversial Prism programme, the ISC decided that UK security services had not broken the law in accessing information on UK citizens.The intercept activities of the UK spy agencies come under three pieces of legislation: The Intelligence Services Act 1994, the Human Rights Act 1998, and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.On Thursday, ISC chairman Sir Malcolm Rifkind said: "In recent months concern has been expressed at the suggested extent of the capabilities available to the intelligence agencies and the impact upon people' s privacy as the agencies seek to find the needles in the haystacks that might be crucial to safeguarding national security."There is a balance to be found between our individual right to privacy and our collective right to security."An informed and responsible debate is needed," he said, adding that the ISC had "therefore decided to broaden the scope of its forthcoming inquiry to consider these wider questions, in addition to those relating to the existing legislative framework."He said the inquiry would continue to examine classified information but also invite written evidence "more broadly, including from the public, to ensure that the committee can consider the full range of opinions expressed on these topics".Mr Rifkind said the committee, which meets in secret, also hoped to hold some future evidence sessions in public.The ISC was recently given greater powers to scrutinise the work of the security services and last week Downing Street dismissed suggestions that there could be a government review of its role.Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, welcomed the ISC announcement but said "such a debate cannot be allowed to take place behind closed doors and without pressing questions being asked about the legal justification for what we know to be already happening at GCHQ and elsewhere".Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil liberties campaigners Liberty, said: "Some will say better late than never, others fear a tactical whitewash to calm public concern."It's certainly significant that the committee feels compelled to dig a little deeper but that's no substitute for much broader public and political debate."</body>

      <title>Call to phase out hereditary peers</title>
      <description>Hereditary peers should not be replaced when one of their number dies as this represents a "reputational risk" for the House of Lords, a group of MPs suggests.</description>

      <body>Hereditary peers should not be replaced when one of their number dies as this represents a "reputational risk" for the House of Lords, a report suggests.The last Labour government abolished the majority of hereditaries, but a rump of 90 remained pending plans for an elected chamber, which then stalled.The Commons Political Reform Committee said the number of hereditaries should "gradually" be allowed to decline.It also called for peers convicted of serious offences to be expelled.The cross-party committee says the failure of the coalition government to win support last year for plans to elect up to 80% of peers should not stop a series of "small-scale" reforms being introduced now.It says there is a consensus behind the need to remove those convicted of serious criminal offences and persistent non-attendees as well as making it easier for members to take voluntary retirement.Unlike in the Commons, where MPs given custodial sentences of more than 12 months are automatically disqualified, peers effectively had a "seat for life", the committee said.The majority of new peers are appointed but 18 peers have been elected to the House since 2002, when the system of by-elections to replace hereditary members who die was introduced.All members of the House of Lords can vote in these ballots but only those on the register of hereditary peers can stand. Most recently, Lord Borwick beat off competition from 22 other candidates to win election in July.But the committee suggested that holding elections in which only a very small number of people were entitled to take part "perpetuated the status quo" and should be phased out."This would also serve to reduce the reputational risk to the House which results from the existence and use of the current by-election system," it said."This would result in only a gradual reduction in numbers but taking this action would not preclude further, wholesale reform taking place in the future."</body>

      <title>UK 'timid' over Commonwealth summit</title>

      <body>The UK failed to take a "principled stand" when it agreed to allow Sri Lanka to host the forthcoming summit of Commonwealth leaders, MPs say.The Commons Foreign Affairs Committee said the UK should have made its approval conditional on progress on Sri Lanka's human rights record.Canada says it will not attend next month's summit over alleged abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.UK PM David Cameron says he cannot raise concerns unless he is present.Campaigners want the Sri Lankan authorities to allow an independent investigation into allegations that government forces committed war crimes towards the end of a decades-long civil war that ended in 2009.The UN estimates that 40,000 civilians were killed in the last five months of the conflict but the Sri Lankan authorities insist that a rehabilitation process is under way after years of fighting.The cross-party committee of MPs makes its reservations about the UK's handling of its relations with Sri Lanka clear in an audit of the Foreign Office's human rights work in 2012.The Commonwealth Secretariat, the organisation's ruling body, decided to award the right to host the 2013 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), which takes place every two years, to Sri Lanka in 2009.The decision must be approved by the heads of government of each of the body's 52 members.But the MPs say that although the UK objected in 2009 to the event being held in Sri Lanka in 2011, it made no such intervention regarding the 2013 venue - a stance the committee said was "inconsistent".The committee said there had been "scant evidence" of any improvement in the Sri Lankan government's treatment of political opponents, with evidence of continuing attacks on the judiciary and civil society groups.After a visit to the country in August, the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights warned that the country was heading in an "increasingly authoritarian direction".Although it was not practical to re-open the question about the summit's location at this late stage, the MPs said it was right to question whether the UK had "played its hand" properly."The UK could and should have taken a more principled stand in 2009, and should have taken a more robust stand after the 2011 Chogm in the light of the continuing serious human rights abuses in Sri Lanka," the report said."The Foreign Office objected to a proposal that Sri Lanka might host the 2011 Chogm on human rights grounds but did not obstruct a proposal that it might do so in 2013."Nor did it insist that Sri Lanka's right to host in 2013 should be conditional on improvements in human rights. That approach now appears timid."The report notes human rights groups, such as Amnesty International, do not support Canada's boycott of the event, urging Mr Cameron instead to travel to the north of the country and to seek guarantees that those members of NGOs he speaks to do not face reprisals afterwards.Speaking last week, Mr Cameron said it was right for him to attend the summit since the UK were "big believers" in the Commonwealth and its values.But he added: "I think it is right in going to the Commonwealth conference we should not hold back in being very clear about those aspects of the human rights record in Sri Lanka that we are not happy with."Labour MP Simon Danczuk is also pressing the PM to highlight the case of British man Khuram Shaikh, who was killed in Sri Lanka in 2011. Eight people, including a Sri Lankan politician, were arrested and bailed in November.On other matters, the committee backs the UK's decision to lift economic sanctions against Burma in April but says it should be prepared to reconsider if undertakings by the Burmese government on human rights are not met.It also rejects suggestions that the 2014 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games should be boycotted in protest at human rights abuses in Russia.Gay rights campaigners have called for action after laws were passed banning the dissemination of "homosexual propaganda" to minors - a move they claim will effectively prevent any public gay rights event.But the committee said the Games provided a platform for wider social and cultural concerns to be voiced in a way which would be difficult for the host country to brush aside.</body>

      <description>Eleanor Laing is elected a deputy Speaker of the House of Commons, beating fellow Conservative Brian Binley into second place.</description>

      <body>Eleanor Laing has been elected as one of the three deputy Speakers of the House of Commons.The Conservative MP for Epping Forest beat six other challengers for the right to fill in for Speaker John Bercow in his absence.In the final round of voting, she saw off Conservative Brian Binley by 273 votes to 240.There has been a vacancy on Mr Bercow's team since Nigel Evans stood down to fight sex offence charges.The other candidates, all Conservative MPs, were David Amess, Henry Bellingham, Simon Burns, Nadine Dorries, and Gary Streeter.Announcing the result of the ballot, which took place earlier on Wednesday, Mr Bercow said: "I congratulate the honourable lady warmly, and I may say on behalf of my colleagues and myself that we all greatly look forward to working with her."In the process, I should like, I'm sure on behalf of the whole House, to thank all of the candidates for participating in the election, and for a contest which showed the House at its best."Ms Laing added: "May I also on behalf of all the candidates who took part thank each of the other candidates for the demure and pleasant way in which this election has been conducted, and may I thank the House for placing their confidence in me to let me become part of your team."The deputy Speaker's position carries a salary premium of £36,360 in addition to the standard MPs' salary, so Ms Laing will now receive a total of £102,098 a year.As a Conservative, Mr Evans could only be replaced by another governing-party MP under Commons rules - although no Lib Dems applied.Ahead of the election, Ms Laing had said: "I'm passionate about freedom through democracy, about the dignity of the House of Commons, and about its vital, essential role as a forum for national debate."I would like to be part of the Speaker's team, not just to keep order in the chamber but to stand up for the rights of the backbenches... against overbearing governments."The election was conducted under a system known as the single transferable vote, where voters list their preferred candidates in order on the ballot paper.If no candidate secures 50% plus one of the votes in the ballot, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated and their preference votes re-distributed to other contenders. This process continues until a winner emerges.Mr Bellingham came third with a final tally of 156 votes, Mr Streeter fourth with 95, and Mr Burns fifth with 70.Mr Amess was sixth with 28 and Ms Dorries came last, gaining 13 votes in the first round.Ms Laing was ahead of all the other candidates at each stage of vote-counting.</body>

      <title>Labour 'could cut more' from welfare</title>
      <description>A future Labour government could find £5bn in further welfare savings by changes to pensions and benefits, a group set up to explore its spending options after 2016 says.</description>

      <body>A future Labour government could find £5bn in further savings in the welfare budget, a group set up to explore its spending choices has concluded.The Fabian Society commission said Labour should raise long-term spending on capital projects but continue to rein in day-to-day expenditure.Options include ending the guaranteed 2.5% state pension rise and limiting tax relief on private pensions.Labour has said it will stick to the coalition's spending plans in 2015-16.Shadow chancellor Ed Balls has said that, if the party forms the next government, there will have to be an "iron discipline" on spending and further cuts will have to be made.Although critical of the coalition's austerity programme over the past three years, Mr Balls has accepted the broad outline of the government's plans for the first year of the next Parliament - in which Chancellor George Osborne is seeking £11.5bn of cuts.The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said the commission had been exploring how Labour could regain economic credibility in the face of opinion polls suggesting many did not trust it to take tough decisions.The commission, set up by the Labour-supporting Fabian Society think tank, said it believed "huge cuts" could be avoided at the same time as continuing to reduce the deficit.It says a 1% real-terms increase in spending each year from 2016 onwards would be "realistic and credible". This would imply spending £20bn more in 2016-17 than Mr Osborne is currently planning.Lord McFall, the former Labour MP who chaired the commission - and who presided over the cross-party Treasury select committee in the last Parliament - said the party shouldn't "get a mania" about its public spending commitments.While Labour should be prepared to say it would outspend the Conservatives and Lib Dems, Lord McFall said increases should be relatively modest and targeted at long-term spending that would help to boost the economy.The commission's report implies that day-to-day spending would still be squeezed, with expenditure on public services such as the NHS and schools "broadly flat".It suggests more could be cut from the welfare budget, saying Mr Balls should go further than his existing plan to remove the winter fuel allowance from better-off pensioners.It says the coalition's "triple lock" pledge on state pensions - a guarantee to increase the state pension every year by a minimum of 2.5%, or by inflation or average earnings if they are higher - could be scrapped.Combined with "modest" tax rises targeting the better-off, such as reforming the system of tax relief on private pensions and some changes to disability benefits, the commission says £5bn could be raised.It is also recommending that Labour sets up an Office of Public Performance to ensure that any increases in government spending bring about tangible improvements to services."No-one denies the fiscal challenges that an incoming government will face," said Andrew Harrop, the Fabian Society's general secretary."The UK's economy is not out of the woods yet and tough choices will have to be made."But compared to the government's cuts to public services and social security, our ideas for savings avoid cuts to the most economically beneficial spending and maintain a fair system of social security that protects lower-income households who have been hardest hit by living standards crisis."But the Conservatives said the report's recommendations suggested Labour had learnt nothing from past experience."What got our economy into a mess was too much spending, too much borrowing and too much debt," a Tory spokesman said."Now Labour's official think tank is calling for more spending, more borrowing and more debt."That would mean higher taxes and higher mortgage rates for hardworking people."</body>

      <title>Complaints 'can make Britain better'</title>
      <description>Minister Oliver Letwin vows to transform the way the NHS and other public services handle complaints so they become a "mine of information".</description>

      <body>Complaints from members of the public should help make Britain's public services better, says Oliver Letwin.Instead of viewing them as a "danger," complaints should be seen as a vital "mine" of information, the Cabinet Office minister told MPs.David Cameron's policy chief is launching two separate reviews into the way complaints are handled."I am trying to engineer a fundamental culture change," he told the public administration committee.Mr Letwin says he was spurred into action by the committee's inquiry, when no other minister was interested in the subject, and plans to start work on the initiative in the New Year after the MPs have published their report.He plans to speak to other governments around the world - but also to learn lessons from the private sector, where he says complaints are seen as potentially useful feedback.His first review will look at how to make it easier for the public to make a complaint about services, and whether the current "maze" of different ombudsmen should be scrapped in favour of a single service with one website.He told the MPs he had been studying the resolver website, which helps guide people with complaints about private companies and public services, for ideas.His second review will look at how complaints are treated by civil servants, government departments, MPs and the NHS."There hasn't really been, over a number of decades, any real attention, paid to how we use complaints to improve service delivery," he told MPsInstead of being dealt with on a case-by-case basis, complaints should be looked at in the round and lessons learned from them, he suggested.He vowed to create, for "the first time in history," a system in which complaints are treated as "a huge potential mine of information on service delivery", adding: "I am intending to drive that forward myself."He said it was more than a question of changing management systems, or launching new training courses, but of transforming an entire culture, something that had not been attempted before and would be "very difficult", but not impossible, to do.Committee chairman, Tory MP Bernard Jenkin, praised Mr Letwin for agreeing to address the issue."We struggled to find a minister in the government who would take responsibility for complaint handling across government and you have gamely stepped up to the crease," said Mr Jenkin.But the minister came in for some criticism from Labour members of the committee, who warned a new system might diminish the role of MPs, who often helped vulnerable people with poor English navigate their way through the complaints system.Mr Letwin assured them that MPs would still have a role to play, although having a "system which was more responsive and easier to access" would mean fewer people would come to MPs with their grievances.He also confessed that, as an MP in a marginal constituency, he had always taken constituents who come to him with problems seriously in case they complained to the local newspaper about him, adding that this was "very good for democracy".Earlier this year, the outgoing head of the NHS in England, Sir David Nicholson, gave the committee an insight into the scale of Mr Letwin's task, when he admitted there was a deep-rooted culture of "denial" and "defensiveness" when it came to handling complaints from patients.Sir David was in charge of the regional health authority responsible for Mid Staffordshire hospital for a short period while patients were being mistreated.He said he regretted not listening to patients in that role - but efforts were now under way across the health service to change that culture.</body>

      <body>Scotland's first minister is to hold talks with both sides involved in the dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant.It is understood Alex Salmond earlier spoke to officials from the plant's operators Ineos.Mr Salmond confirmed in his opening address at the SNP conference in Perth he will hold further talks with both Ineos and the Unite union.The facility remains shut down despite Unite calling off a planned strike.The first minister told delegates at the SNP conference that officials from both Ineos and Unite had been quoted in the media as saying they believed Grangemouth had a "great future".He added: "What I will attempt to do is to take and build on that belief, and say to both Unite and Ineos that only by negotiation, cooperation and agreement can we get an effective resolution."We believe, and Scotland believes and expects, that Grangemouth as an industrial facility has a great future."Mr Salmond left the first day of the conference in Perth for the discussions in Edinburgh."Governments can't make agreements" in such disputes but can "encourage the circumstances in which agreements can be found", he told party delegates.Ineos said shutting down the Grangemouth complex had cost the company £20m so far.It has put proposals over pay and pensions to workers at the site, which has 1,400 employees and many more contractors.A letter outlining the proposed changes was being couriered to employees on Friday.BBC Scotland has been given details of the offer, which includes freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016.The shift allowance would also be reduced from £10,000 to £7,500 per year, while pensions would be transferred from a final salary to a defined benefits scheme.The company added that no job cuts were expected.It has asked for an answer to the proposals by Monday, and has said shareholders will discuss the complex's future on Tuesday.The company has said Grangemouth is "financially distressed" and must reduce costs.It has also asked for guarantees that no further strike action will be held by workers.Unite claimed the company had told staff they could lose their jobs and be reemployed on poorer terms unless they agreed to give up their final salary pension, and accept pay freezes and pay cuts, by 18:00 on Monday.Pat Rafferty, Unite's Scottish secretary, said: "This is cynical blackmail from a company that is putting a gun to the heads of its loyal workforce to slash pay, pensions and jobs."We are considering taking legal action over the company's menacing tactics and urge members not to be threatened into signing their livelihoods away."It is increasingly clear that the company is deliberately generating a dispute and hiding behind fancy accounting to attack its own workforce."On Wednesday, Ineos said Grangemouth "is shut and remains shut", despite Unite calling off a 48-hour strike that had been due to begin on Sunday.The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans.Ineos claims it is unable to immediately restart the complex, which had been shut down ahead of the planned strike.A spokesman said: "The Grangemouth site is three times the size of the City of London and it is an incredibly complex system of manufacturing plants all connected by miles of pipes carrying highly flammable materials."Shutting down the site and restarting again is not like switching the lights off and on. It takes days to shut down properly and it takes weeks to bring it back up again."When Unite forced us to shut down in 2008 we had two major incidents and it took eight weeks to get back to normal. In the first incident, we had a large fire on a compressor. If our employees had been close to the area then there would have been serious injuries or even fatalities."</body>

      <title>MPs' housing benefit changes warning</title>
      <description>Changes to housing benefit - described by critics as the "bedroom tax" - will cause potential problems in Wales, a cross-party committee of MPs is warning.</description>

      <body>Changes to housing benefit - described by critics as the "bedroom tax" - will cause potential problems in Wales, a cross-party MPs' committee has warned.The reforms mean housing association and council tenants see benefits cut if they are deemed to have spare bedrooms.But the Welsh Affairs Committee fears there is a shortage of smaller homes available for rent for those looking to downsize.The UK government said money would be made available for the most vulnerable.Since April the reform has meant a 14% cut in benefits for one spare room and 25% for two.Around 40,000 tenants in Wales are affected by the changes which mean they must choose between losing some of their benefit or moving to a smaller home.But according to the committee, there could be a shortage of one and two-bedroom homes for those who wanted to find smaller properties.The MPs said in the report: "We recommend that the government issue discretionary guidance on the appropriate size of bedrooms in social rented sector accommodation."The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) must closely monitor whether local authorities are struggling to find alternative smaller accommodation for tenants who wish to downsize."If this is so, we urge the government to undertake a speedy review of this policy."It said the DWP should also monitor "whether the movement of tenants to smaller accommodation in the private rented sector leads to long-term savings in housing benefit expenditure".It added that renting privately may prove more expensive and the government's assertion that the under-occupancy policy would reduce rent prices in the private housing sector had yet to be proved.It called for direct rent controls in the private sector which would prevent rents from going above a certain level.The report says: "We acknowledge that one of the main reasons for recent increases in the housing benefit bill and projected further increases is inflation in private housing sector rents."Efforts to control housing benefit increases therefore have to include strategies to manage spiralling rents in the private rented sector, including direct rent controls."This recommendation was endorsed by the committee, despite the opposition of its chairman, Monmouth MP David Davies, and fellow Conservatives Guto Bebb and Glyn Davies.Last week, Mr Davies told BBC Wales the housing benefit reforms were not working as well in Wales as in London or Birmingham but he still backed their introduction.Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) welfare reform spokesman and Swansea councillor David Phillips said: "I have met many of my local residents to talk through the challenges that these reforms are creating for them, and what is plainly obvious in most cases is that the bedroom tax reform places some of our most vulnerable residents under severe financial pressure, while offering them no viable way to change or improve their situation."There are simply not enough smaller properties for people to move to."We hope that the UK government will consider and learn from the findings of this report as they review the impact of their policies and implement other aspects of welfare reform," he added.A DWP spokesperson said: "Housing benefit continues to pay the vast majority of people's rent, but the taxpayer can no longer afford to cover the costs of spare bedrooms."However, we have made £6.2m available to Welsh councils to support vulnerable people, with an additional £880,000 available to help those in rural parts of Wales."The committee said it wanted to know what the definition of "vulnerable" tenants was.Charity Community Housing Cymru said the report's findings echoed its own concerns.</body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Beginner's guide to PM's speech</title>
      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant?What has happened?Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning.Why the big deal about the speech?Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech.So what did Cameron say?Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech.What sorts of powers does the UK want back?The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK."Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders?The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK.So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU?David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market."What has been the reaction in the UK?Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement.Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party.The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts.What about the reaction around Europe?The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction.What about the reaction from business?A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".Where can I get more detail on the speech?If you click on the link below you can read the whole text, with key bits picked out and analysed by BBC expertsAnnotated transcipt: Key excerpts</body>

      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his October 2013 reshuffle.The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction.He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire.The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011.As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper.Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children.The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign.Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury.Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011.Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development.Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. The MP for Leeds West was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament.A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader.As the son of former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest.One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress.Moving to defence from shadow Northern Ireland secretary in October 2013, the MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted having smoked cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip.The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing". Like many leading female MPs, the former union worker entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide. Responsible for the controversial eco-town project as housing minister before becoming Europe minister in 2008. Supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011.One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the Cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. She supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leader of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.Chris Leslie has been appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in the latest Labour frontbench reshuffle. The former Bradford councillor was elected MP for Shipley - a Tory stronghold in Yorkshire - in 1997. He held several junior positions in the former Labour government within the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Constitutional Affairs. He lost his Shipley seat in 2005, but re-entered Parliament in 2010 as MP for Nottingham East. He went on to serve as shadow financial secretary to the Treasury on Labour's front bench in the Commons.Mary Creagh has moved from shadow environment secretary to shadow transport secretary in October 2013. When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before. The Wakefield MP worked for the European Parliament and in academia before entering Parliament in 2005. A keen Europhile, she is fluent in French and Italian. Worked as parliamentary private secretary to Andy Burnham but voted for David Miliband in the leadership contest.Maria Eagle moved in October 2013 to shadow environment secretary in a job swap with Mary Creagh. She is the sister of Angela but chose to support Ed Miliband in the leadership contest. Ms Eagle was a solicitor in Liverpool before entering Parliament in 1997. She held a series of ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including children's minister and equalities minister. Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player.Jim Murphy was moved - demoted in many people's eyes - in October 2013 from shadow defence secretary. He is a Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign. He has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football.Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. But when that constituency was torn up in boundary changes she made the move to Westminster in 2010. Under her, Labour took back Glasgow East having lost it in a by-election defeat by the SNP in 2008. In Holyrood, she held various posts, including minister for communities, overseeing the executive's flagship anti-social behaviour laws. Before entering politics she was a lecturer in community education. The then 52-year-old took up her first full shadow cabinet role in October 2011.Jon Trickett takes over from the departing Tom Watson as deputy Labour party chair. Gordon Brown's former parliamentary aide, Mr Trickett previously attended shadow cabinet as a junior minister and became a full member as shadow Cabinet Office minister in Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle. The then 61-year-old MP for Hemsworth took over the role from Tessa Jowell.Michael Dugher became shadow Cabinet Office minister in October 2013 after attending the shadow cabinet as shadow minister without portfolio. Mr Dugher won the seat of Barnsley East at the 2010 General Election, after serving as chief political spokesman for the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Having joined the ranks of the Labour parliamentary party, he then became a parliamentary private secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband. He is also currently vice-chairman of the Labour Party.Gloria De Piero was appointed shadow women and equalities minister in the October 2013 reshuffle. The former GMTV political editor was an political admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as party leader. She was elected as MP for Ashfield at the 2010 General Election and appointed to a junior role in the shadow Department for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport. Since October 2011, Ms De Piero has served as a junior shadow Home Office minister.Former BBC radio producer and special adviser who has risen quickly through the ranks. The then 40-year-old was elected in 2010 for Pontypridd, but previously stood unsuccessfully in the 2006 Blaenau Gwent by-election where he lost to independent Dai Davies. He supported Ed Miliband for the leadership and was given a role in his shadow team five months after entering the House, first as shadow Wales minister and then in the shadow Treasury team. This is his first shadow cabinet role.Moving from shadow minister for international development in October 2013, former charity worker and chief executive of the Manchester Jewish Federation, Mr Lewis held a string of junior ministerial posts in the Labour government after becoming an MP in 1997 at the age of 31. He started out as a parliamentary private secretary to then Trade Secretary Stephen Byers, before going on to be an education minister, Treasury minister, health minister and international development minister. Most recently, he was minister of state at the Foreign Office. His previous shadow cabinet role was as culture spokesman in which he was a vocal campaigner on phone hacking.The then 52-year-old was elected unopposed in a ballot for chief whip in 2010. A former local government minister, the Doncaster Central MP is responsible for maintaining discipline among Labour MPs in crucial Commons votes.Continues to lead her party in the Lords, having done the job, while in government, under Gordon Brown. She is also a spokesman on education, work and pensions, Northern Ireland and equality issues. Born in 1955, she started her political career as a special adviser to Neil - now Lord - Kinnock in the 1980s.A long-serving leader of Brighton and Hove Council, Lord Bassam was given a peerage in 1997 at the age of 44. The former local government official has continued as Labour's chief whip in the Lords, having done the job since before the 2010 general election.</body>

      <title>Is it a good idea to allow China a stake in UK nuclear?</title>
      <description>Is the UK getting too close to China with latest power deal?</description>

      <body>The UK is to allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants. Is this a good idea?It is 57 years to the day since the Queen threw a lever to start electricity flowing from the world's first civil nuclear power plant, at Calder Hall, in Cumbria.If you had told any of the dignitaries present that day that Britain would one day surrender control of its nuclear industry to foreign powers, losing in the process the ability to build its own reactors, they would have thought you were mad.But we have long got used to the idea that Britain is no longer an industrial powerhouse.So why should we be concerned that China, a former Cold War enemy, has been given the go-ahead to invest in new nuclear plants?The economics are simple enough.Britain needs new nuclear power plants to keep the lights on. But it has ruled out public subsidies, so badly needs private investment."We need to see investment not just from China but from Japan, the US, France and the City of London," said Energy Secretary Ed Davey, an architect of the deal between French energy giant EDF and China General Nuclear Power Group.The deal is initially confined to a 30% stake in a single new plant, at Hinckley Point, but could lead to Chinese companies taking majority stakes in future projects, and will see Chinese technicians being trained by British nuclear scientists.It is being hailed by Chancellor George Osborne as a triumph of British diplomacy, potentially opening up China's rapidly expanding nuclear energy market to British companies and keeping energy bills down for British consumers.But not everyone is quite so ecstatic."With continuing concerns about Chinese cyber-attacks on foreign governments' computer systems, should we really be inviting companies which many believe to be effectively arms of the Chinese government into our critical infrastructure at all?," writes Stuart Nathan, in trade magazine The Engineer, calling the deal "inexplicable".In a recent Financial Times blog, former Downing Street energy policy adviser Nick Butler summed up the concerns: "They will be inside the system, with access to the intricate architecture of the UK's National Grid and the processes through which electricity supply is controlled, as well as to the UK's nuclear technology."Lord West, cyber security minister in the previous Labour government, has been vocal about the threat posed by China to Britain's computer networks - something always denied by the Chinese government."China has an army of people hacking into our systems. They are engaged in industrial espionage on a massive scale," Lord West told BBC News.He is particularly concerned about the deal between BT and Huawei, which gives the Chinese telecoms giant access to Britain's telecommunications network, as highlighted earlier this year in a highly critical report by the intelligence and security committee.But the former Home Office minister says he is relatively relaxed about a Chinese company taking a stake in Britain's nuclear industry, beyond the "embarrassment" of living in a country that is no longer capable of building its own reactors."We probably don't have to worry too much, as long as we have a separate and free state with a Parliament that retains control," he says.It is not as if China is a rogue state or about to go to war with Britain, although, he adds, things could change."In 50 years time you never know what will happen. If someone knows your critical infrastructure very well they can do damage to it."There are also concerns about China's human rights record, which does not seem to have been mentioned by Chancellor George Osborne in his meeting with Chinese officials, despite a new Foreign Office 'action plan' urging firms to pay more attention to the issue."It could set a dangerous precedent," says an Amnesty International spokesman, "If other countries see Britain doing business with China without mentioning human rights then they will follow suit."The key question for many, however, is why can't Britain, the country that pioneered civil nuclear energy, build its own reactors?The UK is uniquely relaxed among Western nations about foreign ownership of key national assets like nuclear power plants, says Antony Froggatt, lead author of the annual World Nuclear Industry Status Report.In the US, Australia and Canada foreign companies are prevented by law from owning critical infrastructure. EDF was recently blocked from building a third reactor at the Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant, in Maryland, due to America's ban on foreign ownership.In some European nations, state-backed "national champions", such as EDF, dominate the nuclear market, while in others, such as Germany, the industry is being wound down.British companies will be involved in building new nuclear plants, says Mr Froggatt, and there is nothing to stop the government breathing new life into Britain's own nuclear industry, which once led the world.But nuclear is a "very risky" investment without massive public subsidies, due to the long lifespan of the plants, and even mighty state-backed enterprises now like to spread the risk by seeking partners.It is also an increasingly niche business.At the nuclear industry's peak in 1979, there were 234 plants under construction around the world. Now there are just 66 - 28 of which are in China."If you were to build up a new industry you would be better doing it in other fields," says Mr Froggatt.But he adds: "I hope that the government, by encouraging this Chinese investment isn't promising that Chinese reactors will be built in the UK because it hasn't got the power to do that."The current design of Chinese reactors would be unlikely to meet British safety standards.But experts say the real prize for the Chinese is to gain approval from the UK nuclear industry regulator, known as one of the toughest in the world, for a new generation of designs, which could open the door to Western markets.Mr Froggatt is also concerned that the political consensus in the UK, with all three main parties now firmly behind nuclear energy, has prevented tough questions being asked about the wisdom of the current policy.Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, quizzed about the China deal on his weekly LBC radio show, summed up the government's laissez fare approach."If people want to come here and build safe sustainable low-carbon ways of generating energy without dollops of British taxpayers' subsidy in a way which is entirely regulated by us, where the rules are set up by us, not in Beijing, then of course that's something we should be open to."Because we've got to keep the lights on and we've got to protect the environment."</body>

      <title>The reshuffled face of politics</title>
      <description>What impact will the frontbench changes have?</description>

      <body>Reshuffles. Like the old cliché about buses, you wait ages for one then three come along at once. But how much of an impact will the latest changes in personnel have?Inside the coalition, the Conservative and Lib Dem leaders independently decided the fate of their ministers.And Ed Miliband, no longer encumbered with a shadow cabinet chosen by his MPs, had a free hand to promote fresh talent.But has the political territory shifted, or is it just the personalities that have been moved?In some ways, the face of politics is changing.Across the board, women are taking more prominent roles - so far, a net increase of four in government, and 44% of Labour's shadow cabinet are female.Among the beneficiaries are two former stars of GMTV - Esther McVey for the Conservatives, and Labour's Gloria De Piero.The equation telegenic + down to earth = promotion has been proven. Though some rather less telegenic but talented people have done well too.For the Conservatives, the reshuffle has also, in part, been about class as well as gender.That isn't a misprint.For the Conservatives, the reshuffle has also, in part, been about class.What some of our tabloid colleagues have depicted as a process of replacing the "top hats" with the "flat caps".In fact Monday didn't really amount to a revolution in millinery. It's simply that some of those who haven't been to public school are winning more prominence.Racing up the junior ranks is Sajid Javid, son of a bus driver from Rochdale.And Mike Penning - a plain-speaking former soldier and fireman - will welcome the challenge of taking the heat for welfare reforms. As a former spokesman for Iain Duncan Smith, he should, at least, have a good working relationship with his boss.So expect some of the non-cabinet ministers to speak with less expensive accents.Allies of the chancellor have also done well from the reshuffle: the aforementioned Mr Javid; Matthew Hancock, a former chief of staff to George Osborne; and the former Treasury whip Greg Hands, are all moving up.Their careers may be moving forward but their advancement doesn't signal a change in direction.None of the better-known Conservative figures around the cabinet table have been moved - any purge at the top will await the outcome of next year's European parliament elections.It was, in fact, Nick Clegg rather than David Cameron that engaged in the night of the long knives. Or, rather, the long knife.It was plunged into the front rather than the back of Micheal Moore, the Secretary of State for Scotland.He had very competently carried out negotiations on the forthcoming referendum on Scottish independence.But now that thorny issues over timing and, crucially, what question to put to the Scottish people, have had been smoothed over, it was felt that it was time to move on from the constitutional niceties and in to campaigning mode.So step forward the robust figure of the former Lib Dem chief whip Alistair Carmichael, whose job it is now to tweak Alex Salmond's tail.But at more junior level, Jeremy Browne was dismissed. This surprised some at Westminster as he had been seen as close to Nick Clegg, and he could never be described as a coalition-sceptic. Certainly working with Conservative ministers didn't seem to trouble his conscience.So it's possible that the Lib Dem leader - while continuing to liaise closely with David Cameron's colleagues - also wants his own ministers to spell out the differences between the two coalition partners more clearly in the run-up to the next election.But even Lib Dems raised eyebrows at Mr Browne's replacement at the Home Office, the former transport minster Norman Baker, the author of a book alleging a cover-up over Dr David Kelly, the government scientist whose death led to the Hutton inquiry.At first glance Ed Miliband's reshuffle marks more of a shift in position - away from his party's Blairite past.At education, Stephen Twigg - who had praised a "free school" in his area and worked hard to find a way of reconciling Michael Gove's creations with Labour's existing (and more hostile) policy - has been dumped from the shadow cabinet, as has Liam Byrne - the former shadow work and pensions secretary who accepted the principle of a cap on benefits payments.And it just so happens that in an interview with the left-of-centre New Statesman earlier, the leader of the Unite trade union Len McCluskey had described both politicians in unflattering terms.Labour sources, naturally, say that Ed Miliband didn't discuss his reshuffle with union leaders.And certainly Tristram Hunt's appointment to replace Stephen Twigg hardly marks a lurch to the left.He is close to Peter Mandelson and was parachuted into his Stoke constituency at the last election with the blessing of the then leadership.And while he has reportedly described free schools as "a vanity project for yummy mummies", expect him to champion "parent-led academies" in the future .Rather, he represents a bit of generational shift - someone who is younger than the Labour leader (not yet 40) and who can potentially appeal beyond the Westminster village - albeit to viewers of TV history shows on BBC Two and Four, rather than breakfast telly.Labour insiders say they wanted to make space for some of the 2010 intake who could prove to be energetic campaigners. That was more important than whether they were Brownite or Blairite, David or Ed.The new shadow women's and equalities minister Gloria De Piero is an admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as her party leader.And there was additional ballast against the "Blairite purge" stories - which some of the papers will write tomorrow - in the shape of Lord Falconer. He is Tony Blair's former flatmate and he has agreed to advise the party on the transition from opposition to government.The shunting of the former shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle to the environment brief has led to speculation that Labour is preparing to derail HS2.Instead, party sources insist, Mary Creagh's move to transport from shadowing Defra is a tribute to her campaigning flair during the horsemeat scandal.She is now going to be tasked with standing up not for the consumer but the commuter, arguing against higher fares as part of Labour's pre-election theme of tackling what it calls the cost-of-living crisis.But if she is a fan of HS2, she may have to turn her campaigning skills to greater effect against some of her shadow cabinet colleagues who think the money could be better spent.Amongst the sceptics is Ed Balls, supportive of the rail project in principle, but in practice stressing he can't back it "at any price".And the shadow chancellor, like his opposite number, will be pleased to see some of his key allies in important posts - including Rachel Reeves, his former number two, taking over the work and pensions brief, and Vernon Coaker moving to shadow defence.Michael Dugher, a redoubtable attack-dog who initially backed Ed Balls for leader, has been given a key role in planning for the next general election.He will be joined by Douglas Alexander (in addition to his foreign affairs role) and Spencer Livermore - the former Gordon Brown apparatchik who was - he believed unfairly - criticised by some of his colleagues for the handling of the 2007 election-that-never-was.Well, with fixed-term Parliaments now, there is little doubt when the next election will come.But perhaps the wider significance of the Labour reshuffle is what it says about the other Ed.The fact that Messrs Twigg and Byrne accepted demotions, and Jim Murphy moved from defence to international development, suggests that his leadership is secure - that there is no prospect of a shadowy group of Blairites outside of the shadow cabinet waiting - or campaigning - for Ed Miliband's political demise.At least, not this side of an election.So, in the days and months ahead, the battle lines will be more clearly drawn between rather than within the parties.</body>

      <title>EU law and budget: a video guide</title>
      <description>Matthew Price explains EU laws and budget</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23782683</url>

      <body>The EU has a reputation for being slow and cumbersome - largely because of the difficulty of getting agreement among 28 member states with different languages and traditions.Here BBC Europe correspondent Matthew Price gives a video guide to the complex bargaining that results in new EU laws and the EU budget.The right to initiate legislation in the EU belongs to the European Commission - the union's civil service and rule-enforcer.Usually Commission proposals go through many amendments before becoming law - a process that takes years.In most policy areas the Council of Ministers - representing EU governments - and the European Parliament reach joint decisions through negotiation. Their role is called "the ordinary legislative procedure". During their negotiations they come under pressure from lobby groups, for example industrial firms or environmentalists.Often EU laws arise because national governments and MEPs tell the Commission that there is a need for them. Public consultations, scientific research and impact assessments also feed into the legislation.Once a measure becomes EU law the member states have two years to adopt it nationally - "transpose" it, in the jargon. The Commission can fine them for failure to do so.The budget is one of the most contentious policy areas among the member states, whose priorities differ greatly. The 2013 EU budget is 132.8bn euros (£113bn; $178bn).The size of the budget has to be decided annually, but there is also a seven-year budget framework, agreed in advance so that money can be set aside for long-term projects.This year for the first time EU leaders agreed to cut the multi-year budget (for 2014-2020), under pressure from the UK and some other countries, including the Netherlands and Sweden.The eurozone crisis has exacerbated tensions in the budget negotiations. Net contributors to the budget - the richer countries including the UK - argue that it should reflect the tough austerity policies adopted nationally. But net beneficiaries, such as the new member states in Central and Eastern Europe, oppose EU cuts to key areas like agriculture and infrastructure projects.EU spending is a small fraction of what the national governments spend in total, but those governments have to pay for big public sector areas like education and health, which are largely outside the EU's remit.</body>

      <body>British Gas is to increase prices for domestic customers, with a dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2% from 23 November.The increase, which will affect nearly eight million households in the UK, includes an 8.4% rise in gas prices and a 10.4% increase in electricity prices.The company said it "understands the frustration" of prices rising faster than incomes. The average annual household bill will go up by £123.PM David Cameron has urged consumers to switch suppliers for the best deal.Energy Minister Ed Davey has described the latest price rise as "extremely disappointing news" for customers.Rival SSE has already announced an 8.2% increase in bills from 15 November.On average, customers will see a dual-fuel bill increase to £1,444 a year.However, there are significant regional variations. On average, the biggest increase in a dual-fuel bill is an 11.2% rise in the north of Scotland, in the Scottish Hydro Electric region. The smallest is a 6.8% increase in the south west of England.The company said that the cost of buying energy on the global markets, delivering gas and electricity to customers' homes, and the government's "green" levies, were all factors in the decision to put up prices."I know these are difficult times for many customers and totally understand the frustration that so many household costs keep on rising when incomes are not keeping pace," said Ian Peters, managing director of British Gas Residential Energy."We haven't taken this decision lightly, but what is pushing up energy prices at the moment are costs that are not all directly under our control."The company, which operates as Scottish Gas in Scotland, said it made a profit of five pence in the pound after tax.British Gas, the UK's biggest energy supplier, said in May that a profit boost would be used to delay future price rises. This came because customers used 18% more gas in the first four months of the year owing to the cold weather.At the time, a spokesman said: "We will use that [cold weather benefit] to effectively hold prices for as long as possible."Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%.Caroline Flint, shadow energy secretary, said: "These latest price rises show clearer than ever why Labour's price freeze is needed." Party leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election.But the prime minister branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas.Mr Cameron also said he was disappointed with the British Gas' announcement."I would encourage customers who are not happy with the service they're getting, are not happy with the prices, to go to the switching sites online and see whether they can get a better deal," he said.Pressed on whether the government could do more to tackle the underlying issues, Mr Cameron added: "What we can do, which is what we are doing, is to try to get new suppliers into the market."Energy Minister Ed Davey also described the latest price rise as "extremely disappointing news" for customers of British Gas. He questioned the claim that costs imposed by the government were increasing as much as bills and told the Commons that unhappy consumers should consider switching suppliers.However, industry analysts expect other suppliers to announce price rises in the coming weeks, which could affect consumers' switching decisions."The question now is whether it will be a trickle or a stampede. However, the fact is that households will be struggling to afford to keep warm this winter," said Tom Lyon, of price comparison website Uswitch.com.Personal finance commentator and campaigner Martin Lewis said it was important that, if consumers do decide to switch, they should focus on fixed rate tariffs.Because only two of the energy companies have currently put their prices up, those who switch now are likely to be hit with price rises if they switch to another variable rate tariff.He said people can "beat the price hikes" by going to fixed tariffs.Adam Scorer, of watchdog Consumer Futures, said: "We would urge anyone worried about their energy costs to shop around to try to find a better deal and ensure they are on the cheapest payment method, such as direct debit."There are also some discounted insulation and heating measures available and we would encourage people to take advantage of this to cut their bills."Mr Davey said that British Gas would need to justify its decision "openly and transparently".Many of British Gas's customers made their annoyance at the price rise known during a Twitter question and answer session with customer service Bert Pijls earlier this afternoon.</body>

      <title>Muslim free school 'dysfunctional'</title>
      <description>A Muslim free school in Derby is criticised by Ofsted inspectors as "dysfunctional" and rated inadequate in every category,</description>

      <body>A Muslim free school has been damned by Ofsted inspectors as "dysfunctional" and rated inadequate in every category - within a year of it opening.An inspection at Derby's Al-Madinah school was brought forward after fears were raised over teaching standards.The report says teachers there are inexperienced and have not been provided with proper training and that the school requires special measures.The school said it accepted the report and would use it to move forward.Reacting to the findings, David Cameron told BBC Radio Derby: "If they don't take immediate action to deal with these things then I think it is right it should close and I think it's absolutely right to intervene rapidly when these things aren't working properly."However, he added: "Let's not use this as a stick with which to beat the whole free school movement - there are now hundreds of schools which have set up as free schools, and on average they have more outstanding and good ratings than established schools."When it goes wrong - just as with a state school - you've got to get in there and sort it out, or close it down," he said.The Ofsted inspection had been due to take place by the end of the year but was prioritised following initial allegations that female teachers were obliged to wear hijabs and boys and girls were segregated.The school has since written to pupils and staff telling them there is no requirement to cover their hair.Education minister Lord Nash last week warned the school it faced closure unless discrimination against female staff and pupils stopped.A spokesperson said: "We were already investigating this school before allegations became public. We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection."We have received a response from the Al-Madinah Education Trust as well as a report on the school from Ofsted. Any decisions made will take into account all the available evidence."The Ofsted report found that pupils were given the same work "regardless of their different abilities" and the governing body was "ineffective".It said basic systems were not in place, describing the school as being "in chaos" and "dysfunctional".Boys and girls had different lunch sittings but the report said this was due to the small size of the canteen.Inspectors gave the school the lowest ranking - "inadequate" - in every area, prompting the chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw to call for it to be placed in special measures.This means Ofsted will carry out inspections at the school at short notice to monitor improvements. If poor performance continues the school could be closed.Dr Stuart Wilson, the acting head teacher, said there were "significant and serous problems" at the school and accepted some of the lessons were not meeting necessary standards."Are special measures a disaster for the school? Yes, they are," said Dr Wilson."It's not where we want the school to be at this time but we accept the report."In one mathematics lesson, described by Ofsted as "insufficiently challenging", pupils spent the majority of their time cutting out and pasting shapes.Dr Wilson said the school, which has 412 pupils aged between four and 16, had a lot of issues to deal with but he insisted it did have a future."Obviously the report doesn't make pleasant reading for anybody - we don't want to be in this position - we wish we weren't in this position - but what we need to do now is to accept the report in full and use it to move the school forward."Writing to the school's chair of governors on Thursday, Lord Nash said the Ofsted report was "further compelling evidence of the breaches of the funding agreement I have required you to address"."Contrary to your suggestion that I have acted prematurely, I am even more convinced of the need for very decisive and urgent action on the part of the trust to comply with all your obligations and remedy the serious failings at the school."Chris Williamson, MP for Derby North, said: "Frankly, the position of Al-Madinah school is now untenable and I would fully expect the school to close and for the children to be found alternative places in the council schools in the city."Speaking in Parliament earlier, shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said the Ofsted report was a "devastating blow to the education secretary's flagship policy".He said: "It reveals that pupils have been failed on every possible measure and parents will want to know why the education secretary has allowed this to happen."He described the government's free school programme as a "dangerous free-for-all"."David Cameron and Michael Gove can no longer ignore this issue - it is a crisis entirely of their own making," he said.But speaking at the weekend, Mr Hunt told BBC One's Andrew Marr programme that although Labour would not open new free schools "along the Michael Gove model", the bulk of existing free schools would be kept open as his party wanted to "keep the good free schools".Responding to Mr Hunt's more recent comments, the schools minister David Laws said that the government had taken "swift action" to deal with failings at the Al-Madinah free school told MPs that no school would be allowed to "languish in failure".He also accused Labour of "total and utter opportunism" using the report "to shift its position".</body>

      <description>US government employees head back to work after President Barack Obama signed a law ending a government shutdown and extending the US debt limit.</description>

      <body>Hundreds of thousands of US government employees are heading back to work after President Barack Obama signed a law ending a 16-day government shutdown and extending the US debt limit.The cross-party deal came hours before the US government risked running out of money to pay its bills."There are no winners," Mr Obama said, adding the US would "bounce back".The deal followed 16 days of partial government shutdown, which began when Congress failed to agree on a budget.Congress voted through the deal less than a day before a deadline to raise the $16.7tn (£10.5tn) debt limit.The measure approved in Washington funds the government to 15 January, and extends the US treasury department's borrowing authority until 7 February.The deal does not resolve the budgetary issues that fiercely divide Republicans and Democrats. Instead, it establishes a cross-party committee of legislators tasked with crafting a long-term budget deal over the coming months.A faction of Republicans in the hardline Tea Party movement had pushed for the confrontation as a way to gut Mr Obama's healthcare reform.However, Mr Obama and the Democrats refused to negotiate, and the law commonly known as Obamacare escaped relatively unscathed.On Thursday, Mr Obama thanked congressional leaders for their help ending the government shutdown and raising the debt limit, but said both had "inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy"."Nothing has done more to undermine our economy the last three years than the kind of tactics that create these kinds of manufactured crises," he said.Mr Obama said politicians had to stop listening to "talking heads" and activists "who profit from conflict" and instead focus on growing the economy and creating a responsible budget."The American people are completely fed up with Washington," he said. "How business is done in this town has to change."Mr Obama called the political crises "a spectacle" which had hurt America's credibility in the world.And to the conservative Republicans who pushed the showdown as a way to extract policy concessions, he said, "Go out there and win an election."Politicians, bankers and economists had warned of global economic calamity unless an agreement to raise the US government's borrowing limit were reached.IMF head Christine Lagarde's positive response to the news was tempered by a call for further action."It will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner," she said in a statement.Economists have estimated the shutdown cost the US economy billions of dollars.The shutdown affected Americans and visitors to the US in countless ways: most national parks were closed, medical research ground to a halt, and ordinary paperwork went unfinished, delaying visa applications, business permits and safety inspections.Hundreds of thousands of employees were put on leave without pay during the shutdown, with many forced to delay purchases or even payment of routine bills. A few days into the shutdown Congress passed a law ensuring they would receive back pay.Before dawn on Thursday, the US Office of Personnel Management, which manages the federal workforce, announced in a terse statement on its website that government workers should return to work as regularly scheduled.A senior manager at the Department of the Interior, which oversees the national parks system and other public land, reminded employees to disable "out of office" email messages, change voicemail prompts, and "check on any refrigerators and throw out any perished food"."We appreciate your sacrifices through these difficult times and we understand that the lapse in government activities has imposed hardships on you, your families, and the people we serve," Rhea Suh, assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, wrote.Federal workers returning to the downtown Washington DC office of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were greeted by Vice-President Joe Biden and a welcome note from their boss, agency head Gina McCarthy."I know the past couple of weeks have been difficult, especially for families," Ms McCarthy wrote. "Let me be one of the first to welcome you back to EPA and tell you that we have certainly missed you!"A security officer at the building said the shutdown had been "depressing" and had made her realise how much she enjoyed her job."I enjoy checking in 500 people every day," said Ettereteen Welch.Spurred on by hardline conservatives, congressional Republicans forced the stand-off by linking budget measures to healthcare reform.Despite reluctant support from the House Republican leadership for the bill approved on Wednesday, most of the party's lawmakers in the House voted against it.Among those who opposed it was chairman of the House budget committee Paul Ryan, who called the deal a "missed opportunity"."Today's legislation won't help us reduce our fast-growing debt," he said."In my judgement, this isn't a breakthrough. We're just kicking the can down the road."Republican Senator John McCain told the BBC he was "very relieved" that the political crisis had ended."I'm guardedly optimistic and confident that we won't revisit it this way again," he said."The reaction of the American people is very, very negative, and understandably so."</body>

      <description>Working parents in Britain no longer earn enough to "escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn warns in his first report.</description>

      <body>Working parents in Britain "simply do not earn enough to escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn has warned.Two-thirds of poor children are now from families where an adult works, his report found.Many low and middle-income children face being "worse off" than their parents because of falling earnings and rising prices, Mr Milburn added.Wealthier pensioners' benefits should be cut and minimum pay raised, he said.The former Labour health secretary suggested some benefits currently protected from cuts - such as free TV licences and winter fuel allowances for pensioners - could be means tested in order to share the burden of austerity more fairly.But a spokesman for David Cameron said: "The prime minister believes it is right to make commitments to pensioners in relationship to state provision."The government has pledged to safeguard such benefits until the next general election.In its first report, the government's Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission warned the target of ending child poverty by 2020 would "in all likelihood be missed by a considerable margin" - leaving as many as two million children in poverty.Poverty is defined as having a household income that is less than 60% of the national median income.The latest government figures on poverty, released in June, show the median UK household income for 2011/2012 was £427 a week - 60% of that figure was £256 a week.In that year, 17% of children, or 2.3 million, were classed as being in poverty while 15% of working-age adults, or 5.6 million, were in poverty.For pensioners, meanwhile, that figures was 16% - or 1.9 million.The report said Britain still had "high levels of child poverty and low levels of social mobility" with a rising number of children in "absolute poverty" coming from working families.Two thirds of children officially deemed as being poor now came from a family where at least one parent was working - and in three out of four of those cases, at least one of their parents was working full time, the report found.It also said the "twin problems of high youth unemployment and falling living standards" were storing up problems for the future.Among its key recommendations the report urged the government to:"Just as the UK government has focused on reducing the country's financial deficit it now needs to redouble its efforts to reduce our country's fairness deficit," the report said.Single mother Judith Healy, who works from home as a telemarketer, said that, while her wages had not gone up, her expenses had continued to increase.She said she was worried about paying energy bills this winter."We didn't ask to get in this situation, we are doing the best that we can in the circumstances that we have and that's really what it's about - it's survival now," she told BBC News.Mr Milburn told the BBC: "Today child poverty is a problem for working families rather than the workless or the work-shy."Around five million people in the country, mainly women, were earning less than the living wage, which is about £7.45 an hour outside of London, he said."These are the people frankly who do all the right things, they go out to work, they stand on their own two feet, they look after their families - they're the strivers not the shirkers - and yet they're all too often the forgotten people of Britain and I think they desperately need a new deal."Mr Milburn said that while ministers and employers could do more, it was unrealistic to expect the government to continue topping up low pay using working tax credits.He advocated a scheme for pairing bright children with the best teachers in an effort to raise attainment.Mr Milburn has previously said social mobility - the idea that individuals can better themselves in terms of educational opportunity, job prospects and salaries from one generation to the next - is "flat-lining".Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg welcomed the report, but warned that "punishing pensioners isn't going to help a single child achieve more in life".Enver Solomon, of the National Children's Bureau charity, said the report was "a wake-up call for all political parties by stating that our country is dramatically polarised between the haves and have- nots"."As the commission states, there is an urgent need to rebalance the distribution of resources so that the burden of austerity is more equally shared," he said.Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said the "powerful report" showed "ordinary families' living standards [were being] squeezed and social divisions [were] deepening as a result of this government's decisions to put a privileged few first".On Wednesday, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed the number of unemployed people in the UK fell by 18,000 to 2.49 million in the June-August period.</body>

      <title>Osborne agrees to China nuclear deal</title>
      <description>The Chancellor, George Osborne, announces that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.</description>

      <body>The Chancellor, George Osborne, has announced that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.The announcement also said that Chinese firms might eventually be allowed to take majority stakes in British nuclear plants.Mr Osborne made the announcement on the last day of a trade visit to China.The first China deal could be as early as next week, with the go ahead for a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site.Also on Thursday, a report commissioned for the prime minister warned of a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years.The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits".Supply is expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15.Most existing coal-fired plants are expected to be closed in 2015 to meet European Union pollution directives, while many gas-fired power plants are not being used at the moment because gas is so expensive.These would take time and money to bring back on stream.The Hinkley C project, in Somerset, will be the first new nuclear power station since 1995.Hinkley C's construction will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EDF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs.EDF has been negotiating with three Chinese nuclear giants on the Hinkley C project - CGN, CNNC and SNPTC - all of which have been seen by the chancellor this week.Our business editor, Robert Peston, says he has been told that one or two of these will end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C.A DECC spokesperson said talks about a contract were underway: "Negotiations remain ongoing between the government and EDF on the potential terms of an investment contract for Hinkley Point C. No agreement has as yet been reached."A contract will only be offered if it is value for money, fair and affordable, in line with government policy on no public subsidy for new nuclear and consistent with state-aid rules."Mr Osborne made the announcement while on a visit to a nuclear plant in southern China on Thursday which is itself a collaboration between EDF and the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG).He said: "Today is another demonstration of the next big step in the relationship between Britain and China, the world's oldest civil nuclear power and the world's fastest growing civil nuclear power."The memorandum of understanding also includes roles for British companies in China's nuclear programme.China has 17 nuclear reactors in operation, which provide about 1% of its electricity production capacity.In the future, Chinese firms might be allowed more than just minority stakes in UK plants. The government said that "over time, stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes".At the weekend, the Energy Minister, Ed Davey, said he believed that a "massive" wave of investment from China, Japan and Korea would secure UK's power supply into the future.Securing future energy supplies is a major challenge.A portion of energy bills is being diverted to alternative energy investment in wind farms and solar energy.But these, renewable, energy sources cannot provide enough power for the country's energy needs.The industry regulator, Ofgem, has also warned of the "unprecedented challenge" to secure power supplies.It said spare electricity power production capacity could fall to 2% by 2015, increasing the risk of blackouts.</body>

      <body>Campaign group Amnesty International has urged Iran not to go ahead with a repeat execution for a drug smuggler who survived a botched hanging.The condemned man, named as Alireza M, was found alive in a morgue after being hanged at a jail in the north-eastern city of Bojnord last week.He is now being nursed to recovery in preparation for his repeat execution."The verdict was the death sentence, and it will be carried out once the man gets well again," an official said.Human rights groups believe Iran is second only to China in the number of people it puts to death for crimes ranging from murder and rape to spying and drug-trafficking.In a separate incident reported by Iranian media on Monday, relatives of a condemned murderer in the western province of Ilam tried to stop his execution at a prison by hurling a grenade.Around 30 people were injured but the hanging went ahead.Alireza M, 37, was left to hang for 12 minutes, after which a doctor declared him dead.But when the prisoner's family went to collect his body from the prison morgue the next day, they found he was still breathing."We found him alive again, which made his two daughters very happy," an unnamed family member told Iranian state media.The man was then moved to a hospital where he was being kept under armed guard."The horrific prospect of this man facing a second hanging, after having gone through the whole ordeal already once, merely underlines the cruelty and inhumanity of the death penalty," said Philip Luther, director of Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa Programme, in a press release.He called for both a stay of execution for the hanging survivor and a moratorium on all executions in Iran.According to Amnesty, at least 508 people may have been executed in Iran this year to date. Most of those killed had been convicted of drug trafficking, it said.</body>

      <body>Six British soldiers who died in an Afghan bomb blast claimed by the Taliban were "unlawfully killed on active service", a coroner has ruled.The six men were on patrol in a Warrior armoured vehicle when it was caught in an explosion on 6 March last year.Recording a narrative verdict, Oxfordshire coroner Darren Salter said there was "nothing their comrades could have done to rescue or save them".A series of improvements have been made to Warriors since the incident.Sgt Nigel Coupe, 33, of 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, was killed alongside Cpl Jake Hartley, 20, Pte Anthony Frampton, 20, Pte Christopher Kershaw, 19, Pte Daniel Wade, 20, and Pte Daniel Wilford, 21, all of 3rd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment.The attack, which was so powerful it turned their vehicle upside down and blew off its gun turret, was the biggest single loss of life in an enemy attack for UK Afghanistan forces since 2001.The inquest heard evidence from pathologists who said the men were likely to have been killed or rendered unconscious immediately by the blast.Mr Salter said: "This, of course, is a tragic loss of these six soldiers and these young lives."At least it is very clear from the evidence of the two pathologists and the evidence of those who witnessed the strike that they did not suffer."He said he was "not going to second-guess decisions of commanders in a courtroom today; that is not the purpose of an inquest"."These are experienced commanders who took decisions on the ground, balancing the risks and exercising judgements," he added.Oxford Coroner's Court heard on Thursday from Warrior expert Maj Douglas Nelson who said it had been "a very large device - and what I would say is, no vehicle that we had was designed to take that"."It was a large device - the effects were worse than what we anticipated," he added.He said that, while the Mastiff armoured vehicle was specifically designed with improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in mind, the Warrior was "infinitely more capable" of fighting at night, when the attack took place."Of any vehicle, I would travel in Warrior," he said."It's as good as we can make it."He said improvements made to the vehicles since the attack included thicker armour, better fire-fighting and detection systems and an improved fuel tank.</body>

      <body>Doctors treating obese or overweight patients should be "respectful" and "non-blaming", advice to the NHS says.The draft guidance is published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).It also suggests obese patients be referred to weight-loss programmes, including those run by commercial companies, to help them lose weight.Obesity increases the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes and costs the NHS more than £5bn each year.Just over a quarter of adults in England are classed as obese and a further 41% of men and 33% of women as overweight.The NICE document, which is subject to a three-month consultation, suggests all health professionals dealing with overweight or obese people should monitor their tone in order to "minimise harm".It states all healthcare professionals should "be aware of the effort needed to lose weight and avoid further weight gain and the stigma adults who are overweight or obese may feel or experience".It adds: "Ensure the tone and content of all communications or dialogue is respectful and non-blaming."The terminology used to describe the person's condition should respect individual preferences."NHS care providers should also ensure equipment and facilities "meet the needs of most adults who are overweight or obese".Those overseeing NHS weight management programmes should tell patients how much weight they can "realistically" expect to lose, and that no programme is a "magic bullet", the document says.Instead, stress should be put on the "importance of making gradual, long-term changes to their eating habits and physical activity and how much weight they might realistically expect to lose in total and on a weekly basis if they adhere to the programme".Prof Mike Kelly, director of the Centre for Public Health at NICE, said: "Being overweight or obese can have serious consequences for an individual's health, not only physically with increased risk of high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, but it can also affect their mental health as a result of stigma and bullying or discrimination."He added: "This draft guidance isn't about quick fixes, it is about ensuring lifestyle weight management services support people in the long-term."Programmes that address diet, activity and behaviour change can help people who are obese lose weight, but they are only cost-effective if the weight is kept off."Tam Fry, a spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, said most health professionals were not trained in how to raise weight issues effectively."The abrupt style that many have taken so far has only made matters worse," he said."NICE is correct to say they should be moderate in their tone. But once they've got the tone right and the confidence of the patient, they should really think about tough love."It's essential that patients realise that the consequences of putting on weight are very serious."Thembi Nkala, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: "Being overweight or obese can have serious consequences for your heart health."However, taking control of your weight can be a daunting task because changing the habits of a lifetime is often a challenge."That's why it's a good idea to get support throughout your weight loss journey, which could include joining a support group."</body>

      <title>'Biggest shift' in abuse guidance</title>
      <description>New guidance on the prosecution of cases involving child sexual abuse, described as the biggest shift in attitude "for a generation", has been been published.</description>

      <body>Final guidance on the prosecution of cases involving child sexual abuse in England and Wales has been published.Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said it represented the biggest shift in attitude across the criminal justice system "for a generation".Under the guidelines, prosecutors are told to focus on the credibility of allegations, not on whether victims make good witnesses.All suspects will also be investigated to see if they possess indecent images.The guidelines cover how victims should be treated and how a case should be built and presented in court.The BBC's legal correspondent Clive Coleman said it was "something of a watershed moment".Victims have previously been disbelieved or discouraged, he said, but the new guidelines represented a move towards a "more sophisticated knowledge of psychology".A list of "myths and stereotypes" about behaviour previously thought to negatively impact the credibility of young victims has also been included, so the use of such preconceptions can be challenged in court by prosecutors.The list includes inconsistencies in what the victim remembers and whether they were drunk or wearing revealing clothes.A joint protocol for information sharing in child sexual abuse cases has also been published alongside the guidelines, in which police and prosecutors are expected to share information with social services, schools and family courts.The publishing of the final guidelines follows a three-month public consultation and takes immediate effect. The information for joint protocol will come into force in England and Wales on 1 January 2014.Changes were sought after there were complaints that too many cases had been dropped before trial because of fears that the allegations would not stand up to scrutiny.One of the most serious recent prosecutions of sex abuse and street grooming - in which 10 men were convicted - was initially shelved because of doubts over the credibility of the victims as witnesses.TV and radio presenter Jimmy Savile was not prosecuted when he was alive and, more recently, a row erupted after a prosecutor called a 13-year-old victim "predatory".Mr Starmer said: "For too long, child sexual abuse cases have been plagued by myths about how 'real' victims behave which simply do not withstand scrutiny."The days of the model victim are over. From now on these cases will be investigated and prosecuted differently, whatever the vulnerabilities of the victim."Mr Starmer said that because the guidelines were the result of discussions with judges, the police, experts, victims' representatives and the government, they would "stand the test of time".He said that because "possession of indecent images of children has been found to be a common feature" of child sexual abuse cases the police would now investigate it in every case of child sexual abuse.The guidelines will also highlight a number of ways victims of abuse can be manipulated and blackmailed to keep quiet, which include threats to publish indecent images or implicating victims in other offences.They also seek to raise awareness of how victims in some ethnic communities are controlled by offenders who might use notions of "honour" or "shame" to deter them.Shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry said it was not clear how much of the guidance would actually get used in practice."These proposals are a welcome effort to correct the over-cautious stance the CPS took in the Jimmy Savile and street-grooming cases," she said."However, the guidance contains a lot more 'shoulds' than 'musts' which makes it far from certain how much of this will actually get implemented."The NSPCC's Alan Wardle said the changes "will start to make a positive difference for child sex abuse prosecutions which in the past have been dogged by difficulties".The Deputy Children's Commissioner for England, Sue Berelowitz, said the CPS had "worked hard to improve the experiences of child witnesses and increase the likelihood of securing convictions by ensuring that judges and juries better understand the psychological and emotional impact on victims of their appalling experiences".The Chief Executive of the Survivors Trust, Fay Maxted, welcomed the new approach. She told BBC Radio 5 Live: "It is at least now saying that we need to stop focusing on questioning whether the victim is telling the truth and actually look at what they're saying has happened and investigate that."</body>

      <body>Pollutants in the air we breathe have been classed as a leading environmental cause of cancer by the World Health Organization.It said the evidence was clear they cause lung cancer.Sources of pollution include car exhausts, power stations, emissions from agriculture and industry - as well as heating in people's homes.The WHO said the classification should act as a strong message to governments to take action.The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a part of the WHO, has now classed air pollution in the same category as tobacco smoke, UV radiation and plutonium.It said air pollution had been know to cause heart and lung diseases, but evidence had now emerged that it was also causing cancer.The IARC said the most recent data suggested 223,000 deaths from lung cancer around the world were caused by air pollution.More than half of the deaths were thought to be in China and other East Asian countries. Rapid industrialisation has led to smoggy skies in cities such as Beijing.However, it is a global problem and concerns about air pollution were raised in Europe again this week.Data suggests there may also be a link with bladder cancer.Dr Kurt Straif, from IARC, said: "The air we breathe has become polluted with a mixture of cancer-causing substances."We now know that outdoor air pollution is not only a major risk to health in general, but also a leading environmental cause of cancer deaths."Cancer Research UK said it was not a surprise.Dr Julie Sharp, the head of health information at the charity, said: "It's important that people keep the risk from air pollution in perspective."Although air pollution increases the risk of developing lung cancer by a small amount, other things have a much bigger effect on our risk, particularly smoking."Dr Rachel Thompson, head of research interpretation at the World Cancer Research Fund International, said: "This latest evidence confirms the need for government, industry and multinational bodies to urgently address environmental causes of cancer."But there's also a lot we can do as individuals to lower our chances of developing the disease such as being more physically active and adopting a healthier diet."</body>

      <body>SNP leader Alex Salmond opened his party's conference by saying he believed people would choose the "hope of yes" rather than the "fears of no".The first minister's speech comes with the Scottish independence referendum 11 months away.He told delegates in Perth that Thursday 18 September 2014 was Scotland's "date with destiny".On that day, voters will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country".Mr Salmond said that the people of Scotland had their biggest opportunity to choose a better future.He told delegates on the first day of the four-day conference: "I believe that people will choose the hope of a yes vote, rather than the fear offered by no."And no-one now denies the reality that Scotland has got what it takes to be a successful, independent country."We know that 'project fear' - as people in the no campaign christened it - will say anything to talk down Scotland's abilities."They peddle nonsense such as mobile phone roaming charges after independence, the threat to annex Faslane, no whisky in embassies - nonsense which even they are forced to retract."The party leader went on to say that people in the no camp could not deny the economic viability and potential of "people-talented, resource-rich Scotland".He added that per head of population, Scotland had more top universities than any other country; was the EU's largest oil producer and had a thriving creative industries sector.Mr Salmond said: "When even the most bitter opponents of Scottish independence agree that Scotland has got what it takes, then it's clear that the only thing people have to fear is 'project fear' itself."At the start of his conference speech, Mr Salmond addressed the on-going dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant.He confirmed that he would be holding further talks with both the facility's operator Ineos and the Unite union.The facility remains shut down despite Unite calling off a planned strike.</body>

      <body>A former BBC radio presenter described as a "dominant predator" has been found guilty of sexually abusing boys.Ex-BBC Radio Norfolk and Radio Clyde broadcaster Michael Souter, 60, was convicted of 19 sexual assaults on seven boys aged between 11 and 16.Souter was a Venture Scouts leader, a volunteer mentor to young people and was even allowed to adopt a child.Judge Mark Lucraft warned him he faced "a long period of imprisonment" when he is sentenced on 31 October.Souter, of Loddon, Norfolk, stared straight ahead without emotion as the judge spoke.The jury at Norwich Crown Court also found him guilty of seven counts of making and possessing indecent images of under-18s, after a six-week trial.The court heard Souter used his celebrity status to abuse his victims.He carried out the attacks between 1979 and 1999.The jury of nine men and three women took three hours to reach verdicts.Det Con Peter Sayer, who led the Norfolk Police investigation, said: "Souter used various opportunities to abuse children whilst being in a position of absolute trust."Chris McCann, head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) complex casework unit for the East of England, said: "Michael Souter presented himself to people as a local celebrity from radio and television, happy to be involved in charity events, the Scout movement and as a youth mentor for Norfolk social services."All this was a smokescreen to hide his true intention: to become close to young boys so he could sexually abuse them, confident that his celebrity status would mean they would not be believed."A BBC spokesperson said: "The crimes that Michael Souter has been found guilty of today are truly shocking and the BBC condemns them in the strongest possible terms."Michael Souter has not worked for the BBC since the early 1990s."</body>

      <title>FA supports Hodgson over 'joke'</title>
      <description>The Football Association says England boss Roy Hodgson has its full support after claims he made an offensive joke.</description>

      <body>The Football Association has given its "full support" to Roy Hodgson after claims a comment made in a team-talk by the England manager caused offence.Hodgson was criticised for referring to a joke about a monkey and an astronaut at half-time in Tuesday's World Cup qualifier against Poland."He has and deserves the full support of the Football Association," FA chairman Greg Dyke said.Anti-racism campaigners Kick It Out praised the FA's "swift" response.It had called for an investigation into Hodgson's comments but, after the FA confirmed it had not received any complaints from the England players, it now considered the matter closed.A Kick It Out statement read: "We are pleased that the Football Association has investigated this matter swiftly and issued its findings immediately."If there has been no complaint on the back of the investigation then the matter can only be deemed as concluded."Kick It Out acts on behalf of the football community at large and when an allegation of a racist or discriminatory nature is made, it's the organisation's role to follow this up."Hodgson was reported  to have made the comments when trying to explain to right-back Chris Smalling that he needed to pass the ball to winger Andros Townsend more.The England manager later apologised and Townsend, 22, tweeted:  "I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken!"Dyke added: "Roy Hodgson is a man of the highest integrity, an honourable man who is doing a great job with the England team."He has fully explained to us what he said and the point he was making to the players in the dressing room at half-time on Tuesday night. He has also explained the context in which he made his remarks."He has made clear there was no intent to say anything inappropriate, and he was certainly not making any comments with any racist connotation. Importantly, he has apologised for any unintended offence that may have been taken."We will be making no further comment on this story and will now be giving Roy and the team our full support as we prepare for the World Cup in Brazil."England striker Wayne Rooney also showed his support for 66-year-old Hodgson on Twitter,  and via his personal website:  "To be honest it's really annoying that something such as this should see the light of day."All the lads know what type of guy Roy is, and to try and pin some form of label on him is absolutely ridiculous. Roy spoke to Andros straight away, and he took no offence whatsoever. Hopefully that's now the end of the matter."Former England striker Stan Collymore, 42, also defended the former Fulham and West Brom boss on Twitter,  suggesting the row undermines moves to eradicate racism from the sport."Demeans every anti-racism campaigner by having cheap pop at RH [Roy Hodgson] who said nothing wrong. Makes campaigners seem over-PC and petty. They're not," he said.However, Piara Powar, executive director of Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare), told the BBC that Hodgson had got it wrong."This was a silly phrase to use in a diverse workforce," said Powar."I think some players will see it as a reflection of the type of language still used by some coaches and some attitudes that still prevail."Here is the basis of the joke which Roy Hodgson is reported to have told his players. However, it is unclear if this is the exact transcript."Nasa decided they'd finally send a man up in a capsule after sending only monkeys in the earlier missions."They fire the man and the monkey into space."The intercom crackles, 'Monkey, fire the retros.'"A little later, 'Monkey, check the solid fuel supply.'"Later still, "Monkey, check the life support systems for the man.'"The astronaut takes umbrage and radioes Nasa, 'When do I get to do something?'"Nasa replies, 'In 15 minutes - feed the monkey.'"</body>

      <body>Prince William has hosted his first investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace.Among those honoured were Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, who was presented with an OBE.It represented an extension of the Duke of Cambridge's public duties after he left the Royal Air Force last month.Standing in for the Queen, William presented awards recognising achievements in a wide range of fields to recipients from across the UK.Andy Murray was on time for the ceremony despite tweeting that he had been held up by a random drugs test."In the middle of a drug test hahaha I'm goin to be late!!!" he wrote.Vicar Of Dibley producer Jon Plowman was also made an OBE by the prince, while broadcaster Aled Jones became an MBE for services to music, broadcasting and charity. Conservationist Helen Butler received an MBE.Around 25 such ceremonies are held every year, either in the ballroom at Buckingham Palace, the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh or at Windsor Castle.The majority are hosted by the Queen but some investitures are carried out by the Prince of Wales or Princess Royal.Prince William already carries out engagements connected to his charitable interests and those of the Royal Foundation he is joint patron of with the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.Following the end of a military career that has occupied the prince since January 2006, the full shape of his public duties has yet to be decided.The next year has been described as "transitional" by palace officials as the duke prepares to become a full-time royal.He plans to expand his conservation work, particularly on the protection of endangered species, through his Royal Foundation.</body>

      <body>England coach Steve McNamara has named only one Burgess brother to start the friendly against Italy on Saturday.Loose forward Sam takes his place in the pack as England finalise their preparations for the World Cup,  which kicks off on 26 October.Uncapped brother George is named on the bench while his twin Tom faces Samoa for England Knights instead.Three of the four Burgess brothers were named in McNamara's 24-man squad, with oldest brother Luke missing out.Sam, George and Tom would become the first set of three siblings to appear on the pitch together for England - although that cannot now happen against Italy.Warrington Wolves forward Ben Westwood misses out on the friendly - England's first meeting with Italy - as he serves a one-match ban for a deliberate punch in the Super League Grand Final defeat by Wigan Warriors this month.Wigan captain Sean O'Loughlin will also miss the match, which kicks off at 16:30 BST at the Salford City Stadium.Zak Hardaker will join Tom Burgess in the development side, who will open up the double-header at 14:00 BST when they take on Samoa."We are delighted to be playing against Italy in the historic international," McNamara said."Italy have made tremendous progress and are well equipped with quality players representing them from the NRL and Super League."And he said he was confident England were well set for the friendly and the World Cup to follow."The make-up of the side looks very exciting, with the right blend of youth and experience," he said."Our preparation has been first-class and we have trained exceptionally well at our camp in Potchefstroom, South Africa."This is the best prepared side to come from England and we are ready for what promises to be the most competitive World Cup in history."Sydney Roosters captain Anthony Minichiello, 33, is the star name in Italy's team and he will line up alongside younger brother Mark, the Gold Coast Titans forward, in a side boasting plenty of NRL experience but sprinkled with raw youngsters.Head coach Carlo Napolitano intends to give all 24 of his squad members a run-out, with the exception of forward Kade Snowden, who is banned.England: Sam Tomkins (Wigan), Hall (Leeds), Ablett (Leeds), Cudjoe (Huddersfield), Briscoe (Hull FC); Chase (Castleford), Sinfield (c) (Leeds); Graham (Canterbury Bulldogs), McIlorum (Wigan), Mossop (Wigan), Hock (Widnes), Farrell (Wigan), Sam Burgess (South Sydney Rabbitohs).Replacements: Charnley (Wigan), Watkins (Leeds), Widdop (Melbourne Storm), Burrow (Leeds) Hill (Warrington), Roby (St Helens), George Burgess (South Sydney Rabbitohs)England Knights: Makinson (St Helens), Thornley (Wigan), Jones (St Helens), Hardaker (Leeds), Cockayne (Wakefield), Sarginson (London Broncos), Powell (Wigan); Tom Burgess (South Sydney), Hodgson (Hull KR), Taylor (Wigan), Ferres (Huddersfield), Whitehead (Catalan Dragons), Crosby (Wigan).Replacements: Green (Hull), Hughes (Wigan), Lawrence (Huddersfield), Dixon (London Broncos), Singleton (Leeds), Bowden (Hull), Logan Tomkins (Wigan).</body>

      <body>England will not be one of the top eight seeds at next year's World Cup in Brazil after sealing qualification with a 2-0 win over Poland on Tuesday.Fifa's latest world rankings determined the top seeds for the 2014 tournament.England who climbed from 17th to 10th, will now have to face one of the top-ranked nations in their group matches.But boss Roy Hodgson says he is not worried whether his team is "first or second out of the hat" when the draw takes place on 6 December.The Netherlands, who were runners-up in 2010, and 2006 winners Italy are also unseeded.But Switzerland, Belgium and Colombia are, following the release of the rankings on Thursday by football's governing body.Hosts Brazil and the remaining top seven ranked qualifiers will be kept apart in the group stages of next year's tournament.Those groups will be completed by teams from three different geographical regions.England will have to face one of Brazil, Spain, Argentina, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Colombia and probably Uruguay.Uruguay's place in Brazil depends on them winning a play-off against Jordan, ranked 70, next month. If they are beaten in the two-legged tie, the Netherlands will take the final seed ahead of Italy.The rankings' emphasis on recent results rather than teams' record in major tournaments means 2010 World Cup runners-up Netherlands and 2006 winners Italy miss out on being kept apart from the other traditional powerhouses of world football.Barring a slump down the Fifa standings for any of the three, the Netherlands, Italy and England are likely to be kept apart as high-ranked fellow European nations.France coach Didier Deschamps, whose side have to win a two-legged play-off to make the finals after finishing second to Spain in their qualifying group, has criticised the system."From my point of view it's not very logical,'' said the former Chelsea midfielder.He added that it was a "double punishment" that his side were in Group I, the only European one with five rather than six teams, meaning they had two fewer matches to earn ranking points.As well as a seed and an unseeded European qualifier, each of the World Cup groups is likely to be completed by a team from a combined Asia, Oceania and North and Central America pot and one of the unseeded African and South American qualifiers or the lowest-ranked European qualifier.Spain remain at the top of the rankings, ahead of Germany who leapfrog Argentina to take second spot.Scotland have climbed 28 places to 35th in the world after beating Croatia and Macedonia in the final two games of their unsuccessful qualification campaign.Wales are up eight places to 44th in the wake of their 1-1 draw with Belgium, while Northern Ireland drop four places to 90th following their 1-1 draw away to Israel.</body>

      <body>There was disquiet across the land: a British team, winning Olympic gold, with more than half its members having grown up thousands of miles away.The year? 1936. And while the story of GB's successful ice hockey team at those Winter Olympics - with nine of its 13-strong squad living in Canada, speaking with Canadian accents and having no memory whatsoever of Britain - has long been forgotten, the contentious issue of national identity in the country's sporting teams skates on.Much of the debate is complicated, either by emotion or instinct, but there is one thing we can say with certainty: British teams have never, despite what the dewy-eyed and dogmatic would like to think, been the exclusive province of those born in Britain.A lamentable dilution of the national cause? Bearing in mind the birthplaces of such quintessentially English sporting heroes as Colin Cowdrey (Bangalore, India), Ted Dexter (Milan, Italy) and Bradley Wiggins (Ghent, Belgium), probably not. The first man to win a medal for Great Britain at a modern Olympics, way back in 1896, was Charles Gmelin, born in Krishnagar, India.Before we start battling through the politics and prejudices of who should be allowed to wear a national jersey, a little more on who legally can.If you hold a British passport, regardless of where you were born, you are eligible. So Tour de France winner Chris Froome (born in Kenya, schooled in South Africa, with a father and grandparents all born in Britain) rides for Great Britain, with considerable pride.The same applies to those born and raised overseas, only to subsequently move to the UK, with a British parent, as a child. Which is why Andrew Strauss (born in South Africa, moved to Australia aged six, arrived in southern England before his eighth birthday) could captain England's cricket team, why distance runner Mo Farah (born in Somalia, moved to Britain aged eight to live with his British-born father Mukhtar) wins Olympic and world doubles for Britain, why US Open golf champion Justin Rose (another born in South Africa, who moved to Hampshire aged five) is British not South African.Having an English, or Scottish, or Welsh, parent or grandparent is enough for both football and rugby's governing bodies, regardless of which passport the player themselves might hold. Of those who immigrate as adults, footballers become eligible for their adopted nation only after five years of continuous residency. The IRB  , rugby's governing body, stipulates a residency of just 36 months; the English and Wales Cricket Board seven years.It's this last category that fires the most argument. Residency might legally qualify you to play for England, or Scotland, or Team GB. But what of hearts and minds? What makes someone British enough to deserve to wear the shirt or parade the flag?Which is where the problems multiply.Identity is a complex, often illogical sense, rather than a simple set of universal rules. If each of us were asked to define Britishness, we'd come up with 60 million nuanced versions.It can't be purely political, or else we would have had one-party rule for the past century. It can't be a single language, or else you could count out large chunks of Wales. Cultural? Nine million people watched Downton Abbey last weekend. Millions more have never seen a single episode.Often our feelings about a stranger's national identity are based entirely on ourselves. Is that person like me, or people that I know? Do I recognise their version of my country?Perceptions of patriotism can be shaped by as little as accent, as much as logic. Tiffany Porter, 100m hurdles bronze medallist at this year's World Championships in Moscow, has held dual UK and US citizenship since birth. But her unmistakable American drawl has arguably made her harder for some athletics aficionados to accept, just as some boxing fans never forgave undisputed heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis (born in West Ham, raised in London) his Canadian inflection.Lewis provides an apposite example of how many modern Britons escape neat definition. His parents were Jamaican. Having come to east London as immigrants themselves, they moved the family to Ontario when he was 12.Lewis subsequently won both the world amateur junior title and an Olympic heavyweight gold for Canada, enough for some British fans to consider his colours forever nailed to the maple. But he says he always felt British, not least for the playground beatings his Cockney accent elicited when he first arrived in his new home, and he returned to the country of his birth as soon as he turned pro.Then there is the charged effect of ethnicity and religion. England wicketkeeper Matt Prior, born in Johannesburg to a South African mother and English father, moved to Sussex aged 11 - three years older than Farah was when he arrived in Hounslow.But it is under articles on the black, Muslim Farah that the comments sections are often dominated by unpleasant rows about his supposed Britishness, not those on Prior.This is not Prior's fault. But neither is it Farah's. He provided the perfect summation of his own identity in the moments after his 5,000m triumph at London 2012."This is where I grew up, this is where I started life. This is my country, and when I put on my Great Britain vest I'm proud. I'm very proud."Why the distrust of some immigrants in a national shirt? It is sometimes as if a sportsman not born in Britain must somehow care less about the nation's fortunes, or at least care for reasons we don't personally recognise, even though the shining example of NBA star Luol Deng (born in Sudan, granted political asylum with his family and subsequently raised in Brixton) shows often it is the refugee - with the most to lose, and the most to be thankful for - who cares the most.Why the distrust, in particular, of those who have arrived as adults?"He's only doing it for the money," comes one complaint. That this motive should be considered detrimental in sport, when it is positively lauded in other careers that immigrants may adopt, says as much about our own attachment to the outdated amateur ideals of long ago as it does about the athlete.It assumes someone who has come to Britain solely to play sport will somehow try a little less hard than someone born on these shores, even when the motivation of someone who has given up their life elsewhere to gamble all on a new existence could surely seldom be greater.There is the accusation of opportunism, as if ambition were bad for a sportsman, and as if opportunism wasn't exactly the sort of talent often lauded in the arena.Opportunism also runs both ways. Sporting governing bodies, particularly before the London Olympics, searched near and far for eligible talent, homegrown or otherwise. As a nation we wanted medals. As a nation we celebrated together when they came. So aren't we all complicit in the process, even if some might find it unsavoury?For all the kissing of badges and draping of flags, commitment to the national cause is a nebulous thing. Who has contributed more to the country, the sports star born overseas who then helps take their adopted team to the top of the world rankings, or the British-born hero who becomes a tax exile in Monaco to protect their earnings from being ploughed back into the society that nurtured them?Cricketer Kevin Pietersen came to Nottingham from Natal aged 20 - opportunistically, many would say, because he thought the quota system in the country of his birth would hold back his sporting ambitions.Next month in Brisbane, Pietersen should make his 100th Test appearance for England - more than Wally Hammond, more than Len Hutton, more than Peter May  or Ken Barrington. He has scored more runs across all forms of the international game than any other England player.Little could indicate greater commitment to the cause. But when Pietersen fails to contribute with bat, or falls out with his team-mates, it is his nationality and that switch that crop up in analysis again and again. Even approaching his Test landmark there is the sense he is appreciated rather than loved by England supporters.Where, too, to draw impenetrable national borders?Sporting success is only partly down to the raw abilities of players and athletes. The quality of coaching they receive can be transformative, which is why German-born Jurgen Grobler  is held in such high esteem by the 11 British rowers he has taken to Olympic gold (many of them, as with Sir Steve Redgrave and Sir Matthew Pinsent, multiple times).Just because Sven-Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello failed with England's football team does not mean British sport - and thus national pride, and our collective identity - has not been well served.To keep British teams for the British would also exclude Zimbabweans Duncan Fletcher and Andy Flower, who together did so much to take England's cricket team from a ranking above only Bangladesh to number one in the world; would mean Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford and Paralympic 100m gold medallist Jonnie Peacock could never have worked with their brilliant American former coach Dan Pfaff and denied six-time Olympic gold medallist Sir Chris Hoy the vital input of German Jan van Eijden and Australian Shane Sutton.Sport reflects the wider world around it. People move, more than ever before - for love, for work, out of choice, out of desperation.The old world, encapsulated by some in the image of blood-soaked patriot Terry Butcher  ignoring intense pain and stern medical advice to see England into the World Cup finals of 1990, is gone, even if it ever truly existed.Butcher's birthplace? Singapore.Comments have now been closed on this article because of persistent abuse of the service.</body>

      <body>British Cycling says it is on course to achieve its target of getting one million more women cycling by 2020.The Women's Cycling Strategy was launched in March by the sport's national governing body to build on interest following the London Olympics.It says around 106,000 women have participated in programmes this year."There is also a real appetite for women to get into racing or to try personal challenge rides," said chief executive Ian Drake."In the six months since we launched our strategy, we've made some great progress and our plan to get one million more women cycling over the next seven years is firmly on track."So far this year, 24,000 women have taken part in British Cycling sportives and our female member base has increased by 19% since we launched our strategy."Maria Miller, the secretary of state for culture, media and sport, said: "With great role models such as Laura Trott (pictured above) and Becky James, an increase in women's races, a Women's Tour announced and more female coaches coming through, the sport is in a great position to keep up this momentum."Earlier this month, the women's Tour of Britain was given the same status as the men's race for its launch in 2014.In its six-month update, British Cycling  said 37,000 women have taken part in traffic-free cycle rides in 2013, adding that over a third of the total attendees were women.Britain's Shanaze Reade, a three-time BMX world champion, said: "For too long, cycling has been seen as a sport for men. We're starting to close that gender gap."Find out how to get involved in cycling near you by visiting the Get Inspired website.</body>

      <title>Prince Charles in pensions warning</title>

      <body>The Prince of Wales has told the pensions industry to use a longer-term investing approach or risk a "miserable future" for the next generation.He warned a National Association of Pension Funds' (NAPF) conference that the current focus on short term investing was "unfit for purpose".Prince Charles said the pensions industry was vital for the economy "now and in the future".The NAPF said it was "pleased" he was "shining a light on these issues."Prince Charles cited "mounting evidence" from Harvard and London Business Schools showing that businesses willing to improve their approach to environmental and social challenges were more likely to deliver long-term returns.The prince said investors had a "duty" to manage risks from rising populations, climate change and "unprecedented levels" of financial indebtedness, he said.He added: "I can only urge you to deploy your considerable human ingenuity to make that innovative and imaginative leap that the world so badly needs.""Otherwise your grandchildren and mine, for that matter will be consigned to an exceptionally miserable future."NAPF chief executive Joanne Segars said sustainability and environmental issues were important to long-term pension fund investors, and were the basis for providing good pensions for people in future.Former pensions adviser to the government Ros Altmann agreed with the prince's comments.She said: "Pensions are meant to deliver long-term value. What we don't want is to get hijacked by the short-term and sell our children's future away."Ms Altmann said it was "clear" that changes needed to be made."We are living for today in a dangerous way," she said.She said she understood why the short-term focus existed for political reasons, but that pension funds should not be operating on the same timetable.The government will enrol up to nine million more people in pensions during the next five years as fears grow that people are living for longer but not saving for their old age.A spokesperson for Saga, a company that focuses on the over 50s, said Prince Charles was "absolutely right" to speak out.He added: "Whilst the heir to the throne may have a secure future, many of his potential subjects have something altogether less savoury in store for their retirement."</body>

      <body>Gloria de Piero, the shadow minister for women and equalities, has accused a news agency of trying to obtain topless pictures of her taken when she was 15.In a blog post, the Labour MP said the agency claimed to be acting on behalf of a national newspaper and was offering thousands of pounds to people who might have copies of the pictures.She would find it "humiliating" if they were published, she told the BBC.She had grown up in poverty and had posed topless for the money, she added."It's part of me, it's part of my life, it's part of my story," she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour."I've got an amazing mum and dad, but after the age of about 10, no-one worked in my household due to my father's ill health."My parents had jobs, they never had careers, and they were very, very ambitious for their daughter to have a better life than them."The Ashfield MP said she had played truant on days when pupils were able to wear their own clothes, because she was ashamed of her wardrobe."I wanted some money, like my friends," she said of her decision to pose topless."There are reasons why I thought that they might be a way out for me, but I would respectfully say that I hope they are not published."I would find it embarrassing, humiliating."The existence of the pictures "says something about poverty, growing up in poverty", she added."I'm not going to be a victim here," she said, adding that she did not want to see politics full of people "who, at 15, are thinking 'Ooh, I might be a politician one day'"."Goodness, if someone had suggested that to me, at 15, I'd have thought they were absolutely barking."In her blog, she elaborated: "I don't think anyone wants politics to be open only to those people who were planning their political careers in their teens. I would like to see a politics that represents our country, including many more women from all walks of life, and that is something I am passionately committed to help bring about."No one should have to worry that something they did when they were young might prevent them from serving their community or getting involved in politics at a local or national level."Ms de Piero concluded: "It is now time to call off the hunt for these pictures and let me get on with the job I was elected to do, representing the people of Ashfield and serving in the shadow cabinet."</body>

      <title>Competition concern stops NHS merger</title>
      <description>Two Dorset NHS hospital trusts will not merge, the Competition Commission rules, in the first decision of its kind.</description>

      <body>Two NHS hospital trusts in Dorset will not merge, the Competition Commission (CC) has decided.The Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals and Poole Hospital Trusts wanted to become one to save money.It is the first time the Competition Commission, which normally rules on companies and commercial markets, has intervened in the NHS in England.The trusts said the decision was "fundamentally wrong" and that they would "explore alternative options".In a statement, the trusts added they were "deeply disappointed" and felt the merger was the best option to ensure "high-quality hospital services to local people"."The assessment of the merger was always weighted to put competition ahead of benefits to patients, and we do not believe the NHS is best served in this way."The two trusts have worked extremely effectively together over the last two years and we will continue to explore areas where we can work in partnership. However, this will not be to the scale we had hoped."It will be much more difficult to make further savings as individual organisations, but we now need to explore alternative options and work closely with our commissioners as we look to the future."The merger was referred to the commission by the Office of Fair Trading, amid concerns about allowing two competing trusts to combine.The Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has 601 beds across two sites, whilst Poole Hospital NHS Foundation Trust has 623 beds across three sites.But the CC said the merger would "damage patients' interests by eliminating competition and choice".Its chairman Roger Witcomb said the organisation was "acutely aware of the pressures facing NHS hospitals"."While the broad aims of the merger are desirable ones, there simply isn't enough detail in the hospitals' plans for us to conclude that any of the claimed benefits are likely to materialise," he said.Poole Hospital NHS Foundation Trust is already being investigated by health sector regulator Monitor amid concerns over its finances and warned it faced a deficit if the planned merger failed.The commission said it did not believe Poole would close as a result of the merger being blocked.A spokesman for the Foundation Trust Network said the decision raised "significant fears about how competition law is being applied within NHS settings and on trusts' ability to make much needed changes to how services are delivered".The NHS Confederation described the decision as a "body blow for change in the NHS".Annette Brooke, the Liberal Democrat MP for Mid Dorset and North Poole, said she was deeply concerned by the decision."We have a big financial problem at Poole hospital and I think it's really important that it is made financially viable," she said."One can certainly see there is a logic in merging management across two hospitals that are so close together [and] the bottom line is whether patients actually want choice over better services."Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: "It's a sad day for the NHS when competition lawyers, and not doctors, are deciding what's best for patients."A spokesman for the Department of Health said: "The review of mergers is a matter for the independent competition authorities. They must make their decisions in the best interests of patients."</body>

      <description>Thousands of schools close across much of England as teachers strike over pay, pensions and jobs.</description>

      <body>Thousands of schools are closed across much of England as teachers strike over pay, pensions and jobs.Teachers in London, Cumbria, the South East, North East and South West have been taking part with nearly 3,500 schools shut or partially closed.The action is part of a continuing campaign of regional strikes involving members of the NUT and NASUWT unions.Prime Minister David Cameron said the strike was "inconvenient for parents" and "not good for pupils' education".NUT general secretary Christine Blower, said the union regretted the disruption caused to pupils and parents but teachers felt they had "no other choice".Major rallies have been taking place in Bristol, Durham and London, with smaller events in other areas, including Brighton, Carlisle and Plymouth.Teachers are objecting to proposals by Education Secretary Michael Gove to bring in performance-related pay, increase their workloads and make changes to their pensions.Twenty out of 33 London boroughs have provided information to BBC London 94.9 about the number of schools affected so far.Of those, about 445 schools are completely closed and 450 partially closed.And in Tyne and Wear, at least 471 schools have been affected by the industrial action.Head teacher Roberta Kirby, from Fernhurst Junior School, in Portsmouth, said the government had "declared war" on teachers.More than 200 schools in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight are affected by the action.She said: "If we cannot offer good wages and a pension that staff pay into that reflects the work they do, then we are not going to be able to attract the best graduates."Responding to the impact of the strike, some parents said they had found it difficult to find alternative childcare.The BBC's Sarah Ransome said: "People in Plymouth have been telling me that finding alternative childcare because of the strike has been 'quite a headache'."A similar walkout by teachers took place in the east of England, the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber region on 1 October.Ms Blower said: "Mr Gove has done nothing to address the crisis of low morale in the teaching profession which threatens the continued provision of high quality education."Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said the "overwhelming majority of teachers" were on strike.She said: "Teachers are committed and dedicated public service workers. They do not take strike action lightly."No teacher has any wish to inconvenience parents or disrupt pupils' education, but this action is not the failure or due to the unreasonableness, of teachers."Plans for a national one-day walkout before Christmas have also been announced by the two unions.Speaking to BBC Sussex, Mr Cameron said responsibility for the strike "lies with the teaching unions"."I think it is very disappointing they have decided to go on strike," he said."And when we look at the things they are striking over, pensions and pay, they are things that have been decided independently by well-led reviews."I was at my children's school today in London. One class was not there but the rest of the school was operating."So, every praise to those teachers who have gone ahead and kept our schools open for our kids."A spokeswoman for the Department for Education (DfE) said 27% of the schools in the affected regions were closed, however, there was no figure available for how many were partially closed.She said: "The NUT and NASUWT have tried to create as much disruption for pupils and parents today as possible."In spite of this, thanks to many hardworking teachers and heads, only around a quarter of schools in the targeted regions were closed today."</body>

      <body>Microsoft has released the Windows 8.1 update for its flagship operating system.The download seeks to address some of the criticisms levelled at the original version of Windows 8.In particular, the update restores the start button and allows a computer to boot up with a traditional desktop interface.The launch comes at a critical time for Microsoft as it seeks a new boss, with PC sales experiencing a long decline.Windows 8 sought to bridge the gap between touchscreen devices, such as tablets and smartphones, and more traditional form laptops and desktop machines. As such it had an interface built of tiles that could be tapped or swiped to open applications.However, many people found the tiled interface did not work well for some of the things they were used to doing with a computer.The changes in 8.1 include:A host of other changes, including better support for multi-tasking and improved links to Microsoft's Xbox game console, are also in the update.Windows 8 was created to capitalise on the growing popularity of tablets and other portable gadgets. Microsoft needs to get people using its software on these machines because sales of desktop machines are in sharp decline.Global shipments of PCs hit a five-year low in early October, according to figures from market research firm Gartner. Sales of PCs had now fallen for six quarters in a row, it added. The downward trend in sales statistics were confirmed by IDC, which added that the decline would probably continue into 2014.The shrinking sales are important for Microsoft because traditionally the bulk of its revenue comes from people and companies buying laptops and desktops and office software to run on them.It is not clear that Microsoft is adjusting to the changes in the types of gadgets that people use. In July, Microsoft was wrote off $900m (£559m) following poor sales of its own-brand Surface touchscreen devices.At the same time, Microsoft has undergone a major reorganisation and has bought phone maker Nokia. It is also launching a new version of its Xbox games console and has begun searching for a new chief executive.Servers ready to dispense the update were turned on at 07:00 New York time (12:00 BST). The update is free to those already running Windows 8. Charges will apply if users upgrade to 8.1 from Windows 7. The update comes just over a year after the launch of Windows 8.</body>

      <body>The number of badgers shot during a six-week cull in Gloucestershire has fallen short of its target, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has told MPs.Defra said 708 badgers had been killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650.Nigel Gibbens, chief veterinary officer, advised it should be extended. This could be for eight weeks.Badger campaigners have called the scheme a "massive failure" and said they would continue their protest .Mr Gibbens said extending the cull would achieve the "earliest and greatest possible impact" on bovine TB in Gloucestershire.Defra said Natural England was currently considering the application to extend the licence in Gloucestershire and a decision is "expected shortly".Mr Paterson told the BBC the cull figures were "not bad news" but admitted that those carrying out the killings had "got off to a slower start" in Gloucestershire."We must remember that these are pilots," he said."This has not been done before and we are learning, clearly, in each area. This isn't a sudden six-week period. These pilots are intended to go on for four years."Up to to the end of July, a further 20,000 perfectly healthy cattle have been hauled off to slaughter at horrendous expense to the taxpayer because we've lost control of TB."Mr Paterson said 305,000 cattle had been "lost" over the past 10 years and it was "not acceptable" to allow the disease to go on.The badger cull in Gloucestershire ended this week. A licence was granted last week to extend the badger cull in Somerset until 1 November.Defra said early indications from Gloucestershire are that, as in Somerset, the pilot had been "safe and humane".The government's original target was 2,900 badgers, based on a population estimate of 3,400 animals. The target was then revised to 1,650, from a population of 2,350.Last week Mr Paterson said the government was exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB.Stop the Badger Cull spokesman Jay Tiernan said the cull had been a "massive failure"."It's disgraceful," he said. "It clearly isn't safe, effective or humane."It is time for someone to bite the bullet and admit it's been a failure."Mr Tiernan said protests against the culls would continue.</body>

      <body>American film director Michael Bay has been injured in an attack in Hong Kong while filming on the set of his latest Transformers film.Two men have been arrested on suspicion of blackmail and assault after they demanded money from the film crew, police have said.Mr Bay, 48, received injuries to the right side of his face.But he declined to seek treatment and continued filming in a busy area of Hong Kong island.A local newspaper in Hong Kong reported that three men caused what it called "a huge disturbance" to the filming of the American science fiction film.It said that the men could have missed out on disturbance fees which the film crew paid to shop and business owners whose businesses were likely to be affected during filming.The two men approached Mr Bay on the set during filming, a police spokeswoman told Reuters.One of them demanded payment of HK$100,000 ($12,900; £8,030).As the discussion continued, the man assaulted Mr Bay and also attacked three police officers who tried to intervene, police say.The officers received treatment at hospital for minor injuries.Police also arrested a third man at the scene.There has been no comment from Mr Bay or his crew on the incident.The fourth instalment of the Transformers franchise starring Mark Wahlberg and Nicola Peltz is scheduled for public release in June 2014.Hong Kong's striking Victoria Harbour is believed to be among the film's locations, along with the city's dense and bustling streets.</body>

      <title>Where ill people are locked in cages with hyenas</title>

      <body>Somalia has one of the highest rates of mental illness in the world and with a healthcare system devastated by years of war, most sufferers receive no medical help. Many are chained up - to trees or at home. Some are even locked in cages with hyenas. But one man is trying to change all that.Dr Hab's advert runs up to three times a day on Mogadishu's radio stations."He's gone crazy! He's running away!" screams the actor. "Chain him down!"The scenario is familiar in Somalia. A man has become possessed by spirits and the only option for his family is to restrain him and call the sheikh. But as the young man protests, a voice that challenges Somali tradition booms out."Stop with the chains!" the voiceover orders. "Take him to Dr Hab's hospital! If he's having mental problems, take him to Dr Hab. He won't chain him, he'll help him."Dr Hab is not actually a real psychiatrist. Rather it's the persona of Abdirahman Ali Awale, a nurse who after three months of specialist training from the World Health Organization (WHO), has made it his mission to rescue Somalia's mentally ill. He claims he is able to treat everything from post-natal depression to schizophrenia.But the alternative to a trip to Hab could be a visit to one of Somalia's popular herbalists or sheikhs who still advocate traditional - and sometimes barbaric - cures."There is a belief in my country that hyenas can see everything including the evil spirits people think cause mental illness," says Hab. "So in Mogadishu, you will find hyenas that have been brought from the bush and families will pay £350 ($560) to have their loved one locked in the room overnight with the animal."The expensive treatment - more than the average annual wage - is as brutal as it sounds. By clawing and biting at the patient, the hyena is thought to force the evil spirit out. Patients, including young children, have been known to die during the process."We are trying to show people that this is nonsense," says Hab. "People listen to our radio advert and they learn that mental illness is just like any other and needs to be treated with scientific methods."Hab's campaign was prompted by an incident in 2005 when he witnessed a group of female patients being chased through the streets by youths. "There was no-one to help them," he says. "I decided after that I would have to open Somalia's first mental hospital."The Habeb Public Mental Health Hospital in Mogadishu became the first of Hab's six centres across Somalia. Together, they have now treated over 15,000 patients.There were only three practising psychiatrists in the whole of Somalia at the last count, and Hab - despite his lack of advanced qualifications - is head of what has become the country's leading provider of mental health services. He even carries a letter from the minister of health that says so.Hab faces a near insurmountable task. WHO estimates that one in three Somalis either is or has been affected by mental illness, compared to a global average of one in 10. In parts of the country, where the population has been the most psychologically scarred from decades of conflict, the rate is even higher. Cases of post-traumatic stress disorder are common and the situation is further complicated by widespread substance abuse."Khat is a big, big problem," says Hab of the herbal stimulant which has been chewed for centuries in East Africa. Side effects are thought to include anxiety and even psychosis. "We treat them in the hospital and they leave, but then they start eating khat again. Sometimes I see the same patients seven or eight times."Western aid agencies in Somalia have often promoted projects targeting communicable diseases, not least because results are quicker and cheaper to obtain. Hab, meanwhile, says he is left to run his organisation with minimal resources and an erratic supply of psychotropic medicines that he sources from NGOs and private pharmacies.Even getting sufferers to recognise that their condition constitutes an illness is difficult. Psychological problems are more likely to be reported by Somalis as physical pain - headaches, sweating, and chest pain. Some concepts of mental illness do not even exist in Somali culture - depression, for example, translates as "the feelings a camel has when its friend dies".But nothing is more indicative of the population's poor understanding of mental health than the widespread practice of chaining-up sufferers to trees and in rooms. GRT, an Italian NGO, has documented sufferers who have been chained up their entire life."I myself have saved many patients who have been left to die," says Hab who drives a minibus into rural areas, unchaining people and taking them to one of his centres. "Parents, siblings, relatives - they've just been chained up to a tree and the family has gone."The WHO has funded a "Chain Free Initiative", with the aim of eradicating the practice altogether, starting with the use of chains in hospitals. But even Hab admits to having chained up some of his most aggressive patients.He tells the story of how, in 2007, one unintended consequence of his acquisition of a batch of the anti-psychotic drug, fluphenazine hydrochloride, was an increased appetite in his patients. They took to scaling the walls of his hospital in Mogadishu to scavenge for food. But still desperately unwell, some of the escapees had been shot when they ignored orders at a military checkpoint. Chaining them to their beds, concluded Hab, was the only option."Many patients take a long time to treat," he says. "There has been no outside help focussed on treating mental health problems and the main reason NGOs are not getting involved is because of the expense."Hab is motivated by the thousands of patients he believes remain chained up in private homes. He sends through a spreadsheet showing what he needs - new mattresses, food for patients, and diesel for his minibus. There is also a shortage of qualified psychiatrists and nurses. The daily struggle to provide for his patients and the suffering he witnesses is clearly taking its toll."Physiologically and mentally it's a very hard job" he says. "I was healthy when I started, now I suffer from diabetes. I am dealing with big, big problems all by myself."I have cried on TV, I have cried in public places, I have cried in front of presidents," he says. "Even now I feel like crying."</body>

      <title>How much better is standing up than sitting?</title>
      <description>Studies have claimed major health benefits for standing for much of the day as opposed to sitting. What's the difference in calories, asks Michael Mosley.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24532996</url>

      <body>Studies have claimed major health benefits for standing for much of the day as opposed to sitting. The difference is marked, explains Michael Mosley.Guess how many hours a day you spend sitting? Fewer than eight? More than 10? A recent survey found that many of us spend up to 12 hours a day sitting on our bottoms looking at computers or watching television. If you throw in the seven hours we spend sleeping then that adds up to a remarkable 19 hours a day being sedentary.Sitting down as much as this is clearly bad for us and some studies suggest that those who sit all day live around two years less than those who are more active. Most of us are guilty of excess sitting. We sit at work, in the car and at home, moving only to shift from one seat to another.Even if you exercise on a regular basis that may not be enough. There is mounting evidence that exercise will not undo the damage done by prolonged sitting. Our technology has made us the most sedentary humans in history.So why is sitting so damaging? One thing it does is change the way our bodies deal with sugar. When you eat, your body breaks down the food into glucose, which is then transported in the blood to other cells.Glucose is an essential fuel but persistently high levels increase your risk of diabetes and heart disease. Your pancreas produces the hormone insulin to help get your glucose levels back down to normal, but how efficiently your body does that is affected by how physically active you areWe wanted to see what would happen if we took a group of people who normally spend their day sitting in an office and ask them to spend a few hours a day on their feet instead.Standing while you are working may seem rather odd, but it is a practice with a long tradition. Winston Churchill wrote while working at a special standing desk, as did Ernest Hemingway and Benjamin Franklin.So with Dr John Buckley and a team of researchers from the University of Chester we conducted a simple experiment. We asked 10 people who work at an estate agents to stand for at least three hours a day for a week.Our lucky volunteers had mixed feelings about how they would get on."It'll be different, but looking forward to it, yes…""I think my feet might hurt - I'll have to wear sensible shoes…""The small of my back, it's going to hurt…""I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to stand up for all that time…[Laughs nervously]"We asked all the volunteers to wear an accelerometer - a movement monitor - to record just how much moving about they were doing. They also wore heart rate monitors and had glucose monitors that measured their blood sugar levels constantly, day and night.The evidence that standing up is good for you goes back to at least the 1950s when a study was done comparing bus conductors (who stand) with bus drivers (who don't). This study, published in the Lancet, showed that the bus conductors had around half the risk of developing heart disease of the bus drivers.Since then prolonged sitting has not only been linked to problems with blood glucose control, but also a sharp reduction in the activity of an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase, which breaks down blood fats and makes them available as a fuel to the muscles. This reduction in enzyme activity leads to raised levels of triglycerides and fats in the blood, increasing the risk of heart disease.We had good reason to believe that standing would make a difference to our volunteers, but we were also a little anxious as to how they would get on. This was the first time an experiment like this had been conducted in the UK. Would our volunteers stick to it?They did. One woman with arthritis even found that standing actually improved her symptoms.The Chester researchers took measurements on days when the volunteers stood, and when they sat around. When they looked at the data there were some striking differences. As we had hoped, blood glucose levels fell back to normal levels after a meal far more quickly on the days when the volunteers stood than when they sat.There was also evidence, from the heart rate monitors that they were wearing, that by standing they were burning more calories."If we look at the heart rates," John Buckley explains, "we can see they are quite a lot higher actually - on average around 10 beats per minute higher and that makes a difference of about 0.7 of a calorie per minute."Now that doesn't sound like much, but it adds up to about 50 calories an hour. If you stand for three hours a day for five days that's around 750 calories burnt. Over the course of a year it would add up to about 30,000 extra calories, or around 8lb of fat."If you want to put that into activity levels," Dr Buckley says, "then that would be the equivalent of running about 10 marathons a year. Just by standing up three or four hours in your day at work."Dr Buckley thinks that although going out and doing exercise offers many proven benefits, our bodies also need the constant, almost imperceptible increase in muscle activity that standing provides. Simple movement helps us to keep our all-important blood sugar under control.We can't all stand up at work but the researchers believe that even small adjustments, like standing while talking on the phone, going over to talk to a colleague rather than sending an email, or simply taking the stairs, will help.I have, of course, written this article while standing.Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <body>A school which let pupils as young as 11 smoke in the playground has been ordered to stop the practice.Leeds City Council education bosses stepped in after learning children at Elmete Central School in Roundhay, Leeds, were allowed to smoke.It is understood cigarettes were confiscated at the start of the day but returned at break times in an attempt to stop pupils playing truant.Elmete caters for 75 pupils with educational and behavioural issues.Paul Brennan, deputy director for children's services, said the council spoke with the school's recently-appointed head teacher Lesley Boyd as soon as it was made aware pupils were smoking on the premises.He said he was now "confident" the practice had ceased."The recently-appointed head teacher has agreed to review any such practices, and to make sure this does not happen in the future we will conduct unannounced visits by local authority staff," he said."We have a strict no-smoking policy in all of our schools and encourage them to promote healthy lifestyles to all pupils."A council spokesman added that Lesley Boyd was not the head teacher at the time the policy was introduced.</body>

      <body>A coroner has pleaded guilty to a £2m fraud that saw him steal some of the money from the estates of dead people.Gloucestershire coroner Alan Crickmore, 57, of East Approach Drive, Cheltenham pleaded guilty to 24 counts of fraud at Southwark Crown Court.Police said Crickmore had been stealing money while acting as probate and using the cash as his own "piggy bank".Crickmore was bailed and electronically tagged ahead of a sentencing hearing on 28 November.The guilty plea followed a police inquiry into alleged breaches of the solicitors' code of conduct and accounting rules.He was suspended from his post in December 2010 and has now resigned.Alan C Crickmore Solicitors, which had an office in Cheltenham, was closed down by the Solicitors Regulation Authority in December 2010.An authority spokesman said it was likely Crickmore would face a tribunal over his actions.He said a final decision would be made after Crickmore was sentenced.Det Ch Insp Dave Sellwood said Crickmore's plea came after being "faced with overwhelming evidence".The coroner stole some of the money after gaining power of attorney for elderly people who had "lost their mental capacity"."[Crickmore] stole what he wanted when he wanted," said Det Ch Insp Sellwood."He was propping up a lifestyle he couldn't afford - regular cruises, fine dining, various holidays, buying a house in the country."By many standards that would be considered to be living quite a high lifestyle and he could only fund that lifestyle by stealing from his clients."He was brought in to deal with probate and to wind up estates and, rather than give all of the monies to beneficiaries, he stole some of the monies from what would have been the beneficiaries."Councillor Will Windsor-Clive, from Gloucestershire County Council, said the case had been "really frustrating" while they waited for it to come to court."While we run the coroner's service in the county, we don't employ the coroner and only the Lord Chancellor can dismiss him. As a result we've had no power to take action."Mr Crickmore has offered his resignation and I hope we can now move forward."</body>

      <title>Scottish Gas rise hits north hardest</title>
      <description>Scottish Gas customers in the north of Scotland are facing higher fuel bills than the rest of the UK, following a move by the energy firm to increase prices.</description>

      <body>Scottish Gas customers in the north of Scotland are facing higher bills than the rest of the UK, after a decision by owners Centrica to increase prices.The price rise will see an average UK dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2% from 23 November.But regional differences mean domestic customers living north of Perth will see an average rise of 11.2% - the biggest in the UK.Customers in the south of Scotland will see an average increase of 9.5%.The smallest rise is a 6.8% increase in the south west of England.Scotland's electricity transmission network is split between Scottish Hydro in the north and Scottish Power which holds the licence for central and southern Scotland.Centrica, which owns the British Gas and Scottish Gas brands, said its regional price differences reflected variations in the network costs it was obliged to pay to the transmission companies around the country.Rival SSE has already announced an 8.2% increase in bills from 15 November.The Centrica move, which will affect nearly eight million people in the UK, includes an average 8.4% rise in gas prices and a 10.4% increase in electricity prices.The company said it "understands the frustration" of prices rising faster than incomes. The average annual household bill will go up by £123.On average, UK customers will see a dual-fuel bill increase to £1,444 a year.Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%.Energy regulator Ofgem said prices were determined by suppliers competing in the British energy market and it was up to them to justify their prices and profits to consumers.An Ofgem spokeswoman said: "Any price rise will not be welcomed by customers which is why it is important that Scottish Gas fully explain the reasons for the increase."Energy suppliers should be doing all they can to minimise the impact of these rising costs on energy bills by ensuring they are managing their costs as efficiently as possible."Suppliers must also ensure they are giving customers all the advice and help they need to save money on their energy bills, for example through energy efficiency."</body>

      <title>Salmond to hold Grangemouth talks</title>
      <description>Scotland's First Minister is expected to hold talks with both sides involved in the dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant.</description>

      <body>Scotland's first minister is to hold talks with both sides involved in the dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant.It is understood Alex Salmond earlier spoke to officials from the plant's operators Ineos.Mr Salmond confirmed in his opening address at the SNP conference in Perth he will hold further talks with both Ineos and the Unite union.The facility remains shut down despite Unite calling off a planned strike.The first minister told delegates at the SNP conference that officials from both Ineos and Unite had been quoted in the media as saying they believed Grangemouth had a "great future".He added: "What I will attempt to do is to take and build on that belief, and say to both Unite and Ineos that only by negotiation, cooperation and agreement can we get an effective resolution."We believe, and Scotland believes and expects, that Grangemouth as an industrial facility has a great future."Mr Salmond left the first day of the conference in Perth for the discussions in Edinburgh."Governments can't make agreements" in such disputes but can "encourage the circumstances in which agreements can be found", he told party delegates.Ineos said shutting down the Grangemouth complex had cost the company £20m so far.It has put proposals over pay and pensions to workers at the site, which has 1,400 employees and many more contractors.A letter outlining the proposed changes was being couriered to employees on Friday.BBC Scotland has been given details of the offer, which includes freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016.The shift allowance would also be reduced from £10,000 to £7,500 per year, while pensions would be transferred from a final salary to a defined benefits scheme.The company added that no job cuts were expected.It has asked for an answer to the proposals by Monday, and has said shareholders will discuss the complex's future on Tuesday.The company has said Grangemouth is "financially distressed" and must reduce costs.It has also asked for guarantees that no further strike action will be held by workers.Unite claimed the company had told staff they could lose their jobs and be reemployed on poorer terms unless they agreed to give up their final salary pension, and accept pay freezes and pay cuts, by 18:00 on Monday.Pat Rafferty, Unite's Scottish secretary, said: "This is cynical blackmail from a company that is putting a gun to the heads of its loyal workforce to slash pay, pensions and jobs."We are considering taking legal action over the company's menacing tactics and urge members not to be threatened into signing their livelihoods away."It is increasingly clear that the company is deliberately generating a dispute and hiding behind fancy accounting to attack its own workforce."On Wednesday, Ineos said Grangemouth "is shut and remains shut", despite Unite calling off a 48-hour strike that had been due to begin on Sunday.The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans.Ineos claims it is unable to immediately restart the complex, which had been shut down ahead of the planned strike.A spokesman said: "The Grangemouth site is three times the size of the City of London and it is an incredibly complex system of manufacturing plants all connected by miles of pipes carrying highly flammable materials."Shutting down the site and restarting again is not like switching the lights off and on. It takes days to shut down properly and it takes weeks to bring it back up again."When Unite forced us to shut down in 2008 we had two major incidents and it took eight weeks to get back to normal. In the first incident, we had a large fire on a compressor. If our employees had been close to the area then there would have been serious injuries or even fatalities."</body>

      <body>A health trust has admitted liability for the deaths of two children in its care during a public inquiry into hospital deaths in Northern Ireland.Claire Roberts and Adam Strain died months apart while they were being treated at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children in 1995 and 1996.Their deaths are being investigated by the inquiry into hyponatraemia-related deaths in Banbridge, County Down.The issue of hospital fluids management is central to the public inquiry.Hyponatraemia is the term for a low level of sodium in the bloodstream, which causes the brain cells to swell with too much water.Four-year-old Adam Strain died shortly after undergoing a kidney transplant at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children in 1995.Claire Roberts was nine when she died at the same hospital the following year.She had been admitted following vomiting and drowsiness and doctors prescribed intravenous fluids.However, Claire was given a fatal overdose of fluids and drugs.In the 17 years since her death, Belfast Health Trust had denied that fluid management played any role and wrongly attributed Claire's death to a brain virus.The trust maintained its stance during the child's inquest in 2006.However, at the public inquiry on Thursday, the trust's lawyer said his client now accepted it was liable for Claire Roberts' death and made "a full and frank admission of liability on behalf of the Belfast Trust".He said it also wanted to offer "a sincere apology for the shortcomings in the management of Claire's treatment" and acknowledged that it had failed to treat the child to an appropriate standard.During the hearing, the Belfast Health Trust also admitted publicly for the first time liability in the earlier case of Adam Strain.It had previously settled this case with Adam's family but a confidentiality clause prevented any detail of that settlement from emerging.The trust further acknowledged that guidelines had not been followed in the case of a third child, Connor Mitchell.The inquiry chairman, Justice John O'Hara QC, welcomed the admissions and acknowledged that it was "never easy to admit when mistakes had been made".Mr O'Hara said the families had made it clear that their pursuit of the truth was "in memory of their children" and that he hoped that today "they feel there is some added justification for what they have done".Speaking to BBC Northern Ireland after the hearing, Claire Roberts' parents welcomed the trust's apology and admission of liability as a small step forward but said there were still many questions over their child's death that had not been answered.The inquiry into hyponatraemia-related deaths is investigating fluid management issues after the deaths of five children in Northern Ireland hospitals.It is looking into the deaths of three of the children, the events following the death of another and a number of issues arising from the death of a fifth.The deaths all took place between 1995 and 2003, and in each case, the way in which fluids were given to the children following surgery is implicated in their deaths.Belfast Trust is the second Northern Ireland health trust to accept liability during the public inquiry.On August 30, the Western Health and Social Care Trust admitted liability over the death of nine-year-old Raychel Ferguson.Raychel died in June 2001, a day after an appendix operation at Altnagelvin Hospital, Londonderry.She was administered a lethal dose of intravenous fluid after her appendix was removed.</body>

      <body>There is no criminal offence if someone assists a woman in going to England for a lawful abortion, the Director of Public Prosecutions in NI has said.Barra McGrory made the comments after the BBC was told draft abortion guidelines had caused a "mood of fear" among medical staff.There have been calls for clarity after women carrying babies with fatal foetal abnormalities told their stories.Foetal abnormality is not a reason for abortion under Northern Ireland law.Draft guidelines were published in March, but following a consultation process, revised guidelines are being brought before the Stormont Executive within weeks.Health Minister Edwin Poots has said he would meet the Public Prosecution Service about the potential prosecution of staff involved in an abortion in certain circumstances.He said he was also taking legal advice from other sources. Mr Poots said he had work to do that needed to be handled sensitively and he would not be deflected from it.Mr McGrory told the BBC's Nolan Show said: "There is no criminal offence of aiding and abetting, counselling or procuring someone to have what is a lawful abortion in England," he said."We can see no circumstances in which anyone would fall foul of the criminal law in that regard."Mr McGrory added: "The circumstances in which you are talking, of these tragic cases of foetal abnormality, where individuals have felt it necessary to travel to England to have an abortion because of serious foetal abnormality, in those circumstances, I can envisage no situation where anyone giving advice and assistance in that regard would fall foul of the law."You cannot aid or abet or procure something which is not a crime in our law."Last week, the BBC's Nolan Show highlighted the cases of two women, whose babies had fatal foetal abnormality, who were refused terminations in Northern Ireland,Sarah Ewart travelled to England for an abortion because her baby was diagnosed with anencephaly, a severe brain abnormality.She said the baby's skull was not formed and it was brain dead.Another woman, Laura, who is 22 weeks pregnant with twins who are suffering from the same condition, appealed to Mr Poots to allow her to have an abortion in Northern Ireland.</body>

      <title>Ex-mayor denies ball-bearing blast</title>
      <description>A former mayor tells a trial that he was not responsible for a series of blasts in his home town earlier this year which included a home-made ball-bearing bomb.</description>

      <body>A former Denbigh mayor has told a trial that he was not responsible for a series of blasts in the town.It culminated in a home-made bomb being detonated under a car - scattering ball-bearings over a wide area.John Larsen told Caernarfon Crown Court that he had played no part in the explosions in the Lenten Pool area between January and April.The 46 year old denies causing an explosion, possessing explosives and three arson attacks on cars.During his trial, the prosecution has claimed that there was "a strong compelling case" that Mr Larsen was the man behind the booms and blasts heard and seen in the area.One witness described how she had seen the town councillor near cars just before an explosion detonated under a Land Rover car.The blast showered ball-bearings and shrapnel over a large area, smashing windows.One resident even found that one of the ball-bearings had hit a headboard on their bed.An explosives expert told the court earlier that the ball-bearings had either been packed or strapped on to the device and would have been ejected from the bomb at "several hundred metres per second" with the potential to cause serious injury of even death to any passersby.But addressing Mr Larsen, his defence barrister, Gordon Hennell asked him: "Did you ever use any ball-bearings as shrapnel in a device?""No, never," replied Mr Larsen, who had been the mayor of Denbigh in 1999.Mr Larsen told the jury that he had an interest in fireworks as one of his hobbies, alongside magic tricks.He also accepted that he had experimented with fuels for rockets.But Mr Hennell said the allegations against the defendant went further than experimentation."The suggestion is that on March 24 you have not simply experimented, but set off an explosive device which has got ball-bearings added," he said.Larsen maintained: "No, that's incorrect. I didn't do that."Asked bluntly whether he had played any part in the night-time explosions in the Lenten Pool area, the defendant replied: "No, not at all."He told the jury that he had been at home in bed when the blasts occurred except for "a few occasions", and that he only went out late at night to check his wife's car."It gets very rowdy at night," he added.Mr Larsen was arrested on 19 April 2013, and police found a mix of chemicals, modified fireworks, rockets, flares and a book on pyrotechnics at his home.He denies causing an explosion likely to endanger life or cause serious injury to property on March 24. He also denies three charges of arson in which cars were damaged, and possessing an explosive substance.The trial continues.</body>

      <title>School pupils offered TB screening</title>

      <body>Screening for tuberculosis (TB) will be offered to 124 pupils at a comprehensive school in Carmarthenshire after a staff member was diagnosed with the infection.Letters have been sent to parents at Ysgol y Strade, Llanelli, saying their children will be offered a blood test next Thursday.Health officials say the risk that the infection has spread to pupils is low.Precautionary screening is also being offered to 21 members of staff.They are those identified as being close contacts of the patient.Sion Lingard, acting consultant in health protection for Public Health Wales (PHW), said TB is difficult to catch and is treatable with antibiotics."We are emphasising to pupils, parents and staff that it is very rare for TB to be transmitted within a school environment and so we are offering screening as a precaution," he said."Close contact with an infectious individual over a long time period, such as living in the same household, is usually required for a person to become infected with TB."Another four cases of TB had been identified in the Llanelli area over the last year, he said, but none of these have links to the school."Investigations into these cases are continuing with the involvement of Hywel Dda Health Board with treatment, advice and screening offered where appropriate," Mr Lingard added.TB is an infection usually found in the lungs, but any part of the body can be affected.People can catch TB by breathing in the bacteria in tiny droplets sneezed or coughed out by someone who has the infection in their lungs.The most common symptom of TB is a persistent cough for more than three weeks, with spit which can sometimes be blood-stained.Other symptoms can include weight loss, a high temperature, and sweating, particularly at night.Public Health Wales said anyone who is concerned about their health should speak to their GP or contact NHS Direct Wales on 0845 46 47.</body>

      <body>Five children have been killed by an old mortar shell as they dug for scrap metal in South Sudan's capital, Juba.The five were looking for metal in an old army barracks, a military spokesman told the BBC.The BBC's James Copnall says unexploded ordinance and mines remain a big problem in South Sudan, following decades of civil war.There are clear-up operations under way in several areas of South Sudan, but such explosions kill people every year.The children, aged 10-14, were killed in a former barracks in Juba's Souk Sita district, army spokesman Col Philip Aguer said.He said that a Ugandan man who was with them, presumably to buy the scrap metal, was wounded.South Sudan gained independence in 2011 after a long conflict with the north but it remains one of the world's least developed countries.In addition to the explosives left over from the war, rebels have been accused of laying new mines, particularly in Unity state near the border with Sudan, our correspondent reports.This has at times made travel around the area dangerous, he adds.</body>

      <body>An appeal court in Tunisia has acquitted rapper Ahmed Ben Ahmed, known as Klay BBJ, on charges of insulting the authorities in his songs.The rapper was jailed in September for six months for insulting the police at a concert in the resort of Hammamet."The court has decided to reject the accusations," the AFP news agency quotes the judge as saying.During the performance in August, he sang alongside fellow rapper Weld El 15, who has been on the run since then.They had both initially been sentenced in absentia in August to 21 months in prison.Klay BBJ lost an appeal in September and was immediately jailed.But on his second appeal hearing in Grombalia, south of the capital, Tunis, the judge said his sentenced had been annulled and he was released.Weld El 15, whose real name is Ala Yaacoub, has been in trouble before for his song The Police Are Dogs.He was given a two-year sentence in June, which was later suspended but he went into hiding following his latest conviction in August.Since the 2011 revolution, which toppled long-time President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, there have been tensions between secular Tunisians and Islamists."Our songs criticise the current situation in Tunisia and the government, no more and no less," AFP news agency quoted Klay BBJ as saying in September.A coalition led by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party has been in government since elections in 2011.</body>

      <body>A woman who was gang-raped in the Indian city of Mumbai in August has fainted in court while giving evidence.The photojournalist, who was attacked while on assignment in a deserted mill, was taken to a local hospital.Earlier the victim, aged 22, identified four of the men accused of raping her.Women's safety has been the focus of attention in India since a brutal gang rape and murder in Delhi last year, after which the Indian government strengthened its sexual violence laws.The photojournalist, who cannot be identified, had been giving evidence for more than four hours when she collapsed, said public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam.The victim was very composed, but was "under mental pressure", Mr Nikam told the BBC.He said she had identified all four men who stood trial in court on Thursday. A fifth suspect is being tried separately by a juvenile court.The photographer also identified pornographic video clips that she said she was shown while she was raped, said the special public prosecutor.Proceedings were stopped when the rape survivor collapsed, Mr Nikam said.Last month, four men were convicted and sentenced to death over the gang-rape and murder of a young woman in Delhi in December.The case led to widespread protests across India and highlighted the extent of attacks on women in the country.A bill containing harsher punishments for rapists, including the death penalty, was approved by India's parliament earlier this year.But many working in the legal system say not enough is done to protect those who bring rape cases to court.</body>

      <body>A plane carrying 49 passengers and crew that crashed in southern Laos hit bad weather as it came into land, officials in the South East Asian nation said.The Lao Airlines plane, flying from the capital Vientiane, crashed into the Mekong river on Wednesday near its destination of Pakse.All 44 passengers and five crew are believed to have died.Footage of the scene on Thursday showed divers in the Mekong river, pulling out parts of the wreckage.The passengers and crew came from a total of 10 nations, the airline said.Seventeen Laos nationals were on board, plus travellers from France, Australia, Thailand, Vietnam, Canada, China, Malaysia, Taiwan and the US."Upon preparing to land at Pakse Airport the aircraft ran into extreme bad weather conditions and was reportedly crashed into the Mekong river,'' the Laos Ministry of Public Works and Transport said in a statement.State-run Laos news agency quoted an eyewitness as saying that the plane "appeared to be hit by a strong wind, causing its head to ascend and pushing it away from the airport area".A senior aviation official from Laos was quoted in other reports as saying the tail end of Typhoon Nari may have been a factor in the crash.An Agence-France Presse (AFP) reporter on the scene told of debris floating in the river and suitcases buried in mud on the river banks."The search teams in Laos are taking the bodies to a local hospital," Thai foreign ministry spokesman Sek Wannamethee told AFP.An official in Pakse was quoted as saying at least six bodies had been retrieved.The plane was an ATR 72-600 twin turboprop engine aircraft. Its manufacturer, ATR, said in a statement that the plane was "delivered from the production line in March 2013".The company said it would co-operate fully with the investigation.Australian's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said that six Australians, including four members of one family, were aboard the plane. An Australian aid worker and his father were also among those believed to have been killed.DFAT released a photo of the two Australians - father and son Gordon and Michael Creighton.The family said in a statement that they had "lost a father, a husband, a son, a brother, a fiance and a best mate in one tragic circumstance".Relatives of the Rhodes family also released a photo of Gavin, a tax consultant, his wife, Phoumalaysy and their two young children.A DFAT spokesperson said that consular officials were in contact with the families of the victims and were travelling to Pakse.However, a DFAT statement said: "Lao authorities have told our embassy in Vientiane they do not expect any survivors.''The route between the capital Vientiane and Pakse is popular with the growing numbers of tourists visiting Laos, correspondents say.Lao Airlines is small company, with just 14 aircraft in its fleet. It flies several domestic routes and has flights to other countries in the region like China, Thailand and Singapore.</body>

      <body>Eleven Nobel prize-winners have written to Vladimir Putin asking the Russian president to drop charges against 30 Greenpeace activists and journalists.The 30, who come from 18 nations, were held last month during a protest against oil drilling in the Arctic.The signatories - including Archbishop Desmond Tutu - described the charges of piracy as "excessive".But Mr Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, responded that the president had no power to influence the courts.The Greenpeace activists, who complain of being detained in harsh conditions, face up to 15 years in prison if convicted.So far all bail applications in the case have been refused.The Netherlands has launched legal action to try to free the activists and the ship, and more than 1.4m people have joined a Greenpeace campaign demanding their release.In the letter, which was released by Greenpeace, the laureates urge Mr Putin "to do all you can to ensure that the excessive charges of piracy against the 28 Greenpeace activists, freelance photographer and freelance videographer are dropped, and that any charges brought are consistent with international and Russian law."We were heartened by your statement, on September 25th, that you did not believe the Greenpeace crew members were pirates," the letter goes on to say."As you know, the Greenpeace activists were unarmed and used only peaceful means to demonstrate their opposition to the oil drilling operations threatening the Arctic."Arctic oil drilling is a dangerous, high-risk enterprise. An oil spill under these icy waters would have a catastrophic impact on one of the most pristine, unique and beautiful landscapes on earth," the letter continues.It is also signed by former East Timor President Jose Ramos Horta, Northern Irish peace campaigner Betty Williams, and Iranian human rights activist Shirin Ebadi.But Putin spokesman Mr Peskov said the laureates had addressed their appeal to the wrong person, reported Russian news agency RIA Novosti."The president treats Nobel prize winners and their opinions with great respect and attention. But in this case, the president is a wrong addressee," the agency quoted him as saying.He said President Putin could not file or drop charges."Investigative bodies deal with it, and everyone should wait for the end of the investigation process and the court's verdict."A law is a law," he added.</body>

      <body>Thousands of schoolchildren in Paris and other parts of France have been demonstrating in anger over the expulsion of two foreign teenagers.Twenty secondary schools in the French capital were disrupted as children joined a march, clenching fists in solidarity with the expelled pupils.Some demanded the sacking of the Interior Minister, Manuel Valls.In one case, a Roma schoolgirl was sent back to Kosovo and in the other, a student was repatriated to Armenia.There has been widespread indignation at the manner in which border police picked up schoolgirl Leonarda Dibrani, whose family had lost its bid for asylum in France after five years in the country.Leonarda, 15, was escorted from her school bus by a teacher, in front of other children, in the eastern region of Doubs on 9 October.The row has caused strains within the government of Socialist President Francois Hollande, whose most popular minister with the wider public is Mr Valls, according to recent opinion polls.Mr Valls has drawn protests over his hard line on Roma immigrants, which is reminiscent of Mr Hollande's conservative predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy.Schoolchildren left class to show solidarity both with Leonarda and Khatchik Kachatryan, a 19-year-old student in Paris who was expelled on Saturday to Armenia.Mr Kachatryan was arrested for shoplifting in September, at which point police discovered he had entered France illegally, the French daily Le Figaro reports.Reports suggest that he was detained on his return to the former Soviet republic for seeking to escape doing military service."Bring back Khatchik and Leonarda, they belong here," marching pupils chanted on Thursday, holding up signs calling for Mr Valls to resign.The president of France's National High School Students' Union, Ivan Dementhon, said students were angry at the way the Dibrani family had been treated."The expulsion of the young Leonarda is particularly shocking because it was done in a school environment," he said."It's not tolerable that students with or without documents are expelled. Everybody should have a right to education, and that is why all high school students are here."Journalists who visited the Dibrani family in Kosovo on Wednesday found them living in a house in the northern town of Mitrovica, despite earlier suggestions that they were homeless.It has also emerged that the father, Resat, was investigated by the French authorities for allegedly beating his family.Mr Valls insists that the deportation of Leonarda and the rest of her family was carried out in line with established procedure."It is of course a difficult subject but any immigration policy requires respect for the law, respect for individuals and great firmness," he said this week. "I am accountable for that to the French people."Amnesty International recently reported that more than 10,000 Roma had been evicted from temporary camps in France in the first half of the year.Some 20,000 Roma have settled in France, coming mainly from Romania, Bulgaria and parts of the former Yugoslavia like Kosovo.</body>

      <body>A 25-year-old Mexican with the autistic condition Asperger's has won the right to make key decisions about his life without parental consent.The Supreme Court ruled in favour of Ricardo Adair by four votes to one.Mr Adair said that Mexican legislation violated the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.It banned him from doing simple tasks by himself, such as applying for a passport, because of his condition.A judge will be appointed to agree which decisions Mr Adair will be allowed to make without the consent of a parent or guardian.The groundbreaking ruling is expected to have wider implications for the rights of people with autism in Latin America, says the BBC's Will Grant."I want to be allowed to decide what to do, where to go, where and with whom I want to live or travel, where to work or study," Mr Adair told the Mexican Supreme Court.Mexican legislation makes straightforward tasks, such as buying a mobile phone, enrolling in university or applying for a driving licence, very difficult for people with Asperger's syndrome or other forms of autism.Mr Adair said all papers had to be signed by his parents or legal guardians.He began his battle two years ago and has been supported in his fight by a non-profit organisation."All we wanted was for Ricardo's own free will to come first, and now the court has recognised that," his lawyer, Andres Gomez Montt, told the BBC.Mr Adair said he wanted to read the full court ruling before making further comments, but expressed his satisfaction at the decision."They have asserted our rights and I believe this is a great step forward," he said.Mexican legislation on people with disabilities was drafted with the intention of protecting them, by taking away legal responsibility for their actions, but Mr Adair's mother says the law is out of date."Many children have different levels of disability. Some need more support, some need less. This should be about giving to each one what they need," Leticia Robles told BBC Mundo earlier this year.The UN's World Health Organization describes autism spectrum disorders as "a group of complex brain development disorders".It affects one in each 160 children around the world on average, the WHO says."These disorders [which include Asperger's syndrome] are characterized by difficulties in social interaction and communication and a restricted and repetitive repertoire of interests and activities."</body>

      <body>At least six people have been killed and two injured in a gas explosion in the central Mexican state of Puebla, officials say.It is not yet clear what caused the blast at the natural gas storage plant at the Chachapa industrial park.The explosion set off a fire which engulfed much of the area.The main highway linking Mexico City and Veracruz was closed for more than four hours as firefighters brought the blaze under control.Businesses and homes were evacuated in a radius of 3km (two miles).The blast occurred at 18:30 local time (23:30 GMT) at the plant owned by Tomza Gas. Local officials said most of the workers had already finished their shift, keeping the number of casualties relatively low.Four of the bodies were found soon after the blast. Two other burnt bodies were found later in the plant's rubble.The victims have not been identified.Governor Rafael Moreno Valle has visited the site.Some 100 people who spent the night in hostels and improvised shelter have now been allowed to return home.Tomza sells and install gas tanks and cylinders for household, commercial and industrial use.There have been a series of gas-related accidents in Mexico. More than 20 people were killed when a lorry carrying gas tanks exploded on a highway on the outskirts of Mexico City in May.And in September 2012, 26 people died in a fire at a gas plant owned by the state oil company Pemex in the city of Reynosa.</body>

      <body>Chemical weapons inspectors in Syria have been unable to access one of the designated sites because of safety concerns, the world's chemical weapons watchdog has told the BBC.It is the first time they have been unable to complete a scheduled visit, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) spokesman said.But overall the experts were pleased with their progress so far, he said.Their mission to rid Syria of chemical weapons was set up by a UN resolution.It followed international outrage at a chemical weapons attack near the Syrian capital Damascus in August.Meanwhile, Syrian state TV reports that a Canadian United Nations worker, missing since February, has been released in Damascus.Carl Campeau had been working as a legal adviser to the UN Disengagement Observer Force that patrols the ceasefire line between Syria and Israel in the Golan Heights.The Syrian government says the Canadian was kidnapped by rebels but has now been handed over to a UN representative.The OPCW's work in Syria marks the first time the international chemical weapons watchdog - which won this year's Nobel Peace Prize - has been asked to oversee the destruction of a weapons armoury during a conflict.The organisation, which is based in the Dutch city of The Hague, said the team in Syria had completed nearly 50% of their work of inspecting more than 20 sites and destroying equipment.Under the UN resolution, Syria's chemical weapons production equipment must be destroyed by 1 November and stockpiles must be disposed of by mid-2014.The deadline for Syria to submit its "destruction plan" was 15 November, the OPCW said on Thursday.But despite the good progress, inspectors were forced to turn back at one site after failing to receive assurances that they would be safe, OPCW spokesman Michael Luhan told the BBC.There had been a number of security incidents over the last few days, which had given them "cause for concern", he said.On Wednesday night there had been a mortar attack near the hotel the inspectors are staying in in Damascus and over the weekend a number of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were detonated in cars nearby, he said.Meanwhile, an international conference on a political solution to Syria's conflict could take place in Geneva on 23-24 November, Qadri Jamil, Syria's deputy prime minister, said on Thursday.He made the announcement after talks at the foreign ministry in Russia, Syria's main international ally.More than 100,000 people have been killed in the fighting that has ravaged Syria for two-and-a-half years, according to the UN.More than two million people have fled Syria and some 4.5 million have been forced from their homes within the country.Casualty figures vary for the chemical weapons attack on the Ghouta agricultural belt around Syria's capital, Damascus, on 21 August.It was estimated to have killed hundreds of people. The United States and other Western powers blamed the attack on President Bashar al-Assad's forces.But Mr Assad accuses Syrian rebels of being behind it.</body>

      <title>Syrian refugees 'detained in Egypt'</title>
      <description>Syrian refugees fleeing to Egypt face unlawful detention, often in deplorable conditions, or deportation, Amnesty International says.</description>

      <body>Syrian refugees in Egypt often face illegal detention or deportation, Amnesty International says.The authorities are holding hundreds of Syrian refugees in deplorable conditions, among them children as young as one, the rights group says.Some of them are accused of being Muslim Brotherhood supporters, and being complicit in the recent political violence in Egypt, Amnesty said.The Egyptian authorities have not yet responded to the findings.The UN estimates that by the end of 2014 more than eight million Syrians could have been forced from their homes, and the number of refugees outside Syria could hit 5.2 million.Syria's civil war began in the wake of the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011, which saw Egypt's long-time President Hosni Mubarak toppled."The Egyptian authorities have a duty to provide protection to anyone who has fled the conflict in Syria and is seeking safe refuge in their country," Sherif Elsayed Ali, Amnesty International's head of refugee and migrants' rights, said in a statement."At present Egypt is failing abysmally to meet its international obligations to protect even the most vulnerable refugees."Instead of offering vital help and support... the Egyptian authorities are arresting and deporting them."Prior to the military ousting of President Mohammed Morsi, Syrian refugees told Amnesty International that they felt safe and protected in Egypt.However, in July and August, following Mr Morsi's removal, their situation turned for the worse when some public figures and parts of the mainstream media started accusing Syrians of being supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and taking part in pro-Morsi demonstrations, Amnesty said."My kids can't play outside anymore. They are cursed by the other kids, told really bad words… There were 1,700 [refugees] living in the area, but now there are no more than 500," a Syrian refugee in a suburb of 6 October City outside Cairo told Amnesty this month.The campaign group's report - "We cannot live here any more": Refugees from Syria in Egypt - says this change in atmosphere has prompted some Syrians to try to reach Europe by boat.Many of those detained had been stopped whilst trying to make the hazardous crossing across the Mediterranean Sea.The report says the Egyptian navy has intercepted around 13 boats since August and, according to UN refugee agency, arrested 946 people, 724 of whom remain in detention.Several lawyers said they were prevented from representing refugees detained in police stations along the Mediterranean coast, the report said.Scores of Syrian children are being detained, many without their parents and some detainees have been held in unsanitary conditions in police stations without food or medical assistance, it said.During a visit to a police station in the port city of Alexandria last week, Amnesty researchers found about 40 Syrian refugees unlawfully and indefinitely detained, including 10 children, the youngest of whom were one-year-old twins held there since 17 September.Several detainees told Amnesty International that police threatened to transfer them to Al-Khalifa prison in Cairo unless they signed papers accepting deportation to countries in the region or back to Syria.Lawyers told researchers that in at least two instances refugees were collectively deported back to Damascus, Amnesty says.Earlier this month a group of 36 mostly Palestinian refugees from Syria were deported to Damascus.Amnesty said many of them are believed to have been detained in Damascus at the Palestine Branch of Syrian Military Intelligence, one of the most feared sections of Syria's secret service."Sending refugees back to a bloody conflict zone is a serious violation of international law," Mr Ali said.The report was also critical of new restrictions on Syrian nationals entering Egypt, requiring them to have a visa and security clearance before arrival.</body>

      <description>A special election to represent the state of New Jersey in the US Senate is won by rising Democratic star and Newark Mayor Cory Booker.</description>

      <body>Newark Mayor Cory Booker has won a special election to represent New Jersey in the US Senate.Mr Booker, 44, defeated Republican Steve Lonegan in a race to replace Senator Frank Lautenberg, a Democrat who died in June.With almost all of the vote counted, Mr Booker led Mr Lonegan by 55% to 44%.The Democratic mayor of New Jersey's largest city will become the second black senator in the current Congress and the first from New Jersey.On Thursday, Mr Booker acknowledged the Senate's low approval ratings in the wake of the highly partisan government shutdown and debt ceiling debate.But, he told MSNBC television's Morning Joe he was a "scrapper" who looked forward to tackling tough issues."I'm hoping to join with a lot of good people from both sides of the aisle," he said.Considered a conservative activist, Steve Lonegan, 57, is a former mayor in Bogota, New Jersey, and the former New Jersey state director of Americans for Prosperity - a group funded by the billionaire Koch brothers, which advocates a limited role for government.Mr Booker has been mayor of Newark since 2006, when he came to power promising to turn round a city suffering from high unemployment, public corruption and rampant crime.Widely billed as a rising star in the Democratic Party, Mr Booker is a progressive on social issues, supporting same-sex marriage, healthcare reform and gun control.Both candidates sought to boost their campaigns with the backing of celebrities.While Mr Lonegan received the support of the former Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Cory Booker won the endorsement of US talk show host Oprah Winfrey.Mr Booker will serve the remaining 15 months of the late Mr Lautenberg's term and will have to run for re-election in November 2014.When he arrives in the Senate, replacing Republican appointee Jeff Chiesa, the Democrats will increase their control of the upper chamber to 55-45.</body>

      <body>The Guardian journalist who broke the Snowden leaks story is to join a new media project being set up by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.Glenn Greenwald confirmed he was leaving the UK newspaper for the mass media outlet being planned by the French-born billionaire.Laura Poitras, the documentary-maker who connected Greenwald with Edward Snowden, is also expected to join.Mr Snowden leaked details of US government surveillance programmes.The former US intelligence contractor is now living in Russia, where he was granted temporary asylum after fleeing Hong Kong in June, shortly after the revelations were published.On Wednesday, British Prime Minister David Cameron accused The Guardian of having knowingly compromised national security by publishing the leaks.Greenwald, a US citizen based in Brazil, insists that none of the information he published could have damaged national security.Announcing his new project in a statement, Mr Omidyar said he wanted to support "independent journalists in a way that leverages their work to the greatest extent possible, all in support of the public interest".His project, he said, was in its early stages but he had approached Greenwald and found that he and fellow Americans Poitras and Jeremy Scahill, an investigative journalist, were already contemplating something similar."We had a lot of overlap in terms of our ideas, and decided to join forces," said Mr Omidyar.The billionaire said his new outlet would be independent of other media with the focus on allowing independent journalists to "pursue the truth in their fields"."And, I want to find ways to convert mainstream readers into engaged citizens," he said in the statement.Mr Omidyar's existing projects include the US-based Omidyar Network, a philanthropic investment firm which operates in some of Africa's most troubled countries.Forbes magazine estimated the Frenchman's net worth to be $8.5bn (£5.3bn; 6.3bn euros) last month.Announcing his departure in a statement on Tuesday, Greenwald said he was embarking on a "once-in-a-career dream journalistic opportunity".</body>

      <description>The effect on bereaved people of a random knife killing</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-22966016</url>
      <date>1382000214</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70511000/jpg/_70511384_holly-91.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>National crime figures have shown that murders involving a knife have dropped 9% in the past year, from 207 in 2011-12 to 189 in 2012-13. The figures provide a dispassionate, statistical snapshot of these crimes, but do not yield the experiences of those left behind - the families. Here are some of their stories.The narrative of fatal knife crime is usually a simple one.A person is killed, the grieving family releases a tribute, the case goes to court and the person responsible is imprisoned.The police will then release a statement on behalf of the family in which the detectives are thanked for their help in securing justice.Some people might even use the word "closure".And that, appeals not withstanding, is that.Only it never is like that.The real impact of violent deaths on surviving families is rarely told. It does not fit the prescribed narrative with its neat beginnings, middles and endings.Mood swings, addiction, the loss of toenails and hair, suicide attempts, marital collapse, alienation from friends and difficulties with eating - the physical and social effects of bereavement are less reported.The after-effects of knife crime on the bereaved can resemble the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) experienced by post-combat soldiers, psychologists say.This is something Anne Oakes-Odger knows all too well.Her son Westley Odger, 27, was stabbed in the neck outside a cash machine in Colchester in 2005. He died of his injuries.The "reason" for the attack was that he told someone not to jump the queue.Ms Oakes-Odger, who lives in Essex, believes the psychological and physical impact of murder on surviving family members is poorly understood."You feel as though you are losing your mind," she says. "When a child is murdered, it is out of the normal course of events."The shock element creates a lot of physical and mental issues for every member of the family."One of the things which happened to me was my hair fell out in bunches and my toenails fell off. I thought that was peculiar to me, but I found out it wasn't."The loss of her hair and nails was, she says, a symptom of the stress of living in a sustained "flight or fight" state. She also suffered colour blindness."During the early years I was not seeing things in colour. I could only see in black and white and various shades of grey."There isn't a 'closure' with homicide."The criminal justice system itself hinders rather than helps, according to Ms Oakes-Odger. For months or years after a murder, the loved one is more "evidence" than person, and can be subjected to multiple post mortem examinations.And at the centre of proceedings sits not the victim, or their family, but the accused.Grieving while the wheels of justice roll, she says, is nigh on impossible. And by the time they do stop, the psychological damage is already done.The Ministry of Justice says it understands the "immeasurable suffering" experienced by victims' families and that it is committed to making sure more support than "ever before" is available to them.This includes the national Homicide Service, which offers such families a Victim Support caseworker and access to specialist counselling.The department is also "revamping" the Victim's Code which it says will make "major improvements for victims" and give them a clearer guide about their entitlements and sources of help.These are the type of measures Tanya (pictured above), who asked for her surname to be withheld, says she desperately needed.Her husband Gary, 59, was murdered by their son Ed who, after killing his father upstairs with a hammer and a knife, came downstairs and tried to kill her.She heard two "thuds" upstairs and believes had she not turned around to see her son before he attacked she too would have died.The killing happened a week before Christmas in 2007. The family had enjoyed a normal day and Ed had been upstairs in his room. He asked Gary to come up and help him fix his stereo.It was then that he killed him.Her son, who was 15 at the time, is serving 18 years for murder and attempted murder. He had denied the charges, claiming his state of mind was altered by the anti-depressant fluoxetine."I lost everything that day," she says.Like Ms Oakes-Odger, Tanya's toenails fell out. Even now, six years on, she still loses her nails when she is under stress.After her husband's murder, the former nursery worker could not bring herself to use knives - even cutlery knives - or face opening her post.Looking back, Tanya says there is precious little support offered to the families of people violently killed. The attention and support, she says, goes to the perpetrators.The victims' families, Tanya says, are - with the exception of police family liaison officers - left to find their own way through the emotional and practical debris of a disaster."There was nothing," she says. "And it takes so much for you to ask for help. And you just don't have the words. It would be much better if support was offered to you, even if you didn't take it there and then, but could take it along the way."My two other children (who were in their late teens when their father was murdered by their brother) had no support."Also difficult has been the expectations wider society places on the families."It has been five years but I still have days when it is hard - anniversaries. Some people are really good and know when you're not in the right place. Others say 'you're OK' and they expect you to be OK and so for those people, you are."I still have times when I have to put the knives away and when people are doing DIY with hammers... but it is part of everyday life, and you have to get used to it."For some, deaths can trigger a personal redefinition. A shy person learns to speak out, for example.Take Holly Watson. Now aged 20, she met her half-brother Lewis when she was 14.Just two years after they met, Lewis was dead. The 23-year-old was stabbed three times in Sudbury, Suffolk.The only photograph she has of Lewis, who was a keen angler, is of him holding a fish. She never got to say goodbye as he was dead before she got to hospital."That was hard," she says. "I had never seen a dead body before. And when the first body you see is your big brother, well that's hard to deal with."I became a bit of a recluse. At the beginning I hated the world and everybody in it."It was almost like a hysteria, with Lewis dying, the funeral and the waiting, like limbo land, and then the court case and then everybody said it would get easier with the closure, but it doesn't."Immediately after her brother's death, she was unable to pick up a cutlery knife."To begin with knives made me feel sick, I couldn't use them. We felt we could not hold something that had killed Lewis."Then there was the impact on her ambitions. Holly had always wanted to be a lawyer. But as she started to explore the law, she found many of the scenarios put to students in law exams involved knife crimes.Her ambitions for the law were put on hold.Next year she will turn 21. It is not an anniversary she is looking forward to. Her brother, she says, should be there for it. And should she ever marry, then Lewis should have been there for that too. But he won't be."I dread the day when I have children and I have to tell them that their uncle isn't here," she says."The biggest thing in getting over something like this is in accepting that the world is not always what you want it to be."Holly says she used to be shy. She is now an anti-knife violence campaigner.So too is Caroline Shearer.Her 17-year-old son Jay Whiston was fatally stabbed in the heart outside a house party in Essex last September.Exactly what happened remains unclear and is currently subject to court proceedings.Ms Shearer describes the days since her son's death as a "living torture" peppered only by the briefest of moments each morning, in the gap between sleep and consciousness, when the anguish of loss is kept at bay.She would love to have all of the happy memories she shared with Jay at the forefront of her mind.Instead, the recurring image which haunts her is of her boy on the cusp of adulthood lying dead on a mortuary slab."I was a mother of two children then, within three hours, I was a mother of one," she says."He was a normal, everyday, loving, caring boy. I always say he had such a huge heart, they couldn't have missed."The grief she describes is like a sledgehammer. There are gaps in the day when she might, for example, notice the weather, or have a conversation. And then the grief hits her, again and again.It is with her throughout the day - as she washes clothes, cooks meals or sees a car of the same colour as Jay's - and last thing at night as she falls asleep.And she too had difficulties with eating.She tells how shortly after Jay's death she struggled to use kitchen knives or cutlery - because of their association with the implement used to kill her son.None of the symptoms reported by the families surprise clinical psychologist Don Macleod.Mr Macleod has worked with families across the north west of England who have suffered tragedy. Some suffer PTSD symptoms more often associated with combat veterans.But for the families, he says, the expert knowledge needed to help them is often not there."I would be almost certain that your average GP would not actually tag what's going on with someone having that kind of reaction," says Mr Macleod."The GP might know there had been a murder in the family, but they might not have the time or indeed the skills and knowledge to be able to pinpoint that [PTSD] is what the issue is."Part of the issue is that the initial responses to grief - anger, anxiety, flashbacks and depression - are, although extremely unpleasant for the people suffering them, "completely normal" given the circumstances.They become an issue, he said, when they "become protracted" - such as with PTSD.Can these families ever recover?Ms Oakes-Odger thinks they can, but it is a slow, painful process which results not in a return to how things used to be but in acceptance of the way they are now."It is about finding a new 'normal'," she says, "a normal in which you can lead a purposeful life, one you can go forward with."</body>

      <title>Digging deep on social mobility</title>
      <description>How young will 'pay the price' for lack of social mobility</description>

      <body>Alan Milburn says he was asked by the coalition to "hold its feet to the fire" in examining its progress on social mobility and child poverty.But just how much will his words hurt?In this, the first of what is planned to be an annual "State of the Nation report", the commission led by the former Labour health secretary concludes that "Britain remains a deeply divided country", one where "being born poor often leads to a lifetime of poverty".The commission says austerity has made it even harder to break ingrained cycles of poverty, that "disadvantage and advantage cascade down the generations".It warns there is a danger that social mobility will go in to reverse after rising in the middle of the last century and "flatlining" towards the end of it.The post-war years saw a big expansion of the middle classes, as the professional jobs market grew and more people bought their own homes, but there has been little change in the last quarter of the century.Mr Milburn said over decades, the UK had become a wealthier society, but had "struggled to become a fairer one" and had more children living in poverty and lower levels of social mobility than "many other developed nations".A total of 2.3 million children (one in six) live in poverty, he said, and this made it essential that the pattern where "birth not worth" determined a person's chances in life was changed.Higher social mobility had become "the new holy grail of public policy". It is certainly something all parties now say they want to see.The report from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission has stinging words on some areas of government policy but they are sweetened with praise for others, including the fact that the coalition continues to "stick to its commitments" on ending child poverty and improving social mobility in "challenging times".Mr Milburn told journalists at a news conference the government "deserved credit" for that.But the target of ending child poverty by 2020 - begun under Labour and continued by the coalition government - would "in all likelihood" be missed, he said.His most stinging criticism seemed to be about the way the young were likely to pay the highest price for a lack of social mobility and poverty during the global financial crisis.He called for older generations to be asked to dig deeper.The number of young people who have been unemployed for two years or more is at a "20-year high", he said.And there was an "inter-generational unfairness" in terms of who was being asked to pick up the bill in the recession.He did not call for pension cuts, but Mr Milburn said politicians should be prepared to "break political taboos" to talk about whether wealthier pensioners should lose benefits currently available to all - particularly the winter fuel allowance and the free TV licence.Pensioners were usually more worried about their grandchildren than themselves, he said.The commission is also looking to employers to do more - to offer better training, pay higher wages and open up professions to a wider pool of people. Two-thirds of children living in poverty, the report says, are living in homes with a working parent.Schools and universities were also urged to do more.He said schools in some areas were letting down pupils from poorer homes and those from middle-income homes too.Schools should give more help to low-achievers from middle-income homes as well as the poorest, while the government should improve careers advice, give extra incentives for teachers to teach in the worst schools and pay colleges "by results they achieve for their students in the labour market - not the numbers they recruit".As for universities - which were the focus of an earlier report by the commission - he says the sector as a whole has drawn in more students from poorer homes but top institutions remain out of reach for too many.Each year, he said, there were 3,700 "missing" state school pupils who had achieved the grades needed to get in to universities in the Russell Group (which represents some of the UK's leading universities) but did not go to them.The commission called for the government to put social mobility at the heart of its policies and practices, so that it was a "golden thread" running through all it did. It concentrated on the overall UK picture, but pointed out that in Scotland and Wales, the issue "currently has a low profile".In an age of austerity, the report's authors suggest creating a fairer society will be a job for all - and far from pain-free.</body>

      <description>Can too much rumination be dangerous?</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country.A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind?Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation.But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be.The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them.A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK."We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool."Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown."The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety."The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others.The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion."But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says."The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem."This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology."Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years."When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says."If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head."Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming."There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me."Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head."Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders.And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum.In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems.So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them?"Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman.It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study."It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says."It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed."Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system."This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster."And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists."Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on FacebookFollow @BBCOuch on Twitter and on FacebookFollow @BBCOuch on Twitter and on Facebook, and listen to our monthly talk show</body>

      <title>China girls barred from 'boys' jobs'</title>
      <description>The jobs China just won't let women do</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24534782</url>

      <body>In China - as in many countries - more women than men are entering university. But are there jobs for the girls out in the real world?Manicurist or courtroom judge? Cake decorator or radio host? For the cost of a ticket, children in Beijing can test out dozens of possible careers at the I Have a Dream theme park.But even in this imaginary world, these children - and their parents - stick to rigid gender stereotypes.The most popular attraction for girls is the chance to dress up as flight attendants. After dragging tiny suitcases onto a fake plane cabin, they learn to serve meals from a miniature trolley."Straighten your uniforms!", the girls are told, as they stand in neat rows, nervously tugging at their sleeves.Many boys choose to work as customs agents or security guards - in costumes complete with fake rifles and mini bullet-proof vests.In China, the idea that girls can't or shouldn't do the same jobs as boys is passed on early. It's a lesson that extends into university and beyond.Six hundred kilometres south of Beijing, at the China Mining and Technology University in China's eastern Jiangsu province, a group of mining engineering students listen intently to their professor.They're the envy of others at this school, since they belong to one of China's so-called "green card majors", courses that all but guarantee employment after graduation.But this program has one clear entrance requirement: men only."China's labour law suggests mining work is unsuitable for women, so we ask women to refrain from applying to our major," explains one of the department's senior professors, Shu Jisen.This university is not alone. Out of respect for women's safety, it says, China's education ministry bans girls from studying a variety of subjects across China, from tunnel engineering to navigation.At one university in Dalian, northern China, females are barred from studying naval engineering - because months on board a ship would be tough for women to endure, one admissions officer explained to the BBC.Slightly different reasons are given for severely restricting the number of women who can study at Beijing's People's Police University, which has a strict quota, limiting girls to comprise 10-15% of the student body.An admissions officer refused to be interviewed in person. But over the phone, he told the BBC that women were not allowed into the university in large numbers because there were not many jobs open to them after graduation, since most people in China expected police officers to be male.Jiangsu's mining engineering department cites similar practical considerations. Women would not be able to carry heavy mining equipment, they explain, and they would not be able to escape the mine as quickly in an emergency."Some jobs are really inappropriate for women," Prof Shu argues."If they force their way into these jobs, they will waste energy that can be better used elsewhere."Some refuse to accept those reasons. A small but feisty network of students and lawyers is fighting the restrictions. Using electric razors, they shaved their heads in series of well-publicised protests across China last year."It was blatant gender discrimination," argues one of the student activists, Xiao Meili."No-one had stood up to these universities before, and told them these policies were wrong. Why didn't anyone want to change anything? It really made me very angry."But more are starting to question the ban. In the university lunch canteen in Jiangsu, girls, here to study everything from management to mathematics, can't stomach the restrictions."If someone can endure tough working conditions, that person should be allowed to do it," explains one student."Universities should lift the limitations and allow people to make their own choices, instead of just barring them."The activists' network is also battling gender quotas at many Chinese universities that favour boys.In recent years, females across the country scored top marks in China's all-important college entrance exam. But schools want their courses to achieve a balance between genders, so they regularly lower the admissions standards for boys, leaving girls with higher marks out of luck.China's ministry of education insists that it does not allow fixed gender ratios when admitting students, "except for military academies, national defence and public security colleges", according to China's state news agency, Xinhua.But unofficially, the quotas are still in place at many schools, according to the activists.They hope to eradicate all written policies banning girls from applying to any majors, a goal activist Xiao Meili feels they can reach within a year.And hidden prejudice against women in education? That presents a bigger challenge."Sexism is in every corner of life in China, and people get so used to it that it's easy to ignore it," she says."People got used to the idea that men did things better than women. But when women started to excel, people got scared and thought of that as a problem."</body>

      <title>Can kindness movements make a difference?</title>
      <description>Would you put a stranger's litter in the bin?</description>

      <body>Picking up litter. Buying someone in need a coffee. Or just doling out free hugs. There's a growing movement of people doing nice things for strangers, but do they make for a kinder society?Each week, Elisa Ng trawls the streets of Singapore picking up rubbish discarded by her fellow citizens. She is not searching for treasure hidden in the litter. Her only goal is to leave the city a little cleaner than before."I want to encourage other people to pick up a piece of litter every day," she says.Recently, she chased an errant lorry driver who had thrown a plastic bag from his window. "He looked quite apprehensive and seemed apologetic," she says.Thankless though the task seems, Ng is just one of many residents of the city who have been inspired by the Singapore Kindness Movement, a government-funded body which aims to promote helpful and courteous behaviour amongst its people."It definitely makes a difference," says William Wan, the leader of the movement. "We have changed the way that certain social norms are accepted. People are starting to give up their seats on buses now, which they never used to do."A similar organisation, the Random Acts of Kindness Foundation, was founded in Denver, Colorado, in response to the city's "Summer of Violence" in 1993, when dozens of people were killed in gang-related shootings, including several children. One victim of stray gunfire was just 10 months old.The organisation borrowed the writer Ann Herbert's call for people to "practice random acts of kindness, and senseless acts of beauty".The phrase has since been popularised on doormats and bumper stickers across the US and encourages Americans to surprise one another with good deeds.Kelsey Gryniewicz, a director at the foundation, advocates activities such as anonymously leaving hampers of food on neighbours' doorsteps and paying for the person queuing behind you at a coffee shop."It's not just about single acts, though," she says. "It's about changing your mentality from day to day."The World Kindness Movement represents the work of organisations from 23 different countries. "It has gone way past the level of community endeavour," says its secretary general Michael Lloyd-White.But measuring the impact of these groups is not easy.Each year, the Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) publishes a World Giving Index, which attempts to track certain types of giving behaviour in 146 countries across the globe.The data is extracted from an annual poll conducted by research firm Gallup and ranks countries according to the proportion of people who have volunteered, helped strangers at random, or donated money to charity in a typical month.In first position last year was Australia, where a third of the population volunteers each month and two-thirds claim to have helped a stranger and donated money to charity.Lisa Grinham, from CAF's Australian branch, says that the rise is due to the flooding that hit Queensland and Victoria the year before, pointing out that figures tend to rise in times of national hardship.Globally, however, the position is very different. "The trend that has been revealed is a disturbing one," says Dr John Law, the chief executive of the Charities Aid Foundation. The number of acts of kindness and charity dropped by hundreds of millions last year due to the global recession, he says.Singapore dropped from 91st to 114th place in the 2012 World Giving Index. The country's own Graciousness Index also indicated that fewer people had experienced "gracious acts" last year.William Wan of the Singapore Kindness Movement blames the decline on "bread-and-butter issues" such as the rising cost of housing and transport.In the US, which dropped from first to fifth place in the global index last year, a team of academics is working on a programme of compassion education in schools to try to reverse the decline.Richard J Davidson from the Center for Investigating Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin-Madison thinks that the level of kindness in society can be improved if children are taught to be more empathetic from an early age."Compassion should be regarded as a skill that can be cultivated through training," he says.The kindness curriculum is currently being taught in 10 schools across Wisconsin. The project is still at the research stage, but "the early signs are promising", he says.Not everybody is convinced that focussing on compassion in this way is helpful, however."We have made altruism a sacred object, so we've been blinded to its deleterious effects," says Barbara Oakley from the University of Oakland, Michigan.In a new book called Pathological Altruism, she argues against what she sees as a cultural obsession with the notion of kindness."There's a misguided view that empathy is a universal solvent. Helping others is often about your own narcissism. What you think people need is often not actually what they need."Kelsey Gryniewicz doesn't think that the American kindness movement is guilty of that charge, arguing that there are tangible, practical benefits to the activities they recommend."It doesn't have to be about cradling people in a bubble of kindness," she says.In Singapore, William Wan takes a more reflective view. "We must be realistic. We mustn't be naive. Kindness movements can't solve all our problems, but if they can solve some of our problems, why not use them?"There are more volunteering stories in the BBC News series Making TimeDo you carry out small acts of kindness for strangers, or for you local area?

      <title>The problem with taking too many vitamins</title>
      <description>Can taking supplements actually harm your health?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24563590</url>

      <body>Millions of people swear by vitamin supplements. But many are wasting their time and some could even be harming themselves, argues Dr Chris van Tulleken.In November 1912 a party of three men and 16 dogs set out from a remote base in eastern Antarctica to explore a series of crevasses many hundreds of miles away.Three months later just one of the men returned. His name was Douglas Mawson. His skin was peeling off and his hair was falling out. He had lost almost half his body weight. He recounted what Sir Edmund Hillary described as "the greatest story of lone survival in the history of polar exploration".A month into their journey, one of the team, along with the tent, most of the provisions and six dogs plunged into a crevasse, never to be seen again. Mawson and the other surviving member, Xavier Mertz, started to return to base, surviving in part by eating the remaining dogs. After a few weeks Mertz developed stomach pains and diarrhoea. Then his skin started to peel off and his hair fell out. He died incontinent and delirious a few days later.Mawson suffered similar symptoms. With the kind of understatement typical of his generation of polar explorers he described the skin of the soles of his feet peeling off: "The sight of my feet gave me quite a shock, for the thickened skin of the soles had separated in each case as a complete layer... The new skin underneath was very much abraded and raw."It was the suffering of early explorers and sailors that motivated the first studies of vitamins and their deficiency diseases.At first sight Mawson's story seems to be another such tale - starvation combined with a lack of some vital nutrient. In fact, Mawson's description of his symptoms is an almost textbook description of vitamin A overdose - probably from eating dog liver. As little as 100g of husky liver could give a hungry explorer a fatal dose.Mawson lived to the decent age of 76 but in his story we find the cautionary tale for our times - vitamins can be very bad for you.This piece is about what we have learned about vitamin supplements in the last few years - if you are healthy, and you live in a country like the UK, taking multi-vitamins and high-dose antioxidants may shorten your life.For most of us, for most of the time, they're unhealthy. "Argh!" I hear you say, "I spend loads of money on them and the claims on the packet are really persuasive. Everything, from my full head of hair to my sex life, depends on them!"I want to get into this in a bit more detail because the vitamin companies certainly don't agree with me. So why do we believe they're useful and why do we take them?Vitamins are essential for life, and there are groups of people even in the UK who benefit from specific supplementation, but general unsupervised vitamin pill-popping is more than just a waste of money. The problem is that we all feel very warm and fuzzy about vitamins because, firstly, the tales of deficiency are so horrific, secondly, we read breakfast cereal packs and thirdly, a double-Nobel laureate called Linus Pauling liked vitamin C in vast, vast doses.All this is packaged by the people now selling us vitamins over the counter into that most beguiling of all logical falsehoods - if a little is good, then more must be better.Now I knew the names of the most obscure vitamins long before medical school because I have always had a fondness for the kind of multicoloured, artificially flavoured breakfast cereals that are marketed using a combination of unlikely cartoon animals and claims of being "vitamin and mineral-enriched".And it has to be said that this vitamin and mineral enrichment of staple food has been one of the most effective public health interventions in history. It continues to save countless lives per year even in Europe.So, while you shouldn't eat dog liver in Antarctica, vitamin A deficiency hugely increases the risk of blindness and death in children with measles and diarrhoea in developing countries. So the World Health Organization recommends a very strict amount and cautions that higher doses can cause birth defects in early pregnancy among other problems.So vitamins do make a huge difference to life expectancy in some circumstances, which is persuasive, and the breakfast propaganda catches us in our most vulnerable, bleary-eyed, early morning state, hinting to us that these vitamins have some sort of catch-all, beneficial effect on our lives, that will transform us into the healthy, energetic beautiful people/cartoon creatures portrayed on the cereal box.These things contribute to a general ideal of healthfulness of vitamins. And then there's Linus Pauling.Whether or not you've heard of him, Linus Pauling is a major influence on vitamin and nutrient culture. It's almost impossible to imagine someone with more authority and credibility. He won two Nobel prizes and was, by all accounts, a genuinely good bloke. He wrote a book in 1970 saying that high doses of vitamin C could be effective in combating flu, cancer, cardiovascular disease, infections and degenerative problems.He took immense quantities himself, hundreds of times the required amount, and lived to a ripe old age surrounded by many great grandchildren. He was the poster boy for mega-dosing of vitamins and this contributed to the growth of an industry supported by the belief that supplementation of these molecules in our diet is beneficial in almost every way imaginable.But rather than taking one man's word for it, however credible, it's worth looking at the results of studies that look at what happens to people who take these supplements for long periods of time.Looking at any one individual study won't be very revealing to answer the question of whether vitamin supplementation is good for you. They're densely scientific and the conflicts of interest can be very hard to spot.For the answer you have to turn to what are called "systematic review papers". This is where independent scientists gather up all the available data and re-analyse it to answer big questions.Here's what a couple of them say:"We found no evidence to support antioxidant supplements for primary or secondary prevention [of diseases of any kind]. Beta-carotene and vitamin E seem to increase mortality, and so may higher doses of vitamin A. Antioxidant supplements need to be considered as medicinal products and should undergo sufficient evaluation before marketing". (See references below).Just to be clear - "increase mortality" - that means they're killing you. These are powerfully bioactive compounds but they're not regulated in the same way as drugs. Whatever you think about the regulation there should surely be a warning on the pack if there's data saying they're bad for us.The next question is - why are they bad for us? It's very hard to pick apart the data, partly because vitamins are a fabulously diverse group of chemicals.I'm going to include what people normally refer to as minerals under the heading of vitamins. They're required in the diet not for energy, but as chemical partners for the enzymes involved in the body's metabolism - cell production, tissue repair, and other vital processes.Their functions are understood largely by their deficiency diseases so we're not exactly sure of precisely what they all do or how they interact. Antioxidants provide a nice example. They soak up the very toxic, chemically-reactive by-products of metabolism called free radicals. These free radicals, left unchecked, can cause damage to DNA and may be linked to cancer.Your cells are full of antioxidants but surely taking more would be better? Right? Keep those cancer causing radicals under control? Well, unfortunately, your body's immune system fights infections by using free radicals to kill bugs. Exactly what effect huge quantities of extra antioxidants could have on this is not clear but it's easy to imagine that it might not be good and you could get more infections.Vitamin A is linked to increasing lung cancer in smokers. Excess zinc is linked to reduced immune function. Long-term excessive intake of manganese is linked to muscle and nerve disorders in older people. Niacin in excess has been linked to cell damage. And so on.And it gets more complicated still when you start mixing everything up in one tablet. For example, different minerals compete for absorption. If you take large quantities of calcium you won't be able to absorb your iron. If you take large quantities of iron you won't be able to absorb zinc. If you take vitamin C you'll reduce your copper level.So it's not just that taking lots of one thing is not good for you, it's that it may cause a dangerous reduction in something else even if you are also supplementing that. To work out the optimal ratios is all but impossible although some manufactures claim to have worked it out.So when are supplements recommended? The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends certain supplements for some groups of people who are at risk of deficiency, including:Your GP may also recommend supplements if you need them for a medical condition. If you decide to take supplements, stick to within the RDA, unless you've had guidance from a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist to exceed the dose. If you've got questions about dosage levels, consult a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist.The tales of deficiency combined with the success of enrichment programs means that it's easy to make that leap of logic that if a little is good then more must be better.And if you read my article last week on water you'll see where this is going. I could do this every week. The same article. Substitute water for vitamins/probiotics/antibiotics. Don't trust the science done by the people who are trying to sell them to you and don't assume that if some is good more must be better.It's like beer. Or coffee. Or computer games. Goldilocks was right about things needing to be just right.References:Bjelakovic G, Nikolova D, Simonetti RG, Gluud C.

      <body>The Future's Rosie recently won "best new blog" at the MAD (Mum and Dad) Blog awards. In it, Thomas Bachofner documents the progress of his two-year-old daughter, Rosie, who has Down's Syndrome. But why does he blog about it?I'm a graphic designer from Cheshire, not known for writing or reading any books. So it came as a surprise to me that I could even string a sentence together, let alone write a blog that is well received - I'm guessing it's because it comes from the heart.My site is about Rosie's achievements, such as last week when she stood up for the first time, but it also gives me an opportunity to do my little bit towards raising positive awareness of Down's.The first post was published on 14 February 2012 but the idea to share our story with the world came much earlier.When my wife Karen and I learnt that our unborn daughter had Down's syndrome, it was a shock, and it didn't feel like anybody understood our predicament.As a parent, you assume that everything will be fine. Our two boys, Harry and Joe, were born without complications. But we were told about Rosie's condition in such a negative way that we thought it would change our lives drastically for the worse.I found that all I wanted to do was read real-life parent stories from people in our situation, not the science and figures you become bombarded with when searching online. But there weren't many Down's syndrome parenting blogs around at the time and even fewer were written from a dad's perspective.I started to jot things down and was surprised to find that it helped get my emotions out. My scribbles eventually turned into The Future's Rosie which is having more of an impact on me and others than I could ever have predicted.Initially it was a handy way of telling my friends and family how I was feeling and it meant I didn't have to repeat myself over and over at what was a delicate time for me. But many of them began to share it with their friends and, before I knew it, my blog was being read by hundreds of people.I've shared lots of private thoughts about her development and how we as a family are all pitching in to help her.Last year I wrote about what I called "a barbaric-looking developmental aid" given to Rosie by her physio. It's a standing brace and we couldn't get her to use it. She hadn't wanted to walk or crawl, so we got Rosie's brothers to stand on the sofa and blow bubbles which made her reach up and support her body with her legs in order to strengthen them.I've covered learning the Makaton sign language, feeling full of pride when my young sons Harry and Joe stood on stage at school to give a talk about Down's to 250 kids, and I wrote about the weekend we all survived without Mummy being there.One of the hardest things I have done is write about Rosie's surgery. Children with Down's syndrome often have related heart difficulties and Rosie was born with a hole in the heart which needed fixing. My blog entry on that day included post-op pictures of my daughter - it felt like these might be useful for parents to see, if they too have to face the same operation with their Down's syndrome child.As Rosie got older, I quickly learned that my own pre-conceived ideas of Down's were both ignorant and outdated. I wanted to teach others about the reality in a non-patronising manner, so decided to use myself as an example in my own social media campaign. I did it from Rosie's perspective and called it Things I've Taught My Daddy.As with the blog, before I knew it the captioned images I shared on Facebook and Twitter had been seen by thousands worldwide.One of the messages I tried to communicate was that people with Down's are people first and foremost. They are more like their families than they are each other, though many people still find it difficult to see past the physical characteristics associated with the syndrome.Life with Rosie really is very normal, in fact she has been a far easier baby than both her older brothers were. The whole family love her to pieces and I genuinely wouldn't change a single thing about her - well, maybe the volume of her cries when she is hungry.After all "Down's syndrome" isn't who she is, it is just a part of her.Thomas Bachofner blogs at The Future's RosieYou can follow Ouch on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Candid words at Iran nuclear talks</title>
      <description>James Reynolds on how Iranian minister's backache broke the ice</description>

      <body>As Western diplomats hail positive progress at talks with Iran on its nuclear programme, the BBC's James Reynolds in Geneva looks at what may have brought the two sides closer together.For years, negotiators from the six world powers and Iran struggled to find ways to understand one another. The only thing they appeared to share was the same awkward posture around their cavernous negotiating tables.But diplomats in Geneva found an unusual source of common ground with their new Iranian counterparts: concern for the status of the Iranian foreign minister's back.In recent days, Mohammad Javad Zarif posted Facebook updates on his debilitating back pain - he was even pictured on Twitter lying down on his flight to Geneva to protect his back.As soon as the formal talks began on Tuesday, diplomats took turns to ask after Mr Zarif's health and offer him advice."I did. We all did," said a senior US administration official with a smile.Once this common ground was established, officials got to work. Mr Zarif used a PowerPoint presentation on his black Lenovo laptop to outline a plan to end the conflict over Iran's nuclear ambitions.For the first time in many years, diplomats say that they engaged in detailed discussions about the nature of Iran's nuclear programme. The talks were conducted in English - a change from previous rounds, where consecutive translation between English and Farsi slowed the pace of dialogue."I've been doing this for two years and I have never had such intense, detailed, straightforward, candid conversations with the Iranian delegation before," said the US official.Neither side will talk about what is in Iran's plan. One diplomat at the talks suggested that this was a positive sign - real discussions do not take place in public.But any final agreement will have to address the demands that the world powers have made in recent years: stop the enrichment of uranium; export existing stockpiles of low- and medium-enriched uranium; suspend work at the heavily fortified Fordow enrichment facility.In return, Iran's demands of the outside world (and the West in particular) are well-known: lift sanctions and recognise what the Islamic Republic calls its right to enrich uranium.Those competing demands will no doubt be discussed when teams of nuclear and sanctions experts hold their own talks in the next few weeks.This round of negotiations also highlighted an important point: Iran and the United States have quietly settled into the habit of holding direct, openly acknowledged talks.Late on Tuesday, the Iranian and US delegations met on the sidelines of the conference for an hour. The US described those talks as "useful".This meeting followed two historic encounters in September: the face-to-face meeting between Mohammad Javad Zarif and US Secretary of State John Kerry, and the 15-minute phone conversation between Presidents Obama and Rouhani.The taboo preventing either side from holding (or acknowledging) direct talks with the other has disappeared."It is no longer the Rubicon that it was - and that is a good thing," said a US official in Geneva.There is much also for Iran's new government to take away from this round of talks. President Hassan Rouhani was elected in June on a promise to end needless confrontation with the outside world. His government will want to show that this Geneva conference marked an important step towards ending the Islamic Republic's isolation."To be fair to our friends in the P5+1 [the world powers group], they showed a new approach," said Mohammad Javad Zarif at his closing news conference.The two days of talks in Geneva appeared to run down his final reserves of strength. Mr Zarif was escorted from the news conference in a wheelchair. But he did manage a wave.After years of mistrust, it took a bad back to break the ice.</body>

      <title>Teachers' strike closes schools</title>
      <description>Thousands of schools close across much of England as teachers strike over pay, pensions and jobs.</description>

      <body>Thousands of schools are closed across much of England as teachers strike over pay, pensions and jobs.Teachers in London, Cumbria, the South East, North East and South West have been taking part with nearly 3,500 schools shut or partially closed.The action is part of a continuing campaign of regional strikes involving members of the NUT and NASUWT unions.Prime Minister David Cameron said the strike was "inconvenient for parents" and "not good for pupils' education".NUT general secretary Christine Blower, said the union regretted the disruption caused to pupils and parents but teachers felt they had "no other choice".Major rallies have been taking place in Bristol, Durham and London, with smaller events in other areas, including Brighton, Carlisle and Plymouth.Teachers are objecting to proposals by Education Secretary Michael Gove to bring in performance-related pay, increase their workloads and make changes to their pensions.Twenty out of 33 London boroughs have provided information to BBC London 94.9 about the number of schools affected so far.Of those, about 445 schools are completely closed and 450 partially closed.And in Tyne and Wear, at least 471 schools have been affected by the industrial action.Head teacher Roberta Kirby, from Fernhurst Junior School, in Portsmouth, said the government had "declared war" on teachers.More than 200 schools in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight are affected by the action.She said: "If we cannot offer good wages and a pension that staff pay into that reflects the work they do, then we are not going to be able to attract the best graduates."Responding to the impact of the strike, some parents said they had found it difficult to find alternative childcare.The BBC's Sarah Ransome said: "People in Plymouth have been telling me that finding alternative childcare because of the strike has been 'quite a headache'."A similar walkout by teachers took place in the east of England, the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber region on 1 October.Ms Blower said: "Mr Gove has done nothing to address the crisis of low morale in the teaching profession which threatens the continued provision of high quality education."Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said the "overwhelming majority of teachers" were on strike.She said: "Teachers are committed and dedicated public service workers. They do not take strike action lightly."No teacher has any wish to inconvenience parents or disrupt pupils' education, but this action is not the failure or due to the unreasonableness, of teachers."Plans for a national one-day walkout before Christmas have also been announced by the two unions.Speaking to BBC Sussex, Mr Cameron said responsibility for the strike "lies with the teaching unions"."I think it is very disappointing they have decided to go on strike," he said."And when we look at the things they are striking over, pensions and pay, they are things that have been decided independently by well-led reviews."I was at my children's school today in London. One class was not there but the rest of the school was operating."So, every praise to those teachers who have gone ahead and kept our schools open for our kids."A spokeswoman for the Department for Education (DfE) said 27% of the schools in the affected regions were closed, however, there was no figure available for how many were partially closed.She said: "The NUT and NASUWT have tried to create as much disruption for pupils and parents today as possible."In spite of this, thanks to many hardworking teachers and heads, only around a quarter of schools in the targeted regions were closed today."</body>

      <title>Muslim free school 'dysfunctional'</title>
      <description>A Muslim free school in Derby is criticised by Ofsted inspectors as "dysfunctional" and rated inadequate in every category,</description>

      <body>A Muslim free school has been damned by Ofsted inspectors as "dysfunctional" and rated inadequate in every category - within a year of it opening.An inspection at Derby's Al-Madinah school was brought forward after fears were raised over teaching standards.The report says teachers there are inexperienced and have not been provided with proper training and that the school requires special measures.The school said it accepted the report and would use it to move forward.Reacting to the findings, David Cameron told BBC Radio Derby: "If they don't take immediate action to deal with these things then I think it is right it should close and I think it's absolutely right to intervene rapidly when these things aren't working properly."However, he added: "Let's not use this as a stick with which to beat the whole free school movement - there are now hundreds of schools which have set up as free schools, and on average they have more outstanding and good ratings than established schools."When it goes wrong - just as with a state school - you've got to get in there and sort it out, or close it down," he said.The Ofsted inspection had been due to take place by the end of the year but was prioritised following initial allegations that female teachers were obliged to wear hijabs and boys and girls were segregated.The school has since written to pupils and staff telling them there is no requirement to cover their hair.Education minister Lord Nash last week warned the school it faced closure unless discrimination against female staff and pupils stopped.A spokesperson said: "We were already investigating this school before allegations became public. We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection."We have received a response from the Al-Madinah Education Trust as well as a report on the school from Ofsted. Any decisions made will take into account all the available evidence."The Ofsted report found that pupils were given the same work "regardless of their different abilities" and the governing body was "ineffective".It said basic systems were not in place, describing the school as being "in chaos" and "dysfunctional".Boys and girls had different lunch sittings but the report said this was due to the small size of the canteen.Inspectors gave the school the lowest ranking - "inadequate" - in every area, prompting the chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw to call for it to be placed in special measures.This means Ofsted will carry out inspections at the school at short notice to monitor improvements. If poor performance continues the school could be closed.Dr Stuart Wilson, the acting head teacher, said there were "significant and serous problems" at the school and accepted some of the lessons were not meeting necessary standards."Are special measures a disaster for the school? Yes, they are," said Dr Wilson."It's not where we want the school to be at this time but we accept the report."In one mathematics lesson, described by Ofsted as "insufficiently challenging", pupils spent the majority of their time cutting out and pasting shapes.Dr Wilson said the school, which has 412 pupils aged between four and 16, had a lot of issues to deal with but he insisted it did have a future."Obviously the report doesn't make pleasant reading for anybody - we don't want to be in this position - we wish we weren't in this position - but what we need to do now is to accept the report in full and use it to move the school forward."Writing to the school's chair of governors on Thursday, Lord Nash said the Ofsted report was "further compelling evidence of the breaches of the funding agreement I have required you to address"."Contrary to your suggestion that I have acted prematurely, I am even more convinced of the need for very decisive and urgent action on the part of the trust to comply with all your obligations and remedy the serious failings at the school."Chris Williamson, MP for Derby North, said: "Frankly, the position of Al-Madinah school is now untenable and I would fully expect the school to close and for the children to be found alternative places in the council schools in the city."Speaking in Parliament earlier, shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said the Ofsted report was a "devastating blow to the education secretary's flagship policy".He said: "It reveals that pupils have been failed on every possible measure and parents will want to know why the education secretary has allowed this to happen."He described the government's free school programme as a "dangerous free-for-all"."David Cameron and Michael Gove can no longer ignore this issue - it is a crisis entirely of their own making," he said.But speaking at the weekend, Mr Hunt told BBC One's Andrew Marr programme that although Labour would not open new free schools "along the Michael Gove model", the bulk of existing free schools would be kept open as his party wanted to "keep the good free schools".Responding to Mr Hunt's more recent comments, the schools minister David Laws said that the government had taken "swift action" to deal with failings at the Al-Madinah free school told MPs that no school would be allowed to "languish in failure".He also accused Labour of "total and utter opportunism" using the report "to shift its position".</body>

      <description>The qualifications of adults now in their 40s, 50s and 60s were as much influenced by social background as intelligence, a long-term study finds.</description>

      <body>The level of qualifications achieved by adults now in their 40s, 50s and 60s was influenced by social background as much as their own intelligence, according to a long-term study from the University of Oxford.It found that children of the same ability went on to achieve very different levels of exam results.Academics tracked 5,000 people in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.It comes as a report on social mobility is about be published.The study, from Oxford University's Department of Social Policy and Intervention, examined the academic achievements of cohorts of people born between the late 1940s and 1970.Their academic results as young adults were compared with cognitive ability tests taken when they were aged between 10 and 13.It showed that children from wealthier and better educated families had been much more successful in exam results than poorer children of a similar intelligence level.It meant that many poor, bright young people leaving school in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s failed to reach their full potential.Among the youngest of this survey, leaving school in the mid-1980s, fewer than one in five went to university. Among the oldest group, who would have left school in the early 1970s, only about one in 20 reached degree level.Last week figures from the OECD think tank indicated the 55-65 age group in England had stronger literacy and numeracy skills than 16-24-year-olds, even though the younger group had much better qualifications.The OECD has warned about the diminishing job prospects for those without skills.And this study shows the long roots of the academic gap between rich and poor and the lack of social mobility in education.What surprised the Oxford University researchers was that a parallel study in Sweden, across the same decades, also showed a strong link between economic background and academic achievement.The lead author of the study, Erzsebet Bukodi, said there were expectations that Sweden would have had more equal outcomes, but the results showed that poorer children were also disadvantaged there.Co-author, Prof John Goldthorpe, said the results showed that Sweden was not "significantly ahead" in terms of a meritocratic system and he said it raised questions about whether educational policies could be used to promote social mobility.Dr Bukodi also highlighted how the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s were decades of great social change, with a perception of increased social mobility, but the studies in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland and Sweden showed a sustained picture of a social gap in exam results.Across three decades there had been no diminishing of this link between social background and achievement, said Dr Bukodi.Despite the lack of a level playing field, it still remained possible for bright children from poorer backgrounds to out-perform those who were from wealthier backgrounds, but with less intelligence.But it was an uphill struggle.The study suggests that among the cleverest children born in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland in 1970, in the top fifth of the ability range, 80% of the richest children achieved two A-levels or their equivalent, compared with only 40% for the poorest.It meant that for poor children with high levels of intelligence, a majority left school in the 1980s without two A-levels."We see that in both the British and Swedish educational systems, even the very brightest children are hampered if they come from a disadvantaged background," said Dr Bukodi."It is possible of course that clever individuals choose other ways of getting on in the world than through education, but the fact remains that many children in British and Swedish schools do not appear to fulfil their academic potential."</body>

      <title>Apprentice schemes 'need reform'</title>
      <description>Apprenticeships in England need to be overhauled to stop many young people being offered practical qualifications that have little worth, a study says.</description>

      <body>Apprenticeships in England need to be overhauled to stop many young people being awarded practical qualifications that have little worth, a report says.Compared with other European countries, many apprenticeships are low quality and too short, the Sutton Trust warns.It says thousands of apprenticeships should be created to boost the economy and improve youngsters' job prospects.The Department for Education says apprenticeships are being reformed to "drive up standards".The Association of Colleges said some existing apprenticeships were respected by industry and should be preserved.The study, which was carried out by the Boston Consulting Group on behalf of the Sutton Trust, says fewer than 200,000 of the 520,000 apprenticeships starting in England every year are rated at level three - which is equivalent to A-level.The report cites figures that suggest apprenticeships are offered by just one in five (20%) of employers in England, compared with over half (51%) in Germany, which, the report says, is considered to have one of the best vocational education systems.Only 61,000 new apprenticeship starts were for young people, whereas in Germany, 570,000 new apprenticeships are for youngsters and 90% of these are equivalent to A-levels.The report also notes that England's vocational system has 18,000 different qualifications, while Germany has 330.The report warns that since 2010, more than half (58%) of apprenticeships have been below level three and three-quarters have been aimed at those over the age of 25, many of whom are already in work.And it warns 11 young people are competing for each apprenticeship.In his foreword to the report, Sutton Trust chairman Sir Peter Lampl said the report had found that, with some exceptions, the opportunities on offer to young people who did not go to university were "poor".The attitude in England, with some exceptions, was very different to that in countries such as Germany and Switzerland, he said."Instead of a clear system of respected vocational routes, we suffer from a complicated patchwork where too many young people are offered qualifications of little worth in a system that confuses employers and is not valued as it should be by society," he said.He said the "cruel deception" about an expansion in apprenticeships, when many were below level three and the majority went to older workers, had to stop.The report calls for apprenticeships to be radically expanded, with up to 300,000 new starts each year. The majority of these should be at level three at least for three years, with some four-year courses at level four - higher than A-levels.No more than 10% of apprenticeships should be two-year courses at level two, it says.Sir Peter said: "Real apprenticeships are as important to social mobility as good university degrees."Students facing huge loans for a university education find themselves between a rock and a hard place. Even if they would prefer to work with training, the lack of good apprenticeships means they feel they have little choice."England's patchwork vocational system not only hinders our economic competitiveness, it prevents tens of thousands of young people from gaining good skilled jobs."Teresa Frith, from the Association of Colleges, said: "Creating 300,000 apprenticeships, when the report acknowledges there is already a shortage of apprenticeship places for 16 to-year-olds, would be a massive challenge and although we agree that there is a business case for employers to take on apprentices, at the moment too few do."The report also says level three apprenticeships should be the priority. This isn't a bad idea in principle but some level two apprenticeships, such as those in construction, are well-respected by the industry and should be preserved."The report is absolutely right to say that vocational courses should only be taught in institutions with high-quality facilities and expert teaching staff and that careers advice and guidance needs to be improved."A Department for Education spokeswoman said: "We are already radically reforming apprenticeships to drive up standards so that they are more rigorous and responsive to the needs of employers."Since 2010 over a million people have become apprentices, providing a great start to their careers. We have already insisted that apprenticeships last for a minimum of a year, include more English and maths and that every apprenticeship is a job."We have consulted on wider reforms to drive up standards in apprenticeships further, and will publish plans later this month."</body>

      <body>Working parents in Britain "simply do not earn enough to escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn has warned.Two-thirds of poor children are now from families where an adult works, his report found.Many low and middle-income children face being "worse off" than their parents because of falling earnings and rising prices, Mr Milburn added.Wealthier pensioners' benefits should be cut and minimum pay raised, he said.The former Labour health secretary suggested some benefits currently protected from cuts - such as free TV licences and winter fuel allowances for pensioners - could be means tested in order to share the burden of austerity more fairly.But a spokesman for David Cameron said: "The prime minister believes it is right to make commitments to pensioners in relationship to state provision."The government has pledged to safeguard such benefits until the next general election.In its first report, the government's Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission warned the target of ending child poverty by 2020 would "in all likelihood be missed by a considerable margin" - leaving as many as two million children in poverty.Poverty is defined as having a household income that is less than 60% of the national median income.The latest government figures on poverty, released in June, show the median UK household income for 2011/2012 was £427 a week - 60% of that figure was £256 a week.In that year, 17% of children, or 2.3 million, were classed as being in poverty while 15% of working-age adults, or 5.6 million, were in poverty.For pensioners, meanwhile, that figures was 16% - or 1.9 million.The report said Britain still had "high levels of child poverty and low levels of social mobility" with a rising number of children in "absolute poverty" coming from working families.Two thirds of children officially deemed as being poor now came from a family where at least one parent was working - and in three out of four of those cases, at least one of their parents was working full time, the report found.It also said the "twin problems of high youth unemployment and falling living standards" were storing up problems for the future.Among its key recommendations the report urged the government to:"Just as the UK government has focused on reducing the country's financial deficit it now needs to redouble its efforts to reduce our country's fairness deficit," the report said.Single mother Judith Healy, who works from home as a telemarketer, said that, while her wages had not gone up, her expenses had continued to increase.She said she was worried about paying energy bills this winter."We didn't ask to get in this situation, we are doing the best that we can in the circumstances that we have and that's really what it's about - it's survival now," she told BBC News.Mr Milburn told the BBC: "Today child poverty is a problem for working families rather than the workless or the work-shy."Around five million people in the country, mainly women, were earning less than the living wage, which is about £7.45 an hour outside of London, he said."These are the people frankly who do all the right things, they go out to work, they stand on their own two feet, they look after their families - they're the strivers not the shirkers - and yet they're all too often the forgotten people of Britain and I think they desperately need a new deal."Mr Milburn said that while ministers and employers could do more, it was unrealistic to expect the government to continue topping up low pay using working tax credits.He advocated a scheme for pairing bright children with the best teachers in an effort to raise attainment.Mr Milburn has previously said social mobility - the idea that individuals can better themselves in terms of educational opportunity, job prospects and salaries from one generation to the next - is "flat-lining".Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg welcomed the report, but warned that "punishing pensioners isn't going to help a single child achieve more in life".Enver Solomon, of the National Children's Bureau charity, said the report was "a wake-up call for all political parties by stating that our country is dramatically polarised between the haves and have- nots"."As the commission states, there is an urgent need to rebalance the distribution of resources so that the burden of austerity is more equally shared," he said.Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said the "powerful report" showed "ordinary families' living standards [were being] squeezed and social divisions [were] deepening as a result of this government's decisions to put a privileged few first".On Wednesday, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed the number of unemployed people in the UK fell by 18,000 to 2.49 million in the June-August period.</body>

      <body>University staff are to stage a one-day national strike at the end of this month in a row over pay.Institutions across the UK are expected to be affected by the action, taken by three unions - the University and College Union (UCU), Unison and Unite.The Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA), which represents universities as employers, said it was disappointed by the move.The news comes as teachers plan a strike in parts of England on Thursday.Members of the National Union of Teachers and the NASUWT are staging a further regional strike in their continuing row over pay, pensions and workload.The unions planning the university strike for 31 October claim a 1% pay rise offered to staff - including lecturers, technicians and administration workers - means there has been a 13% pay cut in real terms since October 2008.For Unite, the turnout for the ballot was 28% and of these, 64% (1,654 members) voted in favour of action. For the UCU the turnout was 35%, with 62% voting in favour of strike action.Unison declined to release details of what percentage of its membership had voted. It only said of those who had voted, 54.4% had been in favour of action and 45.6% against.UCU head of higher education Michael MacNeil said: "Staff have suffered year-on-year cuts in the value of their pay. Quite simply, enough is enough."We urge the employers to reflect on the fact that they are about to face their first ever strike by three unions at the same time and come to the negotiating table to resolve this dispute."The suppression of academic pay is one of the most sustained pay cuts since World War II and, while strike action is always a last resort, the fact that staff are prepared to take this step demonstrates just how angry they are."A spokesman for UCEA said: "Employers do understand that the general 1% uplift offered to all may be frustrating to these trade unions, with 5% of the workforce saying they will support strike action."However, we also know that much more than this is going into pay increases for HEI [higher education institution] staff: 3% incremental rises for many plus merit payments beyond this."Our HEIs tell us that the vast majority of their staff understand the reality of the current environment and would not want to take action that could harm their institutions and their students."</body>

      <title>Teenagers face 'sexting' pressure</title>
      <description>A surveyl suggests almost two thirds of teenagers have been asked for sexual images or videos of themselves, BBC Newsnight learns.</description>

      <body>Six out of 10 teenagers say they have been asked for sexual images or videos, an NSPCC/ChildLine survey seen by the BBC's Newsnight programme suggests.Of those questioned, 40% said they had created a sexual image or video, and about a quarter said they had sent one to someone else by text.The NSPCC's head, Peter Wanless, said "sexting" was getting much more common."These results show that sexting is increasingly a feature of adolescent relationships," he told Newsnight."It is almost becoming the norm that a young person in a relationship should share an explicit image of themselves," he said.For the survey, NSPCC and ChildLine spoke to 450 teenagers from across the country.Of those who had sent an image or video to someone else by text, 58% said the image had been sent to a boyfriend or girlfriend, but a third said they had sent it to someone they knew online but had never met.About 15% said they had sent the material to a stranger.Of those who said they had sent a photo to someone, 20% said it had then been shared with other people, while 28% said they did not know if their picture had been shared with anyone else.More than half (53%) of those questioned said they had received a sexual photo or video, a third of whom had received it from a stranger.Under British law it is legal to have sex aged 16, but it is illegal and a serious criminal offence to take, hold or share "indecent" photos of anyone aged under 18.However, the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) told Newsnight it was highly unlikely children would be prosecuted for sexting."I've been sent a picture before, when I was at school," Daniel, 19, told Newsnight.Speaking from the Salmon Youth Centre in Bermondsey, south-east London, he said: "This girl [and me] had an argument the next day - not about the picture but about something else."I got so angry, I was sending that picture everywhere. It was mean. I felt bad after. To this day she hates me, but that's not the point. I shouldn't have done it in the first place."Taylor Weekes, 17, told Newsnight: "Most girls of my generation do it for attention, to try and find love out of it, but it usually is the wrong way."According to figures from the National Crime Agency's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop) command, 62% of children aged 12-15 owned a mobile phone in 2012, with the figure expected to rise by the end of 2013.Experts say growing smartphone ownership, together with evolving technology, has helped created a perfect storm.Even many of the cheapest mobiles now have cameras with which teenagers can easily take pictures of themselves and distribute them cheaply.With most phones now connected to the internet, "sexts" can instantly be posted on social networking sites - quickly accessible by millions of people.Ceop is dedicated to eradicating the sexual abuse of children. It says it is concerned about images falling into the wrong hands."What we're seeing is abusers taking advantage and getting images out of young people and then blackmailing them for more by saying, 'If you don't do more for me, I'll send these to your family and friends,'" Ceop's head of education, Jonathan Baggaley, said.Now there are growing calls for the government to do more to educate young people about the potential dangers of creating and posting self-generated sexual content.Ministers say that from 2014 all children in England from the age of five will be taught how to stay safe online as part of the new IT curriculum, while existing guidelines offer a sound framework for sex and relationship education in school.But campaigners say the dangers of sexting should be covered in personal, social, and health education (PSHE) lessons."Sexting is not an IT issue, it's a relationships issue," deputy children's commissioner for England Sue Berkowitz said.She says every school should run a comprehensive relationships and sex education programme."It must cover things like sexting and use of mobile technology, as well as all other aspects of relationships and sex education," she added.</body>

      <title>Fear over part-time student numbers</title>
      <description>Rising fees and pressure on household spending are behind a 40% fall in part-time student numbers, say university leaders.</description>

      <body>A "perfect storm" of causes is leading to a rapid and worrying decline in part-time student numbers in England, university leaders have warned.The Universities UK study blames rising fees, pressure on household budgets and reduced support from employers.It examines why part-time students have fallen by 40% in two years, equivalent to a reduction of 105,000.There are concerns that such part-time courses are necessary to provide the skills needed by industry.Sir Eric Thomas, who headed the review, said "something is going wrong".There has been widespread recognition of the economic importance of part-time courses in allowing adults to improve their skills.Most of the 500,000 students taking part-time courses are adults, a majority are women and most will be studying a vocational or work-related course.But the numbers have been been tumbling for two years and the report says that next year's recruitment figures do not suggest that this downward trend will be reversed.Professor Thomas, who is vice-chancellor of Bristol University, said: "The reality is that the UK needs more graduates and relies heavily on part-time higher education to meet these fast-changing skills needs in a fast-changing world."We ignore part-time study's transformative power for individuals and society at our peril."In England in particular, numbers are declining and do not look like rallying."The report says that the sharp decline in numbers reflects a combination of factors.It calls for part-time courses to be seen as an integral part of higher education and "not as an add-on"."There needs to be an urgent push at all levels - national, regional and local - to help potential students and employers understand the value of and opportunities for part-time higher education," says the report.Rachel Wenstone, National Union of Students vice president, said there needed to be more thought about how part-time degree courses were compatible with people's lives."This obvious decline cannot be swept under the carpet any longer - there needs to be a collective response from all levels to the challenges that these groups of students are facing," she said.The Confederation of British Industry's chief policy director, Katja Hall, said: "It's shocking that the number of part-time undergraduate students has plummeted over the last two years."For our economy to stay competitive we'll need more people with higher levels of skills, so it's more important than ever that working people have the opportunity to re-train and up-skill."Alex Bols, executive director of the 1994 Group of research-intensive universities, said: "A decline in part-time study could hamper the UK's attempts to extend its skills base and economic growth."</body>

      <title>Few children 'connected to nature'</title>
      <description>Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a three-year study from the RSPB suggests.</description>

      <body>Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a study from the RSPB suggests.The three-year project found that only 21% of children aged 8-12 were "connected to nature".Girls were much more likely than boys to be exposed to the great outdoors, while children in Wales had the lowest score across the UK.The RSPB says that a perception among some adults that nature is dangerous or dirty could be holding children back.There has been an increasing amount of research in recent years underlining the lack of contact and experience with nature among modern children.Some have argued that this is having a negative impact on their health, education and behaviour.In 2012, the National Trust published a report on the phenomenon of "nature deficit disorder", though it is not recognised as a medical condition.The RSPB says its new study is the first to quantify the scale of British children's exposure, or lack of it, to the natural world.They came up with a definition of what "connected to nature" actually means and then developed a questionnaire with 16 statements designed to assess the level of connection among children.Some 1,200 children from across the UK were asked to agree or disagree with these statements. Only 21% of children in the UK had a level of connection with wildlife and the natural world that the RSPB believes should be realistic and achievable for all youngsters.This "realistic and achievable" value is based on the average scores of children visiting RSPB sites or who are junior members of the organisation.One interesting finding was the gender difference. While 27% of girls were at or above the "realistic and achievable" target, only 16% of boys were at the same level."We need to understand these differences," Sue Armstrong-Brown, head of conservation at the charity, told BBC News."Whether boys and girls are scoring differently on different questions, are girls more empathetic to nature than boys for instance? We need to analyse the data to find that out."The report also highlighted significant regional differences. Only 13% of children in Wales achieved the basic level of exposure, compared with almost twice this number in Northern Ireland and Scotland.The average score for London was higher than the rest of England. Overall urban children had a slightly higher connection than those living in rural areas.According to Sue Armstrong-Brown, the attitudes of adults may be having a significant effect on children."There is definitely an attitude out there, in some cases, that nature is not perceived as interesting or engaging. In some cases it is perceived as a dirty or unsafe thing, and that's an attitude that won't help a young person climb a tree."The RSPB hopes that its study will be taken up by government as one of the indicators on the state of children's wellbeing.Sue Armstrong-Brown believes that improving the natural connection for children is not only good for the youngsters, it is crucial for the future of nature conservation in this country."If we can grow a generation of children that have a connection to nature and do feel a sense of oneness with it, we then have the force for the future that can save nature and stop us living in a world where nature is declining," she said.Follow Matt on Twitter.</body>

      <title>Oxford raises exam reform concerns</title>
      <description>Plans to overhaul A-levels and GCSEs could "wreak havoc" to the exams system in England, Oxford University's admissions tutor says.</description>

      <body>Plans to overhaul A-levels and GCSEs could "wreak havoc" to the exams system in England, Oxford University's admissions tutor has said.Mike Nicholson said universities and schools were worried about the limited evidence available on reforming exams.He said plans to make AS-levels a stand-alone qualification would hinder attempts to increase the numbers of disadvantaged students doing degrees.Ministers said single exams would end the "test treadmill" in sixth-forms.Speaking at a Westminster Education Forum in central London, Mr Nicholson, who is director of undergraduate admissions and outreach at Oxford University, said changing A-levels was "another great example of a government's tendency to meddle in things they should probably just leave alone".He said: "There is widespread concern, not restricted to the secondary-school sector, but also to higher education, about the limited evidence that there is need for any change and widespread concern that the impact of bringing in both GCSE and A-level changes at the same time is going to just wreck the English education system."Part of the problem is a total misunderstanding and confusion over activities and information that is in the public domain," he said.Under the government's plans, teenagers will no longer take "modular" A-levels with exams throughout but "linear" A-levels with exams at the end of the two-year course.AS-levels will be separated from A-levels to form a qualification in their own right.Mr Nicholson said that there was an assumption that linearity was good, partly because some universities still operated a system of exams at the end of a three-year degree course. But he added that universities had "managed to cope with modularity".He said students also applied for degree courses with different types of qualifications, including the International Baccalaureate, the Cambridge Pre-U and A-levels.Mr Nicholson also raised concerns about the planned changes to the AS-level."The loss of AS-levels will have tragic consequences for widening participation and access to higher education."AS-levels are excellent because they give students a very clear indication of what they are capable of achieving."The real danger is students will plough on believing that they may not be capable of applying to a highly selective course, but equally believing that they are capable of applying to a highly selective and competitive course."Losing AS-levels will have a really significant result on the likelihood of students from a disadvantaged background progressing to higher education."Mr Nicholson also said there were misconceptions around the A-level subjects that Russell Group universities - which are considered among the best in the UK - required from prospective students.In 2009 - following calls for universities to be clearer about their admissions procedures - the Russell Group published a list of subjects that tended to be required more often than others.Mr Nicholson told Tuesday's forum:"We tried to respond and give advice. That however has been totally misinterpreted. It states very clearly in the document what the intention is."People choose to ignore that and say what it's basically saying is here are the 12 subjects that will guarantee you a place at a Russell Group university."That's total nonsense. If you believe that's the case then I'm sorry but you are deluded."He also said that no university required students to have the government's English Baccalaureate at GCSE. This covers English, maths, sciences, a language and history or geography."If anything, with GCSEs, we much prefer students to have high grades across a range of subjects," Mr Nicholson said.A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: "We are putting universities, not politicians, in charge of A-levels to ensure they prepare children for work and higher education."According to [the exams watchdog] Ofqual, the clear majority of universities favour A-level predictions over AS-levels as an indicator of ability."Returning A-levels to single exams will end the test treadmill in sixth-forms - something which many teachers complain about."</body>

      <body>Michael Gove has been urged to monitor free schools more closely after a Muslim faith school was closed temporarily because of safety concerns.Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt wrote to Mr Gove saying he was concerned problems at Al-Madinah School revealed a "systemic complacency".The government said it was looking into the school before issues became public.A junior education minister warned the Derby free school it had 17 issues to address including poor standards.Free schools are state-funded schools set up by faith groups, parents, teachers and other individuals and groups. They are directly accountable to the Education Secretary as they are not within the local authority sphere of influence.Al-Madinah School was closed for seven days earlier this month after a single day of inspections by Ofsted which found incomplete records of child protection checks for staff. And concerns were raised about female teachers at the school being told to wear the hijab even if they were not Muslim.In his letter to the education secretary, Mr Hunt said: "In the coming days, we expect Ofsted to publish the inspection report on one of your flagship free schools, the Al-Madinah Free School in Derby."You will be very aware of the high level of public interest and concern generated by the recent temporary closure of the school and the imminent findings of Her Majesty's Inspectorate."As I am sure you will agree, there should be no excuse for underperformance in any school. But it is especially troubling that 400 pupils should be deprived of a week of schooling because a publicly funded free school failed in its duty to meet basic child safety requirements."He added: "Moreover, the parliamentary under-secretary of state for schools has recently acknowledged that the Al-Madinah Free School is 'delivering an unacceptably poor standard of education', and I am extremely concerned that this situation could be indicative of a systemic complacency on standards."Mr Hunt went on to ask whether Mr Gove was satisfied with current arrangements for spotting underperformance in free schools.He also asked the education secretary to explain how parents would be provided with a "firm guarantee that their children's education and safety is not being put at risk due to the inadequate oversight of your free school programme".The letter also highlighted claims there were warnings from Ofsted regarding potential issues with welfare, health and safety of pupils at the Derby school before it opened in September 2012. Mr Gove was asked to explain what steps were taken to ensure that these "warnings were heeded" and that "all issues were resolved before the school opened".The Department for Education did not address many of these questions in its statement, but it did say: "We were already investigating this school before allegations became public. We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection."We have received a response from the Al-Madinah Education Trust. Any decisions made will take into account all the available evidence."The Al-Madinah school was among the first free schools in England with a Muslim ethos, catering for all reception, primary and secondary pupils.But concerns over the application of strict Islamic practices led to a scheduled full inspection being brought forward.A statement on the school website said: "Unsurprisingly, there has been a number of rumours circulating."While unfortunate, my decision to close the school related to a short-term health and safety issue that has now been completely resolved and will not reoccur."The school has been given a deadline of 22 October to address nine further action points and must provide a plan setting out a clear management structure by the start of November.Ofsted is expected to publish its report on the school in the next week or so.</body>

      <description>Ofsted chief warns of weak leadership in children's services and irresponsible parents.</description>

      <body>"Manifestly and palpably weak" leadership and a high turnover of directors are undermining efforts to improve children's services in England, says Ofsted's chief inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw.There are 20 local authorities rated as inadequate for protecting children.Sir Michael branded Birmingham as an example of bad practice, which he called a "national disgrace".He suggested the local authority might need to be broken up.Sir Michael also called for a wider recognition of the impact of children's home environments, such as irresponsible and alcohol-dependent parents and living on streets lined with betting shops and fast-food shops.Presenting his annual report on social care, Sir Michael delivered a series of hard hitting messages about weaknesses in protecting children.Inspectors only rated four in 10 local authorities as "good" or better for safeguarding.It should be an "urgent priority" of government to examine the role of local authority safeguarding bodies, said Sir Michael.His inspectors had often reported major concerns about these bodies, he said.And he warned about the negative impact of too much "volatility" in the senior leadership in children's services."One in three local authorities has had a change in their director of children's services last year alone. The combination of unstable communities and political and managerial instability in our social care services is a dangerous mix," said Sir Michael.He warned that poor leadership was often isolated from frontline staff, such as social workers, many of whom felt "profoundly undervalued".Sir Michael said that the average career span in social work was only eight years and the profession faced a "demographic timebomb".He delivered a stinging attack on Birmingham's services for children - accusing them of long-running failures in supporting the safety and well-being of young people in England's biggest authority.The city had a poor record on child mortality and child poverty, he said, and there had been repeated failings in inspections and inadequate serious case reviews.This was "failure of corporate governance on a grand scale", he said.Asked after his speech if he meant that the authority should be broken up, he said that was the implication of his argument.In response a Birmingham City Council spokesman said: "We are already on record as saying that we have failed to meet the basic expectation of keeping vulnerable children in this city safe. This is a long-standing problem which we acknowledge and the leader has said that improving children's services is his number one priority.""What we don't need, however, is simply a repetition of our failings without any proposed solutions," said the council spokesman.Sir Michael also warned of the destructive force of "social breakdown" on young lives and how they were let down by their families."They lack more than money, they lack parents who will take responsibility," he said.There were 705,000 children living with alcohol-dependent parents and 130,000 in homes where there was domestic violence."Compassion should not be about making excuses," said Sir Michael, who warned about the corrosive consequences of the "hollowing out and fragmentation" of families.He quoted Louise Casey, the so-called troubled families tsar, as warning that there was too much "pussyfooting around" in supporting families, with too many meetings and too little action.Debbie Jones, Ofsted's national director of social care, said that the child protection system was under "huge pressure", with rising volumes of work at a time when local authority budgets were under pressure.The 20 councils where the standard of child protection services has been judged "inadequate" by Ofsted are:Barnsley, Bexley, Birmingham, Blackpool, Calderdale, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire East, Cumbria, Devon, Doncaster, Herefordshire, Isle of Wight, Kingston upon Thames, Medway, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Rochdale, Sandwell, Slough and Somerset.</body>

      <body>Universities should be brought into the heart of the economy and funded to stimulate growth, a report is urging.It says the government should put £1bn into what it calls Arrow Projects, to turn "globally competitive technological ideas into real business".Current funding streams are too complex, argues author Sir Andrew Witty, boss of GlaxoSmithKline.The government and the Confederation of British Industry welcomed the report.John Cridland, director general of the CBI, described Arrow Projects as a "great idea".Universities Minister David Willetts said the government would consider what recommendations to make following the publication."We know that universities are engines of innovation and have an important role to play in driving our industrial strategy," said Mr Willetts.The report, entitled Encouraging a British Invention Revolution, says the UK is a world leader in technology and invention, adding that "the research strength of the UK's universities in an enormous national asset".But it warns: "We will have to work hard to maintain our position of strength in the face of increasing competition."In his foreword, Sir Andrew writes that UK universities have "an extraordinary wealth of ideas, technology and human energy - much of which is world-leading and capable of seeding not just new companies but whole industries".But without better-focused funding, organisation and collaboration, he says, there is a risk of delay and of "British inventions building foreign industries".He says a "thicket of complexity" in funding "leads to unnecessary hurdles for those striving to translate ideas to job-creating businesses".Arrow Projects are his plan for an taking ideas from "mind to factory" with a "globally competitive sense of timing and scale".If they were successful they "could herald a British invention revolution to rival the transformation witnessed in the 19th Century," Sir Andrew writes.He envisages the projects as large collaborations in technologically advanced fields. The partners would not necessarily be "geographically co-located", and would include a range of universities - not just leading research institutions - as well as industry, business and local and central government.The report says the government "will need to create a new funding stream to bring the Arrow Projects into being."This could be composed of both public and private money, from both new or existing sources and delivered perhaps in the form of block grants which would allow project managers to use their judgement as to how it is spent, it says.Universities and businesses would form themselves into consortiums to bid for the funding. The funding would be channelled through the lead university in each project.Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, said: "The future of the UK economy depends upon making the most of the knowledge, innovation and energy to be found in universities. This work is already happening but the report challenges us, quite rightly, to do more."Dr Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group of research universities, also welcomed the proposal: "Discoveries at our world-leading, research-intensive universities have generated billions over the years."But it's vital for the UK's economy that groundbreaking discoveries make it all the way from idea to implementation and from prototype to profit."Collaboration with business is a core part of the mission of all our academics. But we need to bridge the gap and help everyone work together."Mr Cridland added: "We also need to ensure that more mid-sized and smaller businesses benefit from the huge potential universities bring."A single point of entry for companies wishing to engage with universities and a sharper focus on supporting innovation in mid-sized businesses are logical first steps."</body>

      <title>League tables measure eight subjects</title>
      <description>Secondary school league tables in England are to be based on progress in eight subjects, rather than focusing on C grades in five GCSEs.</description>

      <body>Secondary school league tables in England are to be re-designed to discourage an over-emphasis on pupils achieving C grades at GCSE, says Schools Minister David Laws.From 2016, schools will be measured on overall results in eight GCSE subjects.There will be four key league table measures, showing pupils' progress as well as final grades.Education Select Committee chairman Graham Stuart has hailed the change as an "educational breakthrough".Mr Stuart said it would remove the "damaging obsession" with the C grade boundary.Setting out the reforms in the House of Commons, Mr Laws said they would remove "perverse incentives for schools to act in a way which is not in the best interests of pupils".It will mean shifting away from the current league table system, where schools are ranked by the percentage of pupils achieving five GCSEs grades A* to C, including English and maths.There had been concerns that a disproportionate amount of attention is paid to pupils on this C/D borderline, to the detriment of pupils who achieve at a much higher or lower level."This gives schools a huge incentive to focus excessively on the small number of pupils around the five Cs borderline. This is unfair to pupils with the potential to move from E grades to D grades, or from B grades to A grade," said Mr Laws.He told MPs that it could also conceal "coasting" schools in more affluent areas, rewarding them with high positions in the league tables without stretching their pupils to achieve their full potential.From 2016 there will be four league table measures for schools.It will show pupils' achievements across their best eight subjects - including English and maths, three core English Baccalaureate subjects including history, geography, physics, chemistry and languages and three other subjects which can include art, music, drama and business.This result will be shown as an average grade for the school, such as a B-.As well as showing GCSE results there will be a measure of progress, showing how pupils have advanced since taking tests at the end of primary school.This will be expressed as a score showing how much the results vary above or below expected levels. If schools achieve the expected levels they will score zero - and if they are below expected levels, they will have a minus score.There will be extra weighting for specific subjects, with English and maths worth double points.Other measures are the percentage of pupils achieving C grades or higher in English and maths and the proportion gaining the English Baccalaureate subjects, English, maths, history or geography, the sciences (including computing from next year) and a language.The revised league tables will mean changes to the way underperformance and minimum "floor targets" are measured.The new floor targets will be based on the amount of progress pupils should have made since primary school.Mr Laws defined the new floor standard as "progress half a grade lower than reasonable expectations. So, if pupils at a school are expected to average a B in their eight subjects, the school will be below the floor if they average less than four Bs and four Cs".In terms of how this threshold will be shown in the new-look tables, such a half grade below expectations would be expressed as -0.5.If schools perform above expectations in pupil progress, equivalent to a full grade above, or +1.0, they will not face an Ofsted inspection the following year.At present there are 195 schools below the minimum level of achievement, but Mr Law said that if the new plans were applied to current results the number of schools below the threshold would double."The fact that the new accountability measures will put many more schools below the new floor targets will be devastating to many," said the National Union of Teacher's leader, Christine Blower.But she welcomed the "move away from a 'spotlight' on pupils on the C/D borderline. It still remains the case however that a league table and target culture will persist".Head teachers' leader Brian Lightman said there was much to welcome in the changes, including the shift away from focusing on the C grade boundary.But Mr Lightman, leader of the Association of School and College Leaders, said this was "seriously undermined by other ad hoc changes to the examination system".Mary Bousted, leader of the ATL teachers' union, backed the principle of "prioritising the progress schools make with their pupils rather than simply rewarding those with the top grades".But she cautioned that the measurements of progress depended on the reliability of Sats results as the starting point - saying that their validity "cannot be counted on".Mr Stuart welcomed the changes to the league table system: "These plans are an educational breakthrough that will blow away the damaging obsession with the C/D grade boundary and help every child achieve the best possible results."Chris Paterson, author of a report on school accountability for the think tank Centre Forum, said: "Getting the measure that drives school league tables right could be the single most important education reform of the coalition government."</body>

      <body>Record numbers of UK university students are opting to spend a year studying or working abroad, says the British Council.More than 14,500 UK students took part in the European Union's Erasmus student exchange scheme in 2012-13, the highest since it was launched in 1987.But the UK lags behind France, Germany and Spain, where almost three times as many students are on the scheme.The British Council says foreign study has been shown to boost job prospects.Ruth Sinclair-Jones, of the British Council, described the scheme as "an ideal way to learn another language and culture"."As the number of specialist foreign language courses decline in the UK, Erasmus is becoming even more essential."The international experience offered through Erasmus has been shown to make a real difference in terms of people's employability."The British Council has managed Erasmus in the UK for the past six years.Since then, the number of UK students on the scheme has more than doubled, according to British Council data.The latest UK participation figures show a rise of 7% on the previous year.In all, more than 2.5 million students across Europe have taken part in the scheme.Despite the recent rise, the UK is still well behind other major European countries - the latest figures show 39,000 Spanish students took part in the scheme in 2011-12, along with 33,300 from Germany and 33,200 from France.Last year the University of Nottingham was the UK institution to send the largest number of students on to Erasmus exchanges, with 522 participants.The scheme is also popular among students at other members of the Russell Group of research based universities.Last year Leeds sent 459 students, Sheffield 447, Manchester 438 and Bristol 422.Although the numbers are rising across the UK, there has been particular success in Scotland, with 1,877 students taking part last year.Some 13% of Erasmus participants last year came from Scottish institutions, which represent just 8.5% of the UK student population.The University of Edinburgh was the most enthusiastic Erasmus participant in Scotland, with 356 students on the scheme.Vincenzo Raima, director of Nottingham's international office, said the university had set a target for 25% of its undergraduates to be taking part in some form of international scheme or experience by 2015-15."All the evidence out there tells us that students who undertake international activities gain the additional skills employers are looking for," said Mr Raima.</body>

      <body>A Muslim free school in Derby has said it will support female staff who do not want to wear head coverings.It follows a letter warning the Al-Madinah School it faced closure unless discrimination against female staff and pupils stopped.Education Minister Lord Nash laid out 17 issues for the school to consider, which included an end to "unacceptable" teaching standards.The letter said if steps were not taken by Tuesday, funding would be pulled.Parent-governor Abdullah Shahjan told BBC Radio Derby: "We are amending policies to make sure we support staff, who if for their cultural, ethical, or faith do not wish to cover their hair."Another governor Fasal Hussain said: "We are very open, very flexible."However, with regard to Lord Nash's letter and female staff wearing head scarves he added: "We would have appreciated some consultation."We have never received any complaints from our staff."One of the other concerns raised in the letter was that women and girls were being treated less favourably than men and boys.Head of Islamic studies, Mohammad Burhaan, said: "We are an Islamic school and if we were to discriminate against women in any way we wouldn't be faithful to our faith."If you look at the tradition of Islam, it has a very rich history and heritage of female scholarship - both religious and in the field of science, languages and mathematics - we are very proud of that heritage."If we were going to discriminate we would have applied to be a single-gender school from the outset."He said the chair of governors was female, most staff were female and most pupils were female."I think actions speak louder than words and we can't give a bolder statement to our dedication to equality of gender than that," he said.During an earlier interview on Newsnight, Mr Burhaan said head scarves were the code of dress adopted by the school."If you look at an air hostess, for example, a female wears a different code of dress."We are not saying they are discriminated against, that's a choice made by the business," he said then.The government had told the school to write to all female members of staff telling them they did not have to wear a hijab if it was in conflict with their religion or beliefs.In the letter outlining concerns, Lord Nash wrote: "The trust has manifestly breached the conditions of its funding agreement by:"I will not tolerate breaches of the commitments you gave when entering into the funding agreement."He urged the school's trust to take five "urgent steps" by 15 October, including providing written confirmation that "you have ceased any practices and procedures that have as their reason, cause or effect that women and girls are treated less favourably than men and boys".The school has been given a deadline of 22 October to address nine further action points and must provide a plan setting out a clear management structure by the start of November.</body>

      <description>Labour says it will support parents who want to set up new schools but the Conservatives say the opposition's policy on school choice has not changed.</description>

      <body>Labour is "on the side" of parents who want to set up schools and would not shut most existing free schools, the new shadow education secretary insists.Tristram Hunt told the BBC Labour backed "enterprise and innovation" when it came to increasing school places.He said a Labour government would push ahead with what it called parent-led academies in areas of educational need.Tory chairman Grant Shapps said Labour's policy was unchanged and it still opposed the "popular" schools.Free schools, set up by parents and other groups and operating outside local authority control, have been established under a policy pioneered by Education Secretary Michael Gove.More than 170 have been opened across England since September 2011.Labour has been accused by the government of sending out mixed messages about the party's support, opposing their roll-out nationally but backing schools locally.Mr Hunt, who has just taken over from Stephen Twigg as the party's education spokesman, said he regretted previously describing free schools as a "vanity project for yummy mummies". He made the comments in 2010 shortly after becoming an MP.Mr Hunt told BBC One's Andrew Marr programme Labour would not open new free schools "along the Michael Gove model", but that the bulk of existing free schools would be kept open as his party wanted to "keep the good free schools".Citing the case of the Al-Madinah free school in Derby, which was closed for a week earlier this month on the first day of an Ofsted inspection, Mr Hunt said Labour would not allow schools to become an "ideological experiment".Education Minister Lord Nash has warned the school would be closed unless "unacceptable" teaching standards improved.Its acting head teacher said there were areas the school needed to address and it was co-operating with Ofsted."What is going on with the Al-Madinah school is a terrifying example of the mistakes of Michael Gove's education policy," he said.New schools, he added, should only be opened in areas where there was a shortage of places, where "properly qualified" staff could be recruited and where institutions were financially accountable.Under Labour's plans, parent-led academies would enable parent groups and other organisations to set up schools outside local authority control, although local authorities would have greater powers to intervene when there were concerns about standards."If you are a group of parents, social entrepreneurs and teachers interested in setting up a school in areas where you need new school places, then the Labour government will be on your side."We are in favour of enterprise and innovation."But a Conservative Party spokesman said shadow chancellor Ed Balls had made it clear in a speech in June that the party would curb new schools in areas where they was an "excess" of places.Mr Balls had suggested a future Labour government would prioritise resources on areas where school places were in "short supply".Mr Shapps told the BBC: "This is the same old Labour policy. Free schools will only be allowed in specific circumstances in specific areas with a whole load of bureaucracy attached."Free schools have been driving up standards. They are hugely popular with parents and up to now Labour have fought tooth and nail against them including voting against them and what they said today has changed absolutely nothing."Journalist Toby Young, who helped set up a free school in west London, said Mr Hunt had been "less than candid" about Labour's policy as it was considering granting councils the power of veto over free schools in their boroughs.Writing in his blog for the Daily Telegraph, Mr Young - who has said he is considering of applying to be a Conservative candidate at the next election - said this would be a "retrograde step" since councils would be unlikely to approve new schools close to existing ones which were under-performing.Mr Hunt said there needed to be more focus on vocational education with support for further education colleges and apprenticeships in industry.</body>

      <body>People have been giving their views about how schools are funded at a public meeting in Belfast.In June, the education minister proposed changes to the Common Funding Scheme, which determines how funds are allocated to Northern Ireland schools.The proposals had been brought forward by an independent panel of experts who examined the current scheme.They found it was outdated, too complicated and was failing pupils.The panel recommended a simpler funding formula and financial incentives so that smaller schools are better off if they join with schools nearby.The meeting on Monday evening was attended by about 40 people. The majority of those were teachers, with a number of parents there as well.Concerns were raised at the meeting about how the funding changes are implemented.A Department of Education spokesperson said: "When the minister set out the way ahead for how local schools are funded, he undertook to gather the views of everyone who might be affected, or with an interest, who wishes to have their say."Schools already have a mechanism for responding to the consultation, but, in keeping with the minister's views, we wanted to be able to engage with a wider audience."This public meeting in Belfast follows one held already in Omagh and enables those who wish to put their views across verbally to have their say."It forms part of the wider consultation process that has included an online response form, children's and young people's versions and focussed engagement with parents, children and young people."The consultation closes on Friday 18 October.</body>

      <title>Disabled child support review urged</title>
      <description>The government is urged by the children's commissioner for England to undertake a review of the adequacy of support for disabled children.</description>

      <body>Ministers are being urged to review care provided for children with disabilities following research into the adequacy of support for families.Children's commissioner for England Maggie Atkinson called the findings "heart-rending" and "disturbing".The report suggested some families were unable to afford basic necessities for "a dignified life".The Department for Work and Pensions said the report contained "a small sample, presenting a partial picture".The study, carried out by the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) for the children's commissioner, found evidence that poverty meant some disabled children were not living lives that met international human rights standards.Ms Atkinson said the research findings were "not an easy read"."This is about voicelessness and powerlessness, as well as about making ends meet," she said. "It's very poignant and very difficult to hear the stories."Money issues are very real and very challenging, but parents are equally saying they have little or no say in the ways services are planned and provided, from transport to access to youth, or play or leisure which is properly adapted for one's disability."The research was based on interviews and group discussions with 78 disabled children and young people and 17 parents.It was co-led by a team of 11 disabled children and young people working with the university.A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions rejected some of the conclusions."In fact, independent reports show how we are world leaders in support for disabled people with the UK's spending on disability-related benefits a fifth higher than the EU average."The UK is also acknowledged as a world leader in supporting independent living for disabled people, having the best overall rating of 55 countries."We continue to spend around £50bn a year on disabled people and their services and our reforms will make sure the billions spent give more targeted support to those who need it most."Ms Atkinson acknowledged the government's response, but stressed some of the "personal stories" she had heard painted a different picture.She said: "I would like some of the officials who have no doubt written that statement to come and meet some of the young people, who will tell the very true story of living with a disability on a very low income, and then I would ask them to say that again."There is a mum quoted in the survey, who because her child needs an adapted home, including a multi-sensory environment... was persuaded to make sure that was available."She will be paying for it until November 2022."There is also a young woman going through everything that adolescence brings with it, who needs incontinence pads."The benefits pay for four-a-day, she needs 10. That is not human dignity and it is not human rights either."Despite the criticism, researchers found "many examples" of disabled children receiving good care and services which they said "demonstrate how low income does not have to be a barrier".But evidence was also found of inadequate services, compounding the problems of some low income families.The authors said that although families with disabled children often have rights to welfare payments and practical support, their basic incomes often do not cover the extra costs of raising and caring for a disabled child.The team analysed three United Nations treaty documents: the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on Persons with Disabilities and the International Covenant on Economic and Social Rights.Between them these treaties specify individuals' rights to food, clothes and heating, to live independently, to be able to decide where to live, to live in their local communities and to the support and services they need to be able to do that.The researchers found the lives lived by some disabled children and young people did not meet these basic rights."There were accounts of some disabled children, young people and their parents not being able to heat their homes properly or afford adequate clothing and food," said the paper."Some were not informed or involved in decisions about changes to where they lived."Some experienced delays in adaptations being made to their homes and some did not have enough space nor support for independent living."</body>

      <title>Stones and apples thrown at university reformer</title>
      <description>The tough struggle to modernise Kurdistan's education system</description>

      <body>Prof Dlawer Ala'Aldeen had tomatoes, stones and apples thrown at him. He faced countless demonstrations.The reason for this hostility, facing the microbiologist from the University of Nottingham, was his controversial attempt to reform the university system in his birthplace of Kurdistan.Prof Ala'Aldeen was the architect of plans to improve the quality and to internationalise higher education in Iraqi Kurdistan.He says he was up against "deeply entrenched interests, people, institutions and long stagnant cultures".The region, autonomous for two decades in the wake of the Gulf War, had inherited a post-Saddam university system that Prof Ala'Aldeen has described as "grossly outdated" and designed for a closed, centralised country.In 2009 Prof Ala'Aldeen was given a secondment away from his job as professor of clinical microbiology at Nottingham University in the UK.He stepped from academic life in the English midlands into the role of Kurdistan's higher education minister, a post he held until last year.Prime Minister Barham Salih, a good friend, chose him for his knowledge of the higher education system and the series of critical articles on education and governance he had written in the years up to his appointment.Barham Salih's election manifesto had included significant support for higher education and training to support Kurdistan's large population of under 20 year olds.There were already plans for more scholarships to send talented students to study overseas.Within a week of being appointed, Prof Ala'Aldeen had written up a radical vision document and it was quickly endorsed by the cabinet.Higher education in Kurdistan was suffering a major crisis of quality, capacity and infrastructure.There was a consensus in support of reform and it helped that Prof Ala'Aldeen had been very critical of the government in the past.The reforms, which planned to improve the quality and accreditation of university teachers, brought considerable opposition from student and teacher organisations as well as businesses linked with the burgeoning market in private universities.Several new private universities were threatened with closure, much to the anger of their staff and prospective students who had paid fees for their courses."Many teachers had been licensed prematurely. There were 11 private universities when I started with 18 more waiting to be opened. These mushrooming private colleges were relying on the same pool of resources as the public universities which lacked staff and facilities," Prof Ala'Aldeen says.The problem of staffing was particularly acute in medicine, pharmacy and dentistry and in postgraduate studies.But Prof Ala'Aldeen faced protests and opposition.He was accused of trying to transplant the UK system onto Kurdistan, something he vehemently denies since he was educated and worked in his home region, before coming to study in the UK."I knew the system from the inside and studied what had happened in similar countries. I wanted to apply international principles of quality, but tailor-made to Kurdish traditions," he says.He responded by redoubling his efforts to communicate the purpose of the reforms, which also included curriculum development, moving beyond a single teacher delivering a lecture to a class, the introduction of an electronic admissions system and reforming the teaching of PhDs.In the end, the government closed three private universities as well as five health-related colleges, three pharmacy colleges and two dentistry ones."If we had allowed the system to keep evolving as it was it would have taken at least a generation to fix it - a generation would have been wasted. We knew we had to act fast. It was a risky policy, but it would have been far riskier to do nothing," he says.The speed of his action was criticised as were aspects of the efforts to improve teaching standards, such as student feedback being used to measure teacher performance and pay. There was also opposition to teachers being asked to engage in professional development once a week.Prof Brendan O'Leary, director of the programme in ethnic conflict at the University of Pennsylvania, says that a longer process might have worked better.But he says it was against a background when unprecedented changes were happening in Kurdish society as the region opened up to foreign investment."The Kurdistan region is going through a difficult and fast-paced transformation."Ideally a long and rich discussion is needed to agree new institutional conditions to enable higher education to flourish in a region emerging from decades of destruction, war, genocide, internal fighting, academic isolation and lack of resources."University and institutional reforms are more likely to succeed if all the stakeholders have clear ideas on what to do, when, and at what pace. One should not be surprised if people with vested interests fear reforms," said Prof O'Leary.Thomas Hill, assistant professor at New York University Center for Global Affairs, adds: "I do not believe there is consensus even now that the reforms the former minister wanted to implement would have been in the best interest of the Kurdistan region."There are many, many people with very conservative views within the higher education sector in the Kurdistan region and many did not and do not like the progressive path the former minister was plotting."There were areas in which vested interests remained unmoved. Prof Ala'Aldeen could not increase the independence of universities.The government continues to choose university leaders and universities have been totally dependent on government funding.Prof Ala'Aldeen put together draft legislation on institutional autonomy, but says the challenge to the status quo was too great to push it through.He is in close touch with the current government and is pleased that the reforms to improve quality have been maintained, despite the fact that there is still not consensus in favour of them, and says the scholarship programme is already making a difference."Almost 3,000 students have studied abroad, the majority in the UK. Half of these are or will be back by the end of this year. They will provide leadership and bring a breath of fresh air. They will link their institutions to the outside world and break Kurdistan's academic isolation."Although Kurdistan has its own particular circumstances, Prof Ala'Aldeen says that the problems facing the university system are not unique - and that the model for modernisation could be applied elsewhere in the Middle East."The problems are generic and the solutions can be implemented anywhere in the world."Commentators on Kurdistan's politics agree. Prof O'Leary says: "The Kurdistan region, Iraq and several other states in the Middle East are going through dramatic changes, and in some cases, deeply regrettable authoritarian restorations."Most institutions are highly politicised in these societies. If the Kurdistan region can successfully reform its education system, including higher education, it can provide a model for the wider Middle East."</body>

If you've only just caught on to the concept of online university courses called Moocs, then you're in danger of falling behind again.Harvard, one of the world's most influential universities, is moving on to Spocs - which stands for small private online courses. Nothing to do with Star Trek and sombre Vulcans, but plenty to do with ambitions "to boldly go".And could these be the real deal? The academic chairing Harvard's online experiments says we are already "post-Mooc".Moocs - massive open online courses - have been something of a hurricane in universities, making a lot of noise and promising to rip everything up.Pioneered by some of the most prestigious US universities, they have been re-packaging course units into online lessons and making them available to anyone with an internet connection.But it's still not clear whether this is a passing storm or something that will fundamentally change how higher education is delivered.Last week the UK joined the fray, with more than 20 universities launching an online platform called FutureLearn, which will challenge the dominant players on the east and west US coasts.The biggest success for online courses and their greatest problem are the same - the huge numbers attracted.It demonstrates the scale of the unmet demand for higher education, but at the same time it's not clear how tens of thousands of students on a course could ever satisfactorily be taught, assessed and accredited. Most of these signs-up will sign off without completing courses.At Harvard, more people have signed up for Moocs in a single year than have attended the university in its entire 377-year history. That's a great success story in opening up education, but what do you do with all those hungry minds?Enter the Spoc. And the clue is in the "small, private" part of the name. These courses are still free and delivered through the internet, but access is restricted to much smaller numbers, tens or hundreds, rather than tens of thousands.It means a selection process for applicants and the capacity for a more customised experience. Looking further down the track, it wouldn't be difficult to imagine fees and course credits.Harvard and University of California, Berkeley, part of the edX online alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are among the universities beginning to experiment with this more refined model.Next week a popular and highly topical course in US national security strategy will begin at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Alongside the campus students in Cambridge, Massachusetts, there will be a parallel Spoc version with a limit of about 500 online students.Students wanting to get into this online classroom have to submit a written assignment about the US government's response to the conflict in Syria, along with details of their academic credentials.Even though this online course won't have a formal academic credit at the end, it's going to require eight hours of work a week and a capacity to tackle questions about "Iran's nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria's civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information".These Spoc students might include Harvard students who couldn't get into the campus course, alongside those who might be studying from home or at work.Harvard isn't abandoning Moocs, but rather like Russian dolls sitting inside each other, a single course might now be delivered to a large open Mooc audience, to a much smaller number of Spoc students and then down to an even smaller number enrolled at the bricks-and-mortar campus.It's taking the limited and expensive resource of a Harvard course and amplifying it for widening rings of audiences.Prof Robert Lue chairs the committee of academics that runs Harvard's online experiments, under the banner of HarvardX.He describes the current online learning experiments as a "remarkable moment of possibility".And he sees the move towards more flexible and refined formats such as Spocs as an "almost inevitable evolution"."The Mooc represents just the first version of what we can do with online education," says Prof Lue. And this first version has now been overtaken. "We're already in a post-Mooc era.""What has become very clear is that the engagement you get from a very large group with a wide-ranging set of priorities can be radically different from what you get from a more focused group," says Prof Lue.It also paves the way to tackling one of the biggest problems for Moocs. How can they provide formally-recognised qualifications?The smaller class size will allow "much more rigorous assessment and greater validation of identity and that will be more closely tied to what kind of certification might be possible," he says."It's safe to say that in the quite near term there will be announcements of experiments in this area."There are voices of caution about over-hyped expectations for online learning.A report published last week by the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggested there remained many uncertainties over Moocs.The lack of a clear business model was described as a "burning issue".The edX project is in the fortunate position of being given $60m by Harvard and MIT, but few universities have the resources to give away so much expensively-produced content and staff time.Prof Lue suggests that the really tough questions raised by Moocs are not only about online learning but about what it means for the rest of the traditional campus."What is it that a student gets out of being on campus and being in the classroom?"If students on campus prefer learning online, what does it mean for the funding model for universities? What happens if a recorded online lecture is preferable to a mediocre live talk? How do universities show their "added value"?Prof Lue argues that the significance of Spocs is that online learning is now moving beyond trying to replicate classroom courses and is trying to produce something that is more flexible and more effective.Universities that ignore such developments, or think that Moocs can just be showreels for conventional courses, are putting themselves at risk, he suggests."The really big questions for university are about what students get from the classroom, what works, what could be done better.""Institutions that sit back and watch, they may be in trouble. One can imagine a large institution where there isn't much difference between online and classroom - and then you'd be silly not to realise there's a problem."</body>

      <title>UK enters online university race</title>

      <body>The UK's biggest online university project has been launched, with more than 20 universities offering free courses.Students will be able to follow courses on mobile phones as well as computers.The UK's project, called FutureLearn, sees UK universities entering the global market in so-called Moocs - massive open online courses.It could "revolutionise conventional models of formal education", says universities minister David Willetts.Mr Willetts, speaking at the British Library, said that the expansion of access to higher education was no longer necessarily about "bricks and mortar".He said that the FutureLearn partnership would help to serve the unmet demand for university courses, particularly overseas.The launch of FutureLearn sees 21 UK universities, plus Trinity College Dublin and Monash University in Australia, offering courses that are taught and assessed on the internet.The UK universities include Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham, Warwick, Bristol, Reading, Southampton and the Open University, which has headed the project.The British Library, British Museum and British Council will make material available to students.There are 20 short courses announced, with eight starting this year.In this experimental phase, students taking these courses will carry out multiple choice questions, without any formal qualifications.But universities are hoping that many people will be attracted by the chance to follow university-level courses without any travel or cost and at a time that suits them.It will also provide taster courses for youngsters considering their university options.When the University of Edinburgh offered Moocs through a US network it had more than 300,000 students signing up. The University of London international programme had more than 200,000 registrations.FutureLearn will see the UK taking a much bigger step into the rapidly expanding online university market - with claims that higher education is now facing its own online revolution.They are anticipating that each Mooc course will attract 20,000 students.Universities also see the project as a way of recruiting students to degree courses. Martin Bean, vice chancellor of the Open University, described it as a "digital storefront".But Mr Bean says he expects some universities to begin thinking about how to offer formal credits for Moocs.Reading University is going to offer a Mooc course about basic computer programming."Offering free taster courses online is a no-brainer," says David Bell, the university's vice-chancellor."Universities shouldn't be afraid to open up teaching and research, either in the UK or beyond. Learning never stops and as the economy's demand for higher skills rises, universities should be in the vanguard when it comes to providing new opportunities."Making courses accessible online, on mobiles and tablets means that people can fit their studying around their lives, rather than their lives around study."Southampton University is offering a course in web science, Leicester University's course looks at England at the time of Richard III and the University of Warwick has a psychology course.FutureLearn's chief executive Simon Nelson says it will offer a "fresh approach" with all its courses designed to work across all kinds of online platforms, so that a student could begin a course on a laptop at home and then continue on a mobile phone while commuting.He also promises a less isolated experience for students learning at home. He says that it can be a "solitary experience", but that FutureLearn will try to create a supportive online community, with "very strong social architecture".This will allow students to discuss their courses and ask questions, using social networking-style comment pages alongside the lesson content.This consortium will also draw upon the experience in distance learning of the Open University."Time and again we have seen the disruptive impact the internet can have on industries - driving innovation and enhancing the customer experience. I have no doubt Moocs will do the same for education," says Mr Bean.There were also suggestions from the Department for Education last week that Moocs could be used for vocational courses for students in further education colleges and sixth forms in England.Moocs have already had a major impact in the US, launching last year and spearheaded by alliances of top institutions, including Harvard, MIT and Stanford.Coursera, set up by Stanford academics in California and backed by venture capital, has signed up more than four million students in its first 18 months for courses provided by more than 80 universities.These projects have revealed a high level of demand for courses, but also exposed the difficulty in retaining students, with very high levels of drop-out rates.It has sparked a debate about the cost of higher education and what students are paying for when so much information and so many high-quality university materials are available online.These US online courses have begun to develop ways of giving students formal credits, such as students paying to take invigilated exams.Among the Mooc pioneers has been the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which set up the edX online platform with Harvard.On Tuesday, MIT announced a series of new online courses which will have an identity verification system using webcams and with plans for certification for courses.But there have also been questions asked about the long-term financial viability of online university courses.Last week, William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, challenged whether many universities could afford to invest in the type of free online courses offered by wealthy institutions such as Harvard and MIT.He suggested that online courses might work better as part of a "blended" course, where students spend some time together in the classroom as well as studying online.Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said that online universities represented an overdue technological advance."The models of higher education that marched triumphantly across the globe in the second half of the 20th Century require radical and urgent transformation. My fear is that the nature of change is incremental and the pace of change too slow."The establishment of FutureLearn represents an important step in realising this change and seizing the opportunities technology offers in creating a broader, deeper and more exciting education system."Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: "I encourage all our institutions to explore the opportunities offered by new modes of technology, such as Moocs. This will keep the UK ahead in the global race to deliver education in worldwide markets."</body>

      <title>Gordon Brown's Syrian refugee school plan</title>
      <description>Syria's refugee crisis is also threatening to become a long-term education disaster.</description>

      <body>Syria's refugee crisis is threatening to become a long-term education disaster. There will soon be 500,000 refugee children in Lebanon, with few having access to school. But Gordon Brown, former UK prime minister and UN special envoy for global education, says that lessons could be in place in weeks."A few days ago, global education campaigner Malala Yousafzai was able to speak over Skype to Zahra and Om Kolhtoum Katou, teenage Syrian twins exiled in Baalbeck in East Lebanon.As they talked, the three girls realised that they shared something in common. All three are victims of violence that threatened to destroy their youth and their future, and all three cannot do what most other girls and boys do every morning: leave the home in which they grew up and go to school.Now there is a plan that could help the biggest single group of Syrian child refugees - 300,000 of those exiled to Lebanon - which could see them in school and being fed within weeks.It has been prepared by Kevin Watkins of the Overseas Development Institute for the charity, A World at School, which campaigns to get an education for the millions of children without access to school.But this plan can only be put into practice - and this seems unlikely today - if the international community, which is financing just 2% of schooling needs in humanitarian crises, offers an additional $500m (£319m).The plan involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double or even triple shift system; hiring Syrian refugees as teachers in Arabic in community colleges; providing school meals to tackle hunger as we tackle illiteracy.This strategy is also rooted in the realistic presumption that the plight of the Syrian children is more than a short-term emergency: their exile could last years. It has the active support of the Lebanese government, but it is an open question as to whether the world community will put up the funds.Children are always the most neglected and forgotten victims of conflict. Already deprived of food and shelter, boys and girls are also denied their right to education, condemned to forfeit a childhood that, once lost, can never be re-run or re-lived.The one million Syrian children, who make up half of that country's refugees, are simply the most recent victims of this monumental gap in our global system. They are among 28 million children worldwide now being denied their right to schooling in conflict zones and under broken-down regimes.Soon small, unstable Lebanon will have absorbed 500,000 Syrian boys and girls. Already in just a few months, the refugees have grown in number to an astonishing 25% of Lebanon's child population.But today, and for the foreseeable future, there are school places for only a small fraction of them - just 30,000. If they suffer the typical exile of children in conflict they could spend 10 years in camps and without schooling.The traumas engulfing Syrian children underscores an enduring global failure. One hundred years ago, through support for the Red Cross, the world decided it would meet people's basic health needs, even in theatres of war.Forty years ago Médecins Sans Frontières established that healthcare should be available across the most dangerous and violent of war zones.Today, the concept of "Education Without Borders" still remains an unfamiliar idea, a concept yet to be built into our system of humanitarian relief.Yet the cost of inaction for young people deprived of an education, destroyed by anger, restlessness, and desperation and sentenced to tents and camps often for years, will haunt us for generations.Because these millions of young unemployed will become the adult unemployable, and many will graduate not into jobs but into violence.On 23 September in New York, organisations that have for years fought valiantly to deliver education in emergencies will build on pioneering work by UNICEF, UNHCR, UN Refugees and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) to bring to life the Education Without Borders initiative for Lebanon's Syrian refugees.In New York, young people from conflict zones around the world, joined by Malala and backed up by a petition presented to the UN Secretary General, will lead an appeal for funds.It will show that while we cannot do everything we can do something, that hope can survive even amid horror and that good can yet triumph over the worst evils, even in the most troubled and desperate parts of the world."</body>

      <title>Zombie apocalypse: The future of universities?</title>
      <description>A US university is going to create an online course based on the TV drama the Walking Dead.</description>

      <body>Can zombies be the stuff of serious academic study? And could they be shuffling towards a new type of future for higher education?In what is being claimed as the biggest ever experiment in "edutainment", a US television company is forming a partnership with a top-ranking Californian university to produce online courses linked to a hit TV show.This blurring of the digital boundaries between academic study and the entertainment industry will see a course being launched next month based on the post-apocalypse drama series the Walking Dead.Television shows might have spin-off video games or merchandising, but this drama about surviving disaster and social collapse is now going to have its own university course.Academics from the University of California, Irvine, who are setting up the online courses, say these will be academically rigorous and tackle serious scientific issues, related to events in the show.A physicist will look at the "science behind decay"; the public health department will use the series to study questions such as "What can we learn from past epidemics?" and maths lecturers will show how "post-calculus maths can be used to model population and epidemic dynamics".Showbiz lessonsThe show is made by AMC, which also produced cult series such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Killing, and AMC vice-president Theresa Beyer says this showbiz-academic partnership will create a "legitimate educational experience".She says AMC will be the "first entertainment group to make the foray into the online education arena" and wants the course to "drive a deep, sustained connection with the show".The TV series has an audience of 10 million and student numbers for the online course are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands. If this experiment proves successful, the online platform provider, Instructure, suggests there could be further TV show and university hybrids.It's not difficult to imagine an advertising course being built around a series such as Mad Men, suggests Josh Coates, Instructure's chief executive.This partnership also marks another development in the rapidly-expanding world of MOOCs - the massive open online courses - an acronym sufficiently established to have made it into the Oxford online dictionary last week.Millions of students have signed up for online courses in the past year, suggesting the scale of demand for higher education.And millions of students have failed to complete those courses suggesting the scale of the challenge of online learning.Dumbing down?This eight-module course will begin in mid-October and will be accessible without charge to anyone with an internet connection.There will be online tests and discussion groups, but students taking the course will not get any formal qualifications or credits towards a degree, so it's going to be for students who want to follow the course in their own time.But isn't there a risk of dumbing down? The University of California, Irvine, has Nobel prize-winning researchers, it contributes $4.3bn (£2.77bn; 3.3bn euro) to the local economy, does it want to have zombies on its prospectus?"When we entered this partnership it was really important to make each of the modules as academically strong as they would be in our classes at UC Irvine," says Melissa Loble, associate dean of distance learning at the university."The lessons will be academically rigorous and rich and still have connections to the show."Joanne Christopherson, social science lecturer, says that it's taking another step forward from how universities already use contemporary media examples."In all of my classes I have to bring in current issues to keep it interesting. Not just because they're young adults coming out of high school, but because it's important to make these classic theories relevant to them. What we're doing is using this series as an example through the whole course."Apocalypse studiesJosh Coates, head of Instructure, which provides the Canvas online platform, says it will present science and social science issues, using the hook of a TV show."This is real curriculum about infectious diseases, public health, nutrition, psychology and sociology. The fact that the context is this fictional world of an apocalypse is incidental.""This is very topical. We have terrorist attacks, we have Katrina, Fukushima, all these things happen in our world today, which create small vignettes of a local apocalypse. This is an opportunity to educate people about the science of these disasters."Mr Coates says a significant part of this experiment will be to see if it can crack one of the biggest weaknesses of MOOCs, the high drop-out rate. Will the pulling power of television keep people switched on to learning?"Can we get more students through because it's linked to a TV show they really like?" he says.He describes the link between the university and the TV industry as the "cross-pollination" that comes with the internet."The internet tears down walls of tradition and the isolation of different areas of research and interest," he says.Personal learningFor the university, it's a shop window putting their brand in front of a global audience. It also allows them to refine the process of putting courses online."The first MOOCs had great videos and great quizzes, but didn't help students really interact with one another," says Melissa Loble."The next step for MOOCs is to figure how to make them personal without it being overwhelming for the institution trying to deliver that."These are the type of practical questions that come with the huge numbers of online students.Dr Christopherson says that scale of the demand for MOOCs has been a "wake-up call" for universities.But it remains a challenge to provide an online structure that can allow so many students to follow a course without feeling anonymous and disconnected.William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, says there also remains a longer term question about the funding model for MOOCs.And he suggests that universities which have begun to invest in them might become wary at the extent of the drop-out rate.They might work better as part of a "blended" course, where there is a taught, classroom element as well as online study, he says.Spoiler alertAlan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, also has reservations about the value of TV-related online courses.Without formal assessment and personal content, he says it remains to be seen how this delivers more than a good television documentary."The student must be able to sift the evidence."For genuine learning, personal contact really matters," he says.Prof Smithers says such links with a popular TV show might work as a way of attracting students, but the academic element needs to outweigh the entertainment.But don't expect the march of the MOOCs to stop any time soon. And Mr Coates says he wants people to look back at the Walking Dead course as a watershed when education and entertainment connected.With the online course available globally and when different series are being shown at different stages in different countries, this could also be the first university course that has to come with its own spoiler alert.</body>

      <body>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most likely place to have studied.The Times Higher Education magazine ranked the universities attended by chief executive officers of Fortune Global 500 companies.There are four US universities in the top 10, with three from France, two from Japan and one from South Korea.The highest ranked UK university is Oxford in 21st place.This league table, described as the Alma Mater Index, shows which universities around the world taught the bosses of some of the world's biggest companies.One in 20 had a degree from a single institution, Harvard.This included Margaret C Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Jeffrey R Immelt of General Electric and Vittorio Colao of Vodafone.This academic powerhouse regularly appears at the top of university league tables, including the rich list, with an endowment worth $31bn (£20bn' 23.5bn euro).But the top 10 for producing business leaders does not contain all the usual names that appear at the top of university rankings.Oxford and Cambridge are absent, but the University of Pennsylvania in the US and Keio University in Japan are included, along with three French universities, headed by the Ecole Polytechnique.It means that in this top 10 cradles of global CEOs, there are two institutions from Paris, two from the Boston area and two from Tokyo.Across the top 100, universities from the US dominate, followed by universities in China, Japan, France and Germany. There are more CEOs who went to university in Asia than in Europe.In terms of national comparisons, UK universities produced the sixth highest number of global chief executives, with Oxford in 21st place and Cambridge in 45th place.But even though Harvard might have taught the biggest number of bosses from the top 500 companies, it was not attended by any of the heads of the biggest 10 companies, who were from a more diverse range of universities.Royal Dutch Shell is headed by a graduate of Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Wal-Mart is headed by a student of Georgia Tech and Exxon Mobil has a chief executive from the University of Texas, Austin.Three of the leaders of these biggest companies went to university in China and the head of Volkswagen went to university in Stuttgart.</body>

      <title>The scientists who escaped the Nazis</title>
      <description>A first-hand memory of the scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany</description>

      <body>When Gustav Born's family were advised in early 1933 that it was time to leave Nazi-controlled Germany, it was from a good authority.The advice was from Albert Einstein, who told his friend and fellow scientist Max Born to "leave immediately" with his family while they were still able to travel.They packed their bags and headed across the border, first to Italy and then to England, where they arrived as part of what must have been the best-qualified refugee trail in history.Gustav Born was 11 at the time, living in Gottingen, Lower Saxony, where his father, Max, was director of one of the world's leading centres for physics research.The Borns were Jewish, and when Hitler took power, Max Born and his Jewish colleagues were prevented from working at the university. This pioneering, elite group of theoretical scientists were turned into asylum seekers.Gustav now lives in London, a few days short of his 92nd birthday, and he looks back with great clarity on the remarkable flight of these German academics. The conversation is like opening a 1930s Mitteleuropa time capsule.He is now one of the last living links to these academic refugees, who between them went on to win 16 Nobel prizes - his father received the award for his work in quantum mechanics.Did these scientists realise the extent of the threat from the Nazis?"Yes, I think my father probably did. Among his Jewish colleagues, some did, but some didn't believe for some time. But the scale of what the Nazis were doing became apparent in the first three to six months."Gustav remembers that the ugly mood of anti-Semitism had even reached the playground, with some children not allowed to play with him.There were also positive examples of human nature, such as the academics who stood by their Jewish colleagues. The Nobel prize winner Max von Laue showed great support, says Gustav.The physicist Max Planck went to see Hitler in person to challenge the exclusion of Jewish scientists, but Hitler "foamed at the mouth and wouldn't let him talk any more".It was still tough to leave. Max Born had to give up running an institute, his wife was heartbroken at the prospect of emigrating."They hated to be uprooted in this crude and dangerous way."When the Borns left, they were not under any illusions that this would be a temporary departure. "Nazification" was happening rapidly and there were political murders."My parents were pretty sure this was a one-way journey."While the Borns were watching the swastikas appearing in Gottingen, a much more tweedily humanitarian response was being marshalled by university staff in Britain.The economist William Beveridge had set up the Academic Assistance Council, with the aim of rescuing Jewish and politically vulnerable academics.It was an organisation that would help 1,500 academics escape Germany and continue their research work in safety in Britain.It was quickly backed by academics whose names now read like a row of text books - J B S Haldane, John Maynard Keynes, Ernest Rutherford, G M Trevelyan and the poet A E Housman.Albert Einstein supported this high-brow escape committee with a highly-charged speech in the Albert Hall in London in October 1933.He set out an epic defence of Western liberal values of "tolerance and justice" against the "temptations of hatred and oppression", at a time of deepening extremism and economic and political turmoil."It is in times of economic distress such as we experience everywhere today, one sees very clearly the strength of the moral forces that live in a people."He told his audience that it was "the liberty of the individual that has brought us every advance of knowledge and invention - liberty without which life to a self-respecting man is not worth living".The council launched its "rescue operation", arranging for academics to come to Britain and providing practical support in the form of grants, accommodation and most importantly jobs.This was a remarkably talented group being cast aside by the Nazis. As well as the trawl of Nobel prizes, there were 18 future knighthoods and over 100 fellows of the Royal Society or British Academy.According to the Association of Jewish Refugees there were about 70,000 Jewish refugees who came to Britain before the outbreak of war in 1939.Max Born and his family went first to Cambridge and then to Edinburgh University. He paid his way by writing a science text book that became a school standard.There were others who moved on to the United States. Mathematician Richard Courant went to New York where one of the foremost centres for applied maths, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is named after him.Losing such intellectual powerhouses was a self-inflicted wound for the Nazi war effort.In the race to develop atomic weapons, German refugees played a key role in making sure that it was the United States that won.Even though Max Born refused on moral grounds to work on atomic weapons research, Robert Oppenheimer, the US-born "father of the atomic bomb", had been Born's PhD student at Gottingen.There were signs at one stage that the Nazis might have realised their mistake.In 1934, Max Born and his family were visited in Cambridge by Werner Heisenberg, another Nobel prize winner and old colleague who had continued working at Gottingen.Heisenberg brought a message from the Nazi government inviting Max Born to return to continue his scientific work in Germany. The invitation left Born "beside himself with fury", his son recalls.But Max Born and his wife did eventually go back to Germany, after the war was over and after he had retired. He died there in 1970 and is buried in the same cemetery in Gottingen as Max Planck and Max von Laue.Gustav, who became a professor of pharmacology at King's College London, says that his parents were committed to trying to rebuild Germany in a way that would prevent the return of such political extremism.What lessons should be learned from all this?Gustav Born remains a strong supporter of the campaign to rescue academics, which is now marking its 80th year.It has become the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara) and its current chair, Anne Lonsdale, says that after 80 years the organisation "would love to be out of a job", but the problems in Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq and Syria mean that academics still need help in places where "civil society no longer functions".There is an "urgent need for scholars from across the Middle East to get to exile in a place of safety", she said.The stories of refugees from the Nazis, with grainy photos of faces with lines like old railway maps of Europe, might seem like something from a lost world.But Gustav Born says that Cara's ongoing work shows that it is as relevant as ever. It is also a reminder not to make hasty judgements about refugees and what they might be able to achieve.His descriptions of that academic world of the 1930s are also a last glimpse of a highly cultured society.

      <title>Education is a 'security issue', says UN</title>
      <description>Unesco chief says even though pledge for education for all will be missed, huge progress has been achieved.</description>

      <body>The tinderbox mix of high youth unemployment, lack of education and the threat of extremism is turning access to school into a "security issue", says Irina Bokova, director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation.The volatile prospect of millions of uneducated, illiterate youngsters in developing countries, under pressure from the financial downturn, has brought an unprecedented political significance to the campaign to give every child a primary school education, she says.Ms Bokova was speaking ahead of a speech later this week at the United Nations from Malala Yousafzai, who will call for all children to have the right to go to school.The Pakistani schoolgirl, who will make her speech in New York on her 16th birthday, defied the bullets of the Taliban in defence of her right to an education.But behind the optimism of Malala's campaign and the creation of an annual "Malala Day" is a much more complex global story, with failure as well as success.In 2000, in the warm glow of a new millennium, world leaders pledged that universal primary education would be achieved by 2015. No child would miss out on the basics of schooling.After an initial surge, progress stalled and achieving the target in the next 18 months now seems unlikely."By 2015, it's impossible," says Ms Bokova, the Paris-based head of Unesco.But she says that rather than being a cause of pessimism, the pursuit of the target has brought "huge progress". There were 108 million children out of school when the pledge was made; the most recent figures suggest this has fallen to 57 million."If the right strategies are in place, and you put your head where your heart is, then things can be improved. In Afghanistan in 2000 only 4% of girls were in school, now there are more than 70%."Ms Bokova says that another positive outcome has been a much stronger recognition of the importance of measuring the quality of education, rather than simply counting heads going into a classroom.Among the more sobering discoveries has been that many pupils have spent years in school but remained functionally illiterate.So in the autumn, Unesco is planning to produce a new set of global metrics to measure what's actually being learned in primary classrooms around the world. "It will give a global understanding of what quality education means," says Ms Bokova.It remains unclear whether there will be more targets after 2015, but anything that emerges will be more about quality of education, rather than simply volume of places.Ms Bokova says the financial crisis delivered a major blow to achieving the goal of universal primary education. Donor countries pulled the plug and left an "alarming gap" in funding.In sub-Saharan Africa there remains a shortage of 1.7 million teachers.But despite this gloom, she says that the financial crisis has given education a "paradoxical" political importance.Youth unemployment is a major threat in many countries and education and training are seen as vital investments."Education is now becoming in some cases a security issue," she says, with examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq and across the Middle East, where there is huge pressure to provide education to promote stability and democracy and to avoid extremism."The same is true of big emerging powers. In Brazil, the government recognises that the education system is one of the biggest challenges as it moves forward to a competitive economy and an inclusive society."The social tensions of deepening inequality and a lack of social mobility are also shaped by decisions about education systems, she says.Economic and political stability are now inextricably linked to improving education, says the Bulgarian-born Unesco director general."Education is becoming the key issue now in discussions about overcoming the economic crisis."But how are we going to make this happen? Budgets and international aid are shrinking."We try to convince countries that if they want to invest in coming out of the crisis, then invest in education."Another barrier to getting all children to school is a lack of fair access, particularly for girls.Ms Bokova says it's not acceptable for countries to hide behind ideas of "cultural differences" or "tradition" as a reason for discriminating against girls.Malala Yousafzai has become a powerful emblem."One event can spark a huge reaction and understanding and I think it was the case with Malala," she says."It was a stunning example of courage and a desire to learn."And she says that getting more girls into school is the single most important goal."It's not just a human right, it's what is needed to have normal societies. If a girl goes to school, she is less likely to have an early marriage, she will have healthier children, she'll find it easier to earn an income, she's less likely to be subjected to violence, less likely to have an early pregnancy."There are so many advantages, healthier communities, less violence, more economic growth. It has such an incredible multiplying effect."This is the best thing that could happen to humanity."The pledge for education for all has also highlighted where the problem is most acute.A meeting organised by the UN in April brought together eight countries - Bangladesh, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen - which between them have about half the children in the world who are missing out on school.It was an unprecedented attempt to systematically work out what has been going wrong.A minister from the DR Congo said that about 60% of those missing out on school did so because of the cost of school fees with the other 40% blamed on armed conflict.In Ethiopia the problem was identified as being focused on rural communities and lack of access for girls. In South Sudan it was a lack of trained teachers and a low level of school participation among girls.In Nigeria, which has the most children out of school, the difficulty was not necessarily about money, but was caused by low participation among girls in some areas and problems with "infrastructure" about providing teachers. Weaknesses in state authorities delivering the plans of the national government were also blamed.The country has also seen brutal attacks on schools. Secondary schools in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe were ordered to close this week after a massacre in which suspected Islamist extremists killed 22 students.Ms Bokova says that there is now a willingness among such countries to recognise what needs to be changed.Despite the failure to make the 2015 deadline, she says the attempt has shown the international community what can be achieved. Countries such as India and Ethiopia have taken substantial steps forward.This has disproved the feeling that "education is too complex, too costly and it takes too long to show results".But there is no escaping the harsh truth that millions of children, born a decade after the world promised universal primary education, still won't have even the most basic access to school.It's been possible to launch hundreds of satellites and put a spacecraft on Mars, but not to put children into classrooms a few hours south of Heathrow."In many cases we have failed, but it shouldn't discourage us. We're winning the argument."</body>

      <body>Slang such as "ain't", "innit" and "coz" has been banned from a school in south London to try to help students find future employment.Harris Academy Upper Norwood said it implemented the initiative to allow its students to "express themselves confidently and appropriately".Pupils heard using "informal language" will be asked to "reflect" on it.Other banned words include "like", "bare" and "extra" and the phrases "you woz" and "we woz".Starting sentences with "basically" and ending them with "yeah" is also considered to be too informal at the Croydon school.In a statement, the school said: "In addition to giving students the teaching they need to thrive academically, we want them to develop the soft skills they will need to compete for jobs and university places."This particular initiative is just one of the many ways in which we are building the vocabulary of our students and giving them the skills they need to express themselves confidently and appropriately for a variety of audiences."Terry Victor, editor of the New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English said: "It's wrong."You cannot censor a young person's language, they're not talking about words that are offensive, they're talking about some of the words that politicians use."[The word] 'ain't' was around in the 19th Century, people like Dickens used it... and how many politicians have you heard say "basically" to begin a sentence?"Yes, it's irritating but it's part of deliberate language."Harris Academy Upper Norwood opened last month, replacing a secondary school that was in special measures.</body>

      <description>Beloved children's show the Clangers is to make a return to television, with a new series in production for CBeebies in 2015.</description>

      <body>Beloved children's show, the Clangers is being resurrected, with a new series in production for CBeebies in 2015.Debuting in 1969, the show told the tale of a race of knitted aliens eking out a threadbare existence on a cold blue planet, not far from Earth.The pink, mouse-like creatures lived in craters covered by dustbin lids - whose noisy "clang" gave the show its name.Co-creator Peter Firmin said the new series would involve "great storytelling with lots of heart".The puppet-maker, whose other credits include Ivor The Engine and Bagpuss, promised the new series would be markedly different from the crude, jerky animation of the original."When you watch the original Clangers you have to make allowances for the limitations of the animation techniques when it was made," he said in a statement."It was magical for its time, but this is a new Clangers for a new age!"Firmin dreamt up the Clangers with puppeteer and writer Oliver Postgate, who also narrated the series.It was first shown on BBC1 in November 1969, just four months after Nasa's moon landing, and one episode even showed the Clangers making inventive use of a flag left behind by some astronauts.The characters even appeared in Doctor Who - watched by the Doctor's arch-nemesis The Master in the 1972 story, The Sea Devils.Although the creatures communicated in a spooky, swooping whistle, Postgate later revealed that their "dialogue" was written out in full, in English, and often included swear words.On receiving the scripts, the BBC objected, telling him, "Darling, you can't say that on children's television," he told Clive Banks' science fiction website."I said, 'It's not going to be said, it's going to be whistled,' but [the BBC] just said, 'But people will know!'"Eventually, Postgate won - and the Clangers apparently swear like troopers, for those who can translate.Postgate's son Daniel is writing the scripts for the show's 21st Century incarnation, which he described as a "labour of love"."I've always loved Clangers," he said. "I was about five years old when it was made - just the right age."The new Clangers is not something we've rushed into. It has been carefully considered."CBeebies controller Kay Benbow added: "Nostalgia is a funny thing, and we always think very carefully about remakes or re-imaginings of classic children's programmes."The Clangers is a programme that has an enduring magic. The new proposition has been built firmly upon the joyful foundations of the original, and will be produced by a team of exceptional talent which includes the extraordinary Peter Firmin."The £5m production is already under way, and is being co-produced by US pre-school TV channel Sprout, which will broadcast the programme in North America.</body>

      <body>There are fears some children with suspected autism are missing out on a specialist education because waiting times for diagnosis are increasing.In the Hywel Dda local health board area, 311 children have been diagnosed but a further 340 are still waiting to be assessed.Appropriate education provision is difficult without a correct diagnosis.In 2012, BBC Wales found some children were waiting longer than seven years for a diagnosis.According to figures obtained by BBC Wales Today almost 4,000 children in Wales have been diagnosed with autism - two thirds of those children are in mainstream education.But the programme, which will be broadcast on Friday at 18:30 BST on BBC One Wales, spoke to the National Autistic Society which said more than half of of those with autism had waited more than two years to be diagnosed.Nine-year-old Tom Fairburn, from Pembrokeshire, has a chromosome condition called 47 XYY syndrome, which means he has an extra Y chromosome. As a result Tom has learning difficulties.But when Tom was seven his mother, Samantha, suspected he had Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Nearly three years later, Tom is still waiting for a diagnosis.His mother said Tom's story was typical for the area."I think everybody is in the same position, I think everybody just wants their children to be seen," said Ms Fairburn.She called for better training and facilities in schools as well as better support from the education and health authorities."When he was in junior school I raised my concerns that there was no way he was going to cope in mainstream and then when they did open a unit it was basically just a classroom which they called a unit," Ms Fairburn said."They didn't have the facilities for children with special needs - no sensory room, no quiet areas and the space was quite small. Children with autism like space."Ms Fairburn called for teachers to receive more training on how to manage children with autism."I know autistic children are different but a lot of their ways are the same and I think a lot more training should be given - and to teachers in these units," she said."In his school I felt that they thought he was naughty and, to be honest, I think that they couldn't cope with him and they didn't want him in the school... I think Tom felt like that as well."Meleri Thomas, from the National Autistic Society Cymru, said more needed to be done to help children like Tom."It is quite worrying local authorities don't know exactly how many children are waiting for a diagnosis because if they don't know that then they can't know how to plan for provision and what kind of provision is needed," she said."The more forward planning they can do the better it would be in the longer term and for the children in their local authority areas."A spokesman from Pembrokeshire council said: "There has been considerable development of specialist provision in response to a substantial increase in need."We currently have specialist provision for 60 children which is more than in most authorities."We are working closely with parents of children with ASD to ensure that we develop both specialist provision and improve this capacity of mainstream schools to meet the needs of all children with ASD."A spokeswoman for Hywel Dda said it expects to take on more staff in January to cut waiting times."The health board is committed to reducing the waiting times for ASD diagnosis across the Hywel Dda area, focusing initially on Pembrokeshire and will be employing more staff to achieve this," she said."The health board is also working with the Welsh government on the refresh of the all Wales ASD strategy to ensure in future that the significant issues facing the service currently are addressed in a sustainable manner."More on this story will be broadcast on BBC Wales Today at 18:30 BST on Friday.</body>

      <description>Evangelical Christian groups intent on converting pupils are being allowed into state schools claims a report.</description>

      <body>Evangelical Christian groups intent on converting pupils are being allowed into state schools claims a report.The National Secular Society (NSS) says some groups are holding assemblies and bible clubs in schools in England.The NSS has written to the Education Secretary Michael Gove calling for national guidance on external visitors, particularly from religious groups.The government said it had not seen any evidence to support the claims and had not received any complaints.The report says there has been "a marked increase in the number of parents contacting the National Secular Society with concerns about external visitors to schools exposing their children to unwelcome and wholly inappropriate religious evangelism and proselytisation".It added: "We have investigated this and found an abundance of material showing that the parents' concerns were not isolated instances."The report says that in many cases, evangelical Christian organisations offer to provide religious education and school worship.It claims that the legal obligation on schools to provide religious education and a daily act of worship has provided "a foot in the door" to some organisations with evangelistic intentions.The report suggests that shortfalls in religious education provision, recently highlighted in a report from Ofsted, are leading head teachers to accept help from external religious groups and adds that some heads are "insufficiently discerning about the external groups they are allowing into their schools".The letter also asks the Department for Education to ensure that guidance to schools on visits from religious groups "makes clear that schools must not offer opportunities to groups seeking to evangelise".The NSS says its investigation was prompted after it was contacted by parents, some of whom had themselves written to the schools and to the Department for Education about their concerns.One parent said he had become aware "quite by chance" of regular visits by an evangelical group to his child's non-religious primary school in Sheffield.He complains that the group "adheres to a profoundly conservative and avowedly missionary agenda".Another complained that his child had been told the creation story from Genesis was "factual" during visits to a primary school in the West Midlands from a local minister.Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: "Religious education must be clearly delineated as such."A line is crossed when religious positions such as creationism are taught as scientific theories for example. Neither are schools places for proselytisation without the explicit and informed consent of parents."A spokeswoman for the DfE said if parents had concerns about visitors to their child's school they should make a formal complaint to the school."State schools cannot teach creationism as scientific fact," added the spokeswoman."They must offer a broad and balanced curriculum and meet their obligations under equalities legislation. Schools have a responsibility under law to ensure children are insulated from political activity and campaigning."Schools are required to safeguard the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils."Ofsted inspections include a focus on this to enable them to identify any inappropriate practice."Paul Bate of the Association of Christian Teachers and a former head of a faith school said: "Some schools, including faith schools, have a clear statement in their articles prohibiting staff from proselytising within the school."Indeed, the faith school where I was head had such a statement within their articles and the RE curriculum was based around the teaching of philosophy, ethics, and giving the students an understanding of all faiths - which included secularism."</body>

      <description>Tens of thousands of teenagers in England do not have at least a GCSE C-grade in English and maths by the time they are 18, new figures suggest.</description>

      <body>Tens of thousands of teenagers in England do not have at least a C-grade at GCSE in English and maths by the time they are 18, new figures suggest.And most who do not get a good grade in these key subjects by 16 then drop them.The figures are revealed in new government statistics.From now on, all teenagers will have to continue studying maths and English if they do not get at least a C-grade.The statistics, which have been published for the first time and are described as "experimental" by government officials, show that in 2009-10, about one in three young people (220,000) had not gained a grade A* to C in English by the age of 16.Of these, about 34,000 (15%), went on to re-take the GCSE after 16. About half of those then got at least a C.The figures are similar for maths.Schools minister David Laws said: "English and maths are what employers demand before all other subjects - if young people want to get on in life, they must be able to show they have good literacy and numeracy."These figures expose the vast number of young people allowed to give up these subjects after so nearly achieving the level employers demand."With just a bit more teaching, these students could have achieved the grades that would make all the difference to their job prospects."The figures come days after a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said literacy and numeracy rates of England's 16- to 24-year-olds were among the lowest in the developed world.Among 16-year-olds in England, only six in 10 achieve the government's minimum target of five good GCSEs including English and maths.Under changes introduced last month, teenagers now have to stay in some form of education or training until they are 17, although this may be work-based.This is due to rise to 18 in 2015.Ministers say they are writing to 12 local councils who are not tracking whether 16- to 18-year-olds are in education or training.New figures show that nationally, 88% of 16- and 17-year-olds were in education or training in June, up 1% on 2012.But the government said there were differences between areas and some councils were poor at tracking what many teenagers of this age group were doing.</body>

      <title>Inspectors attack prison education</title>
      <description>Ofsted inspectors have strongly criticised the standards of education and training in England's prisons.</description>

      <body>Ofsted inspectors have strongly criticised standards of education and training in England's prisons.The watchdog says it is unacceptable that not one prison has been rated "outstanding" for education in the past four years and only one in three is rated "good".At Wormwood Scrubs jail in London, Ofsted chiefs said if the figures related to schools there would be a "national outcry".Ministers say reforms are under way.In a speech at the prison, Matthew Coffey, national director of further education and skills at Ofsted, said the aim of training and education in jail should be to make people less likely to go back to crime when they got out."This year's annual lecture aims to focus on how we can reduce the high re-offending rates that are nearly 50% for adult prisoners and 72% for juveniles," he said."The aim is to reduce the number of re-offenders by focusing on rehabilitation in prisons through better employer engagement and better teaching and training."Levels of education among prisoners are generally much lower than in the population as a whole.Some studies suggest half of men in UK jails and nearly three-quarters of female prisoners have no qualifications at all, while about half have literacy skills below that of most eleven-year-olds. Many have been expelled from school.Mr Coffey said: "Far too many prisoners leave prison without employability skills, meaning they are less likely to find a job. Research shows that being in employment is one of the key factors that can reduce the risk of re-offending by between 30% and 50%. However, examples of good training provision in prisons were all too scarce."Clearly, reducing the number of those re-offending is in everyone's interests. Every prisoner costs the taxpayer the same as sending a child to Eton, around £34,000 per year. We must now focus on improvement of prisoners' vocational and employability skills to ensure we support them on their journey out of prison and into employment to break the cycle of re-offending."He added that there were "outstanding examples" of prisons working with employers, education providers and other bodies to help prisoners develop vocational skills, but that those examples, were "all too scarce".Education in prisons in England and Wales is provided by private bodies which bid for contracts.Prisons Minister Jeremy Wright said: "Re-offending rates have been too high for too long and we are introducing significant reforms to the way offenders are rehabilitated and managed in the community."We are committed to improving education in prison and are working with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Skills Funding Agency to develop prisoner learning."In most countries in the European Union, only about one in four adult prisoners takes part in education, according to a report for the EU published earlier this year, out of 640,000 inmates.In England and Wales, the proportion is higher, with an estimated 42% receiving some kind of prison education, which has to be provided by law.The EU report said prisons were all too often "environments for negative learning" when they could be offering people a second chance.According to the University and College Union, which represents many prison teachers and trainers, the "constant re-tendering" for education contracts brings problems, including a high turnover of staff and instability.They say because providers are paid by results, some teachers feel under pressure to limit courses to certain offenders and those in for longer terms.</body>

      <title>Toddler brain scan language insight</title>
      <description>The brain has a critical window for language development between the ages of two and four, brain scans suggest.</description>

      <body>The brain has a critical window for language development between the ages of two and four, brain scans suggest.Environmental influences have their biggest impact before the age of four, as the brain's wiring develops to process new words, say UK and US scientists.The research in The Journal of Neuroscience suggests disorders causing language delay should be tackled early.It also explains why young children are good at learning two languages.The scientists, based at King's College London, and Brown University, Rhode Island, studied 108 children with normal brain development between the ages of one and six.They used brain scans to look at myelin - the insulation that develops from birth within the circuitry of the brain.To their surprise, they found the distribution of myelin is fixed from the age of four, suggesting the brain is most plastic in very early life.Any environmental influences on brain development will be strongest in infanthood, they predict.This explains why immersing children in a bilingual environment before the age of four gives them the best chance of becoming fluent in both languages, the research suggests.It also suggests that there is a critical time during development when environmental influence on cognitive skills may be greatest.Dr Jonathan O'Muircheartaigh, from King's College London, led the study.He told the BBC: "Since our work seems to indicate that brain circuits associated with language are more flexible before the age of four, early intervention for children with delayed language attainment should be initiated before this critical age."This may be relevant to many developmental disorders, such as autism, since delayed language is a common early trait."Early childhood is a time when language skills develop very rapidly.Babies have a vocabulary of up to 50 words at 12 months but by the age of six this has expanded to about 5,000 words.Language skills are localised in the frontal areas of the left-hand side of the brain.The researchers therefore expected more myelin to develop in the left-hand side of the brain, as the children learned more language.In fact, they found it remained constant, but had a stronger influence on language ability before the age of four, suggesting there is a crucial window for interventions in developmental disorders."This work is important as it is the first to investigate the relationship between brain structure and language across early childhood and demonstrate how this relationship changes with age," said Dr Sean Deoni from Brown University, a co-researcher on the study."This is important since language is commonly altered or delayed in many developmental disorders, such as autism."Commenting on the study, Prof Dorothy Bishop of the department of Developmental Neuropsychology at the University of Oxford said the research added important new information about early development of connections in brain regions important for cognitive functions."There is suggestive evidence of links with language development but it is too early to be confident about functional implications of the findings," she said."Ideally we would need a longitudinal study following children over time to track how structural brain changes relate to language function."The study was funded by the National Institutes for Mental Health (US) and the Wellcome Trust (UK).</body>

      <body>The mother of Baby Peter, Tracey Connelly, should be released from jail, the Parole Board has said.She was jailed indefinitely, with a recommended minimum term of five years, in May 2009, for causing or allowing her son's death in north London.A Parole Board panel recommended her release from prison following a second review of her case.The board said arrangements and the date of the release were a matter for Justice Secretary Chris Grayling.A spokesman for Mr Grayling said the Parole Board's decision was final.A statement from the board said: "We can confirm that a three-member panel of the board has directed the release of Tracey Connelly."Tracey Connelly first became eligible for parole in August 2012 and at that time a Parole Board panel made no recommendation to release."Peter died on 3 August 2007 at home in Haringey after months of abuse.He had more than 50 injuries, despite being on the at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers, police and health professionals over eight months.Connelly was jailed with her boyfriend Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen, who were convicted at trial of the same offence.Barker was jailed for life with a minimum of 10 years for raping a two-year-old girl and given a 12-year term to run concurrently for his "major role" in Peter's death.Owen was jailed indefinitely with a minimum three-year term but later won an appeal to lower it to a fixed six-year term.He was freed in August 2011 but was then recalled to prison in April this year.When making its decision, the Parole Board will take into account the nature of the offence, the prisoner's offending history, the prisoner's progress in prison and any statements made on behalf of the victim.Reports from psychologists, probation officers and prison officers are also taken into account.Connelly will remain on licence for the rest of her life and if she breaches any of the conditions, she would most likely be recalled to custody.Conditions can include curfews, restrictions on movements and frequent meetings with an offender manager, said a Ministry of Justice spokesman.</body>

      <description>Stagnating social mobility warning - are the young paying the price?</description>

      <body>Alan Milburn says he was asked by the coalition to "hold its feet to the fire" in examining its progress on social mobility and child poverty.But just how much will his words hurt?In this, the first of what is planned to be an annual "State of the Nation report", the commission led by the former Labour health secretary concludes that "Britain remains a deeply divided country", one where "being born poor often leads to a lifetime of poverty".The commission says austerity has made it even harder to break ingrained cycles of poverty, that "disadvantage and advantage cascade down the generations".It warns there is a danger that social mobility will go in to reverse after rising in the middle of the last century and "flatlining" towards the end of it.The post-war years saw a big expansion of the middle classes, as the professional jobs market grew and more people bought their own homes, but there has been little change in the last quarter of the century.Mr Milburn said over decades, the UK had become a wealthier society, but had "struggled to become a fairer one" and had more children living in poverty and lower levels of social mobility than "many other developed nations".A total of 2.3 million children (one in six) live in poverty, he said, and this made it essential that the pattern where "birth not worth" determined a person's chances in life was changed.Higher social mobility had become "the new holy grail of public policy". It is certainly something all parties now say they want to see.The report from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission has stinging words on some areas of government policy but they are sweetened with praise for others, including the fact that the coalition continues to "stick to its commitments" on ending child poverty and improving social mobility in "challenging times".Mr Milburn told journalists at a news conference the government "deserved credit" for that.But the target of ending child poverty by 2020 - begun under Labour and continued by the coalition government - would "in all likelihood" be missed, he said.His most stinging criticism seemed to be about the way the young were likely to pay the highest price for a lack of social mobility and poverty during the global financial crisis.He called for older generations to be asked to dig deeper.The number of young people who have been unemployed for two years or more is at a "20-year high", he said.And there was an "inter-generational unfairness" in terms of who was being asked to pick up the bill in the recession.He did not call for pension cuts, but Mr Milburn said politicians should be prepared to "break political taboos" to talk about whether wealthier pensioners should lose benefits currently available to all - particularly the winter fuel allowance and the free TV licence.Pensioners were usually more worried about their grandchildren than themselves, he said.The commission is also looking to employers to do more - to offer better training, pay higher wages and open up professions to a wider pool of people. Two-thirds of children living in poverty, the report says, are living in homes with a working parent.Schools and universities were also urged to do more.He said schools in some areas were letting down pupils from poorer homes and those from middle-income homes too.Schools should give more help to low-achievers from middle-income homes as well as the poorest, while the government should improve careers advice, give extra incentives for teachers to teach in the worst schools and pay colleges "by results they achieve for their students in the labour market - not the numbers they recruit".As for universities - which were the focus of an earlier report by the commission - he says the sector as a whole has drawn in more students from poorer homes but top institutions remain out of reach for too many.Each year, he said, there were 3,700 "missing" state school pupils who had achieved the grades needed to get in to universities in the Russell Group (which represents some of the UK's leading universities) but did not go to them.The commission called for the government to put social mobility at the heart of its policies and practices, so that it was a "golden thread" running through all it did. It concentrated on the overall UK picture, but pointed out that in Scotland and Wales, the issue "currently has a low profile".In an age of austerity, the report's authors suggest creating a fairer society will be a job for all - and far from pain-free.</body>

      <description>Asia's 'tiger parents' paying a high price for children's future</description>

      <body>Zhang Yang, a bright 18-year old from a rural town in Anhui province in China was accepted to study at a prestigious traditional medicine college in Hefei. But the news was too much for his father Zhang Jiasheng.Zhang's father was partly paralysed after he suffered a stroke two years ago and could no longer work. He feared the family, already in debt to pay for medicines, would not be able to afford his son's tuition fees.As his son headed home to celebrate his success, Zhang Jiasheng killed himself by swallowing pesticide.Zhang's case is an extreme. But East Asian families are spending more and more of their money on securing their children the best possible education.In richer Asian countries such as South Korea and emerging countries like China, "education fever" is forcing families to make choices, sometimes dramatic ones, to afford the bills.There are families selling their apartments to raise the funds to send their children to study overseas.Andrew Kipnis, an anthropologist at Australian National University and author of a recent book on the intense desire for education in China, says the amount spent on education is "becoming extreme".It is not just middle-class families. Workers also want their children to do better than themselves and see education as the only means of ensuring social mobility. Some go deep into debt."Families are spending less on other things. There are many cases of rural parents not buying healthcare that their doctors urge on them... Part of the reason is that they would rather spend the money on their children's education," said Mr Kipnis."Parents may be forced to put off building a new house, which they might have been able to do otherwise," said Mr Kipnis who did the bulk of his research in Zouping district in Shandong province, among both middle-class and rural households."It can be very intense. They often borrow from relatives. Of course some people have difficulty paying it back," said Mr Kipnis.A Euromonitor survey found that per capita annual disposable income in China rose by 63.3% in the five years to 2012, yet consumer expenditure on education rose by almost 94%.It's not just the parents' incomes. Educating a child has become an extended-family project. "It goes beyond tiger mothers, it also includes tiger grandmothers and grandfathers," said Todd Maurer, an expert on education in Asia and partner at the consultancy firm, Sinica Advisors.There is evidence of high levels of education spending in China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Spending is also increasing in India and Indonesia.In South Korea, where the government believes "education obsession" is damaging society, family expenditure on education has helped push household debt to record levels.According to the LG Economic Research Institute, 28% of South Korean households cannot afford monthly loan repayments, and are hard pressed to live off their incomes.A huge proportion of that income - 70% of Korean household expenditure, according to estimates by the Samsung Economic Research Institute in Seoul, goes toward private education, to get an educational edge over other families.Families cut back on other household spending "across the board," said Michael Seth, professor of Korean history at James Madison University in the US and author of a book on South Korea's education zeal. "There is less money to spend on other things like housing, retirement, or vacations.""Every developing country in Asia, specially China, seems to have a similar pattern," said Prof Seth.A highly competitive examination system and rising aspirations are often blamed."The Korean education system puts enormous pressure on children," said Prof Seth." The only way to opt out of the system is not to have children. It is so expensive to educate a child that it is undoubtedly a factor in South Korea's very low birth rate," he said.The education obsession is so all consuming that the South Korean government has unsuccessfully tried to curb it, concerned about family spending on extra-curricular lessons and cram schools for ferociously competitive exams.While not yet at South Korean levels, China's education fever also puts pressure on family spending. A recent survey by market research company Mintel, found that nine out of 10 children from middle class families in China attended fee-charging after-school activities.Parents believe these activities will help their children when it comes to university entry.Children are being tutored for longer, starting younger. Where before it was for a year or two before the university entrance exam, now it can start in middle school or even primary.Matthew Crabbe, Asia research director at Mintel, says that people in China are using the savings that might have been put aside for healthcare."But because the cost of education has risen and the competition for places at good universities have become so much more intense, they are investing more of their savings to make sure the child can get the grades they would need to get in."It does not stop there. Nearly 87% of Chinese parents said they were willing to fund study abroad.In the past an overseas education was confined to the most privileged. Now many more want foreign degrees to give them a shortcut to success.According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a third of Chinese students studying abroad in 2010 were from working-class families.This is a massive financial burden and parents may not realise the true costs.According to Zhang Jianbai who runs a private school in Yunnan province, parents in small provincial cities often sell their apartments to fund their children's study overseas."Parents decide very early on that their children are going to go abroad and that requires quite a bit of money because [the preparation] cannot be acquired through the public education system," said Mr Maurer.It can include intensive English lessons, study tours to the US and significant payments for student recruitment agents.Last year an estimated 40,000 Chinese students travelled to Hong Kong to take the US college admissions exam, the Scholastic Assessment Test (SATS), which is not offered in mainland China.Chinese education company, New Oriental Education, organises SAT trips to Hong Kong for $1,000 (£627) on average, and parents spend up to $8,000 (£5,020) on tutoring.Once confined to affluent Beijing and Shanghai, it is an expanding market. The company expects its revenue to grow by over 40% in China's second and third tier cities."Parents are surrendering their last resources to wager them on a child's future by sending them abroad," said Lao Kaisheng, an education policy researcher at Capital Normal University in Beijing.It means that when young people graduate there is great pressure on them to start earning.This is particularly an issue as record numbers of students graduate, seven million this year, and an overseas degree no longer has the status it had in the past. Many graduates languish in non-graduate jobs.But it is not easy to dampen education fever. In South Korea as in other East Asian countries, "it is deeply embedded in the culture. It's also based on reality that there is no alternative pathway to success or a good career other than a prestige degree, this was true 50 years ago, and it's just as true today"."As long as that's the case it's actually rational for parents to spend so much and put so much pressure on their children," said Prof Seth.</body>

      <body>A school in Bath is reported to have banned pupils from handing out birthday party invitations at school unless the entire class is on the guest list. Father-of-three Ben Milne explores the social minefield of children's parties.It's one of the big questions for parents of small children. Do you invite the whole class to little Harry or Sophie's party, or do you face the fall-out?What the head teacher of Kingswood Prep School in Bath has proposed isn't that revolutionary. At my children's primary school, for instance, the policy is for the child to give their teacher the invitations, which will then be placed discreetly in the invitees' school bags or trays. Nobody feels snubbed, and everybody's happy. What could possibly go wrong with this plan?Oh yes. Children.There you are, waiting for the hordes to arrive, furniture all re-arranged, and party food out on the table. Then your little darling realises they've got a school bag full of invites they've forgotten to give to the teacher. This actually happened to my nephew on his 10th birthday. He was remarkably sanguine about this (the unexpected windfall of unlimited Wotsits seemed to soften the blow somewhat).And if you do invite the whole class, what then? Do you really want your living room used to re-enact Battle Royale with party bags? Or if you want to keep the repair bill down, do you throw large sums of money at the local multiplex or five-a-side pitch?So it's time to whittle down the list. There's the Katie Hopkins method (exclude any child who doesn't share a name with a minor royal) or else there's a process of intense negotiation down from the 200 closest friends your child announces they want to invite, down to the manageable four you had in mind.But is it so bad not being invited to parties? Like a lot of not-very-nice, but survivable things in childhood - not being picked for the team, being blamed for something you didn't do - a snub isn't nice, but it's a small but valuable lesson for the hardships life one day throws at you.As Nietzsche (or was it Kelly Clarkson?) said, "What doesn't kill us, makes us stronger." I don't think he had kids' parties in mind, though.Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <description>How ex-prisoner Frank went from drug smuggling to a 'stable life'</description>

      <body>As Ofsted inspectors deliver a critical verdict of the education prisoners receive in England's jails, one ex-inmate describes how he finally learnt a vital lesson.Expelled from school at 12, Frank Harris says it was the thought of how he would be remembered by his own children that helped him see education as a way to change his life.The 53-year-old Londoner says he was in and out of prisons for more than 30 years before he found his "way out" through education and wants other people involved in crime to see it is not too late for them either."I wasn't getting any younger. I was thinking, 'What will my four kids do if I dropped down [dead]?'"If they said I was in and out of prison - that I wasted my time on earth. Now they can say I made mistakes, but I tried to do something different. That pushes me on."I'm still enjoying my education and still have something to give back."Frank is in the second year of a degree in criminology and criminal justice. He counsels and mentors others who have been involved in crime and has worked with the police on tackling gang culture.But in 2004 he was facing his longest prison stretch ever - four years for smuggling cocaine from Amsterdam - after what he says was a "lifetime of crime"."I knew I'd be coming out, that I needed to do something, to make a change instead of hanging around with people," he said."I found I enjoyed learning. I had been interested before in lots of things but never had the kind of environment for it to be cool to learn."In prison, he did basic skills lessons before getting A-grades in GCSE English and maths."People saying well done, that inspired me to say I enjoyed doing this education and it was positive. I saw I could change my life, learning and achieving things. I saw education as a way out and that it could be the key to set me free."After leaving jail, Frank says he was very tempted to go back to his old way of life but instead decided to stay in touch with a charity that had supported him inside - the Prisoners' Education Trust - and the St Giles Trust."Normally, I was getting picked up by one of my friends [when I got out of jail], and before I got back to London, I would be stoned and wouldn't get home for two days."The crucial thing this time was there was link. This group had offices you can get in touch with when you get out."Frank says he was on the verge of getting involved with crime again when, he says: "Something told me, 'Don't take the left path, take a right,' and instead, I went down to the offices."He went on take a qualification in counselling to help homeless and vulnerable people and to work for the charity Turning Point.He now counsels others, he says, "to try to stop them taking my path".Like many people in Britain's jails, Frank did badly at school. He had no academic qualifications before studying in prison in his 40s.Expelled at 12, he says he was "delinquent" for 18 months, before being sent to a reform "boarding school", where he says there was no proper teaching."The classroom was a work room and the teachers - who were really PE teachers - used to say, 'Finish that English off, then you can finish making your chair.'"Boys would be banging about while others were doing written work."Frank says things then went further downhill."I'd come home every two weeks - my family would not know me, I had no friends. I'd go around by myself and began breaking in to cars, doing rubbish stuff because I was lonely, bored."Shortly after that, Frank says, he began to get custodial sentences for theft and fraud and "that was it for 30 years".He says he was never involved with violent or sexual crimes, but witnessed violence."People were getting shot in a car next to me; people getting stabbed, but I never picked up a knife in anger. I was smoking crack but I always felt I was on the outside looking in; like I was not meant to be there."Now I know that reason was to say to young men and women, 'You don't have to go that way - it's such a waste.' I'm here to tell that story."If you find yourself on the that road, if you are in prison, there's a way out and it's education."Now I'm a proper father, a proper son, a proper grandfather. I'm stable and I have a family that's stable."</body>

      <description>Bribery and corruption in the classroom</description>

      <body>Corruption in education is a serious blight that undermines the quality and availability of schools and universities around the world, according to an international report.Anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International have published a global survey showing that about one in six students has had to pay a bribe for education services.In parts of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia this might be requiring parents to pay a fee for a school place that should be free.In Eastern Europe, it might be paying to gain an advantage in university admissions.The Berlin-based campaign group is best known for its annual "global corruption barometer", which measures levels of dishonest payments in more than 100 countries, based on more than 114,000 household interviews.This year's survey also asked questions about people's first-hand experiences and perceptions of dishonesty in education.In some countries these perceptions are distinctively negative. The report says that almost three-quarters of people in Cameroon and Russia see their education systems as "corrupt or highly corrupt".The findings show a huge range of malpractice.In Pakistan, there are warnings of thousands of "shadow schools" without any real students, but drawing public funding to pay for "ghost teachers"."Leakages" in the funding of schools in Kenya had the equivalent value of losing more than 11 million text books, says the report. A study of 180 schools in Tanzania showed that more than a third of intended funds had failed to reach the school.In Greece there are warnings about nepotism in jobs and promotions in higher education.In Vietnam there is a problem with bribery for places in the most sought-after schools.The report quotes figures from the United Nations showing 110 countries where fees are levied, despite in theory having free education enshrined in law. The report describes "myriad pretexts" to impose charges on parents.So why should education be so vulnerable to corruption?Parents want the best for their children, says the report, and they can be exploited by unscrupulous officials controlling access to places.It also involves a great deal of public money filtering down from central government to local school authorities. In Nigeria, the report says, $21m (£13m) intended for schools was lost in two years.But it's not only a problem for the developing world or those providing the basics of schooling.The massive expansion in demand for university education has created rich opportunities for illicit charges.Students need degree-level qualifications more than ever and are under great pressure to get university places and to leave with good grades, opening up fertile territory for corruption and cheating.Eastern European and former Soviet states are highlighted as having had particular difficulties.In Georgia, there have been reforms to stop corruption in university admissions. This hadn't simply been "cash-filled envelopes", but included a complex system of having to buy tutoring, Transparency International found.There could also be more practical types of illicit charges, with suggestions that in Romania access to university accommodation depended on bribery.The demand for qualifications has also generated its own industry in fake universities.In the United States, the report estimates, there are about a thousand "degree mills" in operation, selling bogus qualifications.This isn't only harmless self-delusion, says the report, as these bought qualifications are used to gain graduate jobs, including in one case working in a nuclear power plant.It also highlights the case of Colby Nolan, a student who ostensibly gained an MBA degree in 2004, until his owner revealed that the graduate was a six-year-old cat. He had gained the equivalent of an upper second class degree.The growth of higher education as a globalised, multi-billion dollar business has also spawned a parallel opportunity for fraud, says Philip Altbach, director of the Center for International Higher Education in the Lynch School of Education at Boston College.He has described the "spectre of corruption haunting" the move towards a more internationalised higher education system.And he has called for more co-ordinated international efforts to set standards and share information.The Transparency International study says that corruption has a corrosive effect on education, raising the cost and lowering the quality."Many people wouldn't realise the extent of corruption in education, right through from the financing of education through to academic corruption," says report editor, Gareth Sweeney."In some countries it's such a serious problem that it could undermine the credibility of their education systems."There is some good news as the report highlights efforts to tackle bribery.In Chile, anti-corruption lessons have been introduced to the school curriculum and in Bangladesh there is an "integrity pledge" taken by officials.The proliferation of mobile phones in Africa is being used to allow people to expose concerns about bribery in schools.Legal advice centres have also been developed in a number of countries to help community groups make legal challenges against school corruption.There are also international efforts to improve the monitoring and tracking of education funds.But corruption is still there leaching away education budgets. It's a particularly bleak problem when there are still tens of millions of children without any access to school."Corruption is an obstacle to a fundamental human right to education," says Mr Sweeney.While there are campaigners calling for education for all, such as Malala Yousafzai in Pakistan, this report also warns of the barriers being created for the poorest communities by demands for corrupt payments.Teachers take bribes to offset poor wages or irregular payments and that in turn raises questions about the lack of funding coming from higher up the chain.Mr Sweeney says that there should be a way of measuring good governance in any future global education targets."Even when formal school fees are abolished, many households are still being forced to pay informal fees. How is a family supposed to be able to afford these costs, when they cannot afford their daily meals?," says Pauline Rose, director of Unesco's Global Monitoring Report, which tracks progress towards primary education for all."Until these hidden costs are eradicated, we will not be able to call education free, and universal primary education will continue to remain a distant goal for the poorest."</body>

      <description>What does a university vice-chancellor do?</description>

      <body>Sir David Bell is vice-chancellor of the University of Reading. So what does he do all day?Does it make him a high-powered head teacher, responsible for the university's academic prowess?Or does it make him chief executive of a multi-million pound enterprise, plotting its future business strategy?Sitting in his office at the beginning of a new academic year, it's a reminder of how many big decisions are lying ahead of the UK's university leaders.On the most practical level, he says, it's like running a small town, with its own housing, doctors, libraries, nursery, shops, bars, sports facilities, hundreds of acres of parkland and campus security.There is an ambassadorial role of seeing and being seen.But it's easy to overlook how much universities have grown in terms of local economic significance. It's a long way from being an academic cottage industry.The vice-chancellor in many university towns is now the biggest local employer, apart from the NHS.There are 4,000 people directly employed by Reading University and many more depend on its spending power. The university and its staff and students are worth an estimated £1.78m every single day to the local economy.Universities like Reading were often set up with money from local big businesses - and now they've become the local big spenders themselves.Reading University is a member of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), as well as belonging to academic groups.Even after students finish their courses, the impact continues, with an estimated 19,000 of the university's graduates continuing to live and work in the area.There is an international dimension, as the UK's universities look to expand overseas, not least because of the need for a reliable source of extra income.Reading already has an outpost in South Africa and is planning to open a campus in Malaysia. They decided not to go ahead with plans for China.Sir David, a former Ofsted chief inspector, says the university needs to make plans to offset the volatility of relying on undergraduate student numbers.The word that Sir David uses to describe his responsibilities is "stewardship".The university is heading towards the 100th anniversary of its charter and as the current captain of the ship he wants to make sure it continues safely into the future.He says he "feels the weight" of this legacy and has the words of a previous vice-chancellor on his office wall: "Universities are living things - they feel, think and do.""There's a danger in being purely a chief executive. At the heart, it's about teaching and research," he says.He says he spends as much time as he can with the academics.In terms of running the organisation, there is the weekly equivalent of a cabinet meeting of senior staff."You sometimes feel vulnerable, you're carrying financial risks. These are big decisions about opening campuses overseas. But you have to make the best decisions at the time with the information available."There is also a responsibility for 17,000 young lives.He says he has been meeting and greeting new arrivals at the university. Watching parents saying goodbye to their children has brought home to him the importance of this moment."This is a big deal. We've got to look after them. It's often their first experience away from home."The funding of universities is increasingly dependent on attracting undergraduates and their tuition fees. And the unpredictability is a problem for long-term planning."I can't imagine there's a vice-chancellor in the land who isn't thinking about it."It raises questions about how mainstream, provincial universities, with a tradition of doing a bit of everything, can make themselves distinctive. Not just compared with other UK universities but also international rivals.The emergence of online university courses - so-called Moocs - makes the powerhouses of US universities only a mouse click away.The uncertainty over undergraduate numbers has given universities an incentive to find other sources of income, such as shifting towards graduate courses and executive training.The Henley Business School, a slice of the City on the Reading campus, has its own mock trading rooms.Postgraduates are now 45% of the students on Reading's campus.But how should a modern university present itself? Is it meant to be clad in ivy or silicon?On a warm autumn afternoon, the Reading campus looks like something from an American college movie, with youngsters practising American football on leafy sports fields.It's a long way from roll-up cigarettes and Oxfam overcoats.There has been a surge of new university buildings to attract young students. In Reading they've put £400m into new accommodation.Sir David says universities have had to respond to "changing patterns of affluence and what young people expect"."I don't take too precious a view of that."But if universities spend too much, they can be accused of being cash rich.When earlier this year the university bought a unique Samuel Beckett manuscript to add to its archive there was some carping about the price tag of £962,500. A US university would have told everyone it cost twice as much and put it all over the website to show they were serious players.Sir David says that despite the upheavals in funding and technology and the push towards a more competitive system he expects more to stay the same than will change."We're in turbulent times," he says, but remains confident that the university will still be recognisable in two decades."There is something powerful in having great seats of learning."</body>

      <title>Ex-mayor denies ball-bearing blast</title>
      <description>A former mayor tells a trial that he was not responsible for a series of blasts in his home town earlier this year which included a home-made ball-bearing bomb.</description>

      <body>A former Denbigh mayor has told a trial that he was not responsible for a series of blasts in the town.It culminated in a home-made bomb being detonated under a car - scattering ball-bearings over a wide area.John Larsen told Caernarfon Crown Court that he had played no part in the explosions in the Lenten Pool area between January and April.The 46 year old denies causing an explosion, possessing explosives and three arson attacks on cars.During his trial, the prosecution has claimed that there was "a strong compelling case" that Mr Larsen was the man behind the booms and blasts heard and seen in the area.One witness described how she had seen the town councillor near cars just before an explosion detonated under a Land Rover car.The blast showered ball-bearings and shrapnel over a large area, smashing windows.One resident even found that one of the ball-bearings had hit a headboard on their bed.An explosives expert told the court earlier that the ball-bearings had either been packed or strapped on to the device and would have been ejected from the bomb at "several hundred metres per second" with the potential to cause serious injury of even death to any passersby.But addressing Mr Larsen, his defence barrister, Gordon Hennell asked him: "Did you ever use any ball-bearings as shrapnel in a device?""No, never," replied Mr Larsen, who had been the mayor of Denbigh in 1999.Mr Larsen told the jury that he had an interest in fireworks as one of his hobbies, alongside magic tricks.He also accepted that he had experimented with fuels for rockets.But Mr Hennell said the allegations against the defendant went further than experimentation."The suggestion is that on March 24 you have not simply experimented, but set off an explosive device which has got ball-bearings added," he said.Larsen maintained: "No, that's incorrect. I didn't do that."Asked bluntly whether he had played any part in the night-time explosions in the Lenten Pool area, the defendant replied: "No, not at all."He told the jury that he had been at home in bed when the blasts occurred except for "a few occasions", and that he only went out late at night to check his wife's car."It gets very rowdy at night," he added.Mr Larsen was arrested on 19 April 2013, and police found a mix of chemicals, modified fireworks, rockets, flares and a book on pyrotechnics at his home.He denies causing an explosion likely to endanger life or cause serious injury to property on March 24. He also denies three charges of arson in which cars were damaged, and possessing an explosive substance.The trial continues.</body>

      <body>Screening for tuberculosis (TB) will be offered to 124 pupils at a comprehensive school in Carmarthenshire after a staff member was diagnosed with the infection.Letters have been sent to parents at Ysgol y Strade, Llanelli, saying their children will be offered a blood test next Thursday.Health officials say the risk that the infection has spread to pupils is low.Precautionary screening is also being offered to 21 members of staff.They are those identified as being close contacts of the patient.Sion Lingard, acting consultant in health protection for Public Health Wales (PHW), said TB is difficult to catch and is treatable with antibiotics."We are emphasising to pupils, parents and staff that it is very rare for TB to be transmitted within a school environment and so we are offering screening as a precaution," he said."Close contact with an infectious individual over a long time period, such as living in the same household, is usually required for a person to become infected with TB."Another four cases of TB had been identified in the Llanelli area over the last year, he said, but none of these have links to the school."Investigations into these cases are continuing with the involvement of Hywel Dda Health Board with treatment, advice and screening offered where appropriate," Mr Lingard added.TB is an infection usually found in the lungs, but any part of the body can be affected.People can catch TB by breathing in the bacteria in tiny droplets sneezed or coughed out by someone who has the infection in their lungs.The most common symptom of TB is a persistent cough for more than three weeks, with spit which can sometimes be blood-stained.Other symptoms can include weight loss, a high temperature, and sweating, particularly at night.Public Health Wales said anyone who is concerned about their health should speak to their GP or contact NHS Direct Wales on 0845 46 47.</body>

      <body>One of the "worst examples of poor treatment" led to the death of a man who was not told he had been diagnosed with a life-threatening condition, said a watchdog.Public Services Ombudsman Peter Tyndall upheld a complaint by the family of Carl Nolan, 30, of Rhyl, who had congenital cirrhosis of the liver.Mr Nolan had been treated at Glan Clwyd hospital.Health bosses said required standards were not met but changes had been made.The ombudsman's report, which refers to Mr Nolan as Mr X, said he was born with cirrhosis of the liver and diagnosed with the "life-threatening" condition - which replaces healthy tissue with non-functioning scar tissue - in 2000 but neither he nor his family were told at the time.And although a follow-up outpatient appointment was made for him in 2001 the IT worker was not notified, said the report.He became ill again in 2008 and was given treatment but investigations to determine the cause were not concluded.It was not until he requested a second opinion that he was told he had been born with cirrhosis.The report was not able to establish why Mr Nolan had not been initially told of his condition or given advice about how he could make lifestyle changes to improve his health after diagnosis of the condition.In 2010, he was admitted to hospital several times in quick succession after becoming ill again and blood tests showed that "his liver was failing".But the hospital "sent him away, only finally admitting him three days after his appearance" with a serious infection and before finally being referred for specialist treatment. He died seven weeks later.The report said: "Had he been treated three days earlier, Mr X should have recovered from the infection and had a chance of receiving a liver transplant. This opportunity to survive and flourish was denied him."In an interview with BBC Wales, Mr Tyndall said: "If he had been appropriately and promptly treated, his family are left with the knowledge that he could still be with us today."He was a young man with his life ahead of him, a partner, a loving family, and all that was taken away."I was shocked by what our investigation found in this instance."This is one of the worst examples of poor treatment and poor communication with a patient that I have encountered in my time as ombudsman."He upheld the family's complaint and issued recommendations to hospital manager Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board to review its "care pathway" and appointments system as well as its complaints handling process.Mr Nolan's mother Pat, a call centre supervisor, said had he been advised about his diagnosis in 2001 he could have sought and received specialist help and advice to improve his condition and could, ultimately, be alive today had he been able to receive a liver transplant.Mrs Nolan said: "This is a catalogue of errors and everybody along the line is accountable for Carl's death because they knew what he had and no one saw fit to communicate that and act upon it."I don't know what their procedures are but something is very lax."Angela Hopkins, health board executive director of nursing, midwifery and patient services, said: "The health board recognises that some of the care given was below the standard that should have been provided to the patient and family."We fully accept the recommendations in the report and have taken action to address each one made."We are reviewing our appointment system and process and gastroenterology care pathways to provide an improved and more robust safe service for patients."We are also making sure that safeguard measures are implemented to improve our standards of engagement with patients while they are treated by the health service in north Wales."The ombudsman also recommended that £5,000 be paid to the family to acknowledge the "failings and provide financial redress" along with £500 for its "poor complaint handling".The report said the family wanted changes to ensure the same "mistakes are never repeated".The ombudsman can hold the institution to account but not individuals involved in the care of Mr Nolan.Hs mother has written to the General Medical Council which regulates doctors and the medical profession asking that her son's case is reviewed."As far as I can see they seem to be above the law and not answerable to anybody and it has got to stop," she said.</body>

      <body>Wales coach Warren Gatland has warned that English and French clubs' attempts to set up a breakaway tournament from the Heineken Cup will fail.The Rugby Champions Cup, due to start next season, is a result of Anglo-French frustrations with Heineken Cup qualification and revenue sharing."I don't see an Anglo-French competition being successful or lasting that long," Gatland told BBC Jersey."I think all parties want full representation from all the countries."The new tournament could yet include teams from Scotland, Wales and Ireland, but the Pro12 sides need their unions' approval to take part. The Welsh, Irish and Scottish unions are, in turn, waiting on the International Rugby Board's (IRB) endorsement.New Zealander Gatland, who was appointed to the Wales post in 2008 after spells with London Wasps and Connacht as well as Ireland, believes a tournament that includes only English and French clubs will damage the international game in the northern hemisphere."There needs to be some sort of protection for a Scottish or Italian team potentially," he added. "Without their involvement we could see an impact going into the Six Nations."The 50-year-old also believes that plans for the Rugby Champions Cup may have overlooked difficulties in securing officials for matches.The English Rugby Football Union (RFU) are still uncommitted to the new tournament and their French counterparts actively oppose it."The referees are controlled by the unions and France have said they would not support a new competition, while the RFU have sort of stood on the fence," Gatland added.Quentin Smith, the chairman of England's top-level Premiership, and Tim Lopez, agent to the likes of Wales and Cardiff full-back Leigh Halfpenny, have warned that the uncertainty over top-level European rugby is affecting players' decisions over contracts at Welsh regions.</body>

      <title>Call for rugby concussion lessons</title>
      <description>More should be done to protect players from the dangers of concussion, the International Rugby Board's former medical advisor says.</description>

      <body>More should be done to protect players from the dangers of concussion, the International Rugby Board's (IRB) former medical advisor said.The call comes after researchers linked suffering repeated concussions from playing sport with memory loss, depression and early dementia.Dr Barry O'Driscoll wants mandatory concussion awareness training for all grassroots rugby coaches and players.He quit his IRB job claiming the body trivialised concussion. It denies this.He said his call was directed at the unions in Wales, England, Scotland and Ireland.The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) does not have mandatory training on concussion for grassroots coaches or referees.Dr O'Driscoll told BBC Wales: "At the grassroots level - so all the way through - I would like to see a mandatory training as part of coaching courses [and] as part of schools lessons with young rugby players."They don't need to be experts on brain surgery. What they need to do is get across a) the signs and symptoms and b) what to do."The WRU said it is committed to ensuring that player welfare is at the forefront of any decision making, and that it followed the guidelines set by the IRB.It also said it is looking at devising a nationwide education programme for all levels of the game.In England the Rugby Football Union (RFU) said it is an issue that is taken "seriously"."This year we have distributed 200,000 'Headcase' cards to the game giving advice on recognising concussion and stressing the 'if in doubt, sit it out' message."Online resources include dedicated area of rfu.com gives advice for players, parents, teachers, coaches, medics and other volunteers."Since 2008 around 35,000 English coaches have taken the IRB's Rugby Ready course which includes a concussion element."The Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) said: "The IRFU observe all international best practices, as set out by the International Rugby Board."We have in place and continue to develop education and training campaigns to ensure player welfare is prioritised at all times."A call for concussion awareness in schools has also been made by the father of a 14-year-old boy from Northern Ireland who died two years ago after playing a match for his school team.Ben Robinson was knocked unconscious and suffered from concussion after several high-impact collisions during the game but he was allowed to carry on playing.He collapsed again just before the end of the game and later died in hospital.His father Peter said he would still be alive if he had been taken off the pitch."At the start of the second half he was involved in a heavy tackle and he lay on the ground for a minute-and-a-half being treated," he said."He was assisted to his feet... his body language looked like an old man when he was walking around but he kept being involved in heavy tackles."It's ironic to think if he'd had a blood injury he'd have been taken off and he would be here today."Mr Robinson is pressing for concussion awareness to be taught in schools across the UK.And next month he will meet Welsh Education Minister Huw Lewis to discuss bringing the idea to Wales, having already met Scotland and Northern Ireland's ministers."I've played rugby down the years - I don't want to change the game of rugby I just want to make it safer," Mr Robinson added."Have all the physicality you want, just make sure at grass roots level it's a safe playing environment for the children."We just want to make sure that it doesn't happen again and that we can educate people and maybe that helps numb the pain in some way."The IRB said its approach to the issue was driven by evidence-based expert research."Concussion management is at the very heart of the IRB's player welfare strategy designed to protect players at all levels of the game and promote the very highest standards of education, coaching and medical care," a spokesperson said.</body>

      <title>MPs' housing benefit changes warning</title>
      <description>Changes to housing benefit - described by critics as the "bedroom tax" - will cause potential problems in Wales, a cross-party committee of MPs is warning.</description>

      <body>Changes to housing benefit - described by critics as the "bedroom tax" - will cause potential problems in Wales, a cross-party MPs' committee has warned.The reforms mean housing association and council tenants see benefits cut if they are deemed to have spare bedrooms.But the Welsh Affairs Committee fears there is a shortage of smaller homes available for rent for those looking to downsize.The UK government said money would be made available for the most vulnerable.Since April the reform has meant a 14% cut in benefits for one spare room and 25% for two.Around 40,000 tenants in Wales are affected by the changes which mean they must choose between losing some of their benefit or moving to a smaller home.But according to the committee, there could be a shortage of one and two-bedroom homes for those who wanted to find smaller properties.The MPs said in the report: "We recommend that the government issue discretionary guidance on the appropriate size of bedrooms in social rented sector accommodation."The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) must closely monitor whether local authorities are struggling to find alternative smaller accommodation for tenants who wish to downsize."If this is so, we urge the government to undertake a speedy review of this policy."It said the DWP should also monitor "whether the movement of tenants to smaller accommodation in the private rented sector leads to long-term savings in housing benefit expenditure".It added that renting privately may prove more expensive and the government's assertion that the under-occupancy policy would reduce rent prices in the private housing sector had yet to be proved.It called for direct rent controls in the private sector which would prevent rents from going above a certain level.The report says: "We acknowledge that one of the main reasons for recent increases in the housing benefit bill and projected further increases is inflation in private housing sector rents."Efforts to control housing benefit increases therefore have to include strategies to manage spiralling rents in the private rented sector, including direct rent controls."This recommendation was endorsed by the committee, despite the opposition of its chairman, Monmouth MP David Davies, and fellow Conservatives Guto Bebb and Glyn Davies.Last week, Mr Davies told BBC Wales the housing benefit reforms were not working as well in Wales as in London or Birmingham but he still backed their introduction.Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) welfare reform spokesman and Swansea councillor David Phillips said: "I have met many of my local residents to talk through the challenges that these reforms are creating for them, and what is plainly obvious in most cases is that the bedroom tax reform places some of our most vulnerable residents under severe financial pressure, while offering them no viable way to change or improve their situation."There are simply not enough smaller properties for people to move to."We hope that the UK government will consider and learn from the findings of this report as they review the impact of their policies and implement other aspects of welfare reform," he added.A DWP spokesperson said: "Housing benefit continues to pay the vast majority of people's rent, but the taxpayer can no longer afford to cover the costs of spare bedrooms."However, we have made £6.2m available to Welsh councils to support vulnerable people, with an additional £880,000 available to help those in rural parts of Wales."The committee said it wanted to know what the definition of "vulnerable" tenants was.Charity Community Housing Cymru said the report's findings echoed its own concerns.</body>

      <body>Crime has fallen 7% to a record low in the last year, the Crime Survey for England and Wales has shown.There were 8.5m incidents in the year to the end of June, compared with 9.1m the previous year.The drop comes despite a 9% rise in sexual offences, which was partly driven by the Jimmy Savile revelations of abuse.Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said England and Wales are safer than they have been "for decades".The headline crime figure is the lowest since the survey began in 1981, and has now fallen to half its peak level, recorded in 1995.However, the Office for National Statistics, which collates the survey, said the number of historical sexual offences - those which took place more than 20 years ago - recorded by the police has doubled.The Savile inquiry has encouraged greater numbers of people to report historical sexual offence to the police.The ONS said that in the last five years there has been a 35% rise in the number of rape offences recorded by the police - partly due to new guidance on the way in which such crimes are recorded.An increase in theft was also recorded by the Crime Survey, with offences up by 8% in the last year.Evidence suggests the rise was driven by the theft of smart phones, and involve pick-pocketing rather than violence or threats.The majority are counted as stealth thefts - where the victim is unaware items are being stolen.Meanwhile, though credit card fraud levels remained flat, overall fraud offences have jumped by 21% in the last year.The ONS said the cause of this rise would become clearer in the next one or two years, but it could be down to a new centralised method of recording fraud.Max Chambers, head of crime and justice at the think-tank Policy Exchange, said: "Whether you believe it's as the result of an ageing population, better policing and prevention, or the impact of the internet, there is little doubt that Britain is becoming a safer place to live, do business and raise a family."But crime is still too high and there are pockets of the country which remain blighted by anti-social behaviour and gang activity."While the latest figures show that the police have been able to cut crime substantially even with fewer resources, they must now redouble their efforts to tackle the hardcore of prolific offenders who commit offences that can often disproportionately hit the poor and the vulnerable."While welcoming falling crime rates, Jon Collins, deputy director of the Police Foundation - an independent policing think-tank - said it was important not to be "blind to new and emerging challenges".He said: "The police and the government should be wary of resting on their laurels."While crimes such as burglary and car crime are clearly not the problem that they once were, it's possible that the official crime figures are just not picking up the extent to which new opportunities for crimes like fraud and counterfeiting have emerged, particularly online."Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said: "Police reform is working and crime is falling."This is really positive news. Forces are rising to the challenge of making savings whilst cutting crime and delivering a better service to the public."England and Wales are safer than they have been for decades but we will continue to deliver measures which keep pace with the changing nature of crime and improve our ability to combat emerging issues."The Crime Survey for England and Wales asks people aged 16 and over living in households in England and Wales about their experiences of crime in the last 12 months. These experiences are used to estimate levels of crime in England and Wales.</body>

      <description>BBC Wales should be accountable to the assembly in the future, the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies says.</description>

      <body>BBC Wales should be accountable to the assembly in the future, the Welsh Conservative leader has suggested.In a speech, Andrew RT Davies will say the BBC has a "near monopoly" on reporting devolution and should be scrutinised by Welsh politicians.This, he will say, will make senior management and editors accountable for the actions they and their teams take.UK ministers said there was a "net benefit" to all parts of the United Kingdom in not devolving broadcasting.Neither AMs or the Welsh government currently have functions relating to broadcasting.The BBC Trust is a UK wide body to oversee the BBC, although there is an Audience Council in Wales which "scrutinises the BBC's services on behalf of BBC audiences in Wales".Mr Davies will tell an audience in Aberystwyth: "The editorial decisions that are taken in Wales not just on politics but on how Wales is reported must be scrutinised by the most important democratically elected body in Wales."He also warns the BBC's ability to "extend its reach in news" through online services is "perhaps to the detriment of other news outlets who usually need advertising revenues or online charging schemes to pay for anywhere near like for like presence"."In the Welsh context, it is near on impossible for a competitor to emerge because of the dominance of the BBC's website - it is free, extensive and accessible on portable devices."Mr Davies has written to Culture Secretary Maria Miller to argue that the future governance of the BBC in Wales should be considered during the charter renewal process in 2017.However, this call from Mr Davies is at odds with the current position of the UK government.In its submission to the second part of the Silk Commission considering further powers for the assembly, the Wales Office said: "There are good reasons why broadcasting was not devolved in the devolution settlements and there is no evidence to suggest that devolution of broadcasting policy or a different approach to funding the BBC would benefit licence fee payers."There is a greater net benefit to the nation and all its constituent parts in having broadcasting reserved."A spokesman for the UK Department for Culture, Media and Sport restated this position on Wednesday, saying Mr Davies's suggestion was not being considered.In a statement the BBC Trust said: "The BBC is accountable to licence fee payers across the UK through the BBC Trust."In Wales, the national trustee Elan Closs Stephens represents the interests of Welsh licence fee payers and the trust is advised about the BBC's performance by the Audience Council Wales."The Welsh assembly is involved in the process of appointing the national trustee."In a separate submission to the commission, the Welsh Conservative assembly group agreed key decisions on broadcasting in Wales should remain the responsibility of UK ministers.But the document also called for a "mechanism of joint accountability" to both the assembly and the UK parliament, so devolved matters such as the Welsh language could be addressed better.Mr Davies will also call for an end to the block grant system, by which the UK Treasury funds the Welsh government, where he says "a cheque is sent down the M4 and simply cashed, and usually more demanded on top".On Wednesday the prime minister refused to say when new tax and borrowing powers, recommended by the first part of the Silk Commission, would be implemented in Wales.In his speech Mr Davies will acknowledge David Cameron's view that those involved in politics in Cardiff Bay are "obsessed with constitutional tinkering" but blame a "poor" original devolution settlement that has left many policy makers discussing the constitution rather than policy.</body>

      <body>A grandfather is to net £125,000 after he placed a £50 bet on his grandson playing football for Wales - when he was 18 months old.Sixteen-year-old Harry Wilson made his international debut on Tuesday as a substitute against Belgium, becoming Wales' youngest ever senior player.His grandfather Peter Edwards, 62, was quoted odds of 2,500/1 when he placed the bet with a bookmaker in Wrexham.He is now set to retire a year earlier than originally planned.Wrexham-born Wilson came on in the 87th minute during Wales' 1-1 draw.At 16 years and 207 days, the Liverpool midfielder was 108 days younger than previous record holder Gareth Bale, now the world's most expensive footballer following his recent move to Real Madrid.There had been speculation that England were ready to try to persuade Wilson to switch international allegiance, but he opted for Wales.Mr Edwards explained how he felt when Wilson made his appearance."I was shattered because I had to wait for 85, 86 minutes before he came on and I was panicking because they'd already substituted twice, so I thought he wasn't going to make it," he said."But when he came on I had another glass of wine. (I was) a proud granddad first for sure."I told my wife at half-time that my pulse was 106 - I didn't know whether that was good or bad."Mr Edwards said Wilson had showed an interest in football from a young age."When he was about 18 months old he used to chase a ball around on the carpet before he could walk," Mr Edwards said."I went into William Hill in Wrexham and asked them how I go about it. I had no idea how to do it and the manageress put me in touch with London."Electrical contractor Mr Edwards, of Corwen, Denbighshire, works away from home most of the year, spending one weekend a fortnight with wife Dorothy, 58."She is over the moon. I retired immediately. I told my manager yesterday that if Harry plays I wouldn't be coming back," said Mr Edwards."I've retired one year early. I have come home now and will not be going back. Not bad for a daft bet."He said after Harry enrolled in the Liverpool FC academy his skills quickly developed and he returned to William Hill in the hope of placing a second bet."Harry was about 12 then. But they turned me down and said I already had a substantial bet with them. But they threw in England as a gesture of goodwill," he added.</body>

      <body>A wheat bag left to warm too long in a microwave is believed to have caused a fire in a 93-year-old woman's flat at a Conwy sheltered housing complex.The pensioner and two other people were taken to hospital and about 30 to 40 other residents were evacuated from flats at Rhoslan Park in Colwyn Bay.The blaze broke out at about 04:00 BST on Thursday.The Welsh Ambulance Service said the woman has been treated for smoke inhalation.North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said she had been alerted to the fire by a smoke alarm and was given safety advice over the phone from fire control operators while help was mobilised.Police and ambulance staff were also called and the pensioner was led to safety to be treated by paramedics at the scene.She was then transferred to hospital as a precaution.The fire service said that other residents from the building, also as a precaution, and were safely accounted for.Two others were treated at the scene and transferred to hospital.Gwyn Jones from North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said they were alerted that the smoke alarm had been activated."This alarm proved invaluable as it gave us an early warning that there was a problem at the address and enabled emergency services to respond quickly," he said."It appears that a wheat bag left to re-heat for too long caused the fire and we are warning residents throughout north Wales who have any kind of warming device such as this to ensure that they follow the manufacturer's instructions."We also advise not to leave any cooking unattended."</body>

      <title>Councils' cash falls by average 3.5%</title>
      <description>Councils in Wales will have their Welsh government funding cut by between 4.6 and 1.2% next year, ministers have announced.</description>

      <body>Details of cuts to every local councils' budget from the Welsh government have been announced.Funding for Ceredigion, Denbighshire and Powys will fall by 4.6% but Newport will only experience a 1.2% cut.Prior to the announcement, the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) warned that most councils were unprepared for the scale of cuts.Many of Wales' 22 councils have already started to plan for how they will meet their budget shortfalls.It is expected that cuts to services such as libraries, refuse collections and public toilets will be made across the country.The funding has been distributed according to a formula, taking into account factors such as the number of school pupils, the age profile and size of the local population.Next year's funding is the first to be based on 2011 census figures. Rural areas will experience bigger cuts because of projected reductions in their populations.Newport's settlement is less harsh because its population is rising and it has a large number of school pupils.The government's draft budget last week prioritised the health service, with £570m extra for the NHS.Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems had made a deal with Labour before the announcement to allow the minority government to pass its budget when AMs vote on it in the coming months.Making Wednesday's announcement, Local Government Minister Lesley Griffiths said the total settlement was £4.26bn.She acknowledged the situation was "extremely challenging".The minister said she had included a mechanism ensuring no single council faced an "unmanageable reduction in their allocation" compared to last year, and had transferred over £30m in grants to give councils greater flexibility in managing resources."I could not have been clearer about the future financial reality facing local government in Wales and I have provided warning of the likely shape of budget reductions," Ms Griffiths said."For the last three years, the Welsh government has shielded local government from the full force of the cuts to allow them to prepare for the transformational change necessary to maintain vital local services, whilst limiting any additional financial pressure on hard-pressed households."Asked whether local authorities could raise council tax above the 5% limit set informally by the Welsh government, Ms Griffiths said: "I would have to look at that."I have made it very clear that I have powers to cap and I would have to look very closely at that. But, at the moment, no figures have been mentioned to me."I will have to see what comes forward and take the decision then."She criticised Rhondda Cynon Taf for using the term "armageddon" in describing the local authority cuts earlier in the week.Ms Griffiths said it was "over the top" and called on councils not to carry out "knee jerk" reactions.She also said that modelling by the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) of a council tax rise of 3.5% was "probably about right" but said she did not have a specific figure in mind.Conservative local government shadow minister Janet Finch-Saunders said: "Labour, the nationalists and Lib Dems agreed a very challenging settlement for Welsh local authorities, which means tough decisions and a forensic scrutiny of council spending."The challenge for local authorities is to resist the easy options of putting up the council tax bills of hardworking families or cutting frontline services."Welsh councils need to go through their budgets line by line and eliminate wasteful spending, improve their tax collection rates and deliver services in more imaginative ways.The WLGA said councils were facing "unprecedented funding reductions".It called for "less central regulation and prescription" to allow councils to change the way they run public services.WLGA deputy leader and finance spokesperson Aaron Shotton said: "Whatever councils do, these cuts mean that the public services delivered by local government in Wales will look significantly different within the next three to five years."Communities throughout Wales will have to revise their expectations significantly in terms of what services they can realistically expect their local councils to deliver, and local councils and their communities will need to engage in some very difficult discussions on what services should be prioritised."BBC Wales' economics correspondent Sarah Dickins writes:It is councillors in Ceredigion, Denbighshire and Powys who will really be feeling pressure with cuts of 4.6% in the money they get from Welsh government. In contrast, in Newport there will be relief that its budget from April is only being cut by 1.2%.Councils have known for months that they will have many millions less to run public services such as social care, school dinners, leisure centres and roads than they have had this year or, for that matter, the year before.Now they have to make decisions about whether to axe specific services, whether to get private companies to run them or whether the work can be done differently, for instance by volunteers or community groups.They will also have to decide how much they can turn to residents for help by increasing council tax.The cuts in funding from Welsh government will have to be found in what is in effect only one third of each council's overall money.Around 40% of their budget is ring-fenced for schools and a further 25% is protected for social services. The remaining 35% does not just pay for services from school meals to gritting to refuse collection but also for councils' long-term borrowing arrangements.A four-week consultation period now begins and councils' final budgets will be set by the end of February.BBC Wales' business correspondent Brian Meechan writes:Councils have a number of options on the table as they face the squeeze.Staff costs make up the bulk of most spending on public services. A Wales Audit Office report said the public sector would need to "identify novel ways of reducing their staffing bills". That could mean flexible working, with reduced hours or moving from full-time to part-time work.It could also mean councils outsourcing some services, for example benefits, computing and technology, and facilities management, to private companies. This can involve the whole scale transfer of staff to the private sector but doesn't necessitate that.Private companies have not proved a popular choice in Wales where local authorities have seemed reluctant to use them as a solution to their financial woes. It's also unpopular with trade unions.But in England, it's a route that many councils have gone down.Mouchel is one company that's profited from this approach. In partnership with Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Services, it maintains highways, road markings, public lighting and street signs for Westminster Council.Meanwhile, Capita runs Service Birmingham, a joint venture with the council that provides IT services. The company says the partnership has led to improved services, reduced costs and created a more efficient, motivated workforce.But there are those who believe that public services shouldn't be about creating profit for private companies and they're sceptical of the claims of improved efficiency.The issues around profit and public services are what's led to a growth in Wales in what's come to be known as the "third sector"- it's neither public nor private.While charities are a part of this, it goes beyond them to describe other organisations that are run as businesses with any profits being reinvested into the business or in other social activities.Many of those third sector organisations are coming together in Cardiff today for the Social Enterprise Wales Conference and councils will almost certainly be looking at how much bigger a role they can play in future provision of services.Some of the bigger examples of these are housing associations.The growth in these over the last decade or so came from some authorities transferring the ownership of their housing stock to not-for-profit housing associations including Valleys to Coast which took over Bridgend's properties.Neath Port Talbot council's leisure facilities meanwhile are run by the not-for-profit Celtic Leisure. It was set up in 2003, long before the financial crash and the cutbacks.It's also happened on a smaller scale when local communities have come together to keep facilities going when they were threatened with closure, Harlech Swimming Pool and the Swansea Tennis Centre being two successful examples.Of course, councils could save by working more closely together as the Welsh government has asked them to do.Their track record though is far from convincing.In 2012, Conwy and Denbighshire councils scrapped plans to merge highways departments.The 22 councils are also supposed to be working together in 4 regional consortia to improve schools which the Education Minister, Huw Lewis, told Good Morning Wales earlier has "not been functioning very well".If councils can't make savings by co-operation, attention may turn to whether there needs to be a reduction in their number as has happened with Local Health Boards.Supporters of reorganisation say it will lead to savings as departments and senior roles are merged.Those against argue that it would be a fraction of cuts that are required and would result in years of problems as councils are distracted from the task of delivering services within tightening budgets while dealing with dramatic changes to their organisations.BBC Wales' arts correspondent Huw Thomas writes:The amount of money that councils spend on the arts and culture is a relatively small proportion of the overall pot, but these services are often funded without any statutory obligation by the local authorities.The situation means there's never any certainty that the funding will continue if the financial climate deteriorates, and the prospect of a significantly tougher 2014/15 local government settlement has already prompted councils to review the services that they fund.Cardiff council has proposed completely cutting the annual grants it gives to some arts organisations in order to save more than £220,000 - which includes stopping a grant worth £161,001 for Sherman Cymru.Flintshire council is reviewing the annual amount it gives to Clwyd Theatr Cymru, which received £1m from the local authority in 2012/13.Other local authorities are also reviewing the non-statutory services they fund, but some councils are also seeking to protect the cultural services that they consider to be a key part of their strategies for attracting tourism and investment.Swansea is currently bidding to be named UK City of Culture 2017, and its joint bid with Carmarthenshire and Neath Port Talbot could mean those authorities are reluctant to significantly reduce their spending on the arts as the judges examine what the area has to offer.</body>

      <body>A dairy company has announced plans to close a Wrexham creamery with the possible loss of 231 jobs.First Milk has told staff its cheese-packing plant in Maelor could close by the end of May 2014.The firm has lost a "significant" contract with Asda and said it had informed trade unions. It will begin a staff consultation soon.The Welsh government said it was "disappointing news" and it would be meeting urgently with First Milk.A spokesman said all possible options would be examined "to try to safeguard the future of the packing facility and the jobs at Maelor".Welsh Secretary David Jones said it was a "sobering reminder of the challenges the Welsh economy still faces"."The news that there may be a significant number of job losses at the First Milk site in Wrexham will cause a great deal of concern to the workers, families and communities affected," he added."The Wales Office is in close communication with the company and we are committed to working with the Welsh government to offer all the support we can at this difficult time."In a statement, First Milk - a co-operative owned by farmers across the UK - said it was "no longer economically viable for the business to keep the site at Maelor operational".A spokesman added: "We very much regret the need to make the proposal to close our Maelor operation."We have a hard-working, loyal and committed workforce there and we are aware of the impact that this news will have on them."We will of course seek to provide those potentially affected with every support and address ways in which the impact of the proposals can be reduced."The spokesman added: "As a farmer-owned co-operative, the reason we're here is to deliver sustainable returns to our members and this announcement today supports that objective."Clwyd South AM Ken Skates said: "This announcement will devastate First Milk's loyal and hard-working employees and is a major blow for the local area."I am disappointed to see Asda end their contract with the company after the excellent service they have been shown by the workers over the years."In a statement, Asda said: "Unfortunately as part of a long-term strategic review, we have decided that from April 2014 we will be switching the supply of some of our cheese from First Milk to Arla."We appreciate how disappointing this news will be for them but we want to reassure everyone that this decision was not taken lightly."Wrexham council leader Neil Rogers said it was a "sad day for Wrexham".He added: "Our thoughts are with those employees who are to be made redundant and their families."It is important that Wrexham does everything it can to develop its economy by attracting new businesses into the county borough."Last year, First Milk announced £13.5m redevelopment plans which it said would safeguard 220 jobs.The firm said it needed to invest in new production facilities at the Maelor creamery to remain competitive.Wrexham councillors approved plans for the company to build a new cheese-cutting and packing centre, including offices.</body>

      <body>An explosive device that was set off in a Denbighshire town could have led to serious injury or death, an explosives expert has told Caernarfon Crown Court.The improvised bomb was detonated in Lenten Pool, Denbigh, in March, smashing windows and scattering shrapnel and metal ball bearings.Former town mayor John Larsen denies being responsible for the blast and a series of arson attacks on cars.He also denies two charges of possessing explosives.Forensic scientist Kevin Sanders told the jury he examined the remains of the device that went off at Lenten Pool on 24 March.Metal fragments from the device were found "twisted and had sharp edges".They were also covered in a grey sooty residue, which was "consistent with being in close proximity to an explosion," Mr Sanders said.The jury heard the fragments had come from a drinks or food can, and had probably held a chlorate-based explosive.The expert said those type of explosive chemicals were not normally used in commercially-made fireworks, and it would be a "home-made" explosive.The court also heard ball-bearings found scattered around the area had either been in the can-bomb or strapped to it.One of those ball-bearings smashed a nearby bedroom window and hit a bed headboard."They would have been ejected (by the blast) at several hundred metres per second," said Mr Sanders."If anyone had been passing they would have been likely to have caused serious injury."If it hit in the head it could have caused death."The trial has heard that the blast in March was the culmination of weeks of bangs and blasts in the Lenten Pool area, that had left some residents "terrified".Mr Larsen, who is a town councillor and had been a mayor of Denbigh in 1999, was arrested at his nearby home on 19 April.A search of his home recovered a wide-range of chemicals, modified fireworks, ball-bearings, flares, and a book on pyrotechnics.The jury has been told it is part of Mr Larsen's defence that he had an innocent and legitimate interest in fireworks.The trial was told many of the chemicals found in his home could be used to make gunpowder and firework flash-powder.There were also components used to colour fireworks, and fuse wires to ignite them.The defence case is due to start on Wednesday, when Mr Larsen is expected to give evidence.The trial continues.</body>

      <body>A town council is looking for a new home after it was left with a £20,000 bill to bring its current Victorian building up to fire safety standards.Newtown Town Council has been told the fire alarm system in its 19th Century headquarters needs upgrading.It also needs new fire doors and might need re-wiring after a fire report described the building as "unsafe and unacceptable".It has approached Powys council about using one of its buildings.The current town council building also houses a museum honouring the social reformer Robert Owen, who was born in the town.Last month, Deputy Mayor Richard Edwards said it had failed to comply with a series of new fire regulations which had been introduced in the last few years.Speaking at a full council meeting this month, town council clerk Jenn Jones said that the report required a substantial list of improvements which had to be carried out immediately.The costs of carrying out the work was estimated to be well in excess of £20,000 and not all the estimates for the work were yet known.It was unanimously agreed that the council would actively explore vacating the building.A Powys council spokesman said: "The town council have approached us to see if we can find them some accommodation within our buildings if and when they have to leave their current building."We have held initial discussions but nothing has yet been decided."</body>

      <body>Water pipes in Welshpool are being replaced after a "flurry" of bursts cut supplies to residents and a hospital.A £250,000 project is renewing about 300m (330 yards) of pipes in Gungrog Road, near Victoria Memorial Hospital.A one-way system will be in place and Severn Trent Water has apologised for any disruption. It is hoped the new pipes will be working by next month.Last month, some homes were temporarily without water and the hospital lost its supply twice in three days.The hospital's new kidney dialysis unit needs 1,200 litres of water every hour when running at full capacity.Severn Trent said it expected the renewed pipes to be working by the end of November.Dave Kiernan, the firm's programme manager, said: "The water pipes in Gungrog Road have served the local community for a very long time."Their age and the increased demand for water has led to the recent bursts, causing interruptions to our customers' water supply and the service we provide."He said the work had been planned as part of a bigger project but was being brought forward because of a flurry of problems experienced at the hospital and Gungrog Infants School.The company said most of the work outside the school was planned for half term week to "minimise disruption".</body>

      <body>Scarlets tight-head prop Samson Lee has been banned for two weeks following the incident that led to his sin-binning in their 33-26 win at Harlequins last weekend.Lee's boot struck Quins scrum-half Danny Care's face at a ruck.Uncapped 20-year-old Lee was banned until Monday, 28 October.That rules him out of the Scarlets' Heineken Cup clash against Racing Metro on Saturday and the 25 October Pro12 clash at Zebre.French citing commissioner Jean-Claude Legendre referred the incident to the competition's disciplinary officials.Irish referee John Lacey sin-binned Lee and the player's case was considered by Scottish judicial officer Rod McKenzie.McKenzie determined Lee was going for the ball, but in doing so, the player's boot "made contact with Care's face in a reckless manner, and that in his opinion, the offence warranted a red card".An ERC statement read: "He [McKenzie] found that the act was at the low-end entry point of the IRB's [International Rugby Board's] sanctioning regime [two weeks] and although there were no aggravating factors, and although Lee had a clean record, the player had pleaded not guilty and therefore, no mitigation was possible in this case."The IRB recommended minimum sanctions for foul play are two weeks for a low range offence, five weeks for a mid range, and nine to 52 weeks for a high end.</body>

      <body>Craig Bellamy bowed out of international football admitting it was an emotional finish to his 78-cap Wales career.The 34-year-old, who scored 19 goals during 15 years as an international, played in Tuesday night's 1-1 draw in Belgium.He revealed the Welsh national anthem brought home his retirement."You do think: 'This is probably the last time I'm going to be in this position as a player,'" said Bellamy."To soak in your national anthem. I'm speechless about it, but it is really nice. It's something I do cherish."It did hit home a bit that I'm not going to be this side of it again."I've enjoyed every second of it. To reach 78 [caps] and the injuries I've had down the years. I'm delighted."Bellamy did question whether it was right to have given 16-year-old Harry Wilson his debut on Tuesday and prevent England having claims on him.The Liverpool Academy midfielder came on in the 87th minute against Belgium to become Wales' youngest ever player."Sixteen is young. He can't play for anyone else now. Is that really the most important thing?"I think he's a talent and I think he's going to do well in the years. But I'd like to see him do well first."But Bellamy also admitted that seeing Wilson become the youngest ever Wales player, beating Gareth Bale's previous record by 108 days, put his own age into perspective."He [Wilson] is my boy's age, so probably [it brought] home to me how old I am," said Bellamy, who made his Wales debut against Jamaica in 1998.Bellamy's retirement coincided with the end of Wales' 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign which saw them finish fifth in Group A, which contained six teams.In their 10 games Wales recorded three wins, six defeats and a draw.But Bellamy, who has hinted one day he would like to manage Wales, says the future is bright for Welsh international football."It's a good generation. A lot of them had potential but a lot have come to the fore and are fulfilling it," he said.On the draw with Belgium, ranked sixth in the world, Bellamy added: "It was a decent result. It was difficult especially when they went 1-0 up. Obviously James [Collins] going off was a bit of a blow to us we needed as much experience as we could."We found an extra gear in the last 10-15 minutes. It was a nice way to go out."</body>

      <title>MPs' housing benefit changes warning</title>
      <description>Changes to housing benefit - described by critics as the "bedroom tax" - will cause potential problems in Wales, a cross-party committee of MPs is warning.</description>

      <body>Changes to housing benefit - described by critics as the "bedroom tax" - will cause potential problems in Wales, a cross-party MPs' committee has warned.The reforms mean housing association and council tenants see benefits cut if they are deemed to have spare bedrooms.But the Welsh Affairs Committee fears there is a shortage of smaller homes available for rent for those looking to downsize.The UK government said money would be made available for the most vulnerable.Since April the reform has meant a 14% cut in benefits for one spare room and 25% for two.Around 40,000 tenants in Wales are affected by the changes which mean they must choose between losing some of their benefit or moving to a smaller home.But according to the committee, there could be a shortage of one and two-bedroom homes for those who wanted to find smaller properties.The MPs said in the report: "We recommend that the government issue discretionary guidance on the appropriate size of bedrooms in social rented sector accommodation."The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) must closely monitor whether local authorities are struggling to find alternative smaller accommodation for tenants who wish to downsize."If this is so, we urge the government to undertake a speedy review of this policy."It said the DWP should also monitor "whether the movement of tenants to smaller accommodation in the private rented sector leads to long-term savings in housing benefit expenditure".It added that renting privately may prove more expensive and the government's assertion that the under-occupancy policy would reduce rent prices in the private housing sector had yet to be proved.It called for direct rent controls in the private sector which would prevent rents from going above a certain level.The report says: "We acknowledge that one of the main reasons for recent increases in the housing benefit bill and projected further increases is inflation in private housing sector rents."Efforts to control housing benefit increases therefore have to include strategies to manage spiralling rents in the private rented sector, including direct rent controls."This recommendation was endorsed by the committee, despite the opposition of its chairman, Monmouth MP David Davies, and fellow Conservatives Guto Bebb and Glyn Davies.Last week, Mr Davies told BBC Wales the housing benefit reforms were not working as well in Wales as in London or Birmingham but he still backed their introduction.Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) welfare reform spokesman and Swansea councillor David Phillips said: "I have met many of my local residents to talk through the challenges that these reforms are creating for them, and what is plainly obvious in most cases is that the bedroom tax reform places some of our most vulnerable residents under severe financial pressure, while offering them no viable way to change or improve their situation."There are simply not enough smaller properties for people to move to."We hope that the UK government will consider and learn from the findings of this report as they review the impact of their policies and implement other aspects of welfare reform," he added.A DWP spokesperson said: "Housing benefit continues to pay the vast majority of people's rent, but the taxpayer can no longer afford to cover the costs of spare bedrooms."However, we have made £6.2m available to Welsh councils to support vulnerable people, with an additional £880,000 available to help those in rural parts of Wales."The committee said it wanted to know what the definition of "vulnerable" tenants was.Charity Community Housing Cymru said the report's findings echoed its own concerns.</body>

      <body>The first minister has clashed with the Welsh secretary over delays in giving the Welsh government the power to borrow money.Carwyn Jones also accused the prime minister of "holding Wales back" over the issue, which was raised at a meeting at Downing Street.UK ministers have agreed in principle to give Wales borrowing powers.But the deal is tied up in a delayed package that would also see the Welsh government get control of some taxes.David Cameron has said he is attracted by the idea of the Welsh government raising some of its budget.First Minister Carwyn Jones said: "The message I put to the prime minister was 'come on, stop holding Wales back. Let's get some sense here over the recommendations that have been made by the UK government's own commission to give Wales a financial package to take Wales forward in the future'."On Sunday Mr Jones warned it would be a "disaster" for Wales if borrowing powers recommended by the Silk Commission were not devolved.He told BBC Radio Wales's Sunday Supplement that without more powers to borrow money, planned £1bn M4 improvements "will not happen".During Wednesday's meeting, Secretary of State for Wales David Jones said it was the Welsh government's responsibility to maintain the M4 and had been since devolution."It is rather rich for the Welsh government not to upgrade the M4 to a proper standard and somehow blame the UK government for that when it was never the UK government's responsibility," he said.The first minister claimed that if the package - a response to last year's report by the Silk commission which is examining the future of devolution - was not agreed by next month, a law to transfer the powers would not be delivered by the next general election.But the Welsh secretary said it was important to get the package right, and UK ministers were still considering submissions to a consultation on the devolution of stamp duty land tax.The pair met at a meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee, made up of the devolved administrations and the UK government.Last month, Mr Cameron denied blocking further devolution and said he was attracted by the idea of the Welsh government being able to raise some of its budget.But he had said the "bubble" in Cardiff was "completely obsessed" about powers when the real issue was economic recovery.Almost a year ago, the commission set up by the UK government and chaired by former assembly clerk Paul Silk said ministers in Cardiff should be allowed to vary some tax rates and some borrowing powers.A decision had been initially expected in the spring.The proposals to ease motorway congestion around Newport, with options of routes swinging south of the existing M4, are currently out to consultation.Chancellor George Osborne has called it one of the most important road schemes in the UK.</body>

      <title>Call to increase AMs from 60 to 100</title>
      <description>The number of AMs in the Welsh assembly needs to be increased from 60 to 100 in order for them to properly scrutinise the government, a report says.</description>

      <body>The number of AMs in the Welsh assembly needs to be increased from 60 to 100 in order for them to properly scrutinise the government, a report has said.The Electoral Reform Society and the UK's Changing Union project researched the assembly's size.They found it had a much smaller number of AMs compared to similar law-making bodies around the world.The Welsh government said it would be premature to speculate ahead of a decision on extra assembly powers.The Scottish Parliament has 129 members, while Northern Ireland's Assembly has 108.The report, Size Matters - Making the National Assembly more effective, says the backbench AMs are badly overstretched and are struggling to effectively scrutinise a "powerful and well-resourced" government.It is not the first time the number of AMs has been questioned.In 2004, the Richard Commission, which looked at expanding the assembly's powers, recommended 80 AMs once it received law-making powers.Those recommendations were not implemented.The Silk Commission, set up by the UK government, is currently looking at the devolution settlement in Wales and has already said ministers in Cardiff should be given the power to vary some tax rates.The new report found 80 was "an arbitrary number", and said after an international comparison of similar bodies, the number of AMs should be 100.An assembly expanded to this size would cost taxpayers about £10.1m per year, but the report's authors argued that with the number of MPs and local councillors both likely to be reduced, it was time for a "mature debate" about the balance of political representation.Presiding officer Rosemary Butler has previously called for the number of AMs to increase, but the Welsh government said at the time there was "no appetite" among the public for more politicians.Deputy presiding officer David Melding AM said: "I welcome this report which has, for the first time, provided us with some relevant international comparisons and analysis of the demands on assembly members."I am sure this report will play an important role in informing the current debate as we move towards the publication of the Silk Commission's inquiry."Steve Brooks, director of the Electoral Reform Society in Wales, said: "As more and more powers are added to the assembly, AMs are buckling under the weight of devolution."Chair of the UK's Changing Union project, Professor Richard Wyn Jones, said: "Few, if any serious observers would argue that just over 40 backbench assembly members is enough to do the job effectively."Indeed the evidence clearly shows that even without the additional financial powers already recommended by the Silk Commission, the National Assembly is overstretched."A Welsh government spokesperson said: "It would be premature for us to speculate on what any additional powers might mean for the size of the National Assembly, given we do not yet know what the Silk Commission will recommend."The Welsh Conservatives said: "Job creation for politicians would rightly be questioned by the public at what remains a challenging time for the Welsh economy."What is urgently needed is more scrutiny of legislation, better engagement with the public and more topical and extensive assembly proceedings."Plaid Cymru AM Simon Thomas said with the prospect of financial and taxation powers becoming more real, there was a need to ensure that the assembly was able to "meet the increased demands".Eluned Parrott AM said the Lib Dems supported a rise to 80 AMs."While I understand that increasing the number of politicians is never going to be popular, it's right that we should have an open and honest debate about the issue," she said, adding the people of Wales would get more capacity to scrutinise with additional AMs.</body>

I think the Heineken Cup is just below international rugby and you need play that week in week out if you've got any international aspirations."You just want to play in an attractive competition, one like the Heineken Cup which is exciting - top teams playing against each other every week."There's no room for error really and it's pushing you as a person."Evans was in the unfamiliar position of being dropped for the Heineken Cup opener against Leinster, which ended in a 19-9 home defeat, and is a doubt to face Northampton this Sunday because of injury.But the 6ft 8in forward said if he was not being selected for big games then that could also have a bearing on his future."Last week I more or less wasn't selected and obviously that was very disappointing," Evans said."It's probably been the worst week that I've been involved in rugby for a long, long time and I was really, really disappointed not to be involved."I felt I could have done the job, I wasn't selected, there's not a lot else I can do."I'd like to play in every game, especially the big games, the Heineken Cup games... this week I've got a niggling Achilles injury and I'm just trying to make sure that's right."It is a massive shock [not to get selected], not that I take away anything from the competition - I think James King [who faced Leinster at lock] has been playing extremely well."The Heineken Cup's the biggest games, that's what you build into and if you're not involved in them then what else are you meant to do, with one year left on your contract?"I haven't had any offers as such yet, but I suppose things will start coming my way hopefully sooner or later."[Going abroad] would not appeal to me, but first and foremost my wife is about to give birth at the end of November and I'm quite a family-orientated person, but I want to try and play competitive rugby."Ospreys have lost a number of high-profile players to France in recent years, including Wales stars Mike Phillips, Lee Byrne and James Hook.The Welsh region's chief executive, Andrew Hore, admitted in August that the region could find it hard to keep hold of some of their Lions stars.Lions and Wales tight-head prop Adam Jones has started negotiations with the region over a new deal but admitted he would consider a move to France.Ospreys contracts of the prop, Evans and fellow lock Alun Wyn Jones expire at the end of the 2013-14 season.The defeat by Leinster left them with an uphill struggle in this weekend's second-round match at Northampton."To lose your home game has put us under a lot of pressure really, but there's one thing for sure, I think the boys... react under pressure," Evans said."Northampton lost out in Castres and playing in front of their home crowd and with the team they've got, I think it'll be a great competition to see who is going to come out on top."</body>

      <body>Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has said Wales' youngest capped player Harry Wilson is not yet ready to play in the Premier League.Wilson, 16, made his full Wales debut as an 87th-minute substitute in their 1-1 World Cup qualifier draw with Belgium on Tuesday.The Liverpool academy player beat Gareth Bale's record, but Rodgers says a full club debut is a long way off."He's not near [playing in] the Premier League," Rodgers said."I was surprised to be honest that he [played against Belgium]. Obviously Wales had a lot of injuries."He's a very talented young player that he knows he will have a great opportunity here if he continues to develop at Liverpool."But as of yet, becoming a Premier League player, I think it's important that we just stay calm and let him develop at his own rate."Wilson had been called into the Welsh squad after injuries had disrupted manager Chris Coleman's preparations for the final two World Cup qualifiers.The Wrexham-born player was an unused substitute for last Friday's 1-0 win over Macedonia at Cardiff City Stadium before making his debut in Brussels.Rodgers revealed he had been informed of Wilson's inclusion in the squad by Liverpool and Wales goal-scoring legend Ian Rush."I had a call from Ian Rush to say he had done great in training and that Chris was very pleased with how he'd been and the possibilities of having him involved," Rodgers added."And then it escalated from there. He'd obviously done well in the training and he was then put into the squad."Wilson's debut also earned his granddad a £125,000 pay-out from a £50 bet on him winning a Wales cap, placed when the Liverpool Academy member was 18 months old.</body>

      <body>Wales' players want Chris Coleman to continue as the national team manager, according to full-back Neil Taylor.Wales ended their World Cup qualifying campaign on a high with a win over Macedonia and a draw in Belgium.And Taylor told BBC Radio Wales: "We've always said we wanted him to stay. We want stability, he has the right ideas and knows what he's talking about."Coleman's contract ends after next month's game with Finland and he has said he is undecided over his future.Taylor added that he had sympathy for the problems Coleman has encountered in his time in charge of the national side, since succeeding the late Gary Speed in January 2012."It's got to be difficult for him when he gets half a squad, or not even half a squad like this time," Taylor added."But it shows what he got out of us is what he's capable of and we want to build on that for him."Hopefully when we get all the players back, what we can produce should be great."Taylor also paid tribute to Cardiff forward Craig Bellamy, who made his final international appearance in Brussels before retiring from the international game.Bellamy is Wales' third most-capped player, having made 78 appearances for his country and fifth on the all-time scorers' chart with 19 goals."It's been a privilege to play with him and I'm a little bit gutted that he's retiring to be honest, but I think the body tells you sometimes that you need to," Taylor said."He's a massive loss to Wales but what a shift. I mean this guy has turned up for every friendly, not just the ones that matter."He always wants to win, always wants to be involved and against Belgium he was as hungry as ever and led by example for the boys who were winning their first cap."Taylor is sure that Wales can build on their promising end to the campaign ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign, which will start in September 2014."We have got to make sure this time that it does bode well for the future and that we do well in the future," Taylor added."We can't turn it on and off and the manager next time will want all his players fit."If we can play like that with our best players as well, then we look a different team."</body>

      <description>How will cash-strapped Welsh councils save money?</description>

      <body>The total amount of cash available to councils around Wales to pay for services such as bin collections, libraries, leisure centres and public toilets has been announced by the Welsh government.It was announced last week that funding for local government would see a cut of 5.81% next year.Local government spending will fall from £4.648bn this year to £4.466bn next year, a cut in cash terms of 3.91% or 5.81% in real terms.Their budgets will be around 9% lower in real terms between now and 2015-16.So how are Wales' 22 local authorities going to deal with budget shortfalls:Council leader Ieuan Williams said: "We now anticipate that the council will face cuts in the region of £7-8m and cuts of this magnitude will hit the authority hard."It's more than likely that we'll again be forced to raise Council Tax by the maximum 5% with a smaller percentage increase unsustainable."Finance portfolio holder Hywel Eifion Jones added: "The reduction in funding for Anglesey of -4% against a Welsh average of -3.5% seems most unfair given our high levels of elderly and unemployed residents."The provisional settlement is disappointing news from the Welsh government and bound to have a significant effect on the level of Council Tax and future services."We'll shortly start consulting with fellow councillors and the public regarding their priorities, but clearly some services will need to be provided in a different way in the future."Anglesey chief executive Richard Parry Jones said: "We'll now have to assess the significant impact that the settlement will have on our capacity to provide services."The council's heads of service are currently working on initial recommendations for efficiency savings, and these will have to be prioritised by our elected members in due course."We also, of course, intend to consult widely with stakeholders and partners as part of the process of formulating the council budget for 2014/15."The decisions will be difficult and it is inevitable that we will have to curtail services to the people of Anglesey."BBC Wales news website is awaiting a response from Blaenau Gwent council.Mel Nott, Leader of Bridgend County Borough Council, said: "It is now inevitable that we face having to make some very difficult decisions."This will obviously have a huge effect on council services, but we are preparing for the challenge by making changes that will move the authority away from some of the more traditional activities and structures associated with local government."The council has a medium-term financial strategy in place which is ensuring that we prioritise and focus our available resources efficiently and in a co-ordinated manner."We need to fundamentally alter the way in which the council works, spends money and makes use of resources, so in future there will be a greater focus on innovation, shared services, lower costs and collaboration."However, there should be no illusions about the reality of the situation that we face, nor the pressing need to start looking at making savings in areas that we have previously tried to protect."A spokesman for Caerphilly council said: "We are going to have to make some very difficult decisions in the wake of this extremely tough budget announcement."Even though the situation is very challenging, Caerphilly is in a good position compared to some other Welsh local authorities and this is largely down to the sound financial strategy adopted by the council over the last few years."Councillors will consider the budget settlement on 23 October.The council needs to try and bridge a budget shortfall of £125m over the next three years.Among its plans, it will reassess the way grants are awarded to ensure there is greater fairness in funding decisions and better service delivery based on requirements and community priorities.The council currently provides £2.7m in grant funding to a wide range of third sector organisations but says many grants are historic with no clear indication of strategic need.It is considering new ways of delivering services which include merging departments and collaborating with other councils.However it has warned that it is considering "drastic measures" such as service reduction and even ending some services completely.Its budget proposals are being prepared over the next few months before going out to public consultation.Next week, all members of the council will be invited to discuss around 60 proposals for efficiency savings to bridge the funding gap Carmarthenshire faces, before a large-scale public consultation is launched.Council leader Kevin Madge has already warned people to brace themselves for change, and has acknowledged that members will be faced with making tough and unpopular decisions over the coming months.Now, he is calling on all 74 members of the council as well as community and voluntary groups to work together to ensure as many services and jobs can be protected."This is one of the toughest settlements we've ever had," he said."We've already tightened our belts and made significant efficiency savings in the last few years, which is why it's going to be hard to cut back further."However, by working together with our communities, we will stand a better chance of protecting front-line services and jobs."I also call on every member of council to work together, similar to how they've worked together in Welsh government where they've put their political differences aside to move forward and set a budget."Earlier, a spokesman for Carmarthenshire council said: "We are holding an elected members seminar shortly which will set out the council's financial position, and give members the opportunity to discuss and consider up to 40 separate options and proposals for savings."Over the coming months, consultation will also involve the general public, local businesses and stakeholder groups."Until this exercise has been undertaken, we can't say exactly what services will be affected."A spokesman for Ceredigion said: "Unfortunately, no decisions have been made."In a report, the local authority said: "Conwy's financial framework for the period 2012 to 2017 highlighted an extremely challenging financial landscape which predicted an annual resource shortfall of around £5m per year for the financial years covered, even after council tax increases of around 5% per year."Indeed 2014/2015 projected a shortfall of £4.5m with warnings that 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 were likely to be at similar levels ie 'more of the same'."A spokesperson for Denbighshire Council said: "Denbighshire council has been expecting a difficult budget settlement and we have been preparing for it."The reduction of 4.6% is on the more severe end of what we have been planning for and it will require the council to take some difficult decisions."Options for reductions are now being developed for elected members to consider during their deliberations over the next few months."Final decisions on the 2014/15 budget will be taken in the new year."The council is committed to delivering excellent services and maximising efficiencies from everything it does will be its key response to this settlement."On the positive side the council welcomes the apparent relaxation of 'ring fencing' rules for a number of grants and budget areas."We haven't had the time to analyse the figures carefully yet, but it seems that the council will be able to look for efficiencies and savings from a wider area than was possible in 2013/14 and this is to be welcomed."The council's initial reaction to the local settlement is:Council leader Aaron Shotton said: "The provisional settlement is as predicted. The task ahead is to plan significant and rapid change within the council to make major savings to balance the books for 2014-15 and protect local services to the best of our ability."It is important that we are not hit by any reductions in the specific grants from Welsh government which support day to day services from education to recycling."These grants are normally confirmed long after the settlement and we do not want unexpected 'devil in the detail'."We cannot absorb a double financial 'hit' in a matter of months."Flintshire is a stable and well performing council - we now have a major job on our hands to hold that position."The council is looking to reorganise and reduce the cost and complexity of management as well as a phased reduction in workforce numbers.A spokesman said before the budget announcement: "The way the council will have to change and become even more modern will remain underpinned by protecting and developing the most important public services in communities, being as modern and high performing as we can in customer services and being as efficient and cost effective as possible."A spokesman for Gwynedd Council said: "At present, we estimate that we could be facing a £16m funding shortfall in 2014/15."Thanks to long-term financial planning, we have already identified over £6m of savings to help bridge this gap, and we estimate that other potential measures identified will lead to an additional saving of around £6m."This means that we will need to deliver a further £4m during the year."We are looking at a number of possible options to mitigate the demand for our services, and carefully weighing up the possible savings that could be achieved against the potential negative impact upon the county's residents."BBC Wales news website is awaiting a response from Merthyr Tydfil council.Peter Fox, leader of Monmouthshire County Council, said: "We are disappointed but not surprised that we have seen a provisional cut of 4.4% in our annual settlement from the Welsh government."Although it is slightly worse than we'd been led to believe, we have for some time been planning for a cut of around this level."We have managed a significant year-on-year decline in our funding for some time now, against a backdrop of our being Wales' lowest funded council per head of population."We have already taken significant steps toward addressing this shortfall in our funding."We are currently meeting directly with our communities, and cabinet has already mandated officers to explore proposed savings of £6.5m, although we are mindful that this would not be sufficient to meet next year's cut."We will continue to work hard to address next year's shortfall and the projected shortfall of £23m over the next four years."The council has already outlined plans to make £6.5m in savings and will hold a number of public engagement meetings in the county over the next two weeks.Among the areas where savings could be made is school transport. The authority is considering reviewing its school transport arrangements based on nearest school policy.It is also considering reducing grants to the third sector and transforming adult social care and children's services.Reductions to cleaning rounds and gritting schedules could also be introduced as well as street lights being switched off.Five public consultation sessions are to be held about the matter and the council has scheduled that the proposals will be concluded by the end of November 2013 with a special cabinet meeting on 18 December.A spokesperson for the council said: "We will be looking at the details of the draft settlement and preparing a report for cabinet on our options for savings for members to decide upon."A spokesman said it had developed a forward financial plan which identified the need for £23m savings over the next four years (this is on top of £30m savings over the past four years).A report will be prepared for members regarding the specific impact of the settlement and what the options will be.A spokesman for the council said it also has a report out to consult on proposals for its library provision for savings of up to £238,000.A spokesperson for Newport City Council said that as expected it would "once again receive a cut to its revenue budget from Welsh government"."The council fully anticipated a reduction and has been making plans to change the way it delivers services with less money and an increased demand," said the spokesperson."The council recognises it still has to make significant savings and is faced with the task of redesigning public services as set out in the recently published 'Prospectus for Change'."The next few years will be extremely difficult and the impact on services will be profound."Residents can already submit their comments and ideas for improvement by emailing changing.services@newport.gov.uk."A full public consultation on budget proposals will be launched later this year."Reacting to the settlement cut leader Jamie Adams, said that his authority faced severe challenges in common with other councils in Wales."As I have previously said, we have to accept that local authorities are not immune from the cuts and we have a part to play in the belt-tightening process during these straitened times," he said."However, when we do make the difficult decisions that we will undoubtedly face, we will do our utmost to ensure that front-line services and the vulnerable are protected as much as possible."I believe that as we are an authority which is on a firm, financial footing we are able to meet and resolve these challenges."The council's cabinet will be receiving a comprehensive report on the implications of the Budget at its 4th November meeting."The council has said it will be moving to fortnightly black bin bag collections to save £500,000 a year.It is also planning to reduce the number of public toilets it is responsible for - there are currently 93 public toilets in Pembrokeshire costing the council £1.5m a year to run. Seven are earmarked for closure.Mr Adams has said it was inevitable that Welsh government cuts in funding to local government would have repercussions on the authority's future spending."We have to accept that, as a local authority, we too have to play a part in the belt-tightening process during these straitened times."However, when we do make the difficult decisions that we will undoubtedly face, we will do our utmost to ensure that front-line services and the vulnerable are protected as much as possible," he said.Powys says it will face a cut in funding of nearly £9m in the next financial year along with increased "service pressures" of £11m leaving the county facing a funding shortfall of £20m for 2014/15.Leader David Jones said: "Powys has once again fared badly with its annual budget allocation with a 4.6% cut in funding - jointly the largest in Wales and well above the Welsh average cut of 3.5%."Powys has experienced below Welsh average funding for five out of the last six years and that poor funding trend has continued greatly increasing the pressure on providing local services. There are also early indications that there could be a further cut of around 2% in 2015/16."We are grateful that there has been some protecting provided by Welsh government otherwise the news could have been even worse."This year we received £190.6m external funding from Welsh government but that figure will be reduced to £182.2m next year. Added to that the council is facing increasing demand for services and unavoidable costs that could add a further £11m added to our operating costs."Providing viable public services with such reduced budgets will be a huge challenge, particularly since the majority of our funding is used for 'protected services' - education and adult social care."The remaining service areas such as highways, waste, leisure and the arts, although hugely appreciated, will have to bear the brunt of very difficult budget decisions."We have already been forced to take unpopular decisions in response to the chill wind of austerity measures but I am afraid the coming years will see far more difficult debates and I hope that Powys residents understand our difficulties."Council leader Anthony Christopher said: "Considering how significantly public sector funding to Wales has been cut by the UK government a settlement of this nature was inevitable."This council has already taken the very difficult step of bringing forward options on how we bridge the significant gap in funding we now face and is due to consider initial proposals next week."Based on the provisional information released today, as predicted the level of savings we will be faced with making over the next four years will now be above our original indication of £56m."Because the Welsh government has done its utmost to protect Wales' public services from the worst of the UK government's cuts, this is the first financial year that 'all' our communities will really feel the pain and the realities of the UK governments public sector funding cuts."Despite the severity of the decisions already being considered it is clear that further and even tougher decisions around the range and level of services we offer will need to be taken in the coming months."In my 25 years in local government I have never had to consider such a bleak outlook for public services."My colleagues and I know fully how the decisions we will need to take will impact upon the communities we represent, but faced with such significant reductions in funding we simply have no alternatives."In the coming weeks therefore the cabinet will be forced to consider further reductions and significant changes to the services we currently provide."Very clearly the austerity measures of the UK government are biting and the effects of Wales' funding being reduced by £1.6bn are set to become very apparent in our local communities."Cabinet members at Rhondda Cynon Taf Council are due to meet next week to consider the first phase of a programme of cuts.Under the proposals children in RCT will start full-time school a year later than they currently do in a bid to save £4.5m a year.Closing 14 of 26 libraries in RCT could save £800,000 per year, while closing 10 out of 19 day centres could save £600,000 per year.Proposed changes to youth services could save £2.2m while £300,000 could be saved by ending the delivery of meals on wheels at the weekend.Swansea council said the headline settlement figure of a 3.1% reduction in funding was broadly in line with expectations.The council said it would be studying the Welsh government's figures in detail but expected overall that it would have to make savings of £45m by 2017.Apart from a reduced settlement, the council said it was also facing a range of funding pressures including rising customer expectation and increasing demand for adult and children's services.Rob Stewart, cabinet member for finance, said: "We've already been consulting with local residents and most people I've talked to understand we are in tough times and the budget issue is a difficult position not of the council's making."This isn't simply about trying to save money. We have an opportunity to transform the council by finding better ways of doing things to improve the services we provide."He added: "No decisions have been made yet because we are consulting with residents, stakeholders and staff to consider their views."Swansea has been holding a consultation with residents called Sustainable Swansea.Detailed budget proposals will be set out in December.The council predicts it requires savings of at least a further £40m over the next four years.Cuts to school transport service, black bag collections and garden waste collections are being considered.It has said making those savings is "no longer a case of trimming the edges" and has warned of difficult and uncomfortable decisions to be made.The executive member for resources, Councillor Anthony Hunt, said: "We must look at the local services we provide, consider our priorities and look at how they impact on our desire to protect the most vulnerable people in our communities."Instead of burying our heads in the sand or making decisions behind closed doors, we want to be honest and open with people about the difficult situation and work together to find solutions."We want to hear from residents about which services they value most, what they could do without and what they'd be prepared to pay more for."The council plans a number of joint working opportunities with neighbouring authorities and health boards including establishing jointly funded posts as part of its drive to plug the £25.7m funding shortfall.It says any targets set will be extremely challenging for services.It is due to meet to discuss proposals.Councillor Malcolm King OBE, Lead Member for Policy, Finance, Performance and Governance said: "There is no disguising the fact that this is very bad news for Wrexham."In previous years, the council has made millions of pounds of savings year on year and has strived to protect schools and social care."But the scale of the reductions contained in this announcement is unprecedented. It is very different to what the council have been planning for just a few months ago."Unfortunately the funding situation looks bleak for quite a few years to come."Although the challenge to find around £13m of cuts next year is very daunting, the longer term challenges are even more difficult."With a shortfall of at least £34m over the next five years, Wrexham has pledged to take a "fundamental look" at all of its work so resources can be used as "effectively as possible".The council has said: "This includes reprioritising and reducing services, ceasing services, considering alternative delivery models, working more effectively and efficiently with existing and new partners and eliminating waste."Reshaping is also to be focused on improving services as well as enabling delivery at a lower cost."It plans to take a "package approach" to reshaping services saying that there was not a single project or single solution that will deliver the value of reductions required.It said: "The overall approach is not about tinkering with what we currently do. There will be a requirement to take a fundamental look at areas like reprioritising and reducing services, ceasing some services altogether, considering alternative delivery models, working more effectively and efficiently with existing and new partners and eliminating waste. Reshaping is also to be focused on improving services as well as enabling delivery at a lower cost."Areas the council are looking at in its ethos of the need to work differently include:</body>

      <title>Methodist founder's bust honour</title>
      <description>Bronze bust on first sermon site of Methodist pioneer</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-24528268</url>

      <body>The man who sparked off almost 300 years of non-conformist religious tradition in Wales has been commemorated with a bronze bust.John Wesley, founder of the Methodist Church, preached to a crowd of around 400 at Devauden, Monmouthshire, on 15 October, 1739.A subsequent tour fuelled a religious revival in south Wales.The bust was unveiled in Devauden on the anniversary of his first Welsh sermon.Although Wesley himself favoured reform from within the Church of England, he was frequently shunned by the establishment.So his bust is on the village green, where he preached after being refused entry into the local church.The Reverend Lin Healey, deputy chair of the Methodist Church's Wales Synod, who unveiled the bust, said it was no surprise Wesley's attempts to democratise religion found particular resonance in Wales."At the very start of the industrial revolution Wales found itself with a growing working-class population who weren't being catered-for by the Church of England," she said."Traditionally, they'd been discouraged from studying or questioning the scripture, and preached to by a hierarchical system. But Wesley's message was that everyone, regardless of their status, could find evidence of God's spirit and salvation within them.""He encouraged ordinary labourers to study the bible and preach to each other in classes, so you begin to see the emergence of an educated poor."That's why it's no surprise that Welsh Methodism and liberalism developed hand-in-hand."Wesley's tour of south Wales in 1739 took in Abergavenny, Pontypool, Usk, Newport and Cardiff.Wesley was ordained into the Church of England in 1725 and remained a member until his death in 1791.However, his religious views were heavily influenced by his contact with German and French non-conformist clergy during his missionary work in the American colonies.In May 1738 he claimed to have experienced a profound discovery of God in his heart which prompted him to undertake a UK-wide tour to preach his revelation."Wesley was a devout believer in the sanctity of the Bible, he called himself a one book man, even though he was actually extremely well read.""But his skill was to be able to interpret the scriptures and preach them in terms which were readily accessible," Ms Healey said."His 44 sermons remain at the heart of the training all us Methodist ministers undergo, and the basic premise of all of them is to discover God's love by sinning as little as possible against as few as possible, whilst always going the extra mile to do as much good for the widest number of people."The Wesley bust has been funded by donations from people in Devauden and local Methodist churches.</body>

      <title>Scottish Gas rise hits north hardest</title>
      <description>Scottish Gas customers in the north of Scotland are facing higher fuel bills than the rest of the UK, following a move by the energy firm to increase prices.</description>

      <body>Scottish Gas customers in the north of Scotland are facing higher bills than the rest of the UK, after a decision by owners Centrica to increase prices.The price rise will see an average UK dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2% from 23 November.But regional differences mean domestic customers living north of Perth will see an average rise of 11.2% - the biggest in the UK.Customers in the south of Scotland will see an average increase of 9.5%.The smallest rise is a 6.8% increase in the south west of England.Scotland's electricity transmission network is split between Scottish Hydro in the north and Scottish Power which holds the licence for central and southern Scotland.Centrica, which owns the British Gas and Scottish Gas brands, said its regional price differences reflected variations in the network costs it was obliged to pay to the transmission companies around the country.Rival SSE has already announced an 8.2% increase in bills from 15 November.The Centrica move, which will affect nearly eight million people in the UK, includes an average 8.4% rise in gas prices and a 10.4% increase in electricity prices.The company said it "understands the frustration" of prices rising faster than incomes. The average annual household bill will go up by £123.On average, UK customers will see a dual-fuel bill increase to £1,444 a year.Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%.Energy regulator Ofgem said prices were determined by suppliers competing in the British energy market and it was up to them to justify their prices and profits to consumers.An Ofgem spokeswoman said: "Any price rise will not be welcomed by customers which is why it is important that Scottish Gas fully explain the reasons for the increase."Energy suppliers should be doing all they can to minimise the impact of these rising costs on energy bills by ensuring they are managing their costs as efficiently as possible."Suppliers must also ensure they are giving customers all the advice and help they need to save money on their energy bills, for example through energy efficiency."</body>

      <title>Salmond to hold Grangemouth talks</title>
      <description>Scotland's First Minister is expected to hold talks with both sides involved in the dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant.</description>

      <body>Scotland's first minister is to hold talks with both sides involved in the dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant.It is understood Alex Salmond earlier spoke to officials from the plant's operators Ineos.Mr Salmond confirmed in his opening address at the SNP conference in Perth he will hold further talks with both Ineos and the Unite union.The facility remains shut down despite Unite calling off a planned strike.The first minister told delegates at the SNP conference that officials from both Ineos and Unite had been quoted in the media as saying they believed Grangemouth had a "great future".He added: "What I will attempt to do is to take and build on that belief, and say to both Unite and Ineos that only by negotiation, cooperation and agreement can we get an effective resolution."We believe, and Scotland believes and expects, that Grangemouth as an industrial facility has a great future."Mr Salmond left the first day of the conference in Perth for the discussions in Edinburgh."Governments can't make agreements" in such disputes but can "encourage the circumstances in which agreements can be found", he told party delegates.Ineos said shutting down the Grangemouth complex had cost the company £20m so far.It has put proposals over pay and pensions to workers at the site, which has 1,400 employees and many more contractors.A letter outlining the proposed changes was being couriered to employees on Friday.BBC Scotland has been given details of the offer, which includes freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016.The shift allowance would also be reduced from £10,000 to £7,500 per year, while pensions would be transferred from a final salary to a defined benefits scheme.The company added that no job cuts were expected.It has asked for an answer to the proposals by Monday, and has said shareholders will discuss the complex's future on Tuesday.The company has said Grangemouth is "financially distressed" and must reduce costs.It has also asked for guarantees that no further strike action will be held by workers.Unite claimed the company had told staff they could lose their jobs and be reemployed on poorer terms unless they agreed to give up their final salary pension, and accept pay freezes and pay cuts, by 18:00 on Monday.Pat Rafferty, Unite's Scottish secretary, said: "This is cynical blackmail from a company that is putting a gun to the heads of its loyal workforce to slash pay, pensions and jobs."We are considering taking legal action over the company's menacing tactics and urge members not to be threatened into signing their livelihoods away."It is increasingly clear that the company is deliberately generating a dispute and hiding behind fancy accounting to attack its own workforce."On Wednesday, Ineos said Grangemouth "is shut and remains shut", despite Unite calling off a 48-hour strike that had been due to begin on Sunday.The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans.Ineos claims it is unable to immediately restart the complex, which had been shut down ahead of the planned strike.A spokesman said: "The Grangemouth site is three times the size of the City of London and it is an incredibly complex system of manufacturing plants all connected by miles of pipes carrying highly flammable materials."Shutting down the site and restarting again is not like switching the lights off and on. It takes days to shut down properly and it takes weeks to bring it back up again."When Unite forced us to shut down in 2008 we had two major incidents and it took eight weeks to get back to normal. In the first incident, we had a large fire on a compressor. If our employees had been close to the area then there would have been serious injuries or even fatalities."</body>

      <body>A man has admitted biting off part of his cousin's ear in a row over a grave plot.Andrew Montgomery, 34, from Dundee, carried out the assault before chasing Dean Montgomery, who was clutching his severed lobe, down the street.The assault left the victim needing extensive reconstructive surgery to create a new ear as the detached part could not be saved.Sheriff Kenneth McGowan deferred sentence until Friday.The court heard how the assault came after a family dispute over a grave plot - with various exchanges between family members over two weeks before the attack.Andrew Montgomery then approached his cousin on Dundee's Dens Road, on 30 July last year, and a fight broke out.Both men fell to the ground, with Dean Montgomery becoming aware that his accused was biting his ear.Fiscal depute Trina Sinclair said: "The accused had a grip of his ear in his teeth and the complainer was afraid to pull away, in case his ear became detached."He was then aware of part of his ear falling to the ground."He picked it up at this time and had it in his hand."Dean Montgomery then managed to get to his feet and ran back down Dens Road - towards Alexander Street.Miss Sinclair added: "The accused caught up with the complainer and knocked him to the ground and repeatedly punched him on the head and body."Members of the public who witnessed the attack then called police - with Andrew Montgomery making off in an orange Vauxhall Corsa.His cousin was taken to Dundee's Ninewells Hospital where he needed 24 stitches to his ear.The amputated part of the lobe was not deemed fit for re-attachment.Dean Montgomery then had to go through lengthy and painful reconstructive surgery to give him a new ear.The court was told that two rib cartilages were harvested from his chest and carved into the shape of the missing part of his ear.They were then covered with a skin flap taken from behind his other ear.Miss Sinclair submitted a victim impact statement to the court detailing the effect of the attack on Dean Montgomery.Andrew Montgomery pleaded guilty on indictment to a charge of assaulting his cousin, to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement.Jack Brown, defending, said there had been a long-standing family dispute and that Dean Montgomery "was not the shrinking violet in the impact statement".Sheriff Kenneth McGowan deferred sentence until Friday for a full plea in mitigation to be heard from Andrew Montgomery's lawyer.</body>

      <body>A dental tycoon who allowed unqualified staff to give children unnecessary treatment at clinics across the west of Scotland has been suspended.George Campbell, owner of the All 1 Smile chain of clinics, also repeatedly failed to check the qualifications of staff who carried out orthodontic work.He has practices in Glasgow, East Kilbride, Greenock, Cumbernauld, Hamilton and Kilmarnock.Campbell has been suspended for nine months following a tribunal.The General Dental Council (GDC) heard how Campbell had mistakenly extracted patients' healthy teeth and referred children for hospital surgery which they did not need.He was referred to the GDC in September 2011 following a series of complaints that were made about the treatment of 30 patients spanning over a decade.The tribunal was told that between July 2001 and August 2011, Campbell repeatedly referred children for unnecessary extraction and surgery.They also heard how he had failed to ensure staff were fully qualified, with up to 18 employees carrying out treatment before they had completed their orthodontic training.It was reported an employee had even provided orthodontic treatment without having any dental qualifications or training.Stewart Goulding, chair of the conduct and competence committee, who made the decision said: "There are a number of grave failings in his clinical practice highlighted by the findings."There are, particularly in the areas of radiography, treatment planning and treatment undertaken, and his employment of unregistered and unqualified staff."Taking these wide-ranging failings together with his departures from specific guidance and standards within the profession, the committee had little difficulty in determining that the facts found proved amounted to serious misconduct"Giving evidence, Campbell had told the GDC there was a lack of guidance from the regulatory body when it came to his newly-qualified staff.He said: "There was no real guidance or supervision so we always aimed to provide the training and guidance ourselves."I was supervising new staff on a daily basis and with any queries on the supervision or tasks we would phone the GDC to check."Campbell had denied the bulk of the allegations against him at the hearing in London.A series of charges were not proven including a failure to ensure patient numbers could be adequately served at his clinics.</body>

      <body>SNP leader Alex Salmond opened his party's conference by saying he believed people would choose the "hope of yes" rather than the "fears of no".The first minister's speech comes with the Scottish independence referendum 11 months away.He told delegates in Perth that Thursday 18 September 2014 was Scotland's "date with destiny".On that day, voters will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country".Mr Salmond said that the people of Scotland had their biggest opportunity to choose a better future.He told delegates on the first day of the four-day conference: "I believe that people will choose the hope of a yes vote, rather than the fear offered by no."And no-one now denies the reality that Scotland has got what it takes to be a successful, independent country."We know that 'project fear' - as people in the no campaign christened it - will say anything to talk down Scotland's abilities."They peddle nonsense such as mobile phone roaming charges after independence, the threat to annex Faslane, no whisky in embassies - nonsense which even they are forced to retract."The party leader went on to say that people in the no camp could not deny the economic viability and potential of "people-talented, resource-rich Scotland".He added that per head of population, Scotland had more top universities than any other country; was the EU's largest oil producer and had a thriving creative industries sector.Mr Salmond said: "When even the most bitter opponents of Scottish independence agree that Scotland has got what it takes, then it's clear that the only thing people have to fear is 'project fear' itself."At the start of his conference speech, Mr Salmond addressed the on-going dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant.He confirmed that he would be holding further talks with both the facility's operator Ineos and the Unite union.The facility remains shut down despite Unite calling off a planned strike.</body>

      <body>A watchdog has completed its investigation into a police force's handling of a complaint from the family of a man who died 16 years ago.Kevin McLeod's body was found in Wick harbour in February 1997. His death was treated as accidental.His family claim officers were instructed by the procurator fiscal to treat it as potential murder.It is understood Police Scotland has now been asked to examine whether this was the case.The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC) confirmed it had completed its review of the family's complaint.A spokesperson said the commissioner had made a single recommendation. Police Scotland said it was considering the action recommended.Northern Constabulary, which was merged with other forces to form Police Scotland, treated Mr McLeod's death as accidental.His family, however, have consistently criticised the force over its investigation.Their most recent complaint centres on the claim that the procurator fiscal instructed the force to carry out a murder investigation.In 2007, the Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland (PCCS) said Northern Constabulary behaved with "institutional arrogance" in the way it handled earlier complaints from Mr McLeod's parents, Hugh and June McLeod.It ordered the then chief constable, Ian Latimer, to apologise in person to his relatives, which the senior officer did.Following the latest development, a spokeswoman for the PIRC said: "The commissioner's review of this case is now complete and a report has been sent to the family and Police Scotland."The commissioner made a single recommendation in his report, which is for Police Scotland to implement."A police spokesperson said: "We have received the report from the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner and are currently considering the recommendation that has been made."</body>

      <body>An island beer maker has announced plans to open a brewery, hotel and visitor centre on the mainland.Isle of Arran Brewery said the centre in the village of St Fillans, Perthshire, will cost at least £250,000 to develop and lead to about 20 jobs.The former Drummond Hotel will be converted into three restaurants, two bars and a shop, with hotel accommodation for up to 30 guests.The brewery aims to attract 30,000 visitors to the site in the first year.It wants the new facilities to complement its existing visitor centre in Brodick, Arran, which draws about 20,000 visitors annually.The new site is due to open at the start of next summer.Isle of Arran Brewery managing director Gerald Michaluk said: "The St Fillans site offers the brewery the chance to diversify and expand, producing a range of fresh and exciting brews in a new region of Scotland."The new premises will be situated on a stunning site overlooking Loch Earn and we hope to add to the magic of St Fillans with some island charm."The St Fillans project is being part-financed by VisitScotland and Bank of Scotland to promote tourism before major events next year such as the Commonwealth Games and Ryder Cup.Last year, the brewery bought Rosebank Distillery near Falkirk as part of expansion plans.The deeds of the site say it cannot be used for distilling until 2017 when a "micro-distillery" could be opened.</body>

      <body>Prince William has hosted his first investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace.Among those honoured were Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, who was presented with an OBE.It represented an extension of the Duke of Cambridge's public duties after he left the Royal Air Force last month.Standing in for the Queen, William presented awards recognising achievements in a wide range of fields to recipients from across the UK.Andy Murray was on time for the ceremony despite tweeting that he had been held up by a random drugs test."In the middle of a drug test hahaha I'm goin to be late!!!" he wrote.Vicar Of Dibley producer Jon Plowman was also made an OBE by the prince, while broadcaster Aled Jones became an MBE for services to music, broadcasting and charity. Conservationist Helen Butler received an MBE.Around 25 such ceremonies are held every year, either in the ballroom at Buckingham Palace, the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh or at Windsor Castle.The majority are hosted by the Queen but some investitures are carried out by the Prince of Wales or Princess Royal.Prince William already carries out engagements connected to his charitable interests and those of the Royal Foundation he is joint patron of with the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.Following the end of a military career that has occupied the prince since January 2006, the full shape of his public duties has yet to be decided.The next year has been described as "transitional" by palace officials as the duke prepares to become a full-time royal.He plans to expand his conservation work, particularly on the protection of endangered species, through his Royal Foundation.</body>

      <body>Leading philanthropists from across the world have been recognised for their work at a special ceremony in the Scottish Parliament.Scottish entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter was among six people to receive the Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy.The medal is awarded biannually to those who use their private wealth and business acumen for public good.They were granted the award for their support for education, science, entrepreneurship and the arts.Sir Tom is only the second Scot to receive the award, after Kwik-Fit founder Sir Tom Farmer.Other recipients of the medal this year included the founder of the second largest telecoms business in Russia, Dr Dmitry Zimin.American hedge fund manager Dr James Harris Simons - along with his wife, economist Dr Marilyn Simons - also received medals, as did Dame Janet Wolfson de Botton on behalf of the Wolfson family, which set up the Wolfson Foundation.The foundation was named after Glasgow-born business leader and philanthropist Sir Isaac Wolfson, who died in 1991.The daughter of Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, chairwoman of the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development, accepted a medal on her mother's behalf.The ceremony has only been held outside the United States once before - also at the Scottish Parliament in 2005.In that same year, Sir Tom Hunter was knighted for services to entrepreneurship and philanthropy.The son of an Ayrshire shop owner, he started his first business selling sports shoes from the back of a van with a £5,000 loan from his father.He later built his Sports Division business into Europe's largest independent sports retailer and eventually sold it in 1998 for £290m.Sir Tom and his wife Lady Marion went on to establish The Hunter Foundation (THF).Previous medal recipients include the Rockefeller Family, the Gates Family, the Sainsbury Family, the Cadbury Family, George Soros and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.Holyrood's Presiding Officer Tricia Marwick said: "Earlier this week, the parliament opened an exhibition exploring the legacy of Andrew Carnegie's philanthropy over the past 100 years."Today, we welcomed modern philanthropists to our chamber, people who have followed in Carnegie's footsteps and used their wealth to make a positive difference to society."I am sure Carnegie would have enjoyed today's ceremony and I hope the stories of the medallists will help inspire the next generation of philanthropists."This year's ceremony also marked the centennial of the establishment of the Carnegie UK Trust.The trust is named after Dunfermline-born industrialist Andrew Carnegie, whose family emigrated to the US from a life of poverty in Scotland in 1848.He made his fortune in steel, becoming the world's richest man, and eventually gave away billions of pounds to fund a network of global foundations.</body>

      <body>A national service which has saved the lives of hundreds of children has been recognised with an award.Yorkhill Hospital's Extracorporeal Life Support Service, or ECLS, has used the latest technology to treat almost 500 children, half of them newborn babies.The service was one of the first in the UK to see the potential of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation, or 'ECMO' machines, to save lives.ECMO machines replace the function of the heart and lungs, giving medics a vital window of opportunity to treat patients who are seriously ill.The technology hit the headlines during the swine flu epidemic in 2009 when it was used to help those whose lungs were failing.Two year old Matthew Wilson was close to death when he was transferred to the service at just three hours old.He had breathed in fluid and faeces in the womb and his body couldn't absorb enough oxygen."I was under general anaesthetic so I didn't actually see him when he was born," said his mum Clare Wilson, "but apparently he wasn't breathing.""They told me it was one of the worst cases they'd seen."Matthew was on an ECMO machine for five days."Although it looks really horrific at the start, it does work," said dad Ian Wilson. "It was very scary but we saw he was on the mend and we grew more confident as the days went on."Matthew made a complete recovery.ECMO machines take blood from the body, usually via a cannula inserted directly into the heart by a cardiac surgeon, and oxygenate it before returning it to the body.Nearly half of a baby's entire volume of blood is oxygenated every minute."Basically, it gives us time," said paediatric surgeon Carl Davis."We can then make the baby better or the baby's body has time to get better. We can give antibiotics or physiotherapy to clear out meconium from the lungs, as Matthew had."So far ECMO machines have been used on 116 babies with the same condition as Matthew, Meconium Aspiration Syndrome.The survival rate is twice as high as would normally be expected, with 98% of babies recovering.Overall nearly 500 children with various conditions have been treated since the service was set up in 1992.Although many of these children are critically ill, the survival rate is 80%.The service is available to children all over Scotland, and is based at Glasgow's Royal Hospital for Sick Children.It has been awarded an award for "Excellence in Life Support" by the Extracorporeal Life Support Organisation."It's a team award," said Mr Davis."We're striving for excellence and it's a huge team involving nurses, physios, profusionists and people in labs providing blood tests ...and I'll have forgotten a whole bunch of people who are also involved."</body>

      <body>Cells for vulnerable prisoners at Scotland's largest prison present an "unacceptable risk" and urgently need upgraded, inspectors have found.Chief Inspector of Prisons David Strang did welcome a 17% drop in inmates at Barlinnie in Glasgow and also praised the support for vulnerable prisoners.But Mr Strang said little progress had been made on improving what are termed safer cells.The July inspection examined conditions for its 1,225 inmates.The Scottish government said action plans had been put in place to deal with the issues raised by the report.The safer cells at HMP Barlinnie contain features which could be used by prisoners attempting to take their own life, known as ligature points, a review of conditions at the jail found.Mr Strang said a 2011 recommendation that they be upgraded was not met by the time of a follow-up inspection in July this year."This presents HMP Barlinnie and the SPS (Scottish Prison Service) with an unacceptable degree of risk," the inspector said."I strongly urge the Scottish Prison Service to address this issue as a matter of some urgency."Mr Strang, who succeeded Brigadier Hugh Munro as chief inspector in June, described the prison's reception area as unfit for purpose and said it should be replaced.Barlinnie was built in 1882 to house 1,021 inmates but held 1,225 at the time of inspection.A drop from 1,477 in May 2011 was due in part to the opening of HMP Low Moss in Bishopbriggs, to the north of Glasgow.But Mr Strang said he feared the return of overcrowding with the closure of two prisons in the north east of Scotland."While still operating beyond the design capacity, this drop in numbers has provided prisoners with greater access to a number of basic opportunities such as regular showers, education classes, library services, physical activities and more time out of cell," he said."I am, however, concerned that this situation may deteriorate if, when HMP Aberdeen and HMP Peterhead close, HMP Barlinnie is required to provide the temporary accommodation for those prisoners displaced, pending the opening of the new prison at HMP Grampian."Barlinnie mainly holds prisoners waiting for court appearances and those who have been sentenced and are waiting for a transfer to a long-term jail.Only two of five recommendations made following the 2011 review were found to have been met in July - a reduction in visitor waiting times and improvements to risk management meetings.Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill said: "The improvements in the Day Care Unit and first night in custody centres are to be welcomed, as is the fact that the SPS have addressed the majority of actions identified at the last inspection of HMP Barlinnie."Action plans have been put in place to resolve the outstanding issues such as the cells, reception areas, purposeful activity and transfer of prisoners from HMS Peterhead and Aberdeen and good progress is being made."</body>

      <body>Highland Council is running a survey of businesses and organisations affected by closures of the A890 Stromeferry bypass in Wester Ross.The eight mile (12km) stretch of road has been repeatedly shut by landslides.The council is examining several possible solutions. These include a tunnel, a bridge or for traffic to use a nearby railway when not in use.The survey seeks information on the reasons why companies and organisations rely on the bypass.Questions include how many employees use it to get to work and how important it is to firms for delivering goods.The bypass on the A890 in Wester Ross has been closed by large landslides in the last two years.The A890 helps to connect Lochcarron to Plockton, with its high school, and also to Kyle.The road links up from the A896, the main road through Lochcarron, and runs down the side of Loch Carron.When the bypass is closed, drivers face having to take a 140-mile (225km) diversion, instead of the usual 18 miles (29km) from Lochcarron to Plockton.It was shut for three days in December last year when almost 20 tonnes of debris came down.In December 2011, the bypass was shut by a landslip which involved 100 tonnes of rock.This left it blocked for four months and sparked a Highland Council investigation into how to prevent further disruption.A small car ferry, a pleasure cruiser and train services were all utilised in an effort to ease the travel headache for locals.Rubber mats were also later laid on a railway running alongside the bypass so road traffic could use the track.Highland Council is not expected to make a decision on a preferred permanent solution until next summer.</body>

      <body>Oil and Gas UK has commissioned new research into the economic contribution of the industry.The industry body has appointed EY to assess the billions of pounds the supply chain generates annually.Oil and Gas UK said the study would use data from more 1,000 companies, with the results expected to be released in March next year.UK Business and Energy Minister Michael Fallon said gaining further insight was important.He said: "The UK's oil and gas supply chain is highly robust with the potential to contribute significantly to economic growth over the coming decades."Gaining even further insight into its strengths and capabilities will only help to support the ongoing work of our joint oil and gas industrial strategy to create new jobs, encourage investment and increase exports."Oil and Gas UK's business development director Stephen Marcos Jones said: "We have a world-leading global supply chain based here in the UK which we believe contributes £5-6bn every year to the Exchequer and exports £7bn worth of goods and services."It is important we continue to make the UK an attractive place for these companies to stay."A recent report said a severe shortage in qualified staff will push the average wage in the oil and gas industry up by 15% this year to £73,600.The forecast came in a survey of more than 2,200 oil and gas companies by recruitment firm Oilandgaspeople.com.</body>

In a crazy period, Lavery hit the woodwork before having a penalty saved by Elgin keeper Raymond Jellema after Steven Notman was felled.Elgin showed Lavery how it was done when Paul Harkins converted from the spot - after Michael Dunlop brought down Sutherland - to complete a full comeback for the guests.</body>

      <body>Police have released the descriptions of three men and a van they hope to trace in connection a missing sculpture that is said to be worth £3m.The bronze piece by Henry Moore which was stolen from the Glenkiln Sculpture Park in Lincluden Estate near Shawhead.Police said a blue Ford Transit-style van and its three occupants were seen at the park on two occasions before the artwork was taken last week.The men have been described as being in their 20s or 30s.Police Scotland said they were of average height and build. One had ginger, shaven hair and was wearing a red or orange waterproof jacket.The men had a collie-type dog and the van was described as being of an unusual shade of blue.Police said the men may have had legitimate business in the area and have appealed for them to contact the force.Det Insp Colin Burnie, the officer leading the enquiry, said Police Scotland was "delighted" with the public response to the investigation.He added: "We now require further help to identify this blue van and occupants and would again ask the public to call us if they have any information which may help us."The missing sculpture, called the Standing Figure, is believed to be worth up to £3m according to police.It was one of four pieces by Moore at the Glenkiln Sculpture Park.The remaining major pieces at the site have since been moved into secure storage for their safety.Standing Figure is among a number of works by the abstract artist, who died in 1986 aged 88, to be targeted by thieves in recent years.Last November, a Henry Moore sculpture worth up to £500,000 was taken from the Henry Moore Foundation at Much Hadham, Hertfordshire.Two men later admitted stealing The Sundial sculpture, which they then sold for £46.</body>

      <body>Renewable energy developer RES UK has welcomed a decision by the Scottish government to clear its plans for a wind farm in the Scottish Borders.RES had lodged an appeal over its 15-turbine Penmanshiel wind farm plans after a dispute with the local council.The company claimed Scottish Borders Council failed to decide on the firm's application within required timescales.The project was cleared after RES cut the number of turbines to 14 on visual impact grounds.Last year, Scottish Borders Council said it would "vigorously defend" the RES appeal.The company maintained the project had been in planning for nearly a year without a decision being made by the council.However, a council spokesman said at the time that RES had not responded to requests to adjust its plans.RES said on Wednesday that Penmanshiel would make an important contribution to Scotland's energy targets and deliver significant benefits to the local community.Project manager Ruth Elder said: "We are delighted with the positive decision made by the Scottish government today and we are pleased that through the removal of one turbine the project has been allowed to proceed."RES said the local community at Penmanshiel would receive a benefits package of £5,000 per installed megawatt once the wind farm is operational.</body>

      <description>Convicted murderers Peter Chester and George McGeoch lose their UK Supreme Court battle over the right to vote while in jail.</description>

      <body>The Supreme Court has dismissed appeals from two prisoners over the right to vote under European Union rules.Convicted murderers Peter Chester and George McGeoch had argued that EU law gave them a right to vote - even though they cannot under British law.Prime Minister David Cameron told the Commons that the ruling was "a great victory for common sense".The European Court of Human Rights has previously told the UK to end the blanket ban on prisoners voting.Parliament is considering legislation, but has not yet decided what to do.Following the Supreme Court's judgement, the BBC's legal correspondent Clive Coleman said: "Critically it ruled that EU law did not provide an individual right to vote, paralleling that recognised by the ECHR. Eligibility under EU law is a matter for national parliaments."Convicted prisoners in the UK are banned from voting on the basis that they have forfeited that right by breaking the law and going to jail.Successive governments have wanted to maintain that position but the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) said a blanket ban on prisoners voting was disproportionate.Peter Chester raped and strangled his niece in Blackpool in 1977 and was jailed for life for her murder. He has served his minimum term but the Parole Board has refused to release him because it says he is too dangerous.In 2008, he tried to join the electoral roll so that he could vote in the elections for the European Parliament. The Ministry of Justice said he could not until the law was changed.In the second case, George McGeoch, serving life in a Scottish prison, argued that EU law allowed him to vote in local and European elections.Although the ECHR has already told the UK to change the law, these two cases focused on whether prisoners as EU citizens have a right to vote even if Westminster says differently.Last year, the government conceded that it would have to change the law to allow some prisoners to vote.Ministers have published a draft bill which is being considered by Parliament. The proposals include limiting the vote to inmates who are serving either less than six months or four years.A further 2,352 inmates have tried to bring voting cases to the European Court of Human Rights. Those applications are adjourned while judges wait to see what Westminster does.</body>

      <body>A man who committed sexual offences on children for 22 years has been sent to prison.Paul Angus, 57, was found guilty of 15 charges including three rapes, attempted rape, sexual assault and indecency.The judge ordered that he serve at least five and a half years in prison before he can ask for parole.He will remain under supervision and on the sex offenders register for the remainder of his life.During an earlier three-week trial Angus claimed he was innocent and that his accusers were conspiring against him.Eight girls ranging from eight to 16 were attacked at various locations in and around Dundee.They were assaulted between December 1988 and May 2010. None of the victims can be named for their protection.The court had heard how three of the girls were plied with drink before Angus made them perform sex acts.He was also found guilty of attempting to pervert the course of justice by contacting one of his rape victims on 14 April last year by text message and attempting to persuade her not to contact police.Lord Burns said: "You used emotional blackmail which is truly despicable."After the trial last December, Lord Burns ordered in-depth reports to pave the way for a life sentence.An earlier hearing had to be cancelled at the last minute because Angus was taken to hospital complaining of chest pains.The judge noted that Angus had "groomed" the eight girls and appeared to have no appreciation of the effects his abuse had on them.He said: "You took advantage of them for your own depraved purposes."Lord Burns warned Angus that he would only be released when it is considered he no longer poses a risk.</body>

      <body>A football hooligan has had his jail sentence reduced by almost half on appeal.William Simpson, 20, will now serve five months instead of the original 11 month sentence imposed.He was jailed along with Lee Stewart, 20, after violent attacks on two Aberdeen fans following a match against Dundee.The 30 month football banning order given to him will remain in place.Simpson was jailed for 11 months and Stewart for three following their guilty pleas to charges of assault in July.The incidents happened after an SPL match between Aberdeen and Dundee at Dens Park on 29 December last year.Dundee Sheriff Court had been told how Simpson targeted Aberdeen fan Connor Leslie as he walked to the city's railway station.Simpson approached Mr Leslie and asked if he was an Aberdeen fan - and when he confirmed he was Simpson immediately started throwing punches, knocking his victim to the ground.He then continued punching and kicking Mr Leslie on the head and body.The attack was captured on CCTV and police were alerted.They then caught Stewart - a friend of Simpson's - attacking an unknown Aberdeen fan at the station, punching him on the back of the head.Reducing Simpson's sentence at the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh on Tuesday, judge Lady Smith said: "Although it was recognised that this was a serious matter and it was an offence that entitled the sheriff to impose a custodial sentence, it was not a sentence which ought in the circumstances to have been imposed."The appellant was a first offender. He was of low risk. He has given up drinking alcohol. He has no outstanding cases. He has shown genuine remorse."</body>

      <body>The impact of changes to housing benefit has been raised by First Minister Alex Salmond in talks with Prime Minister David Cameron.The leaders were meeting at the Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) in Downing Street, involving devolved administrations and the UK government.Mr Salmond said the "insanity" of the so-called bedroom tax was evident.New Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said it was clear there was a difference of views.The JMC meeting comes on the eve of the SNP's conference in Perth and less than a year before the referendum on Scottish independence.Mr Salmond raised the issue of the removal of the spare room subsidy, described by critics as the ''bedroom tax'', as well as youth unemployment and lottery funding.The meeting, chaired by the prime minister, also focused on the economy and illegal immigration as well as the Commonwealth Games and Ryder Cup, both being held in Scotland next year.Ahead of the talks, the first minister told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "There's a subject on the agenda called hot political issues and I can't think of anything hotter than the bedroom tax at the present moment."The insanity of the charge is becoming ever clearer by the day."Mr Salmond called for a review of the policy's impact and an indication of whether discretionary housing payments to mitigate its impact would continue next year.After the talks he said no agreement was reached on the reforms, adding: "The way to agree on the 'bedroom tax' is to get it reversed."Mr Carmichael, who also attended, had urged Mr Salmond not to take a negative approach and said he should be prepared to listen and learn.Mr Salmond said Lib Dem and Labour criticism of his views on the benefit changes was an example of other parties working in co-ordination with the Conservatives.Mr Carmichael told BBC Scotland that Mr Salmond must accept that there would be real problems in an independent Scotland running welfare reform and benefit payments.He said: "The question of a review is one where in fact I think we are rather ahead of the curve because the deputy prime minister announced in the House of Commons yesterday that the government itself is having a review of this, and indeed we review all policies as they go along."The Scottish secretary said difficult decisions had to be made to cut the deficit but if it was shown there were difficulties being caused by housing benefit changes the government would deal with them.Mr Carmichael said: "We always knew that this was going to be a very difficult policy to implement and we can see the obvious difficulties that come with it - we're not blind to that, I see it in my own constituency - that's why we've already put an enormous amount of money directly into local authorities so they can protect those that are going to be most vulnerable to the changes."Meanwhile, Labour's shadow Scottish Secretary, Margaret Curran, accused the Scottish government of "grandstanding".She said: "Prices are rising faster than wages, energy bills are still going up and the bedroom tax is continuing to hit people across the country."This is a rare opportunity to hammer out a plan to get to grips with this cost-of-living crisis."Instead of coming to London to tell David Cameron to bin the bedroom tax, Alex Salmond should be laying out a plan to stop it hitting Scots."Also attending the meeting were the deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, leaders of the Welsh and Northern Irish governments, Scottish Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop and Scottish Youth Employment Minister Angela Constance.</body>

      <body>Scottish Fisheries Secretary Richard Lochhead has asked the UK government to allow him to lead negotiations for Britain at crucial European quota talks, BBC Scotland has learned.It comes after last week's reshuffle by David Cameron saw George Eustice replace Richard Benyon as the UK fisheries minister.Mr Lochhead said it would be unfair to ask the new minister to head the talks.Allowable days at sea and mackerel quotas are among the main issues.Mr Lochhead said: "I will be doing everything I can to secure a favourable outcome for Scotland's fishermen."The EU fisheries council talks begin in Luxembourg on Thursday.Meanwhile, Scottish fishing industry leaders have welcomed "productive" talks with Mr Eustice and Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael.The Scottish Pelagic Fishermen's Association (SPFA) said the talks with the politicians covered a range of issues.These included the mackerel dispute with Iceland and the Faroe Islands.SPFA chief executive Ian Gatt said: "The meeting with Mr Eustice provided an early opportunity to brief the minister on the importance of the autumn negotiation period for the pelagic fleet."We stressed to Mr Eustice that newly-released mackerel scientific advice demonstrated that the stock was in robust health and that the UK should not feel pressurised into securing a deal which jeopardised the future of the UK pelagic fleet. "He added: "We also had a very useful briefing session with Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael, who expressed his full support for our industry."Mr Carmichael, the MP for Orkney and Shetland, replaced Michael Moore as secretary of state for Scotland in the recent reshuffle.</body>

      <body>Employment in Scotland has reached its highest level for five years, according to the latest official figures.Employment rose by 37,000 over the three months to August, and now stands at 2,548,000.The number of unemployed Scots fell by 3,000 to 201,000 over the summer period.Office for National Statistics (ONS) data showed the Scottish jobless rate at 7.3%, which is below the average of 7.7% for the whole of the UK.The number of unemployed in the UK fell by 18,000 in the June-August period to 2.49 million.Meanwhile, the number of people claiming Job Seeker's Allowance (JSA) in Scotland fell by 3,500 from August to 121,800 in September.The total was down by 18,200 on September 2012.The labour market statistics were released as figures showed that the Scottish economy grew for the fourth successive quarter, with growth of 0.6% during April to June.Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael described the labour market figures as "very encouraging".He said: "We continue to work hard to create the right conditions for sustained long-term employment in Scotland."As part of the UK, Scotland gains from tax reductions such as the new employment allowance of £2,000 per year, benefiting 70,000 businesses in Scotland by £100m in total, and taking 35,000 businesses out of employer national insurance contributions altogether."Finance Secretary Mr Swinney also welcomed the latest figures.He said: "These positive figures highlight the significant economic progress being made in Scotland."While times remain challenging, Scotland's economy has grown faster than the UK over the last year to quarter two, with employment now at a five-year high and the economy growing for the fourth consecutive quarter."On figures for employment, unemployment, inactivity and youth employment Scotland continues to perform better than the UK as a whole, with the employment rate amongst our young people continuing to be the highest of all UK nations."Scottish Labour's deputy finance spokeswoman, Jenny Marra, described the latest data as "encouraging" but argued that the Scottish government must demonstrate its commitment to long-term economic recovery "rather than gloating over minor shifts in the numbers each month".She added: "Over the last year there's been very little overall movement in the employment figures, except we know that more young people are out of work for longer and there's more women now looking for jobs."Scottish Chambers of Commerce chief executive Liz Cameron said the labour market figures showed "continued optimism" for Scotland's workforce.She added: "This economic indicator provides a welcome sign that the economy is heading in the right direction and businesses across Scotland should be commended for their efforts in creating and sustaining jobs."These figures provide us with comfort, however we must not become complacent in our mission to revive Scotland's economy."Scottish Trades Union Congress general secretary Grahame Smith said: "Despite modest improvements on a couple of indicators, including youth unemployment, the picture in Scotland is essentially one of 12-month stagnation in the employment market and some worrying trends on women's unemployment."The improvement in long-term unemployment trends is a slightly surprising but welcome trend which we hope will continue."</body>

      <body>Business confidence is rising across all sectors in Scotland but the economic recovery remains frail, a survey of firms has suggested.The Scottish Chambers of Commerce (SCC) found manufacturing orders rose in the third quarter at their highest rate for six years.Manufacturers and retailers also forecast a rise in profitability in the first half of next year.But SCC warned it was "by no means yet certain" the recovery can be sustained.On Wednesday, figures released by the Scottish government indicated Scotland's economy grew by 0.6% between April and June this year - the fourth consecutive quarter of growth north of the border.Labour market statistics also showed employment in Scotland at its highest level for five years.SCC's latest business survey, which is conducted in conjunction with the University of Strathclyde's Fraser of Allander Institute, found employment trends improving in all main sectors in the third quarter of 2013.Manufacturing orders also rose at their highest rate since the third quarter of 2007.Construction orders on balance declined, but levels remained higher than during the same period a year ago.The survey also suggested the long-term decline in retail sales had ended.The good summer boosted visitors to Scottish hotels, with more than half of businesses reporting a rise in guests.SCC chief executive Liz Cameron said the latest survey showed "welcome signs of growth" for Scotland's economy.She said: "Compared to a year ago, business confidence has increased and all business trends in all sectors are stronger, showing positive steps towards sustained economic growth."There are encouraging signs of increased consumer activity, with improving retail sales and stronger tourism trends. This is good news for Scotland and for Scotland's businesses."The manufacturing sector has seen orders rise at the highest rate since 2007, construction respondents reported a rise in investment intentions and the long-term decline in retail sales ended, with retailers reporting increased optimism for the first time since 2006."She added: "However, economic vulnerability remains."Much depends on continuing positive trends in our major export markets and on speedy resolution of any remaining US fiscal issues."Importantly, prices and wages remain disconnected and so household incomes continue to be squeezed."This creates risk in reliance on a consumer-driven economy, which is why government rhetoric about investment and sustainability needs to become a reality to enable continued growth and confidence."</body>

      <body>Oil firm Cairn Energy has announced it is to start a year-long "high impact" exploration programme, with drilling to begin soon in Morocco.The company said the move would offer shareholders "exposure to material growth potential".A number of possible follow-up exploration prospects have also been mapped.Cairn said that a decision would be made soon on whether to drill the Pitu prospect off Greenland next year.The Edinburgh-based group's drilling programme in Greenland has so far been unsuccessful and has been strongly criticised by environmentalists.In a statement to the stock exchange, Cairn said that it remained in a "strong financial position ready to enter an intense operational period on the exploration front".Chief executive Simon Thomson said: "Cairn continues to follow its policy of maintaining appropriate balance sheet strength as it progresses its exploration and development programmes."The company also announced it would begin a share buy back programme of up to $300m (£186m).Cairn got shareholder approval for the move earlier in the year.</body>

      <description>Rangers supporters welcome Craig Mather's exit as chief executive, according to fans' representative Drew Roberton.</description>

      <body>Rangers fans will welcome the departure of Craig Mather as chief executive, Supporters' Association general secretary Drew Roberton believes.Mather resigned two days after losing a court case that forced the League One club to postpone their annual meeting."The fans were unhappy at the way the club was going and the financial performance," said Roberton."And they weren't convinced the current board, including Craig Mather, were the right people to take the club forward."Rangers were forced to delay their AGM because they had failed to include on the agenda a request by shareholders for the election of four new board members.And the departure of Mather, who had been in charge for six months, along with non-executive director Bryan Smart, was announced to the stock exchange."In light of the court judgement, he has clearly made a serious error of judgement as far as the AGM notices go and his position, I would say, was untenable and he's fallen on his own sword," Roberton suggested to BBC Scotland.The association general secretary thought that change was needed in light of a loss of £14m reported for the last financial year."It had to happen because clearly things did not appear to be going very well financially at the club judging from the accounts that have just been raised and everyone believed that change was needed," said Roberton."The club, for whatever reason, tried to block that change."I do believe that the requisitioners do have the best interests of Rangers at heart and I'm sure they'll appoint a top-quality chief executive to run the club."I've spoken to Paul Murray and Malcolm Murray on previous occasions and I have no doubt whatsoever that they have the best interests of Rangers Football Club at heart."Former Rangers director Dave King, the Scottish businessman who has settled a tax dispute in South Africa, had been suggested as a future chairman after talks with Mather."I think there might be a bit of a mixed reaction with Dave King," suggested Roberton. "But, on the other hand, Dave King is certainly in a position to put investment into the club and people would hope that, should Dave King return in any capacity to the board, he would perhaps make a significant investment in the club."Following the financial meltdown that led to Rangers playing in Division Three last season and boardroom battles that also resulted in the departure of Mather's predecessor, Charles Green, Roberton hopes the Glasgow club can now find some stability.Bus tycoon James Easdale and finance director Brian Stockbridge remain on the Rangers International Football Club plc board, while Easdale's brother, Sandy, is also on the football club board."We would just like to see it all settle down and start making on-the-field headlines instead of off-the-field headlines and see the club on a stable financial footing for the future," added Roberton."I just really hope that, between the Easdales and Mr Stockbridge, they arrange the AGM as soon as is reasonably practical and we can move on"</body>

      <body>Celtic captain Scott Brown has been given a three-game European ban by Uefa following his red card in the Champions League defeat by Barcelona.Referee Stephane Lannoy dismissed Brown after he appeared to aim a kick at Barca forward Neymar.The ban would make the 28-year-old unavailable for both games against Ajax and the visit of AC Milan."The club finds this to be excessive and they will be appealing against the decision," said Celtic in a statement.The next Champions League game Brown would be available for is the final Group H fixture against Barcelona at the Nou Camp.Celtic are bottom of the group having lost their opening two matches, while Ajax have one point going into their trip to Glasgow on Tuesday.Following the 1-0 home loss to Barca, Brown admitted he had "made a mistake" but felt the red card was "harsh".</body>

      <body>Chief executive Mark Dodson insists Scottish Rugby is "not frightened of meritocracy" amid plans to change how clubs qualify for European competition.The Rugby Champions Cup, due to start next year, is a result of Anglo-French frustrations with the Heineken Cup.But Dodson insists strong performances in the Pro12 are key to Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh's participation."We believe if Edinburgh finished 11th last year, they should not be involved in the Heineken Cup," said Dodson."When I first came here, I said I would focus on professional rugby as well as the international team."The targets we have been setting for both Glasgow and Edinburgh are for them both to be in the top four of the RaboDirect Pro12."So for us to say we are against meritocracy would be crazy because our ambitions are to be challenging in the Rabo every year."English and French clubs object to the current Heineken Cup qualification criteria and the way revenue is shared. As things stand, Glasgow and Edinburgh are automatically entered to the competition.The new tournament could include teams from Scotland, Wales and Ireland, but the Pro12 sides need their unions' approval to take part.The Welsh, Irish and Scottish unions are, in turn, waiting on the International Rugby Board's endorsement."What we would like to do is ensure that there is a rounded and fair solution," added Dodson."We are prepared to look at meritocracy and some of the other tweaks that might need to be made to allow that to happen."But don't let anyone be under any doubt, we are working very hard to make this work."There has to be give and take. It can't be all take or it won't work."We understand, we need to modernise and I have some sympathy with the English clubs' predicament. But they are working with a mix of models."It doesn't work only the way the French and English leagues work. The Celtic and Italian clubs are run in a fundamentally different way."</body>

We need to stop them playing and get our game in place, too."Four second half tries rescued a bonus point for Warriors against defending champions Toulon."We as group of coaches were disappointed we only played for 40 minutes," Townsend added."But we got a point out of a very tough fixture."Glasgow: Maitland; Seymour, McGuigan, Ascarate, van der Merwe, Jackson, Matawalu, Grant, McArthur, Kalman, Swinson, Kellock, Harley, Holmes, Strauss.Replacements: Hall; Yanuyanutawa, Low, Gray, Vernon, Cusiter, Weir, Bennett.Exeter: TBCReferee: Romain Poite (France)</body>

      <body>The bitter industrial dispute which has broken out at Grangemouth has placed a spotlight on the giant refinery and petrochemicals complex.So what is the history behind the site, who runs it now and what operations are carried out there?When did the site start up?In 1924, BP opened a refinery on the Firth of Forth, in part because of its transport links and the availability of local labour skilled in shale oil refining.From the 1950s, BP's operations there grew to meet growing demand for both petrochemicals and fuels.The advent of a new source of crude oil feedstock in the shape of North Sea oil in the 1970s brought further business to the site.The refinery's feedstock is now mainly supplied by the neighbouring BP-operated Kinneil oil and gas processing plant.Some oil is imported to the site via pipeline from the deepwater Finnart Ocean Terminal, located about 60 miles west of Grangemouth.Who owns the complex?The petrochemicals part of the 1,700-acre site is run by Switzerland-based speciality chemicals and oil product manufacturer Ineos.It owns more than 50 manufacturing facilities in 11 countries across the world.In late 2005 Ineos bought BP's olefins and derivatives business, taking over the Grangemouth complex in the process.The crude oil refinery - the only one in Scotland - is now owned by Petroineos, a joint venture which was formed between Ineos and PetroChina International (London) Company in 2011.What is produced at Grangemouth?The Grangemouth refinery processes around 210,000 barrels of crude oil per day, producing more than nine million litres of clean fuels per day.The refinery, which has an annual capacity of 10 million tonnes, provides fuel to Scotland, Northern England and Northern Ireland.The refinery and chemical plants form Ineos' largest production centre.The petrochemicals facility at the site manufactures more than two million tonnes of chemical products per year.These are later transformed into essential items such as bottles and pipes, cabling and insulation and food packaging.What major equipment is there at the complex?At the heart of the petrochemicals site are two ethylene crackers - G4 and KG - which produce the feed materials used by other chemicals plants.The two units have an ethylene production capacity of one million tonnes per year between them.</body>

Or does the status quo offer a weaker or stronger future for the tertiary education sector?If you would like to discuss these and other issues with an invited panel of guests, please fill in the application below.The special programme will be recorded on Monday, 28 October, at BBC Scotland's Glasgow headquarters. Participants will need to be available from 17:45 to 20:30.Guidelines require the BBC to reflect a broad range of views.To help us do this, we will ask all members of the audience whether they are associated with a political party, if they already have a view on the referendum and where in the British Isles they are from.Voters in Scotland will go to the polls on Thursday, 18 September, next year when they will be asked the straight yes/no question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?"</body>

      <title>Connecting children to the great outdoors</title>
      <description>Are Scottish children more connected to nature?</description>

      <body>A report published by the RSPB has suggested that children in Scotland are more connected to nature than those in the rest of the UK.The research measured young people's enjoyment of the outdoors; how at one they felt with nature; their empathy for creatures; and their environmental responsibility.But at a half-term play scheme being held at the RSPB's Loch Leven reserve the children were more concerned about having fun.Craig Leitch showed them how to build a den, then the group of twelve - aged between six and 12 - split up and started building their own shelters.Boys and girls talked about how you could imagine you were surviving in the woods, or that you were a woodland animal building yourself a new home.One lad told me if he was at home he'd have been playing a computer game. He enjoyed that, of course.But on balance he would rather be out and about in the great outdoors. It was fun, and good exercise, he said.Younger children - the youngest just weeks old - went on a magical walk through the trees, looking for woodland elves and forest fairies.Then Judy Paul showed them, and their mums and dads, how to light a fire so they could toast marshmallows, bananas or potato scones.One parent explained that it was "too easy just to sit indoors and watch TV." But taking part in events at the reserve meant they could enjoy the woods with an experienced person who knows about the trees and the wildlife.Another mum agreed."It's just a fantastic experience learning about the plants and the flowers, the outdoors experience, and socialising with other children their own age," she explained.Rebekah Stackhouse, who runs RSPB Scotland's education and youth programmes, told BBC radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that the results of the research in Scotland, which was carried out by the University of Essex over a three-year period, had been encouraging."Twenty seven per cent of young people in Scotland are highly connected to nature," she said."That's absolutely brilliant news, and it reflects the number of organisations and families that are doing stuff in the outdoors already."But the important thing to remember is that it is only a quarter. So it would be much better if we could get that number up to 50%, or all young people in Scotland being connected to nature."The research was commissioned by the RSPB amid concern that generations of children had little or no contact with the natural world.The RSPB hopes that now a baseline figure has been established, the research can be repeated in future to see what practical difference public polices are making to young people's experience.It is claimed that contact with nature is good for children's education, physical health, and emotional wellbeing.</body>

      <title>Windows 8.1 gets global release</title>
      <description>Microsoft has released the Windows 8.1 update for its flagship operating system.</description>

      <body>Microsoft has released the Windows 8.1 update for its flagship operating system.The download seeks to address some of the criticisms levelled at the original version of Windows 8.In particular, the update restores the start button and allows a computer to boot up with a traditional desktop interface.The launch comes at a critical time for Microsoft as it seeks a new boss, with PC sales experiencing a long decline.Windows 8 sought to bridge the gap between touchscreen devices, such as tablets and smartphones, and more traditional form laptops and desktop machines. As such it had an interface built of tiles that could be tapped or swiped to open applications.However, many people found the tiled interface did not work well for some of the things they were used to doing with a computer.The changes in 8.1 include:A host of other changes, including better support for multi-tasking and improved links to Microsoft's Xbox game console, are also in the update.Windows 8 was created to capitalise on the growing popularity of tablets and other portable gadgets. Microsoft needs to get people using its software on these machines because sales of desktop machines are in sharp decline.Global shipments of PCs hit a five-year low in early October, according to figures from market research firm Gartner. Sales of PCs had now fallen for six quarters in a row, it added. The downward trend in sales statistics were confirmed by IDC, which added that the decline would probably continue into 2014.The shrinking sales are important for Microsoft because traditionally the bulk of its revenue comes from people and companies buying laptops and desktops and office software to run on them.It is not clear that Microsoft is adjusting to the changes in the types of gadgets that people use. In July, Microsoft was wrote off $900m (£559m) following poor sales of its own-brand Surface touchscreen devices.At the same time, Microsoft has undergone a major reorganisation and has bought phone maker Nokia. It is also launching a new version of its Xbox games console and has begun searching for a new chief executive.Servers ready to dispense the update were turned on at 07:00 New York time (12:00 BST).

      <title>Adidas smartwatch has pulse sensor</title>
      <description>Adidas announces a touchscreen colour watch that can measure its owner's heart-rate to create tailored training programmes.</description>

      <body>A watch with a colour touchscreen and built-in heart monitor that studies the wearer's pulse to create training programmes has been unveiled by Adidas.The gadget - which is being targeted at runners - also includes a GPS location chip to maximise the accuracy of its readings.It marks a move by the German firm into the smartwatch sector, although the device does not run third-party apps.The news comes the same week as rival Nike updated its own activity tracker.The two companies - which are best known for their sports clothing and shoe ranges - are taking different approaches with their flagship products.At $399 (£250) Adidas's Micoach Smart Run is more than double the price of Nike's $149 Fuelband SE. But it offers a wider range of sensors as well as the ability to play MP3 audio files to wireless headphones via Bluetooth.It also has the advantage of offering partner apps for Android, Windows Phone and iOS devices. By contrast, Nike only offers a Fuelband app for the iPhone.The US firm does, however, offer a separate Nike-branded watch made by the Dutch firm TomTom that features a GPS chip and can be paired with a heart rate strap made by another company.Adidas announced its new product at Gigaom's Mobilize conference in San Francisco.It said athletes could use the watch to create a coaching programme to improve their fitness levels and would then receive feedback via animated graphics on its screen, vibrations, and audio commands - using paired headphones - telling them to speed up or slow down.The new device is bigger than less advanced digital watches and screenless activity trackers also sold by Adidas, but its 1.45in (3.7cm) display is smaller than the screens on Samsung and Sony's new smartwatches.The Galaxy Gear and Smartwatch 2 both offer a range of activity apps of their own as well as other Android software, but rely on being paired with a smartphone for much of their functionality.Adidas says its product's battery lasts about 14 days when its tracking sensors are switched off. However, that drops to just four hours when it is switched into "training mode".Motorola's Motoactv watch may be its closest competitor. The gadget also features a GPS chip and MP3 player, but not a pulse rate sensor of its own.Consultancy Juniper Research recently predicted the wider wearable tech market will grow from $1.4bn of sales this year to $19bn by 2018.However, it suggested that sales of specialist fitness tracking equipment and watches that are, in effect, slaves to smartphones will be cannibalised by more powerful standalone devices."The products currently available in the market only appeal to a niche demographic, but as we move towards the age of a true multifunctional smartwatch we expect them to become more appealing," said its senior analyst Nitin Bhas."We believe players like Apple, Google and Microsoft will release devices that can acts as a fitness tracker, as a digital wallet, as a way of offering ticketing and coupons, and all sorts of other things. To be honest, the market is still waiting for a killer app."There is an opportunity for Adidas here - but along with start-ups entering the wearable tech sector, it has a very narrow window and is likely to struggle as the marketplace becomes increasingly crowded."Adidas said it would start selling the new watch next month.</body>

      <title>EE rapped over 'misleading' maps</title>
      <description>The Advertising Standards Authority asks for changes to EE's mobile coverage checker following a complaint about its accuracy.</description>

      <body>The Advertising Standards Authority has ordered EE to change its mobile coverage checker after a customer complained it had wrongly told him he would receive excellent service in his area.The checker must make it clearer that it is only a guide, the ASA said.The decision is likely to have an impact on other mobile operators offering similar maps.Mobile coverage can vary widely from street to street.It depends on a variety of factors, including the density of buildings and the number of trees in the area.Despite the fact that the EE coverage map has an addendum which states that it is "only a guide and not guarantee of service availability in a particular location", the ASA still felt the ad was misleadingIts ruling stated: "We noted that the claims under the coverage results were presented in language that was not conditional and consider the overall impression of the ad was such that it was likely to be understood to mean that fast reliable internet access and high quality calling was available... to consumers in the relevant postcode."In response EE said: "Our coverage checker is regulated by Ofcom and offers a prediction of our network coverage across the UK. In this instance, we deemed coverage to be Excellent in the postcode as confirmed by testing that found over 98% of the postcode had an excellent signal.""We take on board the ASA's ruling and will amend the disclaimer language as necessary," it added.EE customers are given a 14-day cooling off period if they are not happy with the mobile service after signing a new contract.O2 also points out that customers have a seven-day window to cancel their service if they find it is not as good as expected."Our coverage maps are created on accurate predictions of the network, but unfortunately they can't always take into account a number of factors affecting signal like building structures and natural landscape," the mobile firm said in a statement."We're making daily improvements to our network and our coverage maps for 2G, 3G and 4G are updated to reflect these on a weekly basis."Most operators have ambitious plans for 4G coverage, both indoors and outdoors, with most planning to reach around 98% of the population by 2017.But it is notoriously hard to produce accurate mobile coverage maps. All the operators produce their own and use different metrics for measuring coverage. Some have called on Ofcom to produce its own coverage map, something that the regulator has rejected.There are a few independent coverage maps available from firms such as RootMetrics and OpenSignal.Matthew Howett, analyst with research firm Ovum said: "While the operator's own coverage checkers are usually very accurate, they don't all necessarily measure the same thing. For instance some might only be for outdoor coverage, whereas others will also give you an idea what you can expect indoors."Given these peculiarities, they are useful only up to a point for consumers when making comparisons between networks," he added.</body>

      <body>Oracle has released a bumper update package for Java that closes lots of security holes in the software.The update fixes 51 separate security bugs in Java, which owner Oracle says is used on billions of devices.About a dozen of the bugs were serious enough to allow attackers to take remote control of a compromised system, researchers said.Java is one of the most popular targets for cyber-thieves and malware writers seeking to hijack home computers.In its advisory about the update, Oracle urged customers to patch the software as soon as possible "due to the threat posed by a successful attack".Programming language Java has proved popular because software written with it can easily be made to run on many different types of computer.Twelve of the holes in Java addressed by the update topped the table that ranked the severity of security weaknesses in software, wrote Qualys security expert Wolfgang Kandek in a blogpost.If these bugs were exploited, attackers could bypass ID controls and take over a target system, he added.He said those seeking to exploit Java would probably seed web pages with booby-trapped links in a bid to catch vulnerable machines.Security glitches in Java are favourites among those that write and run so-called "exploit kits" that seek to compromise vulnerable websites and other systems.Security blogger Brian Krebs said if people needed to run Java, it was well worth taking time to apply the update.Those that did not need the software should consider disabling it altogether, he said."This widely installed and powerful program is riddled with security holes, and is a top target of malware writers and miscreants," he wrote.The update is available via the main Java website and has prompted follow-up action from other electronics firms. Apple has released an update to the version of Java that runs on its computers. This update points people towards the official version of Java from Oracle instead of that supplied by Apple.In the past, Apple has faced criticism over the speed with which it updated its version of Java.</body>

      <title>Watch Dogs delay wounds games maker</title>
      <description>More than a quarter of Ubisoft's market value is wiped out after the French video games publisher delays the launch of hacker-themed title Watch Dogs.</description>

      <body>Shares in video games firm Ubisoft have slumped by 26% after it delayed the release of two much-anticipated titles.Hacker-themed Watch Dogs and open-world racing game The Crew have both been postponed until the publisher's next financial year, which begins in April.The company said it wanted to allow its developers to fine tune their work.Watch Dogs had been due to go on sale on 19 November and will miss out on being a launch title for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.Retailers, including Amazon and Gamestop, have assured consumers who had pre-ordered bundles including both the Chicago-based title and one of the games consoles that they will still receive the machine on the day they had been quoted.The Crew had originally been due out some time in the first three months of 2014.France-based Ubisoft has had success with its Assassin's Creed, Just Dance and Splinter Cell franchises.However, it warned that the delays meant it was likely to swing to an operating loss when it declares its full-year results.Chief executive Yves Guillemo called the move a "tough decision"."We are building franchises that will become perennial pillars of Ubisoft's financial performance," he added."In a context of growing successes for mega-blockbusters, the additional time given to the development of our titles will allow them to fulfil their huge ambitions and thus offer players even more exceptional experiences."A blog posted by the Watch Dogs development team added that it planned to launch the game before the end of June."As we got closer to release, as all the pieces of the puzzle were falling into place in our last push before completion, it became clear to us that we needed to take the extra time to polish and fine tune each detail so we can deliver a truly memorable and exceptional experience," it stated.Ubisoft added that The Crew would now go on sale before the end of September.The news caught many analysts by surprise. To make its November debut, the "gold master" version of Watch Dogs' code would have needed to have been finalised soon in order for the discs to be manufactured and shipped to stores in time.It is unusual, though not unknown, for a game to be pulled so late in development.In February, Ubisoft delayed its platformer Rayman Legends by half a year, less than a month before it had been due to go on sale.Perhaps the best known example was Valve's announcement in 2003 that its sci-fi action sequel Half-Life 2 was to be delayed, just a week before its scheduled launch date. It went on to become one of the best reviewed games of all time.One industry watcher said a short-term view by investors had caused the firm's stock to dive, but that Ubisoft was better off doing this than releasing Watch Dogs in a state that required later software patches to address major faults."I think it was going to be one of the drivers for initial games-console bundle sales and will probably push back some of the hardware sales that would have happened right out of the gate for Sony and Microsoft," said Lewis Ward, video games research manager at consultants IDC."But absolutely it's the right decision if there's something glitchy or there's some game-balance factor that is off."There's a lot of interconnections between the things you can control in the game and how the story then unfolds, so I can only assume there's some factor with the incredibly complex open-world gameplay that's off."But there's no reason Ubisoft can't still deliver what they hoped to do with this game."</body>

      <title>Samsung offers to end patent wars</title>
      <description>To avoid a huge fine for allegations that it has abused the patent system, Samsung has waved the white flag on patent wars.</description>

      <body>Samsung has said that it will stop taking rivals to court over certain patent infringements for the next five years.The white flag in the patent battle has been raised because the South Korean electronics firm faces a huge fine for alleged abuses of the system.The move could help end a long-running patent war between the world's largest mobile operators.The EU said that a resolution would bring "clarity to the industry"."Samsung has offered to abstain from seeking injunctions for mobile SEPs (standard essential patents) for a period of five years against any company that agrees to a particular licensing framework," the European Commission said in a statement.Standard essential patents refer to inventions recognised as being critical to implementing an industry standard technology.Examples of such technologies include the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), a cellular standard at the heart of 3G data; and H.264, a video compression format used by YouTube, Blu-ray disks and Adobe Flash Player among others.The EU had accused the Samsung of stifling competition by bringing a series of SEP lawsuits against Apple and other rivals.Google's Motorola Mobility has been charged with similar anti-competitive practice.Samsung faced a $18.3bn (£11.3bn) fine if it was found guilty of breaching anti-trust laws."Enforcing patents through injunctions can be perfectly legitimate, said Joaquin Almunia, the European Commission's vice-president in charge of competition policy."However, when patents are standard-essential, abuses must be prevented so that standard-setting works properly and consumers do not have to suffer negative consequences from the so-called patent wars."If we reach a good solution in this case, it will bring clarity to the industry," he added.Samsung and Apple are currently battling each other in courts in more than 10 countries across Europe.Interested parties have been given a month to comment on the proposals.</body>

      <description>A team from Buffalo, New York, has been testing "underwater wi-fi" as it attempts to create an internet for the oceans.</description>

      <body>Researchers have tested an "underwater wi-fi" network in a lake in an attempt to make a "deep-sea internet".The team, from the University of Buffalo, New York, said the technology could help detect tsunamis, offering more reliable warning systems.They aim to create an agreed standard for underwater communications, to make interaction and data-sharing easier.Unlike normal wi-fi, which uses radio waves, the submerged network technology utilises sound waves.Radio waves are able to penetrate water, but with severely limited range and stability. Sound waves provide a better option - as demonstrated by many aquatic species such as whales and dolphins.Wireless communication underwater has been possible for some time, but the problem lies in getting separate systems used by different organisations to communicate with each other.The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), for instance, uses acoustic waves to send data from tsunami sensors on the sea floor to buoys on the surface.However due to infrastructure differences, this data cannot be shared quickly with other information gathered by the US Navy.Therefore, the University of Buffalo team is attempting to create a shared standard."A submerged wireless network will give us an unprecedented ability to collect and analyse data from our oceans in real time," said Tommaso Melodia, lead researcher."Making this information available to anyone with a smartphone or computer, especially when a tsunami or other type of disaster occurs, could help save lives."The test was carried out at Lake Erie, near Buffalo. The research team dropped two 40lb (18kg) sensors into the water - and were then able to use a laptop to transmit information to them.In future, the team hopes the sensors could be used to help detect and solve environmental issues. With a shared standard, different research groups with varied equipment could potentially combine their data gathering efforts with greater ease, and in real-time.More details of the team's work will be presented at a conference for underwater networking to be held in Taiwan next month.</body>

      <title>Dexter malware strikes South Africa</title>
      <description>Malware designed to steal information from payment cards' magnetic strips strikes thousands of restaurants and retailers in South Africa.</description>

      <body>South Africa has been hit by one of the biggest cyber-fraud attacks in its history, according to the body that oversees local financial transactions.The payment card systems of thousands of shops, restaurants and hotels had been compromised, said the Payment Association of South Africa (Pasa).Losses were thought to be in the "tens of millions, but not hundreds of millions of rands", it said.It added the attackers had used a new variant of the malware known as Dexter.Ten million rand is worth £626,000 or just over $1m.Dexter gets its name from a string of code found in one of its files, which may refer to the US television show that followed the exploits of a serial killer.The Dexter code was linked to a series of attacks on point-of-sale systems in the UK, US and dozens of other countries towards the end of last year.It skims and transmits the cards' magnetic-strip information, allowing clones to be made that can then be used for fraudulent purchases,.Pasa said it believed the criminals responsible were based in Europe, but added it was not sure from which countries."It's probably the worst [attack] of its kind in terms of the losses," Walter Volker, Pasa's chief executive, told the BBC."We started detecting higher levels of fraud at some of these retailers early in the year - from about late-January, February. We initially thought it was a normal seasonal thing, but as the volumes increased we decided to appoint a forensics investigation company."Eventually it was able to find this particular malware in some of the locations. Very soon after we found the cause of the compromise, we were able to clean up those sites with anti-malware software."Mr Volker added that while the attack had targeted back-end systems to steal data from the cards' magstrips, it had not stolen Pin codes or CVV payment authentication numbers - meaning the thieves would not have been able to withdraw money from bank cash machines or have used the information to make purchases from internet shops."Normal anti-virus software would probably have cleaned up Dexter but it was a particular custom-built variant, which was not detectable with the normal scanning software that everybody's got," Mr Volker added."It seems like it was a European-based syndicate - we don't exactly where - but Interpol and Europol are making good progress in trying to apprehend these particular perpetrators."KFC fast-food restaurants' card systems were among those to have been compromised, according to a statement given by the chain's owner to the Bloomberg news agency."We take this extremely seriously," Yum Brands said. "Our first priority is to make sure that the impact on our customers remains minimal."Bloomberg added that a locally based burger and pizza chain operator, Famous Brands, had also confirmed some of its payment machines had been exposed.However, Pasa stressed that it would ultimately be the banks - rather than the public or other businesses - that would face losses as a consequence of the attack."In terms of the banks, there's probably not a single issuing bank in the country that has not been affected in some way," said Mr Volker."The South African card holders - or potentially tourists using their cards at the affected sites - will not be exposed to any losses. It's just the inconvenience of detecting false transactions on their accounts."If that has happened they should just contact their issuing bank."</body>

      <title>Snapchat hack secretly saves images</title>
      <description>An app that discreetly saves images and videos sent through "self-destruct" messaging service Snapchat has been created, raising privacy fears.</description>

      <body>An app that discreetly saves images and videos sent through "self-destruct" messaging service Snapchat has been created.Snapchat rose to popularity as an app that allows people to share pictures, safe in the knowledge they would delete themselves after being viewed.However, Snaphack circumvents this system, allowing recipients to pass on or upload images to social media.Snapchat could not be reached for comment on the app.However, the company's terms of service state that it does not allow the development of "any third-party applications that interact with user content or the services without our prior written consent".Snaphack was made by UK-based developer Darren Jones, who told the BBC: "Snapchat has not been in touch and I imagine it's only a matter of time until they request that my app is removed."But my app just proves and informs people that these apps exist and people need to be careful."Previous methods of saving or retrieving Snapchat images and video have been publicised. In August, another app known as Snap Save was distributed - but users found that if they saved an image it would inform the sender they had done so.Snaphack gives no such warning.The app is available through Apple's App Store. Apple is yet to comment on the issue.Although it is not marketed as such by the company, Snapchat has gained a reputation as a system for so-called "sexting", due to the app's countdown timer that renders the picture inaccessible after a few seconds.First released in 2011, the app has rapidly grown to be worth - according to one estimate - around $860m (£540m), but like many social media start-ups it has yet to turn a profit.Concerns over privacy have followed the app's success closely. In May, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) filed a complaint with the US Federal Trade Commission."Snapchat is the app that promises to delete photos but it doesn't," said Marc Rotenberg, EPIC's executive director."We have no problem with apps that make photos vanish. But they should work as promised, and if they don't the Federal Trade Commission should investigate."In response, Snapchat brushed off the claims - acknowledging that an image could easily be saved by simply taking a screenshot on the phone, or by photographing the screen with another device.Since then the company has regularly used its blog to outline its practices for storing images.Other image retrieval methods relied on special software to reverse-engineer Snapchat's system - but Snaphack's simplicity and automation raised serious issues, argued one expert."It absolutely undermines the security of Snapchat," said Rik Ferguson, vice president of security research at Trend Micro."If the fact that your photo has a limited lifetime is the one thing that gives you the comfort to send it, this news should put you off."Developer Mr Jones told the BBC he was introduced to Snapchat just three weeks ago - and said he designed the app to raise awareness that such sharing is possible."For months people have been sending private images without knowing it has been possible to do this kind of thing with them with other apps," he told the BBC."The ideal response from Snapchat will be to put a system in place to stop people being able to save images in this way or any other."Mr Ferguson added: "Snapchat advertises its service as being in the moment - but really the best advice is not to get lost in the moment."Please, every single time, take a deep breath, and don't press that button."Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC.</body>

      <description>Nike unveils a new wrist-worn activity tracker, which attempts to address criticism that the earlier model did not distinguish between different activities.</description>

      <body>Nike has unveiled its second generation activity-tracking wristband, addressing criticism that its earlier device failed to recognise that some activities use more energy than others.The Fuelband SE lets owners define the start and end of a session and then tag it - for example as yoga or basketball.The firm's software then adjusts its "fuel" score accordingly.However, speculation that Nike would add a heart monitor or other new sensor to improve accuracy proved incorrect.The New York launch came a fortnight after the Fitbit Force was unveiled - a rival activity tracker that includes a height-measuring altimeter that can record how many stairs its owner has climbed.Jawbone, iHealth, Garmin, Withings and Adidas are among other firms to offer dedicated fitness-measuring gadgets. Meanwhile Samsung and Sony are promoting their newly released smartwatches' ability to download and run Android-based activity-tracking apps.One market watcher suggested Nike might have missed a trick."Since Nike launched the first Fuelband early last year there has been an explosion of fitness wearables and apps," said Nitin Bhas, senior analyst at the tech consultancy Juniper Research."On the one hand you have Apple's promotion of the new motion processor in its iPhone 5S, which extends battery life when the function is used, and on the other hand you have Fitbit adding new technology."But you mustn't forget that Nike has the fact that it's an established brand in its favour, unlike some of the other firms involved."Other improvements to the Fuelband include an upgrade to the lower-power Bluetooth 4.0 technology, allowing the device to automatically synchronise its data to an iPhone rather than requiring the owner to carry out a series of button presses.There continues to be no official Fuelband app for Android devices, although users can connect the gadget to a computer to upload their data to a website.The firm also suggested a redesigned internal circuit board and other changes meant the device offered "greater flexibility" and "improved water resistance". Issues with the original model meant several users suffered error messages after several months' use, requiring the bracelet to be replaced.Like its predecessor, the company suggests the Fuelband SE can be worn in the shower but should not be submerged for extended periods, for example while swimming.The company said that its iOS app also introduced a feature allowing users to work together to hit a fuel score target as well as a way to better monitor how much energy was used at different hours of the day.Nike also announced plans to expand an existing programme to encourage third-party firms to develop software that makes use of the information generated by the device.Analysts agree that the wearable tech market - which includes devices such as Google's forthcoming Glass eyewear - is set to expand, but differ over its expected size.According to a new report from Juniper Research the sector will grow from $1.4bn (£878m) of annual sales this year to $19bn (£11.9bn) by 2018.Analysts at the bank Credit Suisse are more optimistic suggesting a $50bn figure by the same date.Tech research firm Gartner is more cautious suggesting a $10bn target for 2016. But one of its analysts suggested the sector would grow more quickly if businesses decided to equip their workers with such tech."If you don't have motivated and passionate employees they don't give you the extra discretionary effort, and there's some thinking that wellness programmes that encourage staff to be healthier may make them more productive and combat absenteeism," Mike Gotta told the BBC."But that raises the issue of privacy - where does the data go? Employees will be concerned if the information gathered could be used in a punitive way."Nike is adding France, Germany and Japan to its existing Fuelband markets - the US, Canada and the UK.It will be available from 6 November.</body>

      <body>Intel, the world's biggest computer chip maker, has said the production of its next-generation PC chip, Broadwell, will be delayed by a quarter.Chief executive Brian Krzanich said the delay was due to a technical glitch.The Broadwell chips are expected to succeed the firm's Haswell line of processors, and are touted to be more power-efficient and faster.Intel is the leading PC chip-maker and its updated products typically spur on new laptop and desktop sales."We and our (manufacturing) partners have a strong desire to get Broadwell to the market," Mr Krzanich said. "This is a small blip in the schedule."The delay comes as Intel reported a slight fall in third quarter profits, hurt by slowing demand for personal computers (PCs).It reported a net income of $2.95bn (£1.86bn) for the three months to the end September, compared to $2.97bn in the same period last year.The division which makes chips for desktop computers saw sales fall 3.5%.PC sales have now fallen for six quarters in a row and hit a five-year low in the July-to-September period.Sales have been hurt by the growing popularity and falling prices of tablets and smartphones, hurting computer chip makers."The third quarter came in as expected, with modest growth in a tough environment," said Mr Krzanich said in a statement.However, Intel's data centre business reported record sales of $2.9bn, up 12%.</body>

      <body>Ireland plans to shut a tax arrangement used by Apple to shelter $40bn (£25bn) from taxation.Apple, and other firms, have been able to funnel profits into Irish subsidiaries or "ghost companies" that had no declared tax residency anywhere in the world.On Tuesday, the Irish government said it planned to make it illegal for a company to have no tax domicile.But firms would be able to nominate any country as their tax residence.That includes countries such as Bermuda which offer zero tax rates.Because of that, tax experts say that the change announced on Tuesday will not make much difference to the amount of tax paid by Apple.Google and Microsoft have Irish subsidiaries that legally channel money to Bermuda where they pay zero tax.But Ireland's Finance Minister Michael Noonan said his country was committed to reform."Let me be crystal clear. Ireland wants to be part of the solution to this global tax challenge, not part of the problem," he said.Back in May, a US Senate committee said Apple had used "a complex web of offshore entities" to avoid paying billions of dollars in US income taxes.Google, Microsoft and Apple say they follow tax rules in every country where they operate.</body>

      <title>3D printing 'entering the metal age'</title>
      <description>The European Space Agency has unveiled plans to "take 3D printing into the metal age" by building parts for jets, spacecraft and fusion reactors.</description>

      <body>The European Space Agency has unveiled plans to "take 3D printing into the metal age" by building parts for jets, spacecraft and fusion projects.The Amaze project brings together 28 institutions to develop new metal components which are lighter, stronger and cheaper than conventional parts.Additive manufacturing (or "3D printing") has already revolutionised the design of plastic products.Printing metal parts for rockets and planes would cut waste and save money.The layered method of assembly also allows intricate designs - geometries which are impossible to achieve with conventional metal casting.Parts for cars and satellites can be optimised to be lighter and - simultaneously - incredibly robust.Tungsten alloy components that can withstand temperatures of 3,000C were unveiled at Amaze's launch on Tuesday at London's Science Museum.At such extreme temperatures they can survive inside nuclear fusion reactors and on the nozzles of rockets."We want to build the best quality metal products ever made. Objects you can't possibly manufacture any other way," said David Jarvis, Esa's head of new materials and energy research."To build a [fusion reactor], like Iter, you somehow have to take the heat of the Sun and put it in a metal box."3,000C is as hot as you can imagine for engineering."If we can get 3D metal printing to work, we are well on the way to commercial nuclear fusion."Additive manufacturing with metal is not new; General Electric, for example, has used the technique to make fuel injectors for one of its aircraft engines. China claims to be using 3D printing to manufacture load-bearing components in aircraft.And in July, Nasa announced that it had successfully tested a 3D-printed rocket engine part.Amaze is a loose acronym for Additive Manufacturing Aiming Towards Zero Waste and Efficient Production of High-Tech Metal Products.The 20m-euro project brings together 28 partners from European industry and academia - including Airbus, Astrium, Norsk Titanium, Cranfield University, EADS, and the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy.Factory sites are being set up in France, Germany, Italy, Norway and the UK to develop the industrial supply chain.Amaze researchers have already begun printing metal jet engine parts and aeroplane wing sections up to 2m in size.These high-strength components are typically built from expensive, exotic metals such as titanium, tantalum and vanadium.Using traditional techniques to fashion metal objects often wastes precious raw material.Whereas additive manufacturing - building parts up layer-on-layer from 3D digital data - has the potential to produce almost "zero waste"."To produce one kilo of metal, you use one kilo of metal - not 20 kilos," says Esa's Franco Ongaro."We need to clean up our act - the space industry needs to be more green. And this technique will help us."Printing objects as a single piece - without welding or bolting - can make them both stronger and lighter.A weight reduction of even 1kg for a long-range aircraft will save hundreds of thousands of dollars over its lifespan."Our ultimate aim is to print a satellite in a single piece. One chunk of metal, that doesn't need to be welded or bolted," said Jarvis."To do that would save 50% of the costs - millions of euros."But Jarvis is candid about the problems and inefficiencies that still need to be overcome - what he calls the "dirty secrets" of 3D printing."One common problem is porosity - small air bubbles in the product. Rough surface finishing is an issue too," he said."We need to understand these defects and eliminate them - if we want to achieve industrial quality."And we need to make the process repeatable - scale it up."We can't do all this unless we collaborate between industries - space, fusion, aeronautics."We need all these teams working together and sharing."</body>

      <title>Flossie the computer to be rebooted</title>
      <description>The National Museum of Computing announces plans to resurrect one of the oldest business computers still in existence.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24534864</url>

      <body>Efforts to reboot one of the oldest surviving mass-produced computers are under way in Milton Keynes.The National Museum of Computing has taken delivery of what it believes is the last ICT 1301 computer to ever have a chance of working again.The machine - known as Flossie - had originally been used to produce exam results for students at the University of London.The museum hopes to put it on display by 2016.One of its trustees said Flossie was one of the first computers specifically designed for use by UK businesses rather than scientific institutions."Before this time, computers were absolutely huge with valves and thousands of vacuum tubes and would get incredibly hot, making them difficult to house in a normal business," Kevin Murrell, a trustee of the museum, told the BBC."But this machine used transistors, which used very little power. That meant you could have more of them in the same space, you didn't need the complex cooling equipment and you wouldn't require the high power that earlier computers needed."ICT 1301s had a footprint of about 6m by 7m (20ft by 23ft) and weighed some five tonnes. They came with a punch card reader and printer built in to their body, which were used to enter and save data by means of creating a series of holes in a piece of stiff paper."For medium-sized companies that wanted to computerise their invoicing, their accounting or their payroll, this gave them the help to do that," added Mr Murrell.The University of London bought its machine in the 1960s and used it for accounting and administration tasks in addition to generating GCE examination results for students in England and Wales.It was later sold at scrap metal value to a group of students before eventually ending up at a farm in Kent, whose owner donated the machine to the museum.Other editions of the machine were later used as props thanks to their arresting design. Doctor Who, the Pink Panther and the James Bond movie The Man with the Golden Gun all featured ICT 1301s.Over the years more than 150 computers were created, but the charity said it was only aware of three others being left in existence, all of which are beyond repair."One of the problems with computers as museum artefacts is that when they are switched off they are fairly boring - it's fairly difficult to learn anything from them," explained Mr Murrell."So ideally we want it switched on, and once we've restored it we will be able to run the original software."We will have caused some damage in the move, so we need to deal with that, but I think in about three years' time we will have a properly demonstrable machine."</body>

      <title>Silk Road: Will cybercrime evolve?</title>
      <description>Is society safer after the illegal marketplace's demise?</description>

      <body>Silk Road, the infamous online marketplace for drugs and other illegal goods, was closed down by the FBI earlier this month. Since then its alleged founder, Ross Ulbricht - who denies being the site's operator known as Dread Pirate Roberts - has been taken into custody, and police forces around the world have been making arrests.It is a blow to the sale and distribution of harmful substances, including cocaine and heroin, as well as disrupting other criminal activities arranged online, such as the sale of weapons and hitmen for hire.But for how long will society have been made safer?Does it mean the end for illegal marketplaces hidden in the so-called "deep web", which depend on the anonymity provided by the Tor network and the Bitcoin digital currency to attract buyers and sellers?Or is it little more than a minor inconvenience?One man with first-hand experience of FBI takedowns is Emmanuel Gadaix.He was one of the directors of Megaupload, the popular file-sharing website founded by Kim Dotcom that was closed down by the US Department of Justice in January 2012."This changes nothing in the same way that the closure of Megaupload changed nothing," he says."All that happens if you bust him [Dread Pirate Roberts] is that two new people come along."The closure of Silk Road is no more the end of online narcotics sales as the arrest of Al Capone was the end of organised crime."Another man with similar experience is a twenty-something expat Irishman who calls himself H2.0.He is the ex-spokesman for a deep web drugs marketplace called Atlantis, which was closed down by its operators shortly before the Silk Road takedown for "security reasons".Criminals may be more than willing to prey on others, but when it comes to their own dealings they want to feel safe, and H2.0 says Silk Road had managed to build a strong brand in the underworld."It was a pillar of trust in an otherwise Wild West of dodgy scamsites," he says.But he is sure an alternative to Silk Road will emerge."We could be in for a period of sites popping up for a few months and closing [just] as fast. Silk Road will be replaced fast but the trust will take longer."Other marketplaces for illegal goods still exist in the deep web - Sheep and Black Market Reloaded (BMR) are two of the better-known ones - and it appears that former Silk Road sellers are already setting up shop in them."I do know one vendor who was previously one of the top-selling vendors on Atlantis," H2.0 adds."He moved to Silk Road as soon as Atlantis closed, and two weeks after Silk Road closed he is already set up on Sheep and BMR."Vendors even seem confident enough to carry forward the same usernames and reputations from Silk Road, which shows they don't seem too worried about being tracked."But security expert Brian Krebs thinks the takedown is significant."It once again dispels the myth of anonymity on the web, or in this case on the deep web," he suggests."That's a big deal because clearly many buyers and sellers in this community were under the impression that their actions somehow could not be traced online."In the future, illegal deep web marketplaces are likely to attempt to reassure drug dealers and their customers that their communications with each other are secure by making it easy to encrypt conversations.It turns out that a software package called BitWasp that aims to provide this is already under development, and as an open source project will be available free to anyone who wants it.The man behind BitWasp is known in internet circles as afk11. He currently spends between 30 and 50 hours a week developing it, he tells the BBC. He describes himself as unemployed, 21 years old and from Ireland.Afk11 claims his motivation is to help promote the virtual currency Bitcoin, suggesting it could become a popular way to pay for concert tickets and other events."Just because people want to remain private doesn't mean things are suspicious," he says.But does he believe that drugs marketplace operators will also use his software? "The short answer would be yes, they probably will," afk11 says."We're not specifically gearing our project towards the 'dark web' although it will certainly have features which are popular on it, such as PGP encryption."But it's more important to us that Bitcoin becomes adopted by the masses."The next generation of illegal marketplace operators will be much harder for the FBI or other law enforcement agencies to catch, according to a Bangkok-based security expert and broker of security exploits known as the Grugq."You can be famous, or a criminal, but you can't be a famous criminal," he says."[Dread Pirate Roberts] was advertising everywhere and attracting attention - which is never a good thing."He says that the new marketplaces will last longer because the operators won't make the same mistakes."Each bust works as evolutionary pressure, selecting out the insecure sites and training the other ones what to do better, so there will be better and better services (for buyers and sellers) with each iteration of these marketplaces after each bust," he says.Mr Krebs concurs: "Denizens of these communities will learn from their mistakes... with the result that the up-and-coming communities probably will be more difficult to penetrate and take down."But the Grugq believes that despite the protection and anonymity that Tor, Bitcoin and encryption can provide, many marketplaces and their users will get caught thanks to old-fashioned police techniques."What you will see with these sites is that as they become higher-profile, undercover agents will infiltrate them as vendors or customers," he says."They may even work their way into the inner circle and become administrators working for the site."One thing the Silk Road takedown has done is show that operators of illegal marketplaces can and do get caught.And ultimately it's the fear of that happening that may put many people off embarking on a criminal career in the deep web."I think a legit career move is best for me," H2.0 concludes."Whoever wants to be the next Dread Pirate Roberts better be able to handle the stress. I didn't like it."</body>

But can a wristband really lead to better health?Back in 2009, Nike vice-president of digital sport Stefan Olander and his team had an idea: what if a person could track how much they've moved in a day, just by glancing at their wrist?And so, the Nike Fuelband was born.Released in 2012, in a simple, sleek, black plastic design that flashed from red to green once a person's daily fitness goal had been met, the first Fuelband sold out in hours.The pitch was this: by wearing a Fuelband and monitoring fitness data via an app or on the web, anyone - from a professional athlete to Mr Olander himself - could work out a better, more effective, path to health."In today's society, we are overwhelmed with complexity," says Mr Olander.With the Fuelband, he says, Nike really tries "to filter out what doesn't matter and just give you what you need in order to stay motivated."So what's different this time around?Nike says that in addition to making physical improvements to the latest Fuelband - better waterproofing, stainless steel screws - it has also analysed the data from the first wave of Fuelband adopters to see ways in which the band and its supporting iOS app and website could be improved.They found that 98% of their 20 million users exercised - but they didn't necessarily consistently move the recommended five minutes every hour.Now, the wristband buzzes to alert its wearer if he or she hasn't got up in a while.But Nike is not the only company experimenting with wearable technology - particularly as estimates about the potential growth in the industry range from $10bn to $50bn (£6bn to £31bn) in the next five years.Competitor Fitbit recently released a new model, and Jawbone, iHealth, Garmin, Withings and Adidas are among other firms to offer dedicated fitness-measuring gadgets.Samsung and Sony recently released a smartwatch that can monitor a user's steps, and even Apple - whose boss, Tim Cook, sits on Nike's board of directors - has expressed an interest in a device.But beyond these gadgets, Nike's main competition might not be a rival band, but the smartphone."Smartphones are going to start doing more of the tracking, and more people have them already and don't have to buy separate devices," says Sara Watson, a fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society.Already, there is a spate of apps - from MyMee to MapMyRun - capitalising on these built-in features.Beyond the competition, there is also the basic question: can wearing a wristband really make you healthier?"The notion of tracking itself has been around a long time - this is not something new," says Michael Kim, a former Microsoft Xbox executive who is now the head of Kairos Labs."The problem is tracking does not create new behaviour change - it tracks what you already do as a behaviour," says Mr Kim, whose firm works to help people cement their habits.But some doctors say the bands can help those who are already interested in exercise better tailor their workouts."We have done a number of athletic performance tracking projects with people," says Dr Paul Abramson, a physician in San Francisco who uses tracking technologies in his practice."Things like the Fuelband or more complex versions of them can be very useful for people who want to exercise more."Companies are also showing an interest in tracking sensors. In 2008 Bank of America equipped dozens of its call centre staff with special badges to study the way they interacted with each other as part of efforts to boost productivity.One technology consultant suggested several firms were now interested in using fitness equipment as a way of encouraging their staff to bond."At a symposium event last week I was talking to a couple of companies that were trying to improve employee engagement, and there's some thinking that not only are healthier employees more productive but that their sharing of information about how much they are walking, how much they are riding etc is becoming the new 'water cooler' moment," says Mike Gotta from Gartner.However, he cautions that managers should resist the temptation to see the gadgets as the human equivalent of the black boxes used by some car insurance companies to track driver behaviour."A few months back one firm made the news for saying: 'If you don't meet certain criteria we're going to charge you more per month for your healthcare.' That kind of behaviour could create a backlash," Mr Gotta warns."But if firms give these analytics to the employees for their own self-improvement and are relatively hands-off, then the workers will share the information themselves and that could create better relationships across teams."Experts also note that gadgets like the Fuelband still have plenty of room for improvement. At present the measurements it captures are not always precise.Rivals are attempting to address this by offering a wider range of sensors.Withings, for example, has built a heart-rate monitor into its Pulse tracker; Polar's Loop carries out a similar trick by connecting its wristband to a separate accessory; Fitbit includes an altimeter in its new Force wristband to count the number of stairs climbed; while Motorola's Motoactv can be linked up with bicycle-fitted sensors that measure how fast the equipment is being pedalled and its speed of travel.Sensors that measure skin temperature, perspiration and the electrical activity produced by muscles offer further opportunities."The fitness space has spawned a whole host of explorations of tracking devices in other areas," says Steve Dean, a partner at Prehype and a founder of the Quantified Self group in New York, which meets to discuss personal data tracking projects and technologies."It's almost like there's an endless amount of things that we can instrument on our body."</body>

      <body>People around the world are building their own drones. They offer a glimpse of what life will be like when the skies are filled with small, flying robots - and drones become as common as smartphones.Raphael Pirker was sitting on a bench at Washington Square Park on a blustery Friday in New York. A small drone called Discovery, a remotely controlled aircraft made by his company, TBS Avionics, was on the bench next to him.Nearby another drone was flying near a fountain. Even before he saw the drone, he heard it. "It's just like this, 'bzz-bzz'," he said.An onlooker watched the aircraft - "a beginner drone", Pirker said, crash into the pavement.Down the block hundreds of people had gathered at New York University for a Drones and Aerial Robotics Conference. Like Pirker, many of them were carrying their own drones.On a global scale the US and Israel are the world's biggest manufacturers of drones. Yet some European officials want to change the dynamic.Michel Barnier, a European Union commissioner, told a group of French journalists in July that Europeans should make their own drones, rather than rely exclusively on US- and Israeli-made ones.Pirker is also planning for the future. In Europe drones are used to make movies (see Smurfs 2). In the UK officials have granted permission to more than 130 companies and government agencies to fly drones, according to an Aerospace America report.In the US the Federal Aviation Administration has approved the use of drones for police and government agencies, issuing about 1,400 permits over the past several years.The civilian air space will reportedly be open to all kinds of drones in Europe by 2016 - and in the US by 2015. Many of these machines will be small - like the ones Pirker makes.And cheap. You can make a drone, explained South-African-born Mike Winn, of Drone Deploy, for $500 (£310).Pirker, 29, is a Swiss-Austrian who lives in Hong Kong - "for business reasons". He wears rimless glasses, the kind once worn by Apple guru Steve Jobs, and he has light blue eyes. Pirker and the others at the conference belong to a new breed of drone maker. Many are global travellers, and most grew up on drones.At the conference 14-year-old Riley Morgan approached Pirker, carrying a drone he had made. Another enthusiast, Russell de la Torre, who is 31, made his first robot, "a remote-controlled truck with cardboard boxes", at age 12.Pirker started building model airplanes when he was six. "I got bored because they were just flying circles around," he said, spinning his hand in the air in a lazy manner. As an adult he said: "I had this crazy idea of flying [a drone] over the Statue of Liberty."Everybody said, 'Don't do that - you're doing to get shot.'""It was a strange feeling," he said, describing the day three years ago when the drone flew, as shown in this head-spinning footage. "It felt a little bit eerie because you're flying past so much history, you know, about America."Drones give one a different perspective. "It's not the plane that turns in the air - it's the world that turns," he said.Drones do more than provide material for trippy videos, though. They help farmers check on crops and allow journalists to report stories. But even small drones - like the kind Pirker makes - cause problems."Every country has different rules, but we follow our own," Pirker said. "We're not going to hurt anybody. We do it with a little bit of play." Not everyone sees his drones as whimsical.Federal Aviation Administration officials tried to fine Pirker $10,000 for operating a drone in Charlottesville, Virginia, in October 2011. His lawyer filed a motion three weeks ago, describing the aircraft, a "five-pound radio-controlled model airplane constructed of styrofoam", as harmless.Small drones are usually benign. Yet they can be lethal. Roman Pirozek, 19, died last month in Brooklyn, NY, when his remote-controlled helicopter spun out of control - and hit him in the head.Small drones also provide new ways to spy. A Seattle woman felt uneasy about a drone outside her window, as she reported earlier this year on a blog.Amie Stepanovich, director of a project on domestic surveillance at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, thinks drones are cool - and said Pirker's video was "gorgeous".But drones also worry her. "They are helping to usher in a new age of physical surveillance," she said. "They provide a platform for some of the most invasive surveillance technologies we've ever seen."Pirker has a different perspective. Rather than causing anxiety, drones have helped him get over his fear of heights - a handicap, since he lives in a high-rise in Tseung Kwan O, outside of Hong Kong, on the 40th floor.As he sat on the park bench in New York, he stuck out his leg and jiggled it, showing what used to happen when he looked down from a window in a tall building.Now he said: "I just step back."</body>

      <description>Why the world’s technology giants are investing in Africa</description>

      <body>"I don't understand. Why is it that the media only seems to talk about Africa when bad things happen?"The man behind the counter at my hotel in the Ghanaian capital, Accra, was talking to me about my job, and why I was visiting.He looked genuinely pained. He told me he is a big fan of the BBC - in west Africa the World Service and language services have a big following - but it seemed to him that the media outside the continent often only noticed when bad things happened.It's arguably a fair point. That's not to say the positive stories don't get reported, but he can be forgiven for seeing the headlines and thinking all the world sees is war, famine and pestilence.In fact, Africa is booming, with growth of 5.6% predicted for 2013, according to the World Bank - although research suggests this has yet to trickle down to the very poorest on the continent.The middle class in sub-Saharan Africa is expanding rapidly. With the seemingly unstoppable growth of the mobile phone, greater access to the internet, and an increase in access to education, change is happening, and more people have more disposable income to spend.So it's no surprise that the big technology companies are investing in Africa. But is this the whole story?Is it driven by philanthropy or a desire to get in on the ground before their competitors? Or does Africa offer other opportunities? I spoke to three tech giants about why they were investing in the continent.The company has bolstered existing investments in the continent by opening a research facility in Nairobi, with the official inauguration celebration happening at the end of October.According to IBM, this is the first research facility that does both applied and exploratory research on the continent."The key thing is… the great growth story of Africa," says Dr Kamal Bhattacharya, the director of IBM Research - Africa."We know that financial inclusion is the big challenge. About 80% of the population has no access to financial services. There is the lack of access to energy, safe water, sanitation, food security."As scientists we believe that science and technology is an enabler to express your needs, it is an enabler to shape your own future."And this is why IBM is making this very significant investment into Africa, starting with Kenya. We've hired some of the top talent from all over the world, the African diaspora, people of African origin, also people who contribute to the growth of Africa, and we bring them all together here."We believe research for Africa, solving Africa's grand challenges, has to be done on the ground in Africa and this is why we set up and made this investment."His colleague, Dr Uyi Stewart, is chief scientist at the lab. Originally from Nigeria, the role has brought him and his family back to the continent after nearly 10 years in New York."People ask us: 'Can you do African research from New York?' Yes you can. It is possible, you can do research from anywhere."But you will miss the mark... In order to capture value, and deliver innovation that leads to commercially viable products that impact people's lives, we have to be here, in the local ecosystem."Fernando de Sousa heads Microsoft's 4Afrika initiative, which focuses on encouraging innovation, increasing access to technology and building skills in the local workforce.The division backs projects across the continent including access to training, roll-out of broadband in rural areas, infrastructure, agriculture and healthcare projects, as well as their App Factories, hubs designed to nurture young developers creating apps for the Windows phone platform.Building these projects has a very personal resonance for Mr de Sousa, who was born in Mozambique and ended up spending time in a South African refugee camp as a child after the outbreak of civil war."We said we want on focus on young people. We want to focus on skills, we want to focus on small and medium enterprises. We want to focus on access to technology."Let's take Kenya - so we start with TV white spaces in a village in the Maasai Mara."It's now evolved into a national policy conversation - President Kenyatta has said he wants 1.3 million students to have a [connected] device by September 2013. And he travelled to the Masai Mara to go and see what we're doing."It's not just about networks, it's not just about PCs. It's about the end economic impact, it's about the skills."[Now] we have 11 countries that have formally submitted requests for us to implement TV white spaces technology."But Mr de Sousa is clear about the motivation behind the initiative."There is a corporate social investment part of Microsoft which has nothing to do with Microsoft 4Afrika. And I think that that is a well-established process, we do a lot of donations in that space."This is about being on the ground and creating huge consumers. There's no debate about the fact that our objective is enabling economic development."In proving the value of technology as the enabler for that development, it's not just creating consumption of technology, but it's actually more importantly creating the ability for knowledge to be developed, for technology to actually be built in Africa."Because that actually drives the IT ecosystem, that drives the IT industry, that makes technology relevant."Isabel Kelly is the international director of the Salesforce.com Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the customer relationship management and services technology giant.She joined the company 11 years ago from campaigning group Amnesty International.The Foundation was started with an initial investment from the company, as well as access to Salesforce.com software, which is licensed to non-profits, and staff members volunteering.The first project in Africa for the Foundation was the suggestion of an employee, who had a brother who was volunteering in a school in the Kibagare slum in Nairobi."We gave some refurbished hardware to them, we paid for them to get the internet," Ms Kelly says."And so the school has taken on a bit of a focus on technology, we sponsored about 40 girls through the school, over the 10 years."One of the sponsored pupils from a particularly difficult background would go on to become a lawyer working for the Kenyan Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission.The Foundation has its own revenue stream from the bigger NGOs it works with (customers include the Grameen Foundation) and also funds training in how to use the Salesforce platform, and workshops for start-ups at places like Nairobi's iHub and mLab.Meanwhile, a host of social enterprises are using Salesforce tech to power their organisations - like Juhudi Kilimo, a micro-finance social enterprise, focusing on small, rural farmers in Kenya, and Honeycare, an organisation that helps farmers turn to honey production.</body>

      <title>The strange life of John McAfee</title>
      <description>The very strange life of millionaire John McAfee</description>

      <body>Who is the real John McAfee? He's the man who went on the run after his neighbour was found dead, face-up, with a bullet in his head. He's the man who jump-started the multibillion-dollar anti-virus industry. And now he thinks he can make you invisible on the internet.Within tech circles he's long been a legend. But for most people, McAfee came to prominence last year when he fled his Central American home - teeth stained, hair dyed, in disguise - rather than let himself be questioned by authorities he accused of being corrupt.He tells the BBC he had "no connection whatsoever" with his neighbour's death. Police say he remains a "person of interest".Back in the US, after posting footage of young female "friends" stroking his naked tattooed torso, he now plans to neutralise the NSA's cyber-surveillance system.It might suggest a crazed, perhaps even deranged, personality. One journalist who has interviewed McAfee many times described him a "master manipulator" who lies and deceives."I've been called paranoid, schizophrenic, the wild child of Silicon Valley," McAfee acknowledges.But he has a different perspective: "I'm an entrepreneur. I always have been. I am curious and I enjoy solving problems."I think that it's when we step out of the road, step outside the box, become our own person and we walk fearlessly down paths other people wouldn't look at, that true progress comes. And sometimes true beauty as well."We're missing that. We're missing the people who have the courage to walk into the wilderness just to see what's there."This is how Amy Emshwiller, the teenage ex-prostitute he lived with in Belize, describes him: "He's sweet, generous. He likes to like adventures. He's serious and usually he has a dark sense of humour. He's generally a sweet guy. He just doesn't like to be [expletive] with."So, who is the real John McAfee?To have any chance of knowing and gaining an informed opinion of what really motivated his erratic-sounding behaviour after the killing of Gregory Faull, you must travel deep into the 68-year-old's past.Despite his Southern accent, the bleached-blond and goateed businessman is in fact half-British - the son of an Englishwoman who met an American soldier stationed in the UK during World War II."I feel as much British as I do American," McAfee says. "There's not much difference between our countries."They moved to Virginia when he was young, where he had a troubled childhood. His father was an abusive alcoholic who, when McAfee was aged 15, shot himself dead. In the following years, McAfee says, he too began drinking heavily and taking drugs, but still managed to maintain a promising academic career.That came to an end in the late 1960s when Northeast State Louisiana State College terminated his PhD in mathematics after it was revealed that he had slept with an undergraduate he was mentoring.They later married and McAfee turned his skills to a series of programming jobs with some of the biggest tech organisations of the time including Nasa, General Electric, Siemens, Univac and Xerox, all the while continuing to indulge in his addictions."Most of my bosses also used drugs of some kind," he says. "I was in the tech field, after all, we were the leading edge in technology and the leading age in personal experimentation."I had to hide it from my mother and sometimes from my wife. But in the work environment - depending on where you worked - in some companies drugs were taken openly at lunchtime in people's offices. It was a bizarre time."Matters came to a head in the early 1980s after his wife left him, his most recent employer, Omex, let him go and the scale of his drug dependency forced him to seek help."It was 1984, the last time that I took drugs, drank alcohol or sold drugs for that matter," he says."I simply stopped. I started going to an organisation called Alcoholics Anonymous... and that was my last taste of that world."However, it is still with me. My body is covered with tattoos from that period. And I'm afraid some of my ideas and concepts and attitudes that were moulded during that time are still with me. That's why people think, perhaps, I'm a little bit off the wall."Despite his troubles, McAfee managed to land a job at defence contractor Lockheed Martin, where he worked on a classified voice-recognition program.There he came across an unusual bit of self-replicating code designed to copy itself on to any floppy disk inserted into affected computers. When examined, it contained the message: "Welcome to the dungeon. Beware of this VIRUS.""When I first read about the Pakistani Brain virus, I'd never heard of a virus before, neither had anyone in technology," remembers McAfee. "It fascinated me."He worked out a way to disinfect the computers and then spread the cure via the bulletin board system, a precursor to the web.The challenge inspired him to set up a business of his own: McAfee Associates - a firm that would later be sold, years after he had left, to Intel for more than $7.6bn (£4.7bn)."I knew the field would become extremely large because people being who they are, there will always be hackers," he says."It's why we have graffiti on the walls of the inner city. People like to deface things. They like to disrupt things."So, given that fact, computer viruses were not going to go away and were only going to get worse. I just did what I could to be at the forefront of that industry for as long as I could."Despite this, he says, he has never himself used any of the products made by the firm that continues to bear his name."I'm constantly under attack, yet I use no software protection."I protect myself by constantly changing my IP [internet protocol] address, by not attaching my name to any device I use, and by not going on to sites where you might pick up a virus."Porn sites, for example, I just don't go there."Secondly, I practise safe computing. If someone sends me an email with a link, I'm not going there until I can call the person to verify that they sent me the email."It sounds absurd to live that way, but I would rather trust my own devices and thoughts than someone else's software."After selling his stake in the business in 1994, McAfee went on to found and sell other companies, including an instant messaging system, a firewall provider and a ranch from which he offered flights in "trikes" - low-flying, engine-powered cabins suspended from hang-gliders.Then he headed south.In 2008, at an age others might be thinking of putting up their feet, McAfee moved to the jungle of Belize with the stated intention of trying to cure another kind of infection."I came across a concept called quorum sensing, which is the technique that bacteria use to communicate with each other."Up until about 10 years ago we didn't even know that bacteria did communicate, but we find out they have a very sophisticated communication system. I wanted to explore and investigate that to see if we could come up with new antibiotics."He picked the area, he says, because the plants that grew along the country's Rio Nuevo river contained compounds that inhibit bacteria from sending chemical signals to each other and thus thwart their ability to co-ordinate an attack.Things didn't go as planned.The first sign of trouble was when journalists invited to his Carmelita, Orange Walk, base wrote stories that made clear they did not know what to make of the operation.Then a falling-out with the microbiologist he was working with, Allison Adonizio, put the project at risk when she quit.Dr Adonizio, who is now based in Philadelphia, did not want to be interviewed.In April 2012, matters came to a head when the Belize police force's Gang Suppression Unit raided the research facility.McAfee says the officers claimed they suspected it was being used to make the illegal psycho-stimulant methamphetamine.They shot his dog, he says, confiscated both his passport and licensed weapons on the property, and briefly imprisoned him before dropping the charges."Under no circumstances did they really believe it was a meth lab," he states."Everybody knew it was a biotech lab because I had hired half of the people in the village to work there. They all knew what I was doing."It's a pirate haven. It's an extremely corrupt and dangerous place."I knew this and my friends all advised me against it. I just thought I was smart enough to sidestep it. Unfortunately, I was not."I was there for a year and the local politician sent a representative and asked for $2m for a campaign donation. I said no. Two weeks later they raided my compound."McAfee says when he was asked a second time for the cash he went on a publicity blitz, posting messages online, and speaking to local and international press about the incident. It became political.The Belize Times - published by the leading opposition party - suggested the "barbaric assault" on McAfee was a "global black eye" for the nation and a threat to its tourist industry."I do wish that I were smarter socially," reflects McAfee."I think I have the ability to solve mathematical equations and programming issues very easily, but I am a little bit naive in some social situations. And certainly in Belize I was way naive."At the time of the raid, McAfee had begun an affair with a 16-year-old ex-prostitute he had met on Belize Independence Day."I was partying, I was drinking, and I went into this bar and the owner said a friend wants to meet me and likes me," remembers Amy Emshwiller, who still lives in Belize."[He said] can I have your number, and then two weeks later he called me."She says he was unaware she was less than a quarter of his age."He didn't know how old I was. I lied to him saying I was 18, and he thought it was OK."I let him fall in love first before I told him my age."When I told him he was so [expletive] shocked that he didn't know what to do. He was baffled. And he was like: 'I still love you, I don't know what to do. I'm in love with a young girl.' That's how that happened."McAfee's long-term American girlfriend left him. And like many things in his life, the new affair proved complicated.One night Emshwiller took McAfee's gun. She aimed it at his head, squeezed her eyes shut and pulled the trigger. She missed.He continued the relationship."Amy, for one - and many girls in Belize - has a horrific story of abuse that if I told you, you could not believe it," McAfee explains."Of course she's not going to be well. Of course she's going to have issues."When she tried to shoot me in the head what I saw was a frightened child."What I saw was a confused girl who had been so abused - physically, sexually, emotionally - beyond any description."What are you going to do? Throw her out? That doesn't help her."All she did was burst my eardrum. I'm deaf in one ear now, but I don't have a bullet in my head. Forgiveness is one of the graces that we have as human beings. Can I be faulted for indulging in it?"Emshwiller confirms the event but says she wanted to scare, not kill, him after he had said he wanted another girl. She adds it was not the only such incident provoked by her jealousy."One time before, I held him in the corner and I put a knife at his throat," she says."And he just said: 'Go ahead. Kill me.' And I couldn't do it. I just dropped the knife and walked out."Following the raid, McAfee and Emshwiller moved to his villa at San Pedro - a town on Belize's biggest island, Ambergris Caye - where they agreed to have an open relationship.There they were visited by Chad Essley, a cartoonist, who began collaborating on a book about McAfee's life."I didn't quite realise that his lifestyle would be this older guy surrounded by young girls and bodyguards with guns," he says."Many of these girls were former prostitutes or had very rough lives."It was expressly forbidden to go out in the town and drink - the smell of alcohol, he could not be around it. He didn't want any of the girls doing any drugs at all."I interviewed each of these girls, got their background. They were incredibly sad. They were definitely in a better sort of situation being around John."Meanwhile next door, Gregory Faull, an Orlando sports bar owner who had recently divorced and decided to live in his Belize holiday home, was becoming increasingly irate at his neighbour's activities.On Thursday, 8 November 2012, McAfee made the local headlines when he donated 40 stun guns, handcuffs and batons to the local police at a press conference.Mayor Daniel Guerrero thanked him, stating: "Crime is affecting the tourism industry as we have been listed on travel advisories; it is time to stop this. Let us protect our industry and turn San Pedro into the safe haven once more."That night the local TV bulletin declared that "the hatchet was formally buried", suggesting the rift between McAfee and Belize's authorities had ended.Early on Sunday morning, Mr Faull was found dead in a pool of his blood by his housekeeper. Police called to the scene found a single 9mm shell nearby. They said a mobile phone and laptop were missing but there were no visible signs of a forced entry.The head of the police's Gang Suppression Unit told a local newspaper that his officers wanted to speak to McAfee as part of the investigation, but when they called at his house he did not appear to be in.An article posted the following day by Wired magazine revealed why.McAfee told the publication he had seen the officers approaching and had hidden in the sand of his property putting a cardboard box over his head.He recalls that his caretaker had told him of Mr Faull's murder, and now he feared for his own life."The first thing that came to my mind was, 'Oh, my Lord. The government is finally trying to rid themselves of me,' he says."The government does from time to time."I had certainly been a huge thorn in their side, and they had simply got the wrong white man."Seriously, this is what went through my mind. My friends sort of calmed me down, and later said that's absurd. At the time I did not think so."McAfee acknowledges that he and Mr Faull had been at odds, but plays down the idea they hated each other or that he suspected him of being the person who had fed two of Emshwiller's dogs a poisoned tortilla."The entire five years I was there, I'd said maybe 15 words to him," he says."He did not like my dogs and the past two occasions I had seen him walking on the beach he complained. But so did everybody."There was no ongoing argument. Yeah, he was mad about my dogs. Maybe as I'm beginning to think now, maybe he was the one who poisoned them. At the time I certainly did not believe that."In fact, as ABC News later revealed, Mr Faull had filed a complaint to Mayor Guerrero about McAfee the previous month.It said McAfee's dog had attacked a tourist; that his security guards had "terrified" other residents by walking around with shotguns and shining lights in their eyes, and that taxis and other traffic had been arriving at his property "at all hours", causing a disturbance."I did not find that out until weeks after I came back to the States," says McAfee when pressed about this."Belize is not like America where you file a complaint and then the police come out and chase things out. You file a complaint and it goes into a drawer."McAfee then went on the run, saying he feared he would be "silenced" if he was caught and thrown in jail.It made headlines worldwide, in no small part due to the fact that he was posting updates to a blog and giving frequent interviews - actions he says were designed to ensure he couldn't be made to disappear if he had been caught."I disguised myself as a ragged salesman," he recalls."All it takes is some dirty clothes and not bathing for a few days and not combing my hair."You know, people saw my photograph everywhere because all of the police and army had it for that month and a half I was underground. I just made sure I looked different than that."Questioned about the affair, Dean Barrow, Belize's prime minister, made it clear McAfee was not an official murder suspect, and had only been classed instead a "person of interest"."I don't want to be unkind to the gentleman, but I believe he is extremely paranoid, even bonkers," the politician added.During this time McAfee continued to see Emshwiller."When he was on the run I went for lunches with him and then he would call and say: 'Come to this place, or go there,' she recalls."How to come, when to come. Not to go out, or stay home, or go to a different location. He would tell me that so nobody would get me."She adds that she regrets she did not go with him when he finally decided to escape the country.The next major development came on 3 December when a reporter and photographer from Vice magazine revealed they were documenting McAfee's life on the run.In what proved a frustrating twist for the tech guru, they then unwittingly revealed he had crossed the border to Guatemala - a fact revealed by a photo uploaded to the Vice website by staff at its headquarters, who failed to wipe its location data."I had gone out of my way to arrange the escape and I was breathing easily and looking forward to a few days of relaxation," remembers McAfee."We immediately had to go on the run again because we were in Guatemala illegally at this point. But it was no-one's real fault. It was just the fault of the moment."A few days later McAfee was arrested. There was initially speculation he would be sent back to Belize, but a week later he was allowed to fly to Miami a free man."After it was over I asked myself, 'Good Lord, I must have been afraid,'" he says."But I really can't remember. I remember merely trying to solve the problems that occurred as they occurred."McAfee has offered a $25,000 bounty for information relating to Mr Faull's death, but says an attempt to contact the victim's family proved unsuccessful.The family has called the reward a "hollow gesture" and suggested if McAfee really wanted to help he would have met with the Belize police.A spokesman for the country's government said its authorities still wanted to speak to the businessman."Mr McAfee's claims and his behaviour have been extreme," he told the BBC."The investigation is ongoing and McAfee remains a person of interest. If McAfee were to respond to questioning it would make a difference to the progress of the investigation - but this is currently out of the hands of the government of Belize."So long as the crime remains unsolved, it is inevitable the entrepreneur will always face suspicion. But he says he can live with that."There's always going to be someone who likes you and someone who dislikes you," he says."Someone who thinks you're a hero and some that think you're a villain. You know I just do what I can in situations like this to continue to state that I'm totally innocent."That doesn't mean he is trying to forget his time in Belize.In addition to the graphic novel, he is working with a Canadian firm to make both a documentary and a movie about his time there.He adds that George Jung - the imprisoned cocaine drugs lord portrayed by Johnny Depp in the film Blow - has been picked to write his biography.While those projects brew, McAfee has returned to Silicon Valley, announcing the forthcoming launch of a $100 gadget that he promises can make you invisible on the net."If you cannot see it, you cannot hack it, you cannot look at it, you cannot spy on anything happening inside it," he explains.He says the D-Central units will fit in people's pockets and allow their phones, tablets and PCs to communicate with other owners' devices within a three-block radius.He adds they can also connect to the net anonymously via a node - a separate piece of equipment attached to the network - either directly or with their encrypted data relayed relayed via other D-Central boxes.Each will frequently change their network identifier - a long number used by devices as an ID - making them hard to track, he explains.He suggests it will appeal to college students who want to copy music anonymously and to businesses wanting to prevent the theft of corporate secrets.He's also well aware that in the light of Edward Snowden's leaks about surveillance techniques used by the US and UK governments, part of the appeal will be thwarting their efforts."You know from their own paranoia and desire to stay in power, they are watching everything they can," he says.Will the tech work? Will he really frustrate the authorities once again?At this point, like so much of John McAfee's life, it's impossible to be sure of all the facts and it's ultimately up to you whether you take him at his word.</body>

      <body>Campaigners are calling for restrictions on the way magazines airbrush photos. Seeing your face and body transformed is an unnerving experience.My guilty pleasure is fashion and gossip magazines. I will check out those unflattering bikini shots of celebrities and be amazed at how their "fat-busting diet" did such a great job on their abs in just six weeks. Or swoon over the flawless skin of that A-lister advertising the latest £10,000 handbag in just her pants and wonder, "Why doesn't my skin/hair/teeth look like that?"It's no secret that advertisers and magazines use airbrushing to give their images an aspirational sheen. It's been happening for years.In 2008 it was reported that magazines could soon be banned from using airbrushed photographs of celebrities, such was the anxiety over teenage eating disorders.It didn't happen.Women and equalities minister Jo Swinson says that manipulating people's bodies in photographs is "one of the most pernicious types of retouching". But she's against a ban.It would be hard to police. The responsibility is on people taking photographs and creating the images afterwards to "think about the audience their image is going to and what is appropriate", she says.Normally the debate is cast in terms of teenage girls and whether they are being sold a false reality.But what does it actually feel like to be airbrushed? I decided to find out.I wasn't brave enough to be photographed with no make-up so I had a base layer of foundation and powder as well as minimal eye make-up and some blusher and lip-gloss.Photoshoots are a weird experience."Look to the side... put your hands on your hips... smile... don't smile... don't smile so widely," I'm told.Photographer Sarah Brimley helps me relax to try to get my best "natural" picture. She has worked with some of the biggest models in fashion as well as a number of celebrities.It's standard to retouch photos for small things like skin, fixing stray hairs, she says. "Digital cameras are so sharp that retouching is even more necessary because you can see every little blemish on the skin. In film you never used to see that."Extreme airbrushing is rare, she believes.The exception is celebrities. "They'll say can you make my nose different-shaped or make me slimmer. It happens with almost every celebrity we photograph." The most common request is to make the waist "go in a bit" or make the legs longer, she says.Insiders know all this. "But the general public who don't understand the industry, they think these people look like that and they don't," Brimley says.She did a lovely job with my photos and I thought the untouched images were actually quite flattering.Then it was time for the post-production.It was a brutal experience.Like most fashion photographers, Brimley does post-production on all the pictures she takes, but never to extremes. But I wanted to see what was possible so I asked her to do a more extreme job than she would ever normally do.She took around 10 years and three stone off me. All in less than an hour.Every blemish vanished from my skin, as did the scar on my forehead. She whitened my face, lengthened my neck, changed the shape of my nose, widened my eyes, elongated my legs, sliced off parts of my arms and thighs and narrowed my hips.Suddenly the original images that I was quite happy with at the start, looked old, tired and a bit chubby.Georgina Wilkin, 23, a former model who developed an eating disorder because of the pressures of the job, recognises the phenomenon."I've had a few times where I've worked for a magazine and the magazine's come out and I hardly even recognise myself. My legs have been skimmed off, my pores have been eliminated, my nose has been straightened. "The result can be humiliating. "I felt awful - you feel that what you are as a human being isn't good enough."Magazines are not shackled by rules. In 2003 there was controversy after GQ editor Dylan Jones admitted airbrushing a cover image of Kate Winslet, who spoke in the interview about the attractions of curvier women.In contrast, adverts are covered by regulations.The Advertising Standards Authority says there's nothing inherently wrong with retouching images. Only 63 of its 30,000 complaints last year related to post-production.But airbrushing must be done responsibly, says Vena Raffle, the agency's head of investigations. "We step in where we think the techniques lead the ad to be misleading, harmful or offensive, or where it's socially irresponsible."That last definition is hard to pin down. Is it socially irresponsible to make an actress's legs longer and arms skinnier in a photo?And what about giving extremely skinny women bigger breasts and hips? In 2010 the former editor of Cosmopolitan admitted to airbrushing anorexic models to make them look healthier.Airbrushing is creating impossible expectations, Wilkin argues. "Models in magazines and mannequins in shops - that body is not achievable. It seems like it's moving further and further away from reality."Eating disorder charity Beat is calling for a ban on airbrushing that changes the shape of the body. Susan Ringwood, its chief executive, says people have become so used to this alternative norm that they no longer notice. "Because it's everywhere we've lost some of our critical faculties in understanding this is no longer real."There's an alternative view - that this is just an inevitable part of technological change. "In the old days it was lots of make-up, very careful selection of models and good lighting and countless takes with cameramen and lighting engineers, who made sure the absolutely perfect take was got," says Ian Twinn of the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers. "Now it can be done more quickly, people can manipulate and change, airbrush and digitally enhance the image afterwards."Consumers are not stupid, he says. They know and want to buy into a dream, he argues. The same could be said for magazine readers or TV viewers.It's not clear what effect this is having on today's teenagers.Jemma, a 14 year-old schoolgirl who wants to be a model or actor, uses post-production techniques herself.She edits the selfies that she puts on social media. "Sometimes I like how I look naturally but you have to take loads of pictures to get the right one. Most of the pictures I put on Instagram or Facebook will be edited. I'll lighten them, hide spots, things like that."Even though she is aware of airbrushing techniques, Jemma says it is something she forgets about while flicking through a glossy magazine. "Because I'm not thinking about it, you just think they're really skinny and that must be real."Looking again at my airbrushed images, there's something else I lost - any sign of a personality. I look like a clone, almost inhuman. My head is too big for my skinny body, the portrait picture doesn't seem to look like me at all.The models used in these magazines are of course naturally stunning and won't need anywhere near the work I had, but it's simultaneously comforting and frightening how much they can change a person.So next time I see that flawless face or those impossibly long legs and think, "Why don't I look like that?", I'll remind myself, that with a bit of help from Photoshop, I actually can.Having seen the result, it's not a look I'll be revisiting any time soon.Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on FacebookHave you airbrushed yourself?Send your pictures and videos to yourpics@bbc.co.uk or text them to 61124 (UK) or +44 7624 800 100 (International).

      <body>A former BBC radio presenter described as a "dominant predator" has been found guilty of sexually abusing boys.Ex-BBC Radio Norfolk and Radio Clyde broadcaster Michael Souter, 60, was convicted of 19 sexual assaults on seven boys aged between 11 and 16.Souter was a Venture Scouts leader, a volunteer mentor to young people and was even allowed to adopt a child.Judge Mark Lucraft warned him he faced "a long period of imprisonment" when he is sentenced on 31 October.Souter, of Loddon, Norfolk, stared straight ahead without emotion as the judge spoke.The jury at Norwich Crown Court also found him guilty of seven counts of making and possessing indecent images of under-18s, after a six-week trial.The court heard Souter used his celebrity status to abuse his victims.He carried out the attacks between 1979 and 1999.The jury of nine men and three women took three hours to reach verdicts.Det Con Peter Sayer, who led the Norfolk Police investigation, said: "Souter used various opportunities to abuse children whilst being in a position of absolute trust."Chris McCann, head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) complex casework unit for the East of England, said: "Michael Souter presented himself to people as a local celebrity from radio and television, happy to be involved in charity events, the Scout movement and as a youth mentor for Norfolk social services."All this was a smokescreen to hide his true intention: to become close to young boys so he could sexually abuse them, confident that his celebrity status would mean they would not be believed."A BBC spokesperson said: "The crimes that Michael Souter has been found guilty of today are truly shocking and the BBC condemns them in the strongest possible terms."Michael Souter has not worked for the BBC since the early 1990s."</body>

      <body>A school which let pupils as young as 11 smoke in the playground has been ordered to stop the practice.Leeds City Council education bosses stepped in after learning children at Elmete Central School in Roundhay, Leeds, were allowed to smoke.It is understood cigarettes were confiscated at the start of the day but returned at break times in an attempt to stop pupils playing truant.Elmete caters for 75 pupils with educational and behavioural issues.Paul Brennan, deputy director for children's services, said the council spoke with the school's recently-appointed head teacher Lesley Boyd as soon as it was made aware pupils were smoking on the premises.He said he was now "confident" the practice had ceased."The recently-appointed head teacher has agreed to review any such practices, and to make sure this does not happen in the future we will conduct unannounced visits by local authority staff," he said."We have a strict no-smoking policy in all of our schools and encourage them to promote healthy lifestyles to all pupils."A council spokesman added that Lesley Boyd was not the head teacher at the time the policy was introduced.</body>

      <title>Teachers' strike closes schools</title>
      <description>Thousands of schools close across much of England as teachers strike over pay, pensions and jobs.</description>

      <body>Thousands of schools are closed across much of England as teachers strike over pay, pensions and jobs.Teachers in London, Cumbria, the South East, North East and South West have been taking part with nearly 3,500 schools shut or partially closed.The action is part of a continuing campaign of regional strikes involving members of the NUT and NASUWT unions.Prime Minister David Cameron said the strike was "inconvenient for parents" and "not good for pupils' education".NUT general secretary Christine Blower, said the union regretted the disruption caused to pupils and parents but teachers felt they had "no other choice".Major rallies have been taking place in Bristol, Durham and London, with smaller events in other areas, including Brighton, Carlisle and Plymouth.Teachers are objecting to proposals by Education Secretary Michael Gove to bring in performance-related pay, increase their workloads and make changes to their pensions.Twenty out of 33 London boroughs have provided information to BBC London 94.9 about the number of schools affected so far.Of those, about 445 schools are completely closed and 450 partially closed.And in Tyne and Wear, at least 471 schools have been affected by the industrial action.Head teacher Roberta Kirby, from Fernhurst Junior School, in Portsmouth, said the government had "declared war" on teachers.More than 200 schools in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight are affected by the action.She said: "If we cannot offer good wages and a pension that staff pay into that reflects the work they do, then we are not going to be able to attract the best graduates."Responding to the impact of the strike, some parents said they had found it difficult to find alternative childcare.The BBC's Sarah Ransome said: "People in Plymouth have been telling me that finding alternative childcare because of the strike has been 'quite a headache'."A similar walkout by teachers took place in the east of England, the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber region on 1 October.Ms Blower said: "Mr Gove has done nothing to address the crisis of low morale in the teaching profession which threatens the continued provision of high quality education."Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said the "overwhelming majority of teachers" were on strike.She said: "Teachers are committed and dedicated public service workers. They do not take strike action lightly."No teacher has any wish to inconvenience parents or disrupt pupils' education, but this action is not the failure or due to the unreasonableness, of teachers."Plans for a national one-day walkout before Christmas have also been announced by the two unions.Speaking to BBC Sussex, Mr Cameron said responsibility for the strike "lies with the teaching unions"."I think it is very disappointing they have decided to go on strike," he said."And when we look at the things they are striking over, pensions and pay, they are things that have been decided independently by well-led reviews."I was at my children's school today in London. One class was not there but the rest of the school was operating."So, every praise to those teachers who have gone ahead and kept our schools open for our kids."A spokeswoman for the Department for Education (DfE) said 27% of the schools in the affected regions were closed, however, there was no figure available for how many were partially closed.She said: "The NUT and NASUWT have tried to create as much disruption for pupils and parents today as possible."In spite of this, thanks to many hardworking teachers and heads, only around a quarter of schools in the targeted regions were closed today."</body>

      <title>Muslim free school 'dysfunctional'</title>
      <description>A Muslim free school in Derby is criticised by Ofsted inspectors as "dysfunctional" and rated inadequate in every category,</description>

      <body>A Muslim free school has been damned by Ofsted inspectors as "dysfunctional" and rated inadequate in every category - within a year of it opening.An inspection at Derby's Al-Madinah school was brought forward after fears were raised over teaching standards.The report says teachers there are inexperienced and have not been provided with proper training and that the school requires special measures.The school said it accepted the report and would use it to move forward.Reacting to the findings, David Cameron told BBC Radio Derby: "If they don't take immediate action to deal with these things then I think it is right it should close and I think it's absolutely right to intervene rapidly when these things aren't working properly."However, he added: "Let's not use this as a stick with which to beat the whole free school movement - there are now hundreds of schools which have set up as free schools, and on average they have more outstanding and good ratings than established schools."When it goes wrong - just as with a state school - you've got to get in there and sort it out, or close it down," he said.The Ofsted inspection had been due to take place by the end of the year but was prioritised following initial allegations that female teachers were obliged to wear hijabs and boys and girls were segregated.The school has since written to pupils and staff telling them there is no requirement to cover their hair.Education minister Lord Nash last week warned the school it faced closure unless discrimination against female staff and pupils stopped.A spokesperson said: "We were already investigating this school before allegations became public. We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection."We have received a response from the Al-Madinah Education Trust as well as a report on the school from Ofsted. Any decisions made will take into account all the available evidence."The Ofsted report found that pupils were given the same work "regardless of their different abilities" and the governing body was "ineffective".It said basic systems were not in place, describing the school as being "in chaos" and "dysfunctional".Boys and girls had different lunch sittings but the report said this was due to the small size of the canteen.Inspectors gave the school the lowest ranking - "inadequate" - in every area, prompting the chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw to call for it to be placed in special measures.This means Ofsted will carry out inspections at the school at short notice to monitor improvements. If poor performance continues the school could be closed.Dr Stuart Wilson, the acting head teacher, said there were "significant and serous problems" at the school and accepted some of the lessons were not meeting necessary standards."Are special measures a disaster for the school? Yes, they are," said Dr Wilson."It's not where we want the school to be at this time but we accept the report."In one mathematics lesson, described by Ofsted as "insufficiently challenging", pupils spent the majority of their time cutting out and pasting shapes.Dr Wilson said the school, which has 412 pupils aged between four and 16, had a lot of issues to deal with but he insisted it did have a future."Obviously the report doesn't make pleasant reading for anybody - we don't want to be in this position - we wish we weren't in this position - but what we need to do now is to accept the report in full and use it to move the school forward."Writing to the school's chair of governors on Thursday, Lord Nash said the Ofsted report was "further compelling evidence of the breaches of the funding agreement I have required you to address"."Contrary to your suggestion that I have acted prematurely, I am even more convinced of the need for very decisive and urgent action on the part of the trust to comply with all your obligations and remedy the serious failings at the school."Chris Williamson, MP for Derby North, said: "Frankly, the position of Al-Madinah school is now untenable and I would fully expect the school to close and for the children to be found alternative places in the council schools in the city."Speaking in Parliament earlier, shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said the Ofsted report was a "devastating blow to the education secretary's flagship policy".He said: "It reveals that pupils have been failed on every possible measure and parents will want to know why the education secretary has allowed this to happen."He described the government's free school programme as a "dangerous free-for-all"."David Cameron and Michael Gove can no longer ignore this issue - it is a crisis entirely of their own making," he said.But speaking at the weekend, Mr Hunt told BBC One's Andrew Marr programme that although Labour would not open new free schools "along the Michael Gove model", the bulk of existing free schools would be kept open as his party wanted to "keep the good free schools".Responding to Mr Hunt's more recent comments, the schools minister David Laws said that the government had taken "swift action" to deal with failings at the Al-Madinah free school told MPs that no school would be allowed to "languish in failure".He also accused Labour of "total and utter opportunism" using the report "to shift its position".</body>

      <body>Six British soldiers who died in an Afghan bomb blast claimed by the Taliban were "unlawfully killed on active service", a coroner has ruled.The six men were on patrol in a Warrior armoured vehicle when it was caught in an explosion on 6 March last year.Recording a narrative verdict, Oxfordshire coroner Darren Salter said there was "nothing their comrades could have done to rescue or save them".A series of improvements have been made to Warriors since the incident.Sgt Nigel Coupe, 33, of 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, was killed alongside Cpl Jake Hartley, 20, Pte Anthony Frampton, 20, Pte Christopher Kershaw, 19, Pte Daniel Wade, 20, and Pte Daniel Wilford, 21, all of 3rd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment.The attack, which was so powerful it turned their vehicle upside down and blew off its gun turret, was the biggest single loss of life in an enemy attack for UK Afghanistan forces since 2001.The inquest heard evidence from pathologists who said the men were likely to have been killed or rendered unconscious immediately by the blast.Mr Salter said: "This, of course, is a tragic loss of these six soldiers and these young lives."At least it is very clear from the evidence of the two pathologists and the evidence of those who witnessed the strike that they did not suffer."He said he was "not going to second-guess decisions of commanders in a courtroom today; that is not the purpose of an inquest"."These are experienced commanders who took decisions on the ground, balancing the risks and exercising judgements," he added.Oxford Coroner's Court heard on Thursday from Warrior expert Maj Douglas Nelson who said it had been "a very large device - and what I would say is, no vehicle that we had was designed to take that"."It was a large device - the effects were worse than what we anticipated," he added.He said that, while the Mastiff armoured vehicle was specifically designed with improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in mind, the Warrior was "infinitely more capable" of fighting at night, when the attack took place."Of any vehicle, I would travel in Warrior," he said."It's as good as we can make it."He said improvements made to the vehicles since the attack included thicker armour, better fire-fighting and detection systems and an improved fuel tank.</body>

      <body>A coroner has pleaded guilty to a £2m fraud that saw him steal some of the money from the estates of dead people.Gloucestershire coroner Alan Crickmore, 57, of East Approach Drive, Cheltenham pleaded guilty to 24 counts of fraud at Southwark Crown Court.Police said Crickmore had been stealing money while acting as probate and using the cash as his own "piggy bank".Crickmore was bailed and electronically tagged ahead of a sentencing hearing on 28 November.The guilty plea followed a police inquiry into alleged breaches of the solicitors' code of conduct and accounting rules.He was suspended from his post in December 2010 and has now resigned.Alan C Crickmore Solicitors, which had an office in Cheltenham, was closed down by the Solicitors Regulation Authority in December 2010.An authority spokesman said it was likely Crickmore would face a tribunal over his actions.He said a final decision would be made after Crickmore was sentenced.Det Ch Insp Dave Sellwood said Crickmore's plea came after being "faced with overwhelming evidence".The coroner stole some of the money after gaining power of attorney for elderly people who had "lost their mental capacity"."[Crickmore] stole what he wanted when he wanted," said Det Ch Insp Sellwood."He was propping up a lifestyle he couldn't afford - regular cruises, fine dining, various holidays, buying a house in the country."By many standards that would be considered to be living quite a high lifestyle and he could only fund that lifestyle by stealing from his clients."He was brought in to deal with probate and to wind up estates and, rather than give all of the monies to beneficiaries, he stole some of the monies from what would have been the beneficiaries."Councillor Will Windsor-Clive, from Gloucestershire County Council, said the case had been "really frustrating" while they waited for it to come to court."While we run the coroner's service in the county, we don't employ the coroner and only the Lord Chancellor can dismiss him. As a result we've had no power to take action."Mr Crickmore has offered his resignation and I hope we can now move forward."</body>

      <body>Analysis of two bodies found buried in a garden has shown one probably had a distinctive spinal condition like that of a missing woman.The discovery in Blenheim Close, Forest Town, Nottinghamshire was made after a tip-off and prompted a murder inquiry.Patricia Wycherley, who lived there, was understood to have the spinal problem. The other body is believed to belong to her husband, Bill.The pair, who have not been formally identified, were last seen in 1998.Detectives have said the remains appear to have been in the garden for some time, and the couple, who would now be 100 and 79 years old respectively.Det Ch Insp Rob Griffin, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "This latest development does further support our theory that the remains are that of the Wycherleys."With help from relatives and old friends we are starting to build a picture of their lives and, more importantly, their movements in 1998, when neighbours say they simply disappeared."While we have learned some things about Bill, also known as Geoff, little is known about Pat. We believe her maiden name was Moore."The historic nature of the inquiry means it is a long and complex process."The force said formal identification of the bodies could still take some time to confirm.Forensic tests revealed one of the bodies was an elderly white man who was older than 60.He was well-built and between 5ft 7in (1.70m) to 5ft 9in (1.75m) tall.The second set of remains are most likely to be that of a well-built white woman, who was aged 40 or older and 5ft 5ins (1.65m) to 5ft7in (1.70m) tall.Post-mortem examinations, conducted last Friday, could not reveal the cause of death or identity of the bodies.</body>

      <body>The number of badgers shot during a six-week cull in Gloucestershire has fallen short of its target, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has told MPs.Defra said 708 badgers had been killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650.Nigel Gibbens, chief veterinary officer, advised it should be extended. This could be for eight weeks.Badger campaigners have called the scheme a "massive failure" and said they would continue their protest .Mr Gibbens said extending the cull would achieve the "earliest and greatest possible impact" on bovine TB in Gloucestershire.Defra said Natural England was currently considering the application to extend the licence in Gloucestershire and a decision is "expected shortly".Mr Paterson told the BBC the cull figures were "not bad news" but admitted that those carrying out the killings had "got off to a slower start" in Gloucestershire."We must remember that these are pilots," he said."This has not been done before and we are learning, clearly, in each area. This isn't a sudden six-week period. These pilots are intended to go on for four years."Up to to the end of July, a further 20,000 perfectly healthy cattle have been hauled off to slaughter at horrendous expense to the taxpayer because we've lost control of TB."Mr Paterson said 305,000 cattle had been "lost" over the past 10 years and it was "not acceptable" to allow the disease to go on.The badger cull in Gloucestershire ended this week. A licence was granted last week to extend the badger cull in Somerset until 1 November.Defra said early indications from Gloucestershire are that, as in Somerset, the pilot had been "safe and humane".The government's original target was 2,900 badgers, based on a population estimate of 3,400 animals. The target was then revised to 1,650, from a population of 2,350.Last week Mr Paterson said the government was exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB.Stop the Badger Cull spokesman Jay Tiernan said the cull had been a "massive failure"."It's disgraceful," he said. "It clearly isn't safe, effective or humane."It is time for someone to bite the bullet and admit it's been a failure."Mr Tiernan said protests against the culls would continue.</body>

      <title>Family fights 84-day disability rule</title>
      <description>A Warrington family is challenging a government rule which saw their disabled son's benefit taken away while he was in hospital.</description>

      <body>A family whose disabled son's benefit was taken away while he was in hospital, have challenged the government rule.Cameron Mathieson spent more than two years in Alder Hey Hospital with cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy.His family argue they acted as full-time carers until the five-year-old's death, in October 2012.Government guidelines state Disability Living Allowance (DLA) is not payable after the first 84 days in hospital.Cameron's father Craig, said they were challenging "this grossly unfair rule in Cameron's name" and plan to take the government to the Court of Appeal.He said: "Cameron had a unique combination of conditions and was the only such patient in the world with both cystic fibrosis and Duchenne's muscular dystrophy in the genetic combination he had."While he was in hospital, my wife and I remained his primary caregivers and one of us stayed by his bedside at every waking moment, caring for him, nursing him, keeping him happy, bringing his brothers and sister to see him and play with him, giving medicines - far more than the hourly checks that he would have received on such a busy ward."Abdicating Cameron's care to hospital staff during this time was simply not an option because they had made it clear to us how much they depended upon our input, yet after 84 days his DLA was suspended, along with Carer's Allowance and our National Insurance contributions, putting unbearable financial and emotional pressure on us as a family."Children's charities Contact a Family and Children's Trust are backing the Mathieson's challenge and have written to Esther McVey, Minister for Disabled People, about the issue.They have estimated there are up to 500 cases of children affected by this rule each year in the UK, with parents often staying with their child around the clock.Dalton Leong, chief executive of The Children's Trust, said: "Current DLA regulations mean that some of the UK's most severely disabled and sick children are being denied financial assistance at a time when they need it most."Removing DLA from a child, leads to the parents losing their Carer's Allowance and in some cases other benefits. This can prove financially devastating for families with severely disabled children who are often in and out of hospital."We urge the Government to stand by its commitment to protect the most disabled, by abolishing this rule."A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: "DLA is paid to help people who are unable to walk or virtually unable to walk or do things like wash and dress themselves."After a child is looked after free of charge in hospital for nearly three months we put payment of their DLA on hold because their needs are already being met by the NHS."Children receive DLA payments for longer [than over 16s] after being admitted to hospital, because we recognise they need longer to adjust."</body>

      <title>Crime falls 7% to record low - ONS</title>
      <description>Crime in England and Wales fell 7% in the year to June - a record low - official figures show.</description>

      <body>Crime has fallen 7% to a record low in the last year, the Crime Survey for England and Wales has shown.There were 8.5m incidents in the year to the end of June, compared with 9.1m the previous year.The drop comes despite a 9% rise in sexual offences, which was partly driven by the Jimmy Savile revelations of abuse.Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said England and Wales are safer than they have been "for decades".The headline crime figure is the lowest since the survey began in 1981, and has now fallen to half its peak level, recorded in 1995.However, the Office for National Statistics, which collates the survey, said the number of historical sexual offences - those which took place more than 20 years ago - recorded by the police has doubled.The Savile inquiry has encouraged greater numbers of people to report historical sexual offence to the police.The ONS said that in the last five years there has been a 35% rise in the number of rape offences recorded by the police - partly due to new guidance on the way in which such crimes are recorded.An increase in theft was also recorded by the Crime Survey, with offences up by 8% in the last year.Evidence suggests the rise was driven by the theft of smart phones, and involve pick-pocketing rather than violence or threats.The majority are counted as stealth thefts - where the victim is unaware items are being stolen.Meanwhile, though credit card fraud levels remained flat, overall fraud offences have jumped by 21% in the last year.The ONS said the cause of this rise would become clearer in the next one or two years, but it could be down to a new centralised method of recording fraud.Max Chambers, head of crime and justice at the think-tank Policy Exchange, said: "Whether you believe it's as the result of an ageing population, better policing and prevention, or the impact of the internet, there is little doubt that Britain is becoming a safer place to live, do business and raise a family."But crime is still too high and there are pockets of the country which remain blighted by anti-social behaviour and gang activity."While the latest figures show that the police have been able to cut crime substantially even with fewer resources, they must now redouble their efforts to tackle the hardcore of prolific offenders who commit offences that can often disproportionately hit the poor and the vulnerable."While welcoming falling crime rates, Jon Collins, deputy director of the Police Foundation - an independent policing think-tank - said it was important not to be "blind to new and emerging challenges".He said: "The police and the government should be wary of resting on their laurels."While crimes such as burglary and car crime are clearly not the problem that they once were, it's possible that the official crime figures are just not picking up the extent to which new opportunities for crimes like fraud and counterfeiting have emerged, particularly online."Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said: "Police reform is working and crime is falling."This is really positive news. Forces are rising to the challenge of making savings whilst cutting crime and delivering a better service to the public."England and Wales are safer than they have been for decades but we will continue to deliver measures which keep pace with the changing nature of crime and improve our ability to combat emerging issues."The Crime Survey for England and Wales asks people aged 16 and over living in households in England and Wales about their experiences of crime in the last 12 months. These experiences are used to estimate levels of crime in England and Wales.</body>

      <body>A police officer who shot dead a man eight years ago has been refused permission to appeal against an inquiry which found there was "no lawful justification" for his actions.The officer, known as E7, killed Azelle Rodney in Edgware in 2005 after the car he was in was stopped by armed police.E7 said he opened fire because he believed Mr Rodney had picked up a gun.But the inquiry ruled E7 "could not rationally have believed" Mr Rodney was holding a sub-machine gun.E7 was seeking a declaration that the inquiry's conclusions relating to his use of force were "irrational", or an order quashing parts of the report which found his use of force was unjustified.In refusing the judicial review, Mr Justice Wyn Williams said he had "no doubt" there was "ample evidence to justify the finding" the officer did not have an honest belief that Mr Rodney had picked up the gun.The inquiry considered issues including what information the police had, how reliable it was, whether their approach minimised the risk to life and if stopping the car was done with only necessary force.Sir Christopher Holland, who carried out the independent investigation, said in his conclusions: "There was no lawful justification for shooting Azelle Rodney so as to kill him."E7's accounts of what he saw are not to be accepted."Prior to firing he did not believe that the man who turned out to be Azelle Rodney had picked up a gun and was about to use it."Further, on the basis of what he was able to see, he could not rationally have believed that."E7 told the inquiry he saw Mr Rodney start moving around, reaching down and then coming back up with his shoulders hunched.Mr Rodney was then shot six times, once each in the arm and back, and four times in the head.</body>

      <body>The owners of a shop that sells legal highs have defended their firm after a 17-year-old suffered a near fatal reaction to a product they sold.Student Matt Ford, 17, had to be treated in hospital after he smoked an incense called Exodus Damnation from Skunkworks in Canterbury.In a letter to Conservative MP Julian Brazier, a Skunkworks spokesman said it boasted "extremely high moral codes".Mr Brazier wrote to the home secretary calling for the store to be shut down.In its letter, UK Skunkworks said: "The paraphernalia that we sell is not for drug use, we sell a wide range of popular products that are received very well by an adult market."The online industry of products we sell is extensive, however up until now the regulation of the products has been impossible."Our stores operate a number of strict policies and are enforced by a large team."These policies ensure that young people under the age of 18 can not enter our stores what so ever."It reiterates that it took disciplinary action after Matt Ford, a student at Canterbury College, managed to buy Exodus Damnation from one of its stores.The letter ends: "Calling for UK Skunkworks to be shut down is a pitiful attempt at dealing with the issues we face."I think you again fail to understand that we trade legally and take our business very seriously. If you wish to meet with us I think you will find us most accommodating and open minded."In his letter to Theresa May, Mr Brazier, who represents Canterbury and Whitstable, called for Skunkworks and "its fellow shops and its websites" to be banned.He said Skunkworks' get-out clause over the substances for sale at its shop was they were "not for human consumption", but its advice was to "help you relax" by burning the herbs in the home.Legal highs mimic the effects of illegal drugs, but are not banned under the Misuse of Drugs Act.</body>

      <body>The Football Association has given its "full support" to Roy Hodgson after claims a comment made in a team-talk by the England manager caused offence.Hodgson was criticised for referring to a joke about a monkey and an astronaut at half-time in Tuesday's World Cup qualifier against Poland."He has and deserves the full support of the Football Association," FA chairman Greg Dyke said.Anti-racism campaigners Kick It Out praised the FA's "swift" response.It had called for an investigation into Hodgson's comments but, after the FA confirmed it had not received any complaints from the England players, it now considered the matter closed.A Kick It Out statement read: "We are pleased that the Football Association has investigated this matter swiftly and issued its findings immediately."If there has been no complaint on the back of the investigation then the matter can only be deemed as concluded."Kick It Out acts on behalf of the football community at large and when an allegation of a racist or discriminatory nature is made, it's the organisation's role to follow this up."Hodgson was reported  to have made the comments when trying to explain to right-back Chris Smalling that he needed to pass the ball to winger Andros Townsend more.The England manager later apologised and Townsend, 22, tweeted:  "I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken!"Dyke added: "Roy Hodgson is a man of the highest integrity, an honourable man who is doing a great job with the England team."He has fully explained to us what he said and the point he was making to the players in the dressing room at half-time on Tuesday night. He has also explained the context in which he made his remarks."He has made clear there was no intent to say anything inappropriate, and he was certainly not making any comments with any racist connotation. Importantly, he has apologised for any unintended offence that may have been taken."We will be making no further comment on this story and will now be giving Roy and the team our full support as we prepare for the World Cup in Brazil."England striker Wayne Rooney also showed his support for 66-year-old Hodgson on Twitter,  and via his personal website:  "To be honest it's really annoying that something such as this should see the light of day."All the lads know what type of guy Roy is, and to try and pin some form of label on him is absolutely ridiculous. Roy spoke to Andros straight away, and he took no offence whatsoever. Hopefully that's now the end of the matter."Former England striker Stan Collymore, 42, also defended the former Fulham and West Brom boss on Twitter,  suggesting the row undermines moves to eradicate racism from the sport."Demeans every anti-racism campaigner by having cheap pop at RH [Roy Hodgson] who said nothing wrong. Makes campaigners seem over-PC and petty. They're not," he said.However, Piara Powar, executive director of Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare), told the BBC that Hodgson had got it wrong."This was a silly phrase to use in a diverse workforce," said Powar."I think some players will see it as a reflection of the type of language still used by some coaches and some attitudes that still prevail."Here is the basis of the joke which Roy Hodgson is reported to have told his players. However, it is unclear if this is the exact transcript."Nasa decided they'd finally send a man up in a capsule after sending only monkeys in the earlier missions."They fire the man and the monkey into space."The intercom crackles, 'Monkey, fire the retros.'"A little later, 'Monkey, check the solid fuel supply.'"Later still, "Monkey, check the life support systems for the man.'"The astronaut takes umbrage and radioes Nasa, 'When do I get to do something?'"Nasa replies, 'In 15 minutes - feed the monkey.'"</body>

      <body>Two men say they "instinctively" reacted to save a toddler who fell into a river from the top deck of a ferry.Captain's mate Ricardo Ermocilla, 38, dived into the River Mersey and chief engineer Ste Murphy, 41, directed him to the three-year-old girl.Her mother, who asked to remain anonymous, said she "can't explain how grateful" she is for "saving her daughter's life".The child fell from the Snowdrop at Seacombe Ferry Terminal on Monday.Mr Ermocilla, who moved to Crosby, Sefton, from Panama, said: "I heard the captain say that somebody had gone into the water."I rushed to the main deck, looked over and saw a little pink coat floating in the water."I shouted 'I'm going in', took my shoes off and jumped into the water."It was instinct."The girl fell into the river moments after the Mersey Ferries boat had berthed at the port at about 14:30 BST.She was partly hidden under the fender, the buffer between the ship and quayside, while she was in the water.Mr Murphy, who was not on the boat when the incident happened, said: "I'd heard a couple of bangs and a splash and saw a woman looking down from the boat into the water screaming."My first thought was that she'd lost her bag, but then I heard somebody shout 'it's a baby'."There's no doubt her padded coat was keeping her afloat."Mr Murphy, from Aigburth, Liverpool, directed Mr Ermocilla and told him what to do once he had hold of her.Mr Ermocilla said he was relieved when the toddler started crying.The father-of-two said: "The first thing I saw when I grabbed her were big blue eyes looking up at me in shock. I remember saying 'I've got you now'."She started to cry which made me feel so much better as it meant she was breathing."He said seeing Mr Murphy's hand, to help them out of the water, was like "the hand of God"."He grabbed me, pulled me in, took the girl from me, lifted her up and put her on his chest," he said.According to tide tables, it was a low tide at the time of the incident.Mr Murphy, who also has two children, added: "It was a real team effort. This isn't just about me and Ric."Somebody was really looking down on us on that day too."It was so lucky that it was low tide as the Mersey is one of the fastest tidal rivers in the world."The girl's mother, of Warrington, Cheshire, said: "They went into the water without even thinking about it."It was a horrific experience, but one that puts your faith in human nature."</body>

      <body>A man whose Halloween display included a disembowelled corpse has been told to "tone it down" after police received a report it was upsetting children.James Creighton put the fake corpse and other items in his garden on Grove Road, Stevenage to raise money for a cancer charity.He said he thought police were "joking" when they told him of the concerns.Hertfordshire Police said he had been asked to change the display as "people were being distressed by it".A spokesman for the force said the corpse was "very realistic and if people have concerns, we have to address them".Mr Creighton said he had shown his corpses and skeletons every year since 2009 and had never had a complaint.He said he was a "huge" Halloween fan and started the "gored-up" shows shortly after his grandmother died of cancer to raise money for Cancer Research UK.He said he thought the officers who came to his house on Tuesday "must be joking" when they told him of the concerns."I thought it was a ridiculous waste of police time."If someone was worried, they could have told me and I would have made some sort of compromise."Mr Creighton said the officers had asked him to "lose a few bits" and "put a tarpaulin up, but then people wouldn't be able to see it and I do this to raise money".He added that he had removed some items following the visit, but had since put them back.Insp Simon Tabert said officers had visited Mr Creighton "to discuss the matter"."We had a complaint [from a parent] that it was so realistic, it was going to upset their children," he said."Mr Creighton offered to create a barrier, but it's my understanding we did not ask him to do so."We asked him to tone it down, because people were being distressed by it."</body>

      <title>Trinder relishing England chance</title>
      <description>Gloucester centre Henry Trinder says he is ready to live up to expectations after receiving an England call-up.</description>

      <body>Gloucester's Henry Trinder is ready to live up to the expectations placed on him by head coach Stuart Lancaster following his England call-up.The 24-year-old is one of three uncapped centres in Lancaster's squad for next month's autumn Tests."Stuart rang me and it's always a shock when you see his name pop up on your phone," he told BBC Gloucestershire."He told me why I'd been picked and what he wants from me. I'll try and live up to that if I can."Trinder continued: "He was very pleased with how I've been playing and how I carried myself on the pitch. He thinks aggression has been added to my game."I'm pleased to be in the mix and I'm looking forward to the internationals."Swindon-born Trinder came through Gloucester's academy system and, after a dual registration deal at Moseley, became a first-team regular in 2010.During that season, he played under Lancaster in the England Saxons squad at Churchill Cup and went on to train with the Six Nations squad last year, but missed out on selection because of an ankle injury.And he admits he was surprised to be included this time around."I wasn't expecting to skip the Saxons," added Trinder. "But Gloucester have given me a great platform to express myself on the pitch and that's what I've tried to do this season."The first few games of the season have gone my way and I'm feeling confident in how I'm playing here. If I can keep up this standard then hopefully I'll be OK."Gloucester finished fifth in the Premiership last season but have had mixed results so far this term - losing three of their five league games.And Trinder is relieved his England chances have not been scuppered by their indifferent start."You see the players who are being selected regularly and they are in those top teams," he added."It does worry you a bit but the way we finished last season, finishing fifth, and we know we can be up there. It's just about us turning it around as a group."It does play on your mind a bit but all I can think about is my own performance and thankfully it has been noticed."</body>

      <body>England coach Steve McNamara has named only one Burgess brother to start the friendly against Italy on Saturday.Loose forward Sam takes his place in the pack as England finalise their preparations for the World Cup,  which kicks off on 26 October.Uncapped brother George is named on the bench while his twin Tom faces Samoa for England Knights instead.Three of the four Burgess brothers were named in McNamara's 24-man squad, with oldest brother Luke missing out.Sam, George and Tom would become the first set of three siblings to appear on the pitch together for England - although that cannot now happen against Italy.Warrington Wolves forward Ben Westwood misses out on the friendly - England's first meeting with Italy - as he serves a one-match ban for a deliberate punch in the Super League Grand Final defeat by Wigan Warriors this month.Wigan captain Sean O'Loughlin will also miss the match, which kicks off at 16:30 BST at the Salford City Stadium.Zak Hardaker will join Tom Burgess in the development side, who will open up the double-header at 14:00 BST when they take on Samoa."We are delighted to be playing against Italy in the historic international," McNamara said."Italy have made tremendous progress and are well equipped with quality players representing them from the NRL and Super League."And he said he was confident England were well set for the friendly and the World Cup to follow."The make-up of the side looks very exciting, with the right blend of youth and experience," he said."Our preparation has been first-class and we have trained exceptionally well at our camp in Potchefstroom, South Africa."This is the best prepared side to come from England and we are ready for what promises to be the most competitive World Cup in history."Sydney Roosters captain Anthony Minichiello, 33, is the star name in Italy's team and he will line up alongside younger brother Mark, the Gold Coast Titans forward, in a side boasting plenty of NRL experience but sprinkled with raw youngsters.Head coach Carlo Napolitano intends to give all 24 of his squad members a run-out, with the exception of forward Kade Snowden, who is banned.England: Sam Tomkins (Wigan), Hall (Leeds), Ablett (Leeds), Cudjoe (Huddersfield), Briscoe (Hull FC); Chase (Castleford), Sinfield (c) (Leeds); Graham (Canterbury Bulldogs), McIlorum (Wigan), Mossop (Wigan), Hock (Widnes), Farrell (Wigan), Sam Burgess (South Sydney Rabbitohs).Replacements: Charnley (Wigan), Watkins (Leeds), Widdop (Melbourne Storm), Burrow (Leeds) Hill (Warrington), Roby (St Helens), George Burgess (South Sydney Rabbitohs)England Knights: Makinson (St Helens), Thornley (Wigan), Jones (St Helens), Hardaker (Leeds), Cockayne (Wakefield), Sarginson (London Broncos), Powell (Wigan); Tom Burgess (South Sydney), Hodgson (Hull KR), Taylor (Wigan), Ferres (Huddersfield), Whitehead (Catalan Dragons), Crosby (Wigan).Replacements: Green (Hull), Hughes (Wigan), Lawrence (Huddersfield), Dixon (London Broncos), Singleton (Leeds), Bowden (Hull), Logan Tomkins (Wigan).</body>

      <description>Murder victims’ families combat stress, hair loss and flashbacks</description>

      <body>National crime figures have shown that murders involving a knife have dropped 9% in the past year, from 207 in 2011-12 to 189 in 2012-13. The figures provide a dispassionate, statistical snapshot of these crimes, but do not yield the experiences of those left behind - the families. Here are some of their stories.The narrative of fatal knife crime is usually a simple one.A person is killed, the grieving family releases a tribute, the case goes to court and the person responsible is imprisoned.The police will then release a statement on behalf of the family in which the detectives are thanked for their help in securing justice.Some people might even use the word "closure".And that, appeals not withstanding, is that.Only it never is like that.The real impact of violent deaths on surviving families is rarely told. It does not fit the prescribed narrative with its neat beginnings, middles and endings.Mood swings, addiction, the loss of toenails and hair, suicide attempts, marital collapse, alienation from friends and difficulties with eating - the physical and social effects of bereavement are less reported.The after-effects of knife crime on the bereaved can resemble the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) experienced by post-combat soldiers, psychologists say.This is something Anne Oakes-Odger knows all too well.Her son Westley Odger, 27, was stabbed in the neck outside a cash machine in Colchester in 2005. He died of his injuries.The "reason" for the attack was that he told someone not to jump the queue.Ms Oakes-Odger, who lives in Essex, believes the psychological and physical impact of murder on surviving family members is poorly understood."You feel as though you are losing your mind," she says. "When a child is murdered, it is out of the normal course of events."The shock element creates a lot of physical and mental issues for every member of the family."One of the things which happened to me was my hair fell out in bunches and my toenails fell off. I thought that was peculiar to me, but I found out it wasn't."The loss of her hair and nails was, she says, a symptom of the stress of living in a sustained "flight or fight" state. She also suffered colour blindness."During the early years I was not seeing things in colour. I could only see in black and white and various shades of grey."There isn't a 'closure' with homicide."The criminal justice system itself hinders rather than helps, according to Ms Oakes-Odger. For months or years after a murder, the loved one is more "evidence" than person, and can be subjected to multiple post mortem examinations.And at the centre of proceedings sits not the victim, or their family, but the accused.Grieving while the wheels of justice roll, she says, is nigh on impossible. And by the time they do stop, the psychological damage is already done.The Ministry of Justice says it understands the "immeasurable suffering" experienced by victims' families and that it is committed to making sure more support than "ever before" is available to them.This includes the national Homicide Service, which offers such families a Victim Support caseworker and access to specialist counselling.The department is also "revamping" the Victim's Code which it says will make "major improvements for victims" and give them a clearer guide about their entitlements and sources of help.These are the type of measures Tanya (pictured above), who asked for her surname to be withheld, says she desperately needed.Her husband Gary, 59, was murdered by their son Ed who, after killing his father upstairs with a hammer and a knife, came downstairs and tried to kill her.She heard two "thuds" upstairs and believes had she not turned around to see her son before he attacked she too would have died.The killing happened a week before Christmas in 2007. The family had enjoyed a normal day and Ed had been upstairs in his room. He asked Gary to come up and help him fix his stereo.It was then that he killed him.Her son, who was 15 at the time, is serving 18 years for murder and attempted murder. He had denied the charges, claiming his state of mind was altered by the anti-depressant fluoxetine."I lost everything that day," she says.Like Ms Oakes-Odger, Tanya's toenails fell out. Even now, six years on, she still loses her nails when she is under stress.After her husband's murder, the former nursery worker could not bring herself to use knives - even cutlery knives - or face opening her post.Looking back, Tanya says there is precious little support offered to the families of people violently killed. The attention and support, she says, goes to the perpetrators.The victims' families, Tanya says, are - with the exception of police family liaison officers - left to find their own way through the emotional and practical debris of a disaster."There was nothing," she says. "And it takes so much for you to ask for help. And you just don't have the words. It would be much better if support was offered to you, even if you didn't take it there and then, but could take it along the way."My two other children (who were in their late teens when their father was murdered by their brother) had no support."Also difficult has been the expectations wider society places on the families."It has been five years but I still have days when it is hard - anniversaries. Some people are really good and know when you're not in the right place. Others say 'you're OK' and they expect you to be OK and so for those people, you are."I still have times when I have to put the knives away and when people are doing DIY with hammers... but it is part of everyday life, and you have to get used to it."For some, deaths can trigger a personal redefinition. A shy person learns to speak out, for example.Take Holly Watson. Now aged 20, she met her half-brother Lewis when she was 14.Just two years after they met, Lewis was dead. The 23-year-old was stabbed three times in Sudbury, Suffolk.The only photograph she has of Lewis, who was a keen angler, is of him holding a fish. She never got to say goodbye as he was dead before she got to hospital."That was hard," she says. "I had never seen a dead body before. And when the first body you see is your big brother, well that's hard to deal with."I became a bit of a recluse. At the beginning I hated the world and everybody in it."It was almost like a hysteria, with Lewis dying, the funeral and the waiting, like limbo land, and then the court case and then everybody said it would get easier with the closure, but it doesn't."Immediately after her brother's death, she was unable to pick up a cutlery knife."To begin with knives made me feel sick, I couldn't use them. We felt we could not hold something that had killed Lewis."Then there was the impact on her ambitions. Holly had always wanted to be a lawyer. But as she started to explore the law, she found many of the scenarios put to students in law exams involved knife crimes.Her ambitions for the law were put on hold.Next year she will turn 21. It is not an anniversary she is looking forward to. Her brother, she says, should be there for it. And should she ever marry, then Lewis should have been there for that too. But he won't be."I dread the day when I have children and I have to tell them that their uncle isn't here," she says."The biggest thing in getting over something like this is in accepting that the world is not always what you want it to be."Holly says she used to be shy. She is now an anti-knife violence campaigner.So too is Caroline Shearer.Her 17-year-old son Jay Whiston was fatally stabbed in the heart outside a house party in Essex last September.Exactly what happened remains unclear and is currently subject to court proceedings.Ms Shearer describes the days since her son's death as a "living torture" peppered only by the briefest of moments each morning, in the gap between sleep and consciousness, when the anguish of loss is kept at bay.She would love to have all of the happy memories she shared with Jay at the forefront of her mind.Instead, the recurring image which haunts her is of her boy on the cusp of adulthood lying dead on a mortuary slab."I was a mother of two children then, within three hours, I was a mother of one," she says."He was a normal, everyday, loving, caring boy. I always say he had such a huge heart, they couldn't have missed."The grief she describes is like a sledgehammer. There are gaps in the day when she might, for example, notice the weather, or have a conversation. And then the grief hits her, again and again.It is with her throughout the day - as she washes clothes, cooks meals or sees a car of the same colour as Jay's - and last thing at night as she falls asleep.And she too had difficulties with eating.She tells how shortly after Jay's death she struggled to use kitchen knives or cutlery - because of their association with the implement used to kill her son.None of the symptoms reported by the families surprise clinical psychologist Don Macleod.Mr Macleod has worked with families across the north west of England who have suffered tragedy. Some suffer PTSD symptoms more often associated with combat veterans.But for the families, he says, the expert knowledge needed to help them is often not there."I would be almost certain that your average GP would not actually tag what's going on with someone having that kind of reaction," says Mr Macleod."The GP might know there had been a murder in the family, but they might not have the time or indeed the skills and knowledge to be able to pinpoint that [PTSD] is what the issue is."Part of the issue is that the initial responses to grief - anger, anxiety, flashbacks and depression - are, although extremely unpleasant for the people suffering them, "completely normal" given the circumstances.They become an issue, he said, when they "become protracted" - such as with PTSD.Can these families ever recover?Ms Oakes-Odger thinks they can, but it is a slow, painful process which results not in a return to how things used to be but in acceptance of the way they are now."It is about finding a new 'normal'," she says, "a normal in which you can lead a purposeful life, one you can go forward with."</body>

      <title>Trafficking: why is help refused?</title>
      <description>Why are victims of human trafficking reluctant to seek help?</description>

      <body>In a series of raids on suspected illegal brothels in Birmingham West Midlands Police took five women into protective custody. They are thought have been brought into the UK by traffickers, but why have all the women refused counselling?The phrase 'Stockholm Syndrome' is usually reserved for hostages who in some cases form a powerful, emotional attachment to their captors.But the charities tackling human trafficking say that a number of victims of the trafficking gangs are suffering from symptoms of the Syndrome that was first coined in the 1970s following a bank siege in the Swedish capital.Despite the more obvious reason such as the fear of reprisals from those who enslaved them, West Midlands Police say there are many reasons why victims stay silent."Victims are exploited in four main ways - forced labour, sexual exploitation, domestic servitude and benefit fraud. Those who traffic people may do so by force or coercion," said Det Supt Tim Bacon."They either do not see themselves as victims, or they may have a suspicion of authorities and a lack of awareness that (authorities) are in a position to help. They also fear traffickers will accuse them of being complicit in their trafficked situation."Often, there can be a type of Stockholm Syndrome - where due to unequal power, victims create a false emotional or psychological attachment to their controller."Stop The Traffik is a London-based group that works to create and change awareness of the problem.A spokeswoman said: "A lot of women have been groomed into their situation, so there is a huge sense of loyalty to their captors."For many, it can be the first relationship they have ever had; they have no other frame of reference, and are working for this person 12 hours a day, seven days a week."But the after-care system for UK victims is not great."Drop-in venues are available for women who work on the street, but for trafficking victims, behind closed doors, there is none."One trafficking victim who did seek help - and now advises others to do the same - is Svetlana.Free from the abuse of her ordeal, she has used the help and support available to rebuild her life - and now offers that support to others.She said: "At a party when I was 18, a man approached me and started yelling and punching me, saying he was going to take me away."I was forced into a vehicle and told someone would meet me at the other end. This was in London."I was forced to take drugs and pictures were taken of me; and that is when I first got a clue what was happening to me. I was forced to work as a prostitute."Later I was sold to another man for £6,000 and told I would have to work that cost off through prostitution."Despite a fear of her captors, Svetlana plotted her escape at a service station, where she "plucked up the courage" to ask staff for help.She was put in touch with police and the Salvation Army, who work around-the-clock internationally to help identify and support trafficking victims.Major Anne Read, Salvation Army anti-trafficking response co-ordinator, said: "We have the government contract for managing the support for all UK adult trafficking victims."That means when a victim is rescued, or escapes, they are referred to us to see if they need or want help with medical, legal, or accommodation matters."Friday is Anti-Slavery Day and will see the Salvation Army holding a range of UK-wide events to raise even more awareness of the issue.But for now, the daily nightmare of human trafficking continues for hundreds of powerless victims.</body>

      <body>One of the few remaining survivors of a German prisoner of war camp immortalised in the film The Great Escape has died.Frank Stone, who died aged 91, was taken to Stalag Luft III in Zagan after his bomber crashed in Germany in 1940.The 18-year-old RAF gunner was housed in hut 104, home to 76 airmen who attempted escape via a tunnel in 1944.However, the alarm was raised before Mr Stone, who had helped dispose of soil from the tunnel, could join them.During an interview with the BBC in 2009, Mr Stone, of Hathersage, Derbyshire, said the atmosphere on the night of the escape had been "electric"."It was all very tense - but at 5 o'clock, a shot rang out and we knew they had been discovered."Of the 76 who made their break for freedom using the tunnel, known as Harry, 50 were subsequently shot after being recaptured and only three men managed to get away successfully.Mr Stone said: "It was very sad and we were advised not to make any further attempts to escape."He was finally freed towards the end of the war.His widow, Jane, said: "He gave lots of talks about the escape and always said he was doing it in memory of those 50."Frank could never understand why people where so interested in him but they were. We often had to put extra talks on so more people could come."Stalag Luft III, which was 100 miles south-east of Berlin, held about 10,000 RAF crew at the height of its occupation.In 1947, 18 soldiers who shot those who were recaptured were put before a military tribunal in Hamburg.Thirteen of them were executed, while the rest received long prison sentences.The story of the escape was made into a film in 1963, starring Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and Donald Pleasence.</body>

      <body>A 23-year-old woman diagnosed with breast cancer is blogging her beauty tips to 150,000 followers.Laura Cannon's blog, Laura Louise and her Naughty Disease, talks about her treatment and offers advice on how to look good.Miss Cannon, from Salcombe in Devon, has undergone chemotherapy and a double mastectomy.She said she wanted to help other young people with the disease, while making her battle "as fun as possible".Miss Cannon was diagnosed with breast cancer on 22 November last year and soon after the keen writer started her blog.Posts have included photos of her having her hair cut off after chemotherapy led to significant hair loss.She said: "I had it done in different styles. I had a mohawk and stuff."I wanted to look back and laugh and not remember it as a really sad day."Now her hair and her eyebrows have grown back and she has been blogging about make-up."It was a really nice day to be able to put eyeliner and mascara on," she said."It is something that I missed doing when I didn't have eyelashes."Other posts have dealt with the serious side of the effects of the disease."When I was diagnosed I googled stuff and there wasn't much out there for younger cancer patients so I wanted to write some material for them."It was quite liberating and it was nice to be so honest and tell the story from a positive point of view."There were times when I wasn't, but I wanted to approach it with that kind of positive attitude."The biology graduate, who loves online shopping, said the blog has also been therapeutic for her."It is something to focus on, a nice distraction."The blog has more than 150,000 followers and the feedback has been universally positive, including from patients as she charts the ups and downs of her treatment.Now her posts are reflecting her upcoming five weeks of radiotherapy.She wrote: "If I am honest the thing that is bumming me out the most about this news is the fact that I won't be able to have a hot bath during and for a little while after the treatment."</body>

      <body>Pollutants in the air we breathe have been classed as a leading environmental cause of cancer by the World Health Organization.It said the evidence was clear they cause lung cancer.Sources of pollution include car exhausts, power stations, emissions from agriculture and industry - as well as heating in people's homes.The WHO said the classification should act as a strong message to governments to take action.The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a part of the WHO, has now classed air pollution in the same category as tobacco smoke, UV radiation and plutonium.It said air pollution had been know to cause heart and lung diseases, but evidence had now emerged that it was also causing cancer.The IARC said the most recent data suggested 223,000 deaths from lung cancer around the world were caused by air pollution.More than half of the deaths were thought to be in China and other East Asian countries. Rapid industrialisation has led to smoggy skies in cities such as Beijing.However, it is a global problem and concerns about air pollution were raised in Europe again this week.Data suggests there may also be a link with bladder cancer.Dr Kurt Straif, from IARC, said: "The air we breathe has become polluted with a mixture of cancer-causing substances."We now know that outdoor air pollution is not only a major risk to health in general, but also a leading environmental cause of cancer deaths."Cancer Research UK said it was not a surprise.Dr Julie Sharp, the head of health information at the charity, said: "It's important that people keep the risk from air pollution in perspective."Although air pollution increases the risk of developing lung cancer by a small amount, other things have a much bigger effect on our risk, particularly smoking."Dr Rachel Thompson, head of research interpretation at the World Cancer Research Fund International, said: "This latest evidence confirms the need for government, industry and multinational bodies to urgently address environmental causes of cancer."But there's also a lot we can do as individuals to lower our chances of developing the disease such as being more physically active and adopting a healthier diet."</body>

      <description>Doctors treating obese or overweight patients should be "respectful" and "non-blaming", advice to the NHS says.</description>

      <body>Doctors treating obese or overweight patients should be "respectful" and "non-blaming", advice to the NHS says.The draft guidance is published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).It also suggests obese patients be referred to weight-loss programmes, including those run by commercial companies, to help them lose weight.Obesity increases the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes and costs the NHS more than £5bn each year.Just over a quarter of adults in England are classed as obese and a further 41% of men and 33% of women as overweight.The NICE document, which is subject to a three-month consultation, suggests all health professionals dealing with overweight or obese people should monitor their tone in order to "minimise harm".It states all healthcare professionals should "be aware of the effort needed to lose weight and avoid further weight gain and the stigma adults who are overweight or obese may feel or experience".It adds: "Ensure the tone and content of all communications or dialogue is respectful and non-blaming."The terminology used to describe the person's condition should respect individual preferences."NHS care providers should also ensure equipment and facilities "meet the needs of most adults who are overweight or obese".Those overseeing NHS weight management programmes should tell patients how much weight they can "realistically" expect to lose, and that no programme is a "magic bullet", the document says.Instead, stress should be put on the "importance of making gradual, long-term changes to their eating habits and physical activity and how much weight they might realistically expect to lose in total and on a weekly basis if they adhere to the programme".Prof Mike Kelly, director of the Centre for Public Health at NICE, said: "Being overweight or obese can have serious consequences for an individual's health, not only physically with increased risk of high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, but it can also affect their mental health as a result of stigma and bullying or discrimination."He added: "This draft guidance isn't about quick fixes, it is about ensuring lifestyle weight management services support people in the long-term."Programmes that address diet, activity and behaviour change can help people who are obese lose weight, but they are only cost-effective if the weight is kept off."Tam Fry, a spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, said most health professionals were not trained in how to raise weight issues effectively."The abrupt style that many have taken so far has only made matters worse," he said."NICE is correct to say they should be moderate in their tone. But once they've got the tone right and the confidence of the patient, they should really think about tough love."It's essential that patients realise that the consequences of putting on weight are very serious."Thembi Nkala, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: "Being overweight or obese can have serious consequences for your heart health."However, taking control of your weight can be a daunting task because changing the habits of a lifetime is often a challenge."That's why it's a good idea to get support throughout your weight loss journey, which could include joining a support group."</body>

      <title>Competition concern stops NHS merger</title>
      <description>Two Dorset NHS hospital trusts will not merge, the Competition Commission rules, in the first decision of its kind.</description>

      <body>Two NHS hospital trusts in Dorset will not merge, the Competition Commission (CC) has decided.The Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals and Poole Hospital Trusts wanted to become one to save money.It is the first time the Competition Commission, which normally rules on companies and commercial markets, has intervened in the NHS in England.The trusts said the decision was "fundamentally wrong" and that they would "explore alternative options".In a statement, the trusts added they were "deeply disappointed" and felt the merger was the best option to ensure "high-quality hospital services to local people"."The assessment of the merger was always weighted to put competition ahead of benefits to patients, and we do not believe the NHS is best served in this way."The two trusts have worked extremely effectively together over the last two years and we will continue to explore areas where we can work in partnership. However, this will not be to the scale we had hoped."It will be much more difficult to make further savings as individual organisations, but we now need to explore alternative options and work closely with our commissioners as we look to the future."The merger was referred to the commission by the Office of Fair Trading, amid concerns about allowing two competing trusts to combine.The Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has 601 beds across two sites, whilst Poole Hospital NHS Foundation Trust has 623 beds across three sites.But the CC said the merger would "damage patients' interests by eliminating competition and choice".Its chairman Roger Witcomb said the organisation was "acutely aware of the pressures facing NHS hospitals"."While the broad aims of the merger are desirable ones, there simply isn't enough detail in the hospitals' plans for us to conclude that any of the claimed benefits are likely to materialise," he said.Poole Hospital NHS Foundation Trust is already being investigated by health sector regulator Monitor amid concerns over its finances and warned it faced a deficit if the planned merger failed.The commission said it did not believe Poole would close as a result of the merger being blocked.A spokesman for the Foundation Trust Network said the decision raised "significant fears about how competition law is being applied within NHS settings and on trusts' ability to make much needed changes to how services are delivered".The NHS Confederation described the decision as a "body blow for change in the NHS".Annette Brooke, the Liberal Democrat MP for Mid Dorset and North Poole, said she was deeply concerned by the decision."We have a big financial problem at Poole hospital and I think it's really important that it is made financially viable," she said."One can certainly see there is a logic in merging management across two hospitals that are so close together [and] the bottom line is whether patients actually want choice over better services."Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: "It's a sad day for the NHS when competition lawyers, and not doctors, are deciding what's best for patients."A spokesman for the Department of Health said: "The review of mergers is a matter for the independent competition authorities. They must make their decisions in the best interests of patients."</body>

      <body>The UK medicines watchdog is recalling five drugs produced at an Indian factory where "manufacturing deficiencies" have been found.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is asking chemists and wholesalers to return the medicines made by Wockhardt Limited.The recalled drugs are used for pain relief and to treat type 2 diabetes.The MHRA has stressed there is no risk to patients and people should continue to take their medication as prescribed.The agency's decisions follows a precautionary recall from retail outlets by the manufacturer.It had found problems with the manufacturing process during an inspection of Wockhardt's manufacturing site in Chikalthana, India, in July.They included, poor record keeping relating to the manufacture and testing of the medicines made at the site and inadequate validation and production controls for medicines.The MHRA said it was working with Wockhardt and other international regulators to resolve these issues.The affected medicines are, in most cases, available from alternative manufacturers.Ten prescription-only medicines can continue to be made at the Chikalthana site and used in the UK.The MHRA said even though there were concerns over the continuity of supply, the benefits to patients of continuing to take these medicines outweighed that risk.It said patients did not need to return the medicines they had as there was no evidence they were defective and no evidence of a patient safety risk.But the MHRA said it had to "act in the interests of public health as poor manufacturing standards means that the quality of medicines is not guaranteed".Gerald Heddell, MHRA director of inspection, enforcement and standards, said: "People can be reassured that there is no evidence of a safety risk from the medicines made at Wockhardt's Chikalthana site, so it's important people continue to take their medicines as prescribed."We are working with the Department of Health to ensure that people have access to the medicines they need.

      <body>A health trust has admitted liability for the deaths of two children in its care during a public inquiry into hospital deaths in Northern Ireland.Claire Roberts and Adam Strain died months apart while they were being treated at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children in 1995 and 1996.Their deaths are being investigated by the inquiry into hyponatraemia-related deaths in Banbridge, County Down.The issue of hospital fluids management is central to the public inquiry.Hyponatraemia is the term for a low level of sodium in the bloodstream, which causes the brain cells to swell with too much water.Four-year-old Adam Strain died shortly after undergoing a kidney transplant at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children in 1995.Claire Roberts was nine when she died at the same hospital the following year.She had been admitted following vomiting and drowsiness and doctors prescribed intravenous fluids.However, Claire was given a fatal overdose of fluids and drugs.In the 17 years since her death, Belfast Health Trust had denied that fluid management played any role and wrongly attributed Claire's death to a brain virus.The trust maintained its stance during the child's inquest in 2006.However, at the public inquiry on Thursday, the trust's lawyer said his client now accepted it was liable for Claire Roberts' death and made "a full and frank admission of liability on behalf of the Belfast Trust".He said it also wanted to offer "a sincere apology for the shortcomings in the management of Claire's treatment" and acknowledged that it had failed to treat the child to an appropriate standard.During the hearing, the Belfast Health Trust also admitted publicly for the first time liability in the earlier case of Adam Strain.It had previously settled this case with Adam's family but a confidentiality clause prevented any detail of that settlement from emerging.The trust further acknowledged that guidelines had not been followed in the case of a third child, Connor Mitchell.The inquiry chairman, Justice John O'Hara QC, welcomed the admissions and acknowledged that it was "never easy to admit when mistakes had been made".Mr O'Hara said the families had made it clear that their pursuit of the truth was "in memory of their children" and that he hoped that today "they feel there is some added justification for what they have done".Speaking to BBC Northern Ireland after the hearing, Claire Roberts' parents welcomed the trust's apology and admission of liability as a small step forward but said there were still many questions over their child's death that had not been answered.The inquiry into hyponatraemia-related deaths is investigating fluid management issues after the deaths of five children in Northern Ireland hospitals.It is looking into the deaths of three of the children, the events following the death of another and a number of issues arising from the death of a fifth.The deaths all took place between 1995 and 2003, and in each case, the way in which fluids were given to the children following surgery is implicated in their deaths.Belfast Trust is the second Northern Ireland health trust to accept liability during the public inquiry.On August 30, the Western Health and Social Care Trust admitted liability over the death of nine-year-old Raychel Ferguson.Raychel died in June 2001, a day after an appendix operation at Altnagelvin Hospital, Londonderry.She was administered a lethal dose of intravenous fluid after her appendix was removed.</body>

      <description>The number of new cases of autism being diagnosed in the UK has levelled off, following the surge of the 1990s, according to researchers.</description>

      <body>The number of new cases of autism being diagnosed in the UK has levelled off, according to researchers.The study, published in the British Medical Journal, said there had been a surge in reported cases in the 1990s, but the rise had not continued.Increased awareness and diagnosis of condition are thought to have contributed to earlier increases.The National Autistic Society said the evidence proved the condition had been around for a long time.Researchers at the Institute of Child Health at University College London looked at GP data which represented 5% of patients in the UK.They used the information to estimate the number of eight-year-olds with autism each year.The annual prevalence of autistic spectrum disorders was estimated at 3.8 per 1,000 boys and 0.8 per 1,000 girls. That figure was stable between 2004 and 2010.The study concluded there was "compelling evidence that a major rise in incidence rates of autism, recorded in general practice, occurred in the decade of the 1990s but reached a plateau shortly after 2000 and has remained steady through 2010".The researchers said changes in the way autism was diagnosed as well as greater awareness among doctors and the public explained some of the rise although "the actual cause [of the rise in the 90s] remains in large part a mystery".The study is in contrast to a report by the US Centre for Disease Control, which reported a 78% rise between 2002 and 2008.The last UK Census, which has data from more people than this study but lacks the yearly analysis of diagnoses, suggested the prevalence of autism was closer to one in 100.Carol Povey, from the National Autistic Society, said: "This study shows that, contrary to media hype, autism has been with us for a long time."Evidence suggests that the increase in diagnoses of autism is in large part down to greater awareness of the condition, as well as better diagnostic facilities and improved skills and knowledge among those who carry out diagnoses."More than one in 100 people in the UK have autism and it's important that we work to ensure they receive the support they need to reach their full potential."</body>

      <body>There is no criminal offence if someone assists a woman in going to England for a lawful abortion, the Director of Public Prosecutions in NI has said.Barra McGrory made the comments after the BBC was told draft abortion guidelines had caused a "mood of fear" among medical staff.There have been calls for clarity after women carrying babies with fatal foetal abnormalities told their stories.Foetal abnormality is not a reason for abortion under Northern Ireland law.Draft guidelines were published in March, but following a consultation process, revised guidelines are being brought before the Stormont Executive within weeks.Health Minister Edwin Poots has said he would meet the Public Prosecution Service about the potential prosecution of staff involved in an abortion in certain circumstances.He said he was also taking legal advice from other sources. Mr Poots said he had work to do that needed to be handled sensitively and he would not be deflected from it.Mr McGrory told the BBC's Nolan Show said: "There is no criminal offence of aiding and abetting, counselling or procuring someone to have what is a lawful abortion in England," he said."We can see no circumstances in which anyone would fall foul of the criminal law in that regard."Mr McGrory added: "The circumstances in which you are talking, of these tragic cases of foetal abnormality, where individuals have felt it necessary to travel to England to have an abortion because of serious foetal abnormality, in those circumstances, I can envisage no situation where anyone giving advice and assistance in that regard would fall foul of the law."You cannot aid or abet or procure something which is not a crime in our law."Last week, the BBC's Nolan Show highlighted the cases of two women, whose babies had fatal foetal abnormality, who were refused terminations in Northern Ireland,Sarah Ewart travelled to England for an abortion because her baby was diagnosed with anencephaly, a severe brain abnormality.She said the baby's skull was not formed and it was brain dead.Another woman, Laura, who is 22 weeks pregnant with twins who are suffering from the same condition, appealed to Mr Poots to allow her to have an abortion in Northern Ireland.</body>

      <body>A rapid blood test to diagnose blood poisoning, or sepsis, at the hospital bedside could potentially save thousands of lives, say researchers.Early studies at King's College London suggest the condition can be diagnosed in two hours using a simple blood test.Current diagnostic methods take up to two days, which may delay treatment with life-saving antibiotics.The condition - caused when the body's immune system overreacts to infection - causes 37,000 UK deaths each year.In the study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, researchers identified a biomarker for diagnosing sepsis rapidly in blood samples.It is based on detecting nucleotides specific to sepsis to rule out similar conditions that can mimic its symptoms.A small study at a London hospital and a larger study in Sweden demonstrated that sepsis could be diagnosed within two hours, with an accuracy of 86%.Lead researcher Prof Graham Lord, director of the NIHR biomedical research centre at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London, told BBC News: "If our early phase result holds up in a large trial, it could have significant effects in saving thousands of lives and reducing the use of unnecessary antibiotics."If we can prove its value in prospective trials, we can quite rapidly translate it into NHS clinical care."He said more research was needed to be done, but if successful, the test could be available for use in the NHS in about two years.UK Sepsis Trust chairman Dr Ron Daniels said the work paved the way for earlier detection of sepsis."If we had a simple test that would reliably detect sepsis - particularly in vulnerable groups - it would significantly improve the reliability of the delivery of care," he said.He added: "We still need the suspicion of sepsis to be present for someone to give the test."In September, a report from the health service ombudsman found significant failings in treatment of sepsis and said more had to be done to save the lives of patients.The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence will produce guidance for GPs and clinicians to help them recognise sepsis at an early stage.</body>

      <title>Call for rugby concussion lessons</title>
      <description>More should be done to protect players from the dangers of concussion, the International Rugby Board's former medical advisor says.</description>

      <body>More should be done to protect players from the dangers of concussion, the International Rugby Board's (IRB) former medical advisor said.The call comes after researchers linked suffering repeated concussions from playing sport with memory loss, depression and early dementia.Dr Barry O'Driscoll wants mandatory concussion awareness training for all grassroots rugby coaches and players.He quit his IRB job claiming the body trivialised concussion. It denies this.He said his call was directed at the unions in Wales, England, Scotland and Ireland.The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) does not have mandatory training on concussion for grassroots coaches or referees.Dr O'Driscoll told BBC Wales: "At the grassroots level - so all the way through - I would like to see a mandatory training as part of coaching courses [and] as part of schools lessons with young rugby players."They don't need to be experts on brain surgery. What they need to do is get across a) the signs and symptoms and b) what to do."The WRU said it is committed to ensuring that player welfare is at the forefront of any decision making, and that it followed the guidelines set by the IRB.It also said it is looking at devising a nationwide education programme for all levels of the game.In England the Rugby Football Union (RFU) said it is an issue that is taken "seriously"."This year we have distributed 200,000 'Headcase' cards to the game giving advice on recognising concussion and stressing the 'if in doubt, sit it out' message."Online resources include dedicated area of rfu.com gives advice for players, parents, teachers, coaches, medics and other volunteers."Since 2008 around 35,000 English coaches have taken the IRB's Rugby Ready course which includes a concussion element."The Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) said: "The IRFU observe all international best practices, as set out by the International Rugby Board."We have in place and continue to develop education and training campaigns to ensure player welfare is prioritised at all times."A call for concussion awareness in schools has also been made by the father of a 14-year-old boy from Northern Ireland who died two years ago after playing a match for his school team.Ben Robinson was knocked unconscious and suffered from concussion after several high-impact collisions during the game but he was allowed to carry on playing.He collapsed again just before the end of the game and later died in hospital.His father Peter said he would still be alive if he had been taken off the pitch."At the start of the second half he was involved in a heavy tackle and he lay on the ground for a minute-and-a-half being treated," he said."He was assisted to his feet... his body language looked like an old man when he was walking around but he kept being involved in heavy tackles."It's ironic to think if he'd had a blood injury he'd have been taken off and he would be here today."Mr Robinson is pressing for concussion awareness to be taught in schools across the UK.And next month he will meet Welsh Education Minister Huw Lewis to discuss bringing the idea to Wales, having already met Scotland and Northern Ireland's ministers."I've played rugby down the years - I don't want to change the game of rugby I just want to make it safer," Mr Robinson added."Have all the physicality you want, just make sure at grass roots level it's a safe playing environment for the children."We just want to make sure that it doesn't happen again and that we can educate people and maybe that helps numb the pain in some way."The IRB said its approach to the issue was driven by evidence-based expert research."Concussion management is at the very heart of the IRB's player welfare strategy designed to protect players at all levels of the game and promote the very highest standards of education, coaching and medical care," a spokesperson said.</body>

      <body>A 25-year-old Mexican with the autistic condition Asperger's has won the right to make key decisions about his life without parental consent.The Supreme Court ruled in favour of Ricardo Adair by four votes to one.Mr Adair said that Mexican legislation violated the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.It banned him from doing simple tasks by himself, such as applying for a passport, because of his condition.A judge will be appointed to agree which decisions Mr Adair will be allowed to make without the consent of a parent or guardian.The groundbreaking ruling is expected to have wider implications for the rights of people with autism in Latin America, says the BBC's Will Grant."I want to be allowed to decide what to do, where to go, where and with whom I want to live or travel, where to work or study," Mr Adair told the Mexican Supreme Court.Mexican legislation makes straightforward tasks, such as buying a mobile phone, enrolling in university or applying for a driving licence, very difficult for people with Asperger's syndrome or other forms of autism.Mr Adair said all papers had to be signed by his parents or legal guardians.He began his battle two years ago and has been supported in his fight by a non-profit organisation."All we wanted was for Ricardo's own free will to come first, and now the court has recognised that," his lawyer, Andres Gomez Montt, told the BBC.Mr Adair said he wanted to read the full court ruling before making further comments, but expressed his satisfaction at the decision."They have asserted our rights and I believe this is a great step forward," he said.Mexican legislation on people with disabilities was drafted with the intention of protecting them, by taking away legal responsibility for their actions, but Mr Adair's mother says the law is out of date."Many children have different levels of disability. Some need more support, some need less. This should be about giving to each one what they need," Leticia Robles told BBC Mundo earlier this year.The UN's World Health Organization describes autism spectrum disorders as "a group of complex brain development disorders".It affects one in each 160 children around the world on average, the WHO says."These disorders [which include Asperger's syndrome] are characterized by difficulties in social interaction and communication and a restricted and repetitive repertoire of interests and activities."</body>

      <body>One of the "worst examples of poor treatment" led to the death of a man who was not told he had been diagnosed with a life-threatening condition, said a watchdog.Public Services Ombudsman Peter Tyndall upheld a complaint by the family of Carl Nolan, 30, of Rhyl, who had congenital cirrhosis of the liver.Mr Nolan had been treated at Glan Clwyd hospital.Health bosses said required standards were not met but changes had been made.The ombudsman's report, which refers to Mr Nolan as Mr X, said he was born with cirrhosis of the liver and diagnosed with the "life-threatening" condition - which replaces healthy tissue with non-functioning scar tissue - in 2000 but neither he nor his family were told at the time.And although a follow-up outpatient appointment was made for him in 2001 the IT worker was not notified, said the report.He became ill again in 2008 and was given treatment but investigations to determine the cause were not concluded.It was not until he requested a second opinion that he was told he had been born with cirrhosis.The report was not able to establish why Mr Nolan had not been initially told of his condition or given advice about how he could make lifestyle changes to improve his health after diagnosis of the condition.In 2010, he was admitted to hospital several times in quick succession after becoming ill again and blood tests showed that "his liver was failing".But the hospital "sent him away, only finally admitting him three days after his appearance" with a serious infection and before finally being referred for specialist treatment. He died seven weeks later.The report said: "Had he been treated three days earlier, Mr X should have recovered from the infection and had a chance of receiving a liver transplant. This opportunity to survive and flourish was denied him."In an interview with BBC Wales, Mr Tyndall said: "If he had been appropriately and promptly treated, his family are left with the knowledge that he could still be with us today."He was a young man with his life ahead of him, a partner, a loving family, and all that was taken away."I was shocked by what our investigation found in this instance."This is one of the worst examples of poor treatment and poor communication with a patient that I have encountered in my time as ombudsman."He upheld the family's complaint and issued recommendations to hospital manager Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board to review its "care pathway" and appointments system as well as its complaints handling process.Mr Nolan's mother Pat, a call centre supervisor, said had he been advised about his diagnosis in 2001 he could have sought and received specialist help and advice to improve his condition and could, ultimately, be alive today had he been able to receive a liver transplant.Mrs Nolan said: "This is a catalogue of errors and everybody along the line is accountable for Carl's death because they knew what he had and no one saw fit to communicate that and act upon it."I don't know what their procedures are but something is very lax."Angela Hopkins, health board executive director of nursing, midwifery and patient services, said: "The health board recognises that some of the care given was below the standard that should have been provided to the patient and family."We fully accept the recommendations in the report and have taken action to address each one made."We are reviewing our appointment system and process and gastroenterology care pathways to provide an improved and more robust safe service for patients."We are also making sure that safeguard measures are implemented to improve our standards of engagement with patients while they are treated by the health service in north Wales."The ombudsman also recommended that £5,000 be paid to the family to acknowledge the "failings and provide financial redress" along with £500 for its "poor complaint handling".The report said the family wanted changes to ensure the same "mistakes are never repeated".The ombudsman can hold the institution to account but not individuals involved in the care of Mr Nolan.Hs mother has written to the General Medical Council which regulates doctors and the medical profession asking that her son's case is reviewed."As far as I can see they seem to be above the law and not answerable to anybody and it has got to stop," she said.</body>

      <body>The number of complaints against doctors in the UK has doubled in the past five years, figures show.The data from the General Medical Council showed there were more than 8,100 complaints in 2012, compared with just under 4,000 in 2007.About a third of complaints led to a full investigation by the regulator.But doctors' leaders said the figures still represented a small proportion of the amount of care given in the NHS - there are 250,000 doctors in the UK.Nonetheless, the rise in complaints - and the subsequent investigations - are still causing concern.The upward trend has happened during a period when there has been mounting concern about NHS care following the Stafford Hospital scandal.And research released last week by the patient watchdog Healthwatch England suggested that, if anything, problems were going unreported.Its survey showed half of those who had experienced a problem failed to report it.Healthwatch England chairwoman Anna Bradley said: "We all have a right to safe, dignified and high-quality care."Of the 8,109 complaints made last year, 2,673 were taken forward for an official investigation.A total of 179 sanctions and warnings have already been made, while nearly 900 cases remain open.The GMC said it was important to learn from the trend, but the regulator believes there may be an issue with patients not knowing to whom they should direct their complaints.The majority of complaints - nearly two-thirds - came from patients, but just a fifth were deemed within the GMC's scope to follow up.GMC chairman Prof Sir Peter Rubin said: "Overall the standard of care that patients receive in the UK is good and doctors continue to deserve the trust and respect of the public."What our report shows is that some patients don't know where to go to raise a concern about their treatment and more needs to be done to help them raise issues."British Medical Association leader Dr Mark Porter added: "It is encouraging that the number of overall complaints is very small given the hundreds of thousands of appointments, operations and other patient interactions that occur every day in the NHS."</body>

      <title>Seeing in 3D 'possible with one eye'</title>

      <body>The effect of "vivid 3D vision" can be experienced with just one eye, a study has suggested.Researchers at St Andrews University said a method using a small circular hole could have wide implications for 3D technology.The study, published in Psychological Science, also has implications for people who have just one eye or difficulties with double-eye vision.The method was said to create 3D similar to effects used in film-making.Researchers said that current thinking was based on the need for two visual images - one from each eye - to be combined in the visual cortex, creating a sense of depth.But Dr Dhanraj Vishwanath, a psychologist at the university, believes both eyes are not necessary for this "3D experience".Dr Vishwanath said: "We have demonstrated experimentally, for the first time, that the same 'special way' in which depth is experienced in 3D movies can also be experienced by looking at a normal picture with one eye viewing through a small aperture (circular hole)."While this effect has been known for a long time, it is usually dismissed."Now we have shown that it is in fact real, and the perceptual results are exactly like stereoscopic 3D, the kind seen in 3D movies."Based on this finding, we have provided a new hypothesis of what the actual cause of the 3D experience might be."The university said the 1838 invention of the stereoscope - the technology behind 3D film-making - brought with it the assumption two eyes were necessary for 3D vision.Dr Vishwanath said: "This work has significant implications for people who don't have normal binocular vision."First it could help them experience what it means to see in 3D. Second, it could encourage them to seek therapy to try to regain two-eye 3D vision (which produces the strongest 3D effect in everyday life) once they can see first-hand what 'seeing in 3D' is really like."Dr Vishwanath and his colleagues are now testing the method with a large group of strabismics, people with misaligned eyes.He said that nearly 15% of the population, including Hollywood actor Johnny Depp, may have some form of misalignment.The psychologist also believes his theory suggests a 3D experience could be induced simply by increasing resolution, using ultra-high definition (4K) televisions.Seeing in 3D with just one eye: Stereopsis without binocular vision is published by Psychological Science. Further research is due to be published later this year.</body>

      <title>Pet dog 'can predict epileptic fit'</title>
      <description>An Irish family say their Great Dane, Charlie, is helping to protect their three-year-old daughter by warning them when she is about to have an epileptic seizure.</description>

      <body>An Irish family has said their pet dog is helping to protect their three-year-old daughter by warning them when she is about to have an epileptic seizure.The Lynch family, from County Clare, believe their Great Dane, Charlie, can sense changes in their child up to 20 minutes before she has a fit.Brianna Lynch has epilepsy since birth.Her family said Charlie will alert them by walking in circles around Brianna. He also gently pins her against a wall to stop her from falling during a fit.Brianna's condition was picked up when she was three months old.It can lead to traumatic seizures, some of which cause her to go into a trance-like state, while others cause violent convulsions during which she is at risk of falling and hitting her head.Brianna's mother, Arabella Scanlan, said Charlie is not a trained "seizure alert dog" but was just a normal, family pet who appears to have developed some kind of special skill through his own instincts.They first noticed it some time ago when the huge Great Dane began to get agitated and walk in circles around Brianna. Minutes later the toddler had an epileptic fit."If you see a child having a seizure, it's pretty horrific, it's frightening, it's terrible, it's gut-wrenching," Ms Scanlan said."Charlie will know about 15 to 20 minutes before she's going into seizure. He'll get ever so panicky and giddy, almost as if you'd think 'this stupid dog is going to knock her over'."In fact, at first the family thought they might have to find another home for their clumsy Great Dane, amid concerns that he would knock the toddler down as a result of his agitation."He's a big boy - it isn't like he's agile. When Charlie turns the whole room turns with him," Ms Scanlan said. "But he has never once knocked her over."She said the family began to notice a pattern to Charlie's behaviour, with his increased agitation often preceding one of Brianna's fits."We kept an eye on this and, sure enough, I went into the yard one day and she (Brianna) was buckled over to the side, on top of him (Charlie). She was actually having a seizure."She was leaning against the wall, bent over him and he just looked at me as if to say 'I don't know what to do'. But he stayed with her, he didn't move."Ms Scanlan said that since then, the dog rarely leaves Brianna's side and will gently pin her up against a wall or other surface if he senses she is about to fit. He will guard the child until help arrives."I actually don't know the psychology behind it but, no shadow of a doubt, people are mesmerised when they see him in action. It would actually melt your heart to see them together," she added.Scientific studies have established that some dogs can be trained to "sniff out" cancers and detect low blood sugar levels in diabetic patients, but to date, there is no conclusive scientific proof that canines have an ability to predict human epileptic seizures.UK charities such as Support Dogs and Medical Detection Dogs train dogs to assist people with a variety of medical conditions.The Sheffield-based charity, Support Dogs, trains "seizure alert dogs" which it says can "give between 10-55 minutes warning prior to an oncoming seizure".Medical Detection Dogs chief executive Dr Claire Guest has personal experience of the animals' ability to detect serious illness.She was training dogs to recognise cancers, when she said one of them "started to warn her". She subsequently discovered she had an early stage breast tumour.Dr Guest said it had been established that dogs could detect human odour changes in cancer and diabetes patients but said it was not yet clear how some dogs could predict epileptic fits.She said it could be triggered by smell, but the dogs could also be responding to visual signals.It is certain that not all dogs showed signs of ability to detect illness and disease.Dr Guest said it was usually found in highly expressive dogs that were very attentive to humans and showed a general concern to protect their owners from harm.She added that most scientific studies had been initially sparked by "anecdotal reports" from pet owners who noticed a pattern of behaviour in their dogs, but said the area would benefit from more research.In 2003, findings from a preliminary study published in Seizure, European Journal of Epilepsy, suggested that "some dogs have innate ability to alert and/or respond to seizures".The study added that the success of these seizure alert dogs "depends largely on the handler's awareness and response to the dog's alerting behaviour".Charlie and Brianna's story was first reported in their local paper, the Clare Champion.The family are fundraising to a buy a new electroencephalography (EEG) machine for University Hospital Limerick, in order to accurately diagnose their daughter's condition.</body>

      <title>Is 'addiction' an excuse to overeat?</title>
      <description>Expert argues "food addiction" may just be an excuse to overeat</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24402163</url>
      <date>1381109365</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70287000/jpg/_70287873_sweetthings.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>"Food addiction" is becoming a popular term to explain overeating. But in this Scrubbing Up, Professor John Blundell from the Institute of Psychological Sciences at the University of Leeds warns the term is being used far too freely.Some have likened food addiction to drug addiction, and then used this term to associate it with overeating, and as a clinical explanation for the obesity epidemic, implicating millions of people.The use of the term food addiction is a step towards medicalisation and implies that normal human social behaviour is pathological.Forms of eating therefore become an illness. This attitude is not helpful and has huge implications for the way in which people view their own behaviour and their lives.The concept of food addiction comes from a combination of experimental data, anecdotal observations, scientific claims, personal opinions, deductions and beliefs.It is an over-simplification of a very complex set of behaviours.The existing evidence fails to define the precise characteristics of the actual foods concerned or the eating environment that underlies the assumed addiction risk.This is in contrast to drug addiction, where the molecule is identified and its pharmacological effect on the brain is characterised.Animal studies have shown changes to specific brain regions in those given a sugary diet - and human brain scans show activation of reward systems in the same part of the brain when sweet tastes are consumed.Therefore, it is not surprising that reward centres are activated when sweet foods are consumed, as we know that the reward circuits in the brain have been established through evolution as signalling systems that control our appetite.Many stimuli influence these areas of the brain and, in addition, there is an intrinsic drive to consume carbohydrate-rich foods to satisfy a basic metabolic need of the brain.Sweetness is a major signal for such foods but the science has not yet assessed this fully and much more work is needed before we could say that food is addictive.Attributing food addiction as the single cause underlying the development of obesity, despite the existence of numerous other very plausible explanations, is unhelpful, particularly for those trying to live more healthy lives.I am concerned that many people may potentially latch on to the concept of food addiction as an excuse to explain their overeating - the premise that it's "not my fault" and therefore, "I can't help it".This removes the personal responsibility they should feel and could act on - and they infer that their eating is a form of disease.Food addiction may offer an appealing explanation for some people but the concept could seriously hinder an individual's capacity for personal control.Binge eating disorder does exist - but it is a rare clinical condition affecting fewer than 3% of obese people.Sufferers have a strong compulsion to eat, which persists alongside the sense of a loss of control.Addiction-like food behaviour may be a component of the severe and compulsive form of binge eating disorder.But this condition does not explain the huge rise in obesity we have seen across the population.Binge eating is not a key cause of obesity and, therefore, in the context of mass public health, is not a major concern.What we need is a calm and composed analysis of what the words food addiction really mean so that people can make informed deductions about the causes of their own behaviour.If you are concerned that you may have an eating disorder and would like to speak with someone about it, you could contact the charity beat on 08456341414.</body>

      <description>Two doctors attack conventional medical equipment with power tools</description>

      <body>Archimedes did it in the bath, Tesla with a walking stick and the father of the sticky note had his flash of inspiration while singing in church - or so legend has it.Yet today we expect new inventions to be born in anonymous laboratories after the submission of several grant proposals.But the age of the home-grown inventor may not be over.David Williams and John Dingley are consultant anaesthetists at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Their moment of genius came in their garages while tinkering with glue-guns and car-body filler.Inspired by Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio, they wondered "almost jokingly" whether it might be possible to make something similarly economical and easy-to-use in the medical world.And having worked in remote settings, Dr Williams was aware of how crucial equipment that does not require a constant power source could be. In Zambia he had noticed entire operating theatres remaining unused because of a lack of replacement light bulbs or a reliable mains power supply.So the doctors set themselves the challenge of inventing essential kit for the doctor's bag on a budget.And after a week spent attacking conventional medical equipment with power tools, they had the first prototype of a device which has the potential to save lives.The ShakerScope is a light source which can be quickly adapted to look in people's eyes, ears and throats. But unlike regular devices it does not need batteries.Dr Patrick Finlay, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said: "According to the World Health Organisation, 95% of medical devices fail to work in developing countries. Often designers in the West don't understand the conditions elsewhere."This type of invention is very important. With these scopes you would normally need three different instruments for each examination, each one requiring batteries. For low income countries this is a joke. "At the core of the ShakerScope is a powerful moveable magnet, surrounded by a coil of wire.As noted by Michael Faraday in 1831, as the magnet moves over the wire the magnetic field induces an electric current in the coil. And shaking the ShakerScope for 30 seconds produces enough current to light the device for three minutes."That might not sound like long but it is more than enough time for most ear or eye examinations or to insert tracheal tubes," Dr Williams said.Once the scope is shaken the charge can be stored for many weeks. And instead of using a conventional light bulb, it uses a light emitting diode which can last up to 10,000 hours.The team has designed changeable heads allowing it be converted into a number of devices.One of its most promising uses so far has been as a laryngoscope - an instrument which lights-up the back of the mouth allowing anaesthetists to insert breathing tubes when people are unable to breathe for themselves.It has already been tested in military hospitals in Afghanistan, in Uganda and after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010."In Haiti we saw a lady with a neck injury who urgently needed a tracheal tube to help stabilise her. There were no other functioning laryngoscopes close by and the ShakerScope worked well despite the difficult case," said Dr Williams.According to Dr Williams the project has been a series of steep learning curves."Having the good idea is the easy part. Making it into a reality required an almost obsessive degree of dedication," he said.In the early days the doctors tried to do as much as possible from home - from teaching themselves microelectronics to perfecting their computer-aided design skills.Luckily for Dr Williams, his wife is a sculptor who works on large pieces of metal.He has been known to borrow her workshop, saws and glue-gun on many occasions. But he says he learned very early on that the kitchen may not be the best place to melt plastics.Dr Jerry Nolan, a consultant anaesthetist at Bath Royal United NHS Trust, who was not involved in the research said: "The ShakerScope has the potential to be invaluable in remote locations."That they have taught themselves the skills to get a final version near to market is even more remarkable and surely disproves the adage doctors make poor businessmen."The device is one of many frugal, home-grown devices recently showcased at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in the UK.Having made several fully-functioning versions tested across the world, the doctors say they recently reached the limit of their technical abilities, and passed on further manufacturing and design to a larger company.But these anaesthetists have returned to their sheds and have many other possible irons in the fire.</body>

      <title>The problem with taking too many vitamins</title>
      <description>Can supplements actually be dangerous?</description>

      <body>Millions of people swear by vitamin supplements. But many are wasting their time and some could even be harming themselves, argues Dr Chris van Tulleken.In November 1912 a party of three men and 16 dogs set out from a remote base in eastern Antarctica to explore a series of crevasses many hundreds of miles away.Three months later just one of the men returned. His name was Douglas Mawson. His skin was peeling off and his hair was falling out. He had lost almost half his body weight. He recounted what Sir Edmund Hillary described as "the greatest story of lone survival in the history of polar exploration".A month into their journey, one of the team, along with the tent, most of the provisions and six dogs plunged into a crevasse, never to be seen again. Mawson and the other surviving member, Xavier Mertz, started to return to base, surviving in part by eating the remaining dogs. After a few weeks Mertz developed stomach pains and diarrhoea. Then his skin started to peel off and his hair fell out. He died incontinent and delirious a few days later.Mawson suffered similar symptoms. With the kind of understatement typical of his generation of polar explorers he described the skin of the soles of his feet peeling off: "The sight of my feet gave me quite a shock, for the thickened skin of the soles had separated in each case as a complete layer... The new skin underneath was very much abraded and raw."It was the suffering of early explorers and sailors that motivated the first studies of vitamins and their deficiency diseases.At first sight Mawson's story seems to be another such tale - starvation combined with a lack of some vital nutrient. In fact, Mawson's description of his symptoms is an almost textbook description of vitamin A overdose - probably from eating dog liver. As little as 100g of husky liver could give a hungry explorer a fatal dose.Mawson lived to the decent age of 76 but in his story we find the cautionary tale for our times - vitamins can be very bad for you.This piece is about what we have learned about vitamin supplements in the last few years - if you are healthy, and you live in a country like the UK, taking multi-vitamins and high-dose antioxidants may shorten your life.For most of us, for most of the time, they're unhealthy. "Argh!" I hear you say, "I spend loads of money on them and the claims on the packet are really persuasive. Everything, from my full head of hair to my sex life, depends on them!"I want to get into this in a bit more detail because the vitamin companies certainly don't agree with me. So why do we believe they're useful and why do we take them?Vitamins are essential for life, and there are groups of people even in the UK who benefit from specific supplementation, but general unsupervised vitamin pill-popping is more than just a waste of money. The problem is that we all feel very warm and fuzzy about vitamins because, firstly, the tales of deficiency are so horrific, secondly, we read breakfast cereal packs and thirdly, a double-Nobel laureate called Linus Pauling liked vitamin C in vast, vast doses.All this is packaged by the people now selling us vitamins over the counter into that most beguiling of all logical falsehoods - if a little is good, then more must be better.Now I knew the names of the most obscure vitamins long before medical school because I have always had a fondness for the kind of multicoloured, artificially flavoured breakfast cereals that are marketed using a combination of unlikely cartoon animals and claims of being "vitamin and mineral-enriched".And it has to be said that this vitamin and mineral enrichment of staple food has been one of the most effective public health interventions in history. It continues to save countless lives per year even in Europe.So, while you shouldn't eat dog liver in Antarctica, vitamin A deficiency hugely increases the risk of blindness and death in children with measles and diarrhoea in developing countries. So the World Health Organization recommends a very strict amount and cautions that higher doses can cause birth defects in early pregnancy among other problems.So vitamins do make a huge difference to life expectancy in some circumstances, which is persuasive, and the breakfast propaganda catches us in our most vulnerable, bleary-eyed, early morning state, hinting to us that these vitamins have some sort of catch-all, beneficial effect on our lives, that will transform us into the healthy, energetic beautiful people/cartoon creatures portrayed on the cereal box.These things contribute to a general ideal of healthfulness of vitamins. And then there's Linus Pauling.Whether or not you've heard of him, Linus Pauling is a major influence on vitamin and nutrient culture. It's almost impossible to imagine someone with more authority and credibility. He won two Nobel prizes and was, by all accounts, a genuinely good bloke. He wrote a book in 1970 saying that high doses of vitamin C could be effective in combating flu, cancer, cardiovascular disease, infections and degenerative problems.He took immense quantities himself, hundreds of times the required amount, and lived to a ripe old age surrounded by many great grandchildren. He was the poster boy for mega-dosing of vitamins and this contributed to the growth of an industry supported by the belief that supplementation of these molecules in our diet is beneficial in almost every way imaginable.But rather than taking one man's word for it, however credible, it's worth looking at the results of studies that look at what happens to people who take these supplements for long periods of time.Looking at any one individual study won't be very revealing to answer the question of whether vitamin supplementation is good for you. They're densely scientific and the conflicts of interest can be very hard to spot.For the answer you have to turn to what are called "systematic review papers". This is where independent scientists gather up all the available data and re-analyse it to answer big questions.Here's what a couple of them say:"We found no evidence to support antioxidant supplements for primary or secondary prevention [of diseases of any kind]. Beta-carotene and vitamin E seem to increase mortality, and so may higher doses of vitamin A. Antioxidant supplements need to be considered as medicinal products and should undergo sufficient evaluation before marketing". (See references below).Just to be clear - "increase mortality" - that means they're killing you. These are powerfully bioactive compounds but they're not regulated in the same way as drugs. Whatever you think about the regulation there should surely be a warning on the pack if there's data saying they're bad for us.The next question is - why are they bad for us? It's very hard to pick apart the data, partly because vitamins are a fabulously diverse group of chemicals.I'm going to include what people normally refer to as minerals under the heading of vitamins. They're required in the diet not for energy, but as chemical partners for the enzymes involved in the body's metabolism - cell production, tissue repair, and other vital processes.Their functions are understood largely by their deficiency diseases so we're not exactly sure of precisely what they all do or how they interact. Antioxidants provide a nice example. They soak up the very toxic, chemically-reactive by-products of metabolism called free radicals. These free radicals, left unchecked, can cause damage to DNA and may be linked to cancer.Your cells are full of antioxidants but surely taking more would be better? Right? Keep those cancer causing radicals under control? Well, unfortunately, your body's immune system fights infections by using free radicals to kill bugs. Exactly what effect huge quantities of extra antioxidants could have on this is not clear but it's easy to imagine that it might not be good and you could get more infections.Vitamin A is linked to increasing lung cancer in smokers. Excess zinc is linked to reduced immune function. Long-term excessive intake of manganese is linked to muscle and nerve disorders in older people. Niacin in excess has been linked to cell damage. And so on.And it gets more complicated still when you start mixing everything up in one tablet. For example, different minerals compete for absorption. If you take large quantities of calcium you won't be able to absorb your iron. If you take large quantities of iron you won't be able to absorb zinc. If you take vitamin C you'll reduce your copper level.So it's not just that taking lots of one thing is not good for you, it's that it may cause a dangerous reduction in something else even if you are also supplementing that. To work out the optimal ratios is all but impossible although some manufactures claim to have worked it out.So when are supplements recommended? The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends certain supplements for some groups of people who are at risk of deficiency, including:Your GP may also recommend supplements if you need them for a medical condition. If you decide to take supplements, stick to within the RDA, unless you've had guidance from a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist to exceed the dose. If you've got questions about dosage levels, consult a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist.The tales of deficiency combined with the success of enrichment programs means that it's easy to make that leap of logic that if a little is good then more must be better.And if you read my article last week on water you'll see where this is going. I could do this every week. The same article. Substitute water for vitamins/probiotics/antibiotics. Don't trust the science done by the people who are trying to sell them to you and don't assume that if some is good more must be better.It's like beer. Or coffee. Or computer games. Goldilocks was right about things needing to be just right.References:Bjelakovic G, Nikolova D, Simonetti RG, Gluud C.

      <title>The danger of rumination</title>
      <description>Can too much rumination be dangerous?</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country.A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind?Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation.But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be.The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them.A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK."We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool."Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown."The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety."The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others.The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion."But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says."The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem."This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology."Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years."When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says."If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head."Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming."There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me."Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head."Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders.And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum.In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems.So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them?"Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman.It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study."It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says."It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed."Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system."This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster."And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists."Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on FacebookFollow @BBCOuch on Twitter and on FacebookFollow @BBCOuch on Twitter and on Facebook, and listen to our monthly talk show</body>

      <body>The Future's Rosie recently won "best new blog" at the MAD (Mum and Dad) Blog awards. In it, Thomas Bachofner documents the progress of his two-year-old daughter, Rosie, who has Down's Syndrome. But why does he blog about it?I'm a graphic designer from Cheshire, not known for writing or reading any books. So it came as a surprise to me that I could even string a sentence together, let alone write a blog that is well received - I'm guessing it's because it comes from the heart.My site is about Rosie's achievements, such as last week when she stood up for the first time, but it also gives me an opportunity to do my little bit towards raising positive awareness of Down's.The first post was published on 14 February 2012 but the idea to share our story with the world came much earlier.When my wife Karen and I learnt that our unborn daughter had Down's syndrome, it was a shock, and it didn't feel like anybody understood our predicament.As a parent, you assume that everything will be fine. Our two boys, Harry and Joe, were born without complications. But we were told about Rosie's condition in such a negative way that we thought it would change our lives drastically for the worse.I found that all I wanted to do was read real-life parent stories from people in our situation, not the science and figures you become bombarded with when searching online. But there weren't many Down's syndrome parenting blogs around at the time and even fewer were written from a dad's perspective.I started to jot things down and was surprised to find that it helped get my emotions out. My scribbles eventually turned into The Future's Rosie which is having more of an impact on me and others than I could ever have predicted.Initially it was a handy way of telling my friends and family how I was feeling and it meant I didn't have to repeat myself over and over at what was a delicate time for me. But many of them began to share it with their friends and, before I knew it, my blog was being read by hundreds of people.I've shared lots of private thoughts about her development and how we as a family are all pitching in to help her.Last year I wrote about what I called "a barbaric-looking developmental aid" given to Rosie by her physio. It's a standing brace and we couldn't get her to use it. She hadn't wanted to walk or crawl, so we got Rosie's brothers to stand on the sofa and blow bubbles which made her reach up and support her body with her legs in order to strengthen them.I've covered learning the Makaton sign language, feeling full of pride when my young sons Harry and Joe stood on stage at school to give a talk about Down's to 250 kids, and I wrote about the weekend we all survived without Mummy being there.One of the hardest things I have done is write about Rosie's surgery. Children with Down's syndrome often have related heart difficulties and Rosie was born with a hole in the heart which needed fixing. My blog entry on that day included post-op pictures of my daughter - it felt like these might be useful for parents to see, if they too have to face the same operation with their Down's syndrome child.As Rosie got older, I quickly learned that my own pre-conceived ideas of Down's were both ignorant and outdated. I wanted to teach others about the reality in a non-patronising manner, so decided to use myself as an example in my own social media campaign. I did it from Rosie's perspective and called it Things I've Taught My Daddy.As with the blog, before I knew it the captioned images I shared on Facebook and Twitter had been seen by thousands worldwide.One of the messages I tried to communicate was that people with Down's are people first and foremost. They are more like their families than they are each other, though many people still find it difficult to see past the physical characteristics associated with the syndrome.Life with Rosie really is very normal, in fact she has been a far easier baby than both her older brothers were. The whole family love her to pieces and I genuinely wouldn't change a single thing about her - well, maybe the volume of her cries when she is hungry.After all "Down's syndrome" isn't who she is, it is just a part of her.Thomas Bachofner blogs at The Future's RosieYou can follow Ouch on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <body>Immunisation has been one of the great success stories of global health. It is estimated to prevent the deaths of two to three million children each year. But another 1.5 million children still die from diseases that could be prevented by routine vaccines.The eradication of smallpox in 1980 helped encourage global efforts to fight more diseases through immunisation. These maps chart the growth of global vaccine coverage from 1980 and show which countries are doing best - and worst - at protecting their population. The three vaccines illustrated combat five infections and have been chosen as they demonstrate varying levels of progress against several major diseases.Source: WHO and UNICEF estimates of national routine immunization coverage, 2012 data revision (July 2013).The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 1.5 million deaths children under five die each year from diseases that could have been prevented by routine immunisation.The chart shows that pneumococcal diseases and rotavirus infection are responsible for around two thirds of these deaths. The former causes pneumonia and the latter is the most common cause of severe diarrhoea.Vaccines against the main causes of both infections have been introduced in the past decade. They are now routinely available in wealthier countries and are being gradually introduced across the developing world.The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) has preliminary plans to support the introduction of rotavirus vaccines in more than 30 of the world's poorest countries by 2015.More than 25 developing countries have begun using pneumococcal vaccines and it hopes to rollout the jab in 45 countries by 2015.Written and produced by Fergus Walsh, John Walton, Sophia Domfeh, Martyn Rees and Claire Shannon.</body>

      <body>Draft guidelines on abortion issued in Northern Ireland in March have caused a "mood of fear" among medical staff, according to a retired obstetrician.Prof Jim Dornan has more than 40 years of experience in obstetric medicine.He said health trusts had sought legal advice over the implications for staff in the draft guidelines.He added that some NI trusts were told by their legal teams that staff should stop giving advice to pregnant women in cases of foetal abnormality.Prof Dornan was speaking to BBC Radio Ulster amid recent controversy over two such cases, where pregnant women requested abortions in Northern Ireland because their babies had been diagnosed with anencephaly, a severe brain abnormality.Sarah Ewart and another woman, known only as Laura, were both told their babies would die either before or shortly after birth, but they were both refused terminations as foetal abnormality is not a reason for abortion under Northern Ireland law.Prof Dornan said cases of this kind had started to emerge as a result of changes laid out in the new draft abortion guidelines published in March.He said the draft guidelines had introduced two new measures that medical staff had found "particularly offensive".Those measures, he said were the warning that staff could face ten years in jail if they failed to report their suspicions of unlawful terminations to police, and also the recommendation that only a consultant psychiatrist should decide whether or not a pregnancy should be terminated on the grounds of risk to a woman's mental health.Prof Dornan said: "The mood is fear within the health care professionals because of these guidelines."He added: "Some of the trusts went to their legal teams at that stage (March) and were advised to stop...giving advice on what to do in these situations."The retired obstetrician worked as director of foetal medicine at the Royal Maternity Hospital in Belfast for 20 years and was a member of the committee that drew up the previous guidelines on abortion in Northern Ireland.He said: "It has always been made very clear to us that case law in Northern Ireland 100% allows a pregnancy to be delivered before 24 weeks in certain circumstances. Those circumstances are that they are definitely not because there is a foetal abnormality but because of the effect of the abnormality on the physical or mental health of the mother."However, Prof Dornan said that after a recent judicial review, Northern Ireland's Department of Health "then brought forward new guidelines in March this year that bore no resemblance to the previous guidelines"."There were two areas that were particularly offensive to those of us who have been providing this very sensitive care for over 50 years - the assessment of mental health. It was suggested that this should be by a psychiatrist and not by the team of geneticists, paediatricians, obstetricians and midwives who have been doing it for 50 years."Secondly, they said that any healthcare worker, including non-clinical healthcare workers, if they suspected that something illegal was going or in their unit, they must report it to the PSNI or risk ten years in jail."However, he added that he was "greatly heartened" to hear the Health Minister Edwin Poots say that he would ask the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to "state unequivocally what the chances are of conviction under present law should any health care workers be involved".Mr Poots offered to meet both women involved in the recent abortion controversy and to examine the legal implications for staff who are asked to carry out terminations in cases of fatal foetal abnormality.Prof Dornan said: "I think that'll be very, very helpful. I really can't see the DPP coming out with any other thing other than to say that what we were doing right up until March of this year was within the law."He told BBC Radio Ulster that every year, about about 200 pregnancies in Northern Ireland will involve "major genetic or anatomical problems" with the foetus.He said that in the vast majority of problem pregnancies in Northern Ireland, obstetricians "work very closely with our paediatric colleagues and do our best to maximise outcome for the mother and the baby"."Some women have got the skill set that they can continue with a pregnancy, some do not."We support them all, all life should be respected and is respected. All of those of us involved in this healthcare area respect life. We are all pro-life, but we are pro-life of the mother and pro-life of everybody," Prof Dornan added.</body>

      <title>Where ill people are locked in cages with hyenas</title>
      <description>Where deadly hyenas are used to treat mental illness</description>

      <body>Somalia has one of the highest rates of mental illness in the world and with a healthcare system devastated by years of war, most sufferers receive no medical help. Many are chained up - to trees or at home. Some are even locked in cages with hyenas. But one man is trying to change all that.Dr Hab's advert runs up to three times a day on Mogadishu's radio stations."He's gone crazy! He's running away!" screams the actor. "Chain him down!"The scenario is familiar in Somalia. A man has become possessed by spirits and the only option for his family is to restrain him and call the sheikh. But as the young man protests, a voice that challenges Somali tradition booms out."Stop with the chains!" the voiceover orders. "Take him to Dr Hab's hospital! If he's having mental problems, take him to Dr Hab. He won't chain him, he'll help him."Dr Hab is not actually a real psychiatrist. Rather it's the persona of Abdirahman Ali Awale, a nurse who after three months of specialist training from the World Health Organization (WHO), has made it his mission to rescue Somalia's mentally ill. He claims he is able to treat everything from post-natal depression to schizophrenia.But the alternative to a trip to Hab could be a visit to one of Somalia's popular herbalists or sheikhs who still advocate traditional - and sometimes barbaric - cures."There is a belief in my country that hyenas can see everything including the evil spirits people think cause mental illness," says Hab. "So in Mogadishu, you will find hyenas that have been brought from the bush and families will pay £350 ($560) to have their loved one locked in the room overnight with the animal."The expensive treatment - more than the average annual wage - is as brutal as it sounds. By clawing and biting at the patient, the hyena is thought to force the evil spirit out. Patients, including young children, have been known to die during the process."We are trying to show people that this is nonsense," says Hab. "People listen to our radio advert and they learn that mental illness is just like any other and needs to be treated with scientific methods."Hab's campaign was prompted by an incident in 2005 when he witnessed a group of female patients being chased through the streets by youths. "There was no-one to help them," he says. "I decided after that I would have to open Somalia's first mental hospital."The Habeb Public Mental Health Hospital in Mogadishu became the first of Hab's six centres across Somalia. Together, they have now treated over 15,000 patients.There were only three practising psychiatrists in the whole of Somalia at the last count, and Hab - despite his lack of advanced qualifications - is head of what has become the country's leading provider of mental health services. He even carries a letter from the minister of health that says so.Hab faces a near insurmountable task. WHO estimates that one in three Somalis either is or has been affected by mental illness, compared to a global average of one in 10. In parts of the country, where the population has been the most psychologically scarred from decades of conflict, the rate is even higher. Cases of post-traumatic stress disorder are common and the situation is further complicated by widespread substance abuse."Khat is a big, big problem," says Hab of the herbal stimulant which has been chewed for centuries in East Africa. Side effects are thought to include anxiety and even psychosis. "We treat them in the hospital and they leave, but then they start eating khat again. Sometimes I see the same patients seven or eight times."Western aid agencies in Somalia have often promoted projects targeting communicable diseases, not least because results are quicker and cheaper to obtain. Hab, meanwhile, says he is left to run his organisation with minimal resources and an erratic supply of psychotropic medicines that he sources from NGOs and private pharmacies.Even getting sufferers to recognise that their condition constitutes an illness is difficult. Psychological problems are more likely to be reported by Somalis as physical pain - headaches, sweating, and chest pain. Some concepts of mental illness do not even exist in Somali culture - depression, for example, translates as "the feelings a camel has when its friend dies".But nothing is more indicative of the population's poor understanding of mental health than the widespread practice of chaining-up sufferers to trees and in rooms. GRT, an Italian NGO, has documented sufferers who have been chained up their entire life."I myself have saved many patients who have been left to die," says Hab who drives a minibus into rural areas, unchaining people and taking them to one of his centres. "Parents, siblings, relatives - they've just been chained up to a tree and the family has gone."The WHO has funded a "Chain Free Initiative", with the aim of eradicating the practice altogether, starting with the use of chains in hospitals. But even Hab admits to having chained up some of his most aggressive patients.He tells the story of how, in 2007, one unintended consequence of his acquisition of a batch of the anti-psychotic drug, fluphenazine hydrochloride, was an increased appetite in his patients. They took to scaling the walls of his hospital in Mogadishu to scavenge for food. But still desperately unwell, some of the escapees had been shot when they ignored orders at a military checkpoint. Chaining them to their beds, concluded Hab, was the only option."Many patients take a long time to treat," he says. "There has been no outside help focussed on treating mental health problems and the main reason NGOs are not getting involved is because of the expense."Hab is motivated by the thousands of patients he believes remain chained up in private homes. He sends through a spreadsheet showing what he needs - new mattresses, food for patients, and diesel for his minibus. There is also a shortage of qualified psychiatrists and nurses. The daily struggle to provide for his patients and the suffering he witnesses is clearly taking its toll."Physiologically and mentally it's a very hard job" he says. "I was healthy when I started, now I suffer from diabetes. I am dealing with big, big problems all by myself."I have cried on TV, I have cried in public places, I have cried in front of presidents," he says. "Even now I feel like crying."</body>

      <body>Millions of people around the world have learned CPR on a mannequin known as Resusci Anne. The story of the 19th Century beauty behind the model - or at least, one version of it - will be told at a symposium in London to mark European Restart a Heart Day. But does anyone really know anything about her?The Lorenzi workshop is a small haven of peace and antiquity in the busy Parisian suburb of Arcueil. And it's the last of its kind. Downstairs the mouleurs, or cast-makers, create figurines, busts and statues, pouring plaster into moulds in much the same way they have since the family business started in the 1870s.But if you want to be face-to-face with history, pick your way up the dusty wooden stairs to a room above the workshop. It's an unsettling experience. Hanging all around you in the narrow attic are life and death masks of poets and artists, politicians and revolutionaries: Napoleon, Robespierre, Verlaine, Victor Hugo, the robust, impatient face of the living Beethoven and the sallow, diminished features of the composer's death mask.Yet, surprisingly, of all the visages of the great and the good on display at Lorenzi's, the best-seller is the mask of a young woman. She has a pleasant, attractive face, with the hint of a smile playing on her lips. Her eyes are closed but they look as if they might spring open at any moment. Hers is the one mask that has no name. She's known simply as the Inconnue, the unknown woman of the Seine.This is how her story goes. Some time in the late 19th Century, the drowned body of a young woman was recovered from the River Seine. As was customary in those days, her body was put on display at the Paris mortuary, in the hope that someone would recognise and identify her. The pathologist on duty became so entranced by the face of the girl with the enigmatic half-smile that he asked a moulder to take a plaster cast of her face.Before long the mask began to appear for sale outside the mouleurs' workshops on the Left Bank and soon the young woman's face became a muse for artists, novelists and poets, all eager to weave imagined identities and stories around the mystery woman, this drowned Mona Lisa. Over the years Rilke, Louis Aragon, Man Ray and Vladimir Nabokov successively fell under the Inconnue's spell and at one time no fashionable European drawing room was complete without a mask of the Inconnue on the wall.One of the first stories featuring her was the 1899 novella The Worshipper of the Image by Richard le Gallienne, who portrays the mask as a malevolent force which bewitches and ultimately destroys a young poet. Other authors have been kinder, many of them telling the story of an innocent young woman from the country who comes to Paris, who's seduced by a rich lover and then abandoned when she falls pregnant. With nobody to turn to, she drowns herself in the waters of the Seine, a modern Ophelia. At the mortuary, her beautiful face, now peaceful in death, is preserved forever with a plaster cast.It was another drowning - or near-drowning - that ensured the Inconnue a place in medical history.In 1955 Asmund Laerdal saved the life of his young son, Tore, grabbing the boy's lifeless body from the water just in time and clearing his airways. Laerdal at that time was a successful Norwegian toy manufacturer, specialising in making children's dolls and model cars from the new generation of soft plastics. When he was approached to make a training aid for the newly-invented technique of CPR - cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the combination of chest compressions and the kiss of life which can save the life of a patient whose heart has stopped - his son's brush with death a few years earlier made him very receptive.He developed a torso or whole-body mannequin which simulates an unconscious patient requiring CPR. Asmund wanted his mannequin to have a natural appearance. He also felt that a female doll would seem less threatening to trainees. Remembering a mask on the wall of his grandparents' house many years earlier, he decided that the Inconnue de la Seine would become the face of Resusci Anne. So if you're one of the 300 million people who's been trained in CPR, you've almost certainly had your lips pressed to the Inconnue's.Through Resusci Anne, students of first aid have for more than 50 years been trying to bring back to life the young woman from the Seine. But was the Inconnue actually dead in the first place? Is that peaceful face really a death mask or was it taken from a live model? When a few years ago I was making a Radio 4 programme about the Inconnue with the novelist Louise Welsh, we decided to show the mask to the men and women who specialise in recovering drowned bodies from the Seine - the Paris river police, known as the Brigade Fluviale.Sitting in the wheelhouse of one of the brigade's boats moored at their headquarters near the Pont d'Austerlitz, Chief Brigadier Pascal Jacquin was less than convinced that the girl was dead when the mask was made."It's surprising to see such a peaceful face," he said. "Everyone we find in the water, the drowned and suicides, they never look so peaceful. They're swollen, they don't look nice."Over the centuries, artists and writers may have used the stories of Ophelia and the Lady of Shallot to portray drowning as a romantic and peaceful death but Pascal knows from years of dredging bodies out of the Seine that the truth is very different. Even suicides fight for life at the last moment and their faces betray that struggle. And the process of decomposition starts much more quickly in water too.This woman, he remarked, "looks like she's just asleep and waiting for Prince Charming to come".Like so many others before him, Jacquin's imagination had been piqued by the young woman's face and he had already begun to weave a tale of his own around the closed eyes, that secretive little smile and the enigma of the Inconnue.Other experts we consulted seemed to agree that the Inconnue seemed just too healthy, too vital for the mask to have been taken from a corpse. At the workshop in Arcueil, Michel Lorenzi, the current proprietor, is mystified by people's fascination with the Inconnue."This doesn't look to me like the face of a dead person. It's very hard to maintain a smile while a cast is being taken so I think she was a professional, a very good model."For me the story has two postscripts. The first came a few weeks after the programme was broadcast in 2009. I was visiting Edward Chambre Hardman's photographic studio in Liverpool, the National Trust's perfectly preserved time capsule from the first half of the 20th Century, where anyone who was anyone in Liverpool sat for a portrait with Hardman. Seeing the mask of the Inconnue on the wall of his waiting room, I asked the guide, disingenuously, who the young woman was.Without hesitating she told me the story of two sisters, identical twins, who'd been born in Liverpool more than a century ago. One of them, she said, had embarked on a love affair with a rich suitor and eloped to Paris, never to be seen again. Many years later the other sister had visited Paris on holiday. Walking down a street she was shocked to see the mask of the drowned Inconnue hanging outside the mouleurs' workshops. She had instantly recognised the girl as her long-lost twin, condemned - or blessed - to remain forever young, while her sister grew old.I was captivated by the story. Once again, a tapestry of imagination had been woven around the enigma of the Inconnue and in this case it had been given a Liverpool twist.The other postscript comes from an Oxford-based artist called John Goto. Several years ago he decided to create his own fiction for the Inconnue.He constructed an apparently factual account of detective work and a trail of clues leading to the discovery of a turn-of-the-century carte de visite in a Buenos Aires junk shop. This and other evidence supposedly proved finally and beyond doubt the identity of the Inconnue - she was as a Hungarian actress named Ewa Lazlo, who was murdered by her lover, Louis Argon. Goto put the story and its "supporting evidence" online and moved on to other projects.It was intriguing, therefore, to come across details of this week's London symposium for European Restart a Heart Day. During the day a series of speakers share the latest research on improving survival rates after cardiac arrest. But in the evening entertainment is provided by the ensemble Mulberry Hawk. They're putting on a performance which, according to the blurb, "tells the story of Ewa Lazlo who became the inspiration for the face of Resusci Anne, the first CPR training manikin, and the most kissed girl in the world".So, I thought, Ewa is beginning to take on a life of her own. In fact several websites and blogs are quoting as fact that she's the Inconnue.Goto admits to feeling a little uncomfortable with his creation. "I'd assumed that people would have a postmodern view and treat it as fictional," he told me. "I really didn't expect them to take it seriously."But even if Ewa is an object lesson in not believing quite everything you read on the internet, it's unlikely that the story will go much further.What we love about the Inconnue is the uncertainty, the enigma. As Louise Welsh remarked when we returned from recording our search for this drowned Mona Lisa in Paris, the mask's value lies in its mystery."The moment we have a name, a life story, that mystery is dead."Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <body>Studies have claimed major health benefits for standing for much of the day as opposed to sitting. The difference is marked, explains Michael Mosley.Guess how many hours a day you spend sitting? Fewer than eight? More than 10? A recent survey found that many of us spend up to 12 hours a day sitting on our bottoms looking at computers or watching television. If you throw in the seven hours we spend sleeping then that adds up to a remarkable 19 hours a day being sedentary.Sitting down as much as this is clearly bad for us and some studies suggest that those who sit all day live around two years less than those who are more active. Most of us are guilty of excess sitting. We sit at work, in the car and at home, moving only to shift from one seat to another.Even if you exercise on a regular basis that may not be enough. There is mounting evidence that exercise will not undo the damage done by prolonged sitting. Our technology has made us the most sedentary humans in history.So why is sitting so damaging? One thing it does is change the way our bodies deal with sugar. When you eat, your body breaks down the food into glucose, which is then transported in the blood to other cells.Glucose is an essential fuel but persistently high levels increase your risk of diabetes and heart disease. Your pancreas produces the hormone insulin to help get your glucose levels back down to normal, but how efficiently your body does that is affected by how physically active you areWe wanted to see what would happen if we took a group of people who normally spend their day sitting in an office and ask them to spend a few hours a day on their feet instead.Standing while you are working may seem rather odd, but it is a practice with a long tradition. Winston Churchill wrote while working at a special standing desk, as did Ernest Hemingway and Benjamin Franklin.So with Dr John Buckley and a team of researchers from the University of Chester we conducted a simple experiment. We asked 10 people who work at an estate agents to stand for at least three hours a day for a week.Our lucky volunteers had mixed feelings about how they would get on."It'll be different, but looking forward to it, yes…""I think my feet might hurt - I'll have to wear sensible shoes…""The small of my back, it's going to hurt…""I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to stand up for all that time…[Laughs nervously]"We asked all the volunteers to wear an accelerometer - a movement monitor - to record just how much moving about they were doing. They also wore heart rate monitors and had glucose monitors that measured their blood sugar levels constantly, day and night.The evidence that standing up is good for you goes back to at least the 1950s when a study was done comparing bus conductors (who stand) with bus drivers (who don't). This study, published in the Lancet, showed that the bus conductors had around half the risk of developing heart disease of the bus drivers.Since then prolonged sitting has not only been linked to problems with blood glucose control, but also a sharp reduction in the activity of an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase, which breaks down blood fats and makes them available as a fuel to the muscles. This reduction in enzyme activity leads to raised levels of triglycerides and fats in the blood, increasing the risk of heart disease.We had good reason to believe that standing would make a difference to our volunteers, but we were also a little anxious as to how they would get on. This was the first time an experiment like this had been conducted in the UK. Would our volunteers stick to it?They did. One woman with arthritis even found that standing actually improved her symptoms.The Chester researchers took measurements on days when the volunteers stood, and when they sat around. When they looked at the data there were some striking differences. As we had hoped, blood glucose levels fell back to normal levels after a meal far more quickly on the days when the volunteers stood than when they sat.There was also evidence, from the heart rate monitors that they were wearing, that by standing they were burning more calories."If we look at the heart rates," John Buckley explains, "we can see they are quite a lot higher actually - on average around 10 beats per minute higher and that makes a difference of about 0.7 of a calorie per minute."Now that doesn't sound like much, but it adds up to about 50 calories an hour. If you stand for three hours a day for five days that's around 750 calories burnt. Over the course of a year it would add up to about 30,000 extra calories, or around 8lb of fat."If you want to put that into activity levels," Dr Buckley says, "then that would be the equivalent of running about 10 marathons a year. Just by standing up three or four hours in your day at work."Dr Buckley thinks that although going out and doing exercise offers many proven benefits, our bodies also need the constant, almost imperceptible increase in muscle activity that standing provides. Simple movement helps us to keep our all-important blood sugar under control.We can't all stand up at work but the researchers believe that even small adjustments, like standing while talking on the phone, going over to talk to a colleague rather than sending an email, or simply taking the stairs, will help.I have, of course, written this article while standing.Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <description>Can Nike's Fuelband and other fitness trackers change your behaviour?</description>

      <body>Nike says its new activity-tracking Fuelband SE will motivate people to exercise even more. But can a wristband really lead to better health?Back in 2009, Nike vice-president of digital sport Stefan Olander and his team had an idea: what if a person could track how much they've moved in a day, just by glancing at their wrist?And so, the Nike Fuelband was born.Released in 2012, in a simple, sleek, black plastic design that flashed from red to green once a person's daily fitness goal had been met, the first Fuelband sold out in hours.The pitch was this: by wearing a Fuelband and monitoring fitness data via an app or on the web, anyone - from a professional athlete to Mr Olander himself - could work out a better, more effective, path to health."In today's society, we are overwhelmed with complexity," says Mr Olander.With the Fuelband, he says, Nike really tries "to filter out what doesn't matter and just give you what you need in order to stay motivated."So what's different this time around?Nike says that in addition to making physical improvements to the latest Fuelband - better waterproofing, stainless steel screws - it has also analysed the data from the first wave of Fuelband adopters to see ways in which the band and its supporting iOS app and website could be improved.They found that 98% of their 20 million users exercised - but they didn't necessarily consistently move the recommended five minutes every hour.Now, the wristband buzzes to alert its wearer if he or she hasn't got up in a while.But Nike is not the only company experimenting with wearable technology - particularly as estimates about the potential growth in the industry range from $10bn to $50bn (£6bn to £31bn) in the next five years.Competitor Fitbit recently released a new model, and Jawbone, iHealth, Garmin, Withings and Adidas are among other firms to offer dedicated fitness-measuring gadgets.Samsung and Sony recently released a smartwatch that can monitor a user's steps, and even Apple - whose boss, Tim Cook, sits on Nike's board of directors - has expressed an interest in a device.But beyond these gadgets, Nike's main competition might not be a rival band, but the smartphone."Smartphones are going to start doing more of the tracking, and more people have them already and don't have to buy separate devices," says Sara Watson, a fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society.Already, there is a spate of apps - from MyMee to MapMyRun - capitalising on these built-in features.Beyond the competition, there is also the basic question: can wearing a wristband really make you healthier?"The notion of tracking itself has been around a long time - this is not something new," says Michael Kim, a former Microsoft Xbox executive who is now the head of Kairos Labs."The problem is tracking does not create new behaviour change - it tracks what you already do as a behaviour," says Mr Kim, whose firm works to help people cement their habits.But some doctors say the bands can help those who are already interested in exercise better tailor their workouts."We have done a number of athletic performance tracking projects with people," says Dr Paul Abramson, a physician in San Francisco who uses tracking technologies in his practice."Things like the Fuelband or more complex versions of them can be very useful for people who want to exercise more."Companies are also showing an interest in tracking sensors. In 2008 Bank of America equipped dozens of its call centre staff with special badges to study the way they interacted with each other as part of efforts to boost productivity.One technology consultant suggested several firms were now interested in using fitness equipment as a way of encouraging their staff to bond."At a symposium event last week I was talking to a couple of companies that were trying to improve employee engagement, and there's some thinking that not only are healthier employees more productive but that their sharing of information about how much they are walking, how much they are riding etc is becoming the new 'water cooler' moment," says Mike Gotta from Gartner.However, he cautions that managers should resist the temptation to see the gadgets as the human equivalent of the black boxes used by some car insurance companies to track driver behaviour."A few months back one firm made the news for saying: 'If you don't meet certain criteria we're going to charge you more per month for your healthcare.' That kind of behaviour could create a backlash," Mr Gotta warns."But if firms give these analytics to the employees for their own self-improvement and are relatively hands-off, then the workers will share the information themselves and that could create better relationships across teams."Experts also note that gadgets like the Fuelband still have plenty of room for improvement. At present the measurements it captures are not always precise.Rivals are attempting to address this by offering a wider range of sensors.Withings, for example, has built a heart-rate monitor into its Pulse tracker; Polar's Loop carries out a similar trick by connecting its wristband to a separate accessory; Fitbit includes an altimeter in its new Force wristband to count the number of stairs climbed; while Motorola's Motoactv can be linked up with bicycle-fitted sensors that measure how fast the equipment is being pedalled and its speed of travel.Sensors that measure skin temperature, perspiration and the electrical activity produced by muscles offer further opportunities."The fitness space has spawned a whole host of explorations of tracking devices in other areas," says Steve Dean, a partner at Prehype and a founder of the Quantified Self group in New York, which meets to discuss personal data tracking projects and technologies."It's almost like there's an endless amount of things that we can instrument on our body."</body>

      <body>British Gas is to increase prices for domestic customers, with a dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2% from 23 November.The increase, which will affect nearly eight million households in the UK, includes an 8.4% rise in gas prices and a 10.4% increase in electricity prices.The company said it "understands the frustration" of prices rising faster than incomes. The average annual household bill will go up by £123.PM David Cameron has urged consumers to switch suppliers for the best deal.Energy Minister Ed Davey has described the latest price rise as "extremely disappointing news" for customers.Rival SSE has already announced an 8.2% increase in bills from 15 November.On average, customers will see a dual-fuel bill increase to £1,444 a year.However, there are significant regional variations. On average, the biggest increase in a dual-fuel bill is an 11.2% rise in the north of Scotland, in the Scottish Hydro Electric region. The smallest is a 6.8% increase in the south west of England.The company said that the cost of buying energy on the global markets, delivering gas and electricity to customers' homes, and the government's "green" levies, were all factors in the decision to put up prices."I know these are difficult times for many customers and totally understand the frustration that so many household costs keep on rising when incomes are not keeping pace," said Ian Peters, managing director of British Gas Residential Energy."We haven't taken this decision lightly, but what is pushing up energy prices at the moment are costs that are not all directly under our control."The company, which operates as Scottish Gas in Scotland, said it made a profit of five pence in the pound after tax.British Gas, the UK's biggest energy supplier, said in May that a profit boost would be used to delay future price rises. This came because customers used 18% more gas in the first four months of the year owing to the cold weather.At the time, a spokesman said: "We will use that [cold weather benefit] to effectively hold prices for as long as possible."Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%.Caroline Flint, shadow energy secretary, said: "These latest price rises show clearer than ever why Labour's price freeze is needed." Party leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election.But the prime minister branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas.Mr Cameron also said he was disappointed with the British Gas' announcement."I would encourage customers who are not happy with the service they're getting, are not happy with the prices, to go to the switching sites online and see whether they can get a better deal," he said.Pressed on whether the government could do more to tackle the underlying issues, Mr Cameron added: "What we can do, which is what we are doing, is to try to get new suppliers into the market."Energy Minister Ed Davey also described the latest price rise as "extremely disappointing news" for customers of British Gas. He questioned the claim that costs imposed by the government were increasing as much as bills and told the Commons that unhappy consumers should consider switching suppliers.However, industry analysts expect other suppliers to announce price rises in the coming weeks, which could affect consumers' switching decisions."The question now is whether it will be a trickle or a stampede. However, the fact is that households will be struggling to afford to keep warm this winter," said Tom Lyon, of price comparison website Uswitch.com.Personal finance commentator and campaigner Martin Lewis said it was important that, if consumers do decide to switch, they should focus on fixed rate tariffs.Because only two of the energy companies have currently put their prices up, those who switch now are likely to be hit with price rises if they switch to another variable rate tariff.He said people can "beat the price hikes" by going to fixed tariffs.Adam Scorer, of watchdog Consumer Futures, said: "We would urge anyone worried about their energy costs to shop around to try to find a better deal and ensure they are on the cheapest payment method, such as direct debit."There are also some discounted insulation and heating measures available and we would encourage people to take advantage of this to cut their bills."Mr Davey said that British Gas would need to justify its decision "openly and transparently".Many of British Gas's customers made their annoyance at the price rise known during a Twitter question and answer session with customer service Bert Pijls earlier this afternoon.</body>

      <description>Working parents in Britain no longer earn enough to "escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn warns in his first report.</description>

      <body>Working parents in Britain "simply do not earn enough to escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn has warned.Two-thirds of poor children are now from families where an adult works, his report found.Many low and middle-income children face being "worse off" than their parents because of falling earnings and rising prices, Mr Milburn added.Wealthier pensioners' benefits should be cut and minimum pay raised, he said.The former Labour health secretary suggested some benefits currently protected from cuts - such as free TV licences and winter fuel allowances for pensioners - could be means tested in order to share the burden of austerity more fairly.But a spokesman for David Cameron said: "The prime minister believes it is right to make commitments to pensioners in relationship to state provision."The government has pledged to safeguard such benefits until the next general election.In its first report, the government's Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission warned the target of ending child poverty by 2020 would "in all likelihood be missed by a considerable margin" - leaving as many as two million children in poverty.Poverty is defined as having a household income that is less than 60% of the national median income.The latest government figures on poverty, released in June, show the median UK household income for 2011/2012 was £427 a week - 60% of that figure was £256 a week.In that year, 17% of children, or 2.3 million, were classed as being in poverty while 15% of working-age adults, or 5.6 million, were in poverty.For pensioners, meanwhile, that figures was 16% - or 1.9 million.The report said Britain still had "high levels of child poverty and low levels of social mobility" with a rising number of children in "absolute poverty" coming from working families.Two thirds of children officially deemed as being poor now came from a family where at least one parent was working - and in three out of four of those cases, at least one of their parents was working full time, the report found.It also said the "twin problems of high youth unemployment and falling living standards" were storing up problems for the future.Among its key recommendations the report urged the government to:"Just as the UK government has focused on reducing the country's financial deficit it now needs to redouble its efforts to reduce our country's fairness deficit," the report said.Single mother Judith Healy, who works from home as a telemarketer, said that, while her wages had not gone up, her expenses had continued to increase.She said she was worried about paying energy bills this winter."We didn't ask to get in this situation, we are doing the best that we can in the circumstances that we have and that's really what it's about - it's survival now," she told BBC News.Mr Milburn told the BBC: "Today child poverty is a problem for working families rather than the workless or the work-shy."Around five million people in the country, mainly women, were earning less than the living wage, which is about £7.45 an hour outside of London, he said."These are the people frankly who do all the right things, they go out to work, they stand on their own two feet, they look after their families - they're the strivers not the shirkers - and yet they're all too often the forgotten people of Britain and I think they desperately need a new deal."Mr Milburn said that while ministers and employers could do more, it was unrealistic to expect the government to continue topping up low pay using working tax credits.He advocated a scheme for pairing bright children with the best teachers in an effort to raise attainment.Mr Milburn has previously said social mobility - the idea that individuals can better themselves in terms of educational opportunity, job prospects and salaries from one generation to the next - is "flat-lining".Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg welcomed the report, but warned that "punishing pensioners isn't going to help a single child achieve more in life".Enver Solomon, of the National Children's Bureau charity, said the report was "a wake-up call for all political parties by stating that our country is dramatically polarised between the haves and have- nots"."As the commission states, there is an urgent need to rebalance the distribution of resources so that the burden of austerity is more equally shared," he said.Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said the "powerful report" showed "ordinary families' living standards [were being] squeezed and social divisions [were] deepening as a result of this government's decisions to put a privileged few first".On Wednesday, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed the number of unemployed people in the UK fell by 18,000 to 2.49 million in the June-August period.</body>

      <body>Six British soldiers who died in an Afghan bomb blast claimed by the Taliban were "unlawfully killed on active service", a coroner has ruled.The six men were on patrol in a Warrior armoured vehicle when it was caught in an explosion on 6 March last year.Recording a narrative verdict, Oxfordshire coroner Darren Salter said there was "nothing their comrades could have done to rescue or save them".A series of improvements have been made to Warriors since the incident.Sgt Nigel Coupe, 33, of 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, was killed alongside Cpl Jake Hartley, 20, Pte Anthony Frampton, 20, Pte Christopher Kershaw, 19, Pte Daniel Wade, 20, and Pte Daniel Wilford, 21, all of 3rd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment.The attack, which was so powerful it turned their vehicle upside down and blew off its gun turret, was the biggest single loss of life in an enemy attack for UK Afghanistan forces since 2001.The inquest heard evidence from pathologists who said the men were likely to have been killed or rendered unconscious immediately by the blast.Mr Salter said: "This, of course, is a tragic loss of these six soldiers and these young lives."At least it is very clear from the evidence of the two pathologists and the evidence of those who witnessed the strike that they did not suffer."He said he was "not going to second-guess decisions of commanders in a courtroom today; that is not the purpose of an inquest"."These are experienced commanders who took decisions on the ground, balancing the risks and exercising judgements," he added.Oxford Coroner's Court heard on Thursday from Warrior expert Maj Douglas Nelson who said it had been "a very large device - and what I would say is, no vehicle that we had was designed to take that"."It was a large device - the effects were worse than what we anticipated," he added.He said that, while the Mastiff armoured vehicle was specifically designed with improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in mind, the Warrior was "infinitely more capable" of fighting at night, when the attack took place."Of any vehicle, I would travel in Warrior," he said."It's as good as we can make it."He said improvements made to the vehicles since the attack included thicker armour, better fire-fighting and detection systems and an improved fuel tank.</body>

      <body>A Muslim free school has been damned by Ofsted inspectors as "dysfunctional" and rated inadequate in every category - within a year of it opening.An inspection at Derby's Al-Madinah school was brought forward after fears were raised over teaching standards.The report says teachers there are inexperienced and have not been provided with proper training and that the school requires special measures.The school said it accepted the report and would use it to move forward.Reacting to the findings, David Cameron told BBC Radio Derby: "If they don't take immediate action to deal with these things then I think it is right it should close and I think it's absolutely right to intervene rapidly when these things aren't working properly."However, he added: "Let's not use this as a stick with which to beat the whole free school movement - there are now hundreds of schools which have set up as free schools, and on average they have more outstanding and good ratings than established schools."When it goes wrong - just as with a state school - you've got to get in there and sort it out, or close it down," he said.The Ofsted inspection had been due to take place by the end of the year but was prioritised following initial allegations that female teachers were obliged to wear hijabs and boys and girls were segregated.The school has since written to pupils and staff telling them there is no requirement to cover their hair.Education minister Lord Nash last week warned the school it faced closure unless discrimination against female staff and pupils stopped.A spokesperson said: "We were already investigating this school before allegations became public. We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection."We have received a response from the Al-Madinah Education Trust as well as a report on the school from Ofsted. Any decisions made will take into account all the available evidence."The Ofsted report found that pupils were given the same work "regardless of their different abilities" and the governing body was "ineffective".It said basic systems were not in place, describing the school as being "in chaos" and "dysfunctional".Boys and girls had different lunch sittings but the report said this was due to the small size of the canteen.Inspectors gave the school the lowest ranking - "inadequate" - in every area, prompting the chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw to call for it to be placed in special measures.This means Ofsted will carry out inspections at the school at short notice to monitor improvements. If poor performance continues the school could be closed.Dr Stuart Wilson, the acting head teacher, said there were "significant and serous problems" at the school and accepted some of the lessons were not meeting necessary standards."Are special measures a disaster for the school? Yes, they are," said Dr Wilson."It's not where we want the school to be at this time but we accept the report."In one mathematics lesson, described by Ofsted as "insufficiently challenging", pupils spent the majority of their time cutting out and pasting shapes.Dr Wilson said the school, which has 412 pupils aged between four and 16, had a lot of issues to deal with but he insisted it did have a future."Obviously the report doesn't make pleasant reading for anybody - we don't want to be in this position - we wish we weren't in this position - but what we need to do now is to accept the report in full and use it to move the school forward."Writing to the school's chair of governors on Thursday, Lord Nash said the Ofsted report was "further compelling evidence of the breaches of the funding agreement I have required you to address"."Contrary to your suggestion that I have acted prematurely, I am even more convinced of the need for very decisive and urgent action on the part of the trust to comply with all your obligations and remedy the serious failings at the school."Chris Williamson, MP for Derby North, said: "Frankly, the position of Al-Madinah school is now untenable and I would fully expect the school to close and for the children to be found alternative places in the council schools in the city."Speaking in Parliament earlier, shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said the Ofsted report was a "devastating blow to the education secretary's flagship policy".He said: "It reveals that pupils have been failed on every possible measure and parents will want to know why the education secretary has allowed this to happen."He described the government's free school programme as a "dangerous free-for-all"."David Cameron and Michael Gove can no longer ignore this issue - it is a crisis entirely of their own making," he said.But speaking at the weekend, Mr Hunt told BBC One's Andrew Marr programme that although Labour would not open new free schools "along the Michael Gove model", the bulk of existing free schools would be kept open as his party wanted to "keep the good free schools".Responding to Mr Hunt's more recent comments, the schools minister David Laws said that the government had taken "swift action" to deal with failings at the Al-Madinah free school told MPs that no school would be allowed to "languish in failure".He also accused Labour of "total and utter opportunism" using the report "to shift its position".</body>

      <body>A former BBC radio presenter described as a "dominant predator" has been found guilty of sexually abusing boys.Ex-BBC Radio Norfolk and Radio Clyde broadcaster Michael Souter, 60, was convicted of 19 sexual assaults on seven boys aged between 11 and 16.Souter was a Venture Scouts leader, a volunteer mentor to young people and was even allowed to adopt a child.Judge Mark Lucraft warned him he faced "a long period of imprisonment" when he is sentenced on 31 October.Souter, of Loddon, Norfolk, stared straight ahead without emotion as the judge spoke.The jury at Norwich Crown Court also found him guilty of seven counts of making and possessing indecent images of under-18s, after a six-week trial.The court heard Souter used his celebrity status to abuse his victims.He carried out the attacks between 1979 and 1999.The jury of nine men and three women took three hours to reach verdicts.Det Con Peter Sayer, who led the Norfolk Police investigation, said: "Souter used various opportunities to abuse children whilst being in a position of absolute trust."Chris McCann, head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) complex casework unit for the East of England, said: "Michael Souter presented himself to people as a local celebrity from radio and television, happy to be involved in charity events, the Scout movement and as a youth mentor for Norfolk social services."All this was a smokescreen to hide his true intention: to become close to young boys so he could sexually abuse them, confident that his celebrity status would mean they would not be believed."A BBC spokesperson said: "The crimes that Michael Souter has been found guilty of today are truly shocking and the BBC condemns them in the strongest possible terms."Michael Souter has not worked for the BBC since the early 1990s."</body>

      <body>A coroner has pleaded guilty to a £2m fraud that saw him steal some of the money from the estates of dead people.Gloucestershire coroner Alan Crickmore, 57, of East Approach Drive, Cheltenham pleaded guilty to 24 counts of fraud at Southwark Crown Court.Police said Crickmore had been stealing money while acting as probate and using the cash as his own "piggy bank".Crickmore was bailed and electronically tagged ahead of a sentencing hearing on 28 November.The guilty plea followed a police inquiry into alleged breaches of the solicitors' code of conduct and accounting rules.He was suspended from his post in December 2010 and has now resigned.Alan C Crickmore Solicitors, which had an office in Cheltenham, was closed down by the Solicitors Regulation Authority in December 2010.An authority spokesman said it was likely Crickmore would face a tribunal over his actions.He said a final decision would be made after Crickmore was sentenced.Det Ch Insp Dave Sellwood said Crickmore's plea came after being "faced with overwhelming evidence".The coroner stole some of the money after gaining power of attorney for elderly people who had "lost their mental capacity"."[Crickmore] stole what he wanted when he wanted," said Det Ch Insp Sellwood."He was propping up a lifestyle he couldn't afford - regular cruises, fine dining, various holidays, buying a house in the country."By many standards that would be considered to be living quite a high lifestyle and he could only fund that lifestyle by stealing from his clients."He was brought in to deal with probate and to wind up estates and, rather than give all of the monies to beneficiaries, he stole some of the monies from what would have been the beneficiaries."Councillor Will Windsor-Clive, from Gloucestershire County Council, said the case had been "really frustrating" while they waited for it to come to court."While we run the coroner's service in the county, we don't employ the coroner and only the Lord Chancellor can dismiss him. As a result we've had no power to take action."Mr Crickmore has offered his resignation and I hope we can now move forward."</body>

      <title>'Biggest shift' in abuse guidance</title>
      <description>New guidance on the prosecution of cases involving child sexual abuse, described as the biggest shift in attitude "for a generation", has been been published.</description>

      <body>Final guidance on the prosecution of cases involving child sexual abuse in England and Wales has been published.Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said it represented the biggest shift in attitude across the criminal justice system "for a generation".Under the guidelines, prosecutors are told to focus on the credibility of allegations, not on whether victims make good witnesses.All suspects will also be investigated to see if they possess indecent images.The guidelines cover how victims should be treated and how a case should be built and presented in court.The BBC's legal correspondent Clive Coleman said it was "something of a watershed moment".Victims have previously been disbelieved or discouraged, he said, but the new guidelines represented a move towards a "more sophisticated knowledge of psychology".A list of "myths and stereotypes" about behaviour previously thought to negatively impact the credibility of young victims has also been included, so the use of such preconceptions can be challenged in court by prosecutors.The list includes inconsistencies in what the victim remembers and whether they were drunk or wearing revealing clothes.A joint protocol for information sharing in child sexual abuse cases has also been published alongside the guidelines, in which police and prosecutors are expected to share information with social services, schools and family courts.The publishing of the final guidelines follows a three-month public consultation and takes immediate effect. The information for joint protocol will come into force in England and Wales on 1 January 2014.Changes were sought after there were complaints that too many cases had been dropped before trial because of fears that the allegations would not stand up to scrutiny.One of the most serious recent prosecutions of sex abuse and street grooming - in which 10 men were convicted - was initially shelved because of doubts over the credibility of the victims as witnesses.TV and radio presenter Jimmy Savile was not prosecuted when he was alive and, more recently, a row erupted after a prosecutor called a 13-year-old victim "predatory".Mr Starmer said: "For too long, child sexual abuse cases have been plagued by myths about how 'real' victims behave which simply do not withstand scrutiny."The days of the model victim are over. From now on these cases will be investigated and prosecuted differently, whatever the vulnerabilities of the victim."Mr Starmer said that because the guidelines were the result of discussions with judges, the police, experts, victims' representatives and the government, they would "stand the test of time".He said that because "possession of indecent images of children has been found to be a common feature" of child sexual abuse cases the police would now investigate it in every case of child sexual abuse.The guidelines will also highlight a number of ways victims of abuse can be manipulated and blackmailed to keep quiet, which include threats to publish indecent images or implicating victims in other offences.They also seek to raise awareness of how victims in some ethnic communities are controlled by offenders who might use notions of "honour" or "shame" to deter them.Shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry said it was not clear how much of the guidance would actually get used in practice."These proposals are a welcome effort to correct the over-cautious stance the CPS took in the Jimmy Savile and street-grooming cases," she said."However, the guidance contains a lot more 'shoulds' than 'musts' which makes it far from certain how much of this will actually get implemented."The NSPCC's Alan Wardle said the changes "will start to make a positive difference for child sex abuse prosecutions which in the past have been dogged by difficulties".The Deputy Children's Commissioner for England, Sue Berelowitz, said the CPS had "worked hard to improve the experiences of child witnesses and increase the likelihood of securing convictions by ensuring that judges and juries better understand the psychological and emotional impact on victims of their appalling experiences".The Chief Executive of the Survivors Trust, Fay Maxted, welcomed the new approach. She told BBC Radio 5 Live: "It is at least now saying that we need to stop focusing on questioning whether the victim is telling the truth and actually look at what they're saying has happened and investigate that."</body>

      <body>Thousands of schools are closed across much of England as teachers strike over pay, pensions and jobs.Teachers in London, Cumbria, the South East, North East and South West have been taking part with nearly 3,500 schools shut or partially closed.The action is part of a continuing campaign of regional strikes involving members of the NUT and NASUWT unions.Prime Minister David Cameron said the strike was "inconvenient for parents" and "not good for pupils' education".NUT general secretary Christine Blower, said the union regretted the disruption caused to pupils and parents but teachers felt they had "no other choice".Major rallies have been taking place in Bristol, Durham and London, with smaller events in other areas, including Brighton, Carlisle and Plymouth.Teachers are objecting to proposals by Education Secretary Michael Gove to bring in performance-related pay, increase their workloads and make changes to their pensions.Twenty out of 33 London boroughs have provided information to BBC London 94.9 about the number of schools affected so far.Of those, about 445 schools are completely closed and 450 partially closed.And in Tyne and Wear, at least 471 schools have been affected by the industrial action.Head teacher Roberta Kirby, from Fernhurst Junior School, in Portsmouth, said the government had "declared war" on teachers.More than 200 schools in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight are affected by the action.She said: "If we cannot offer good wages and a pension that staff pay into that reflects the work they do, then we are not going to be able to attract the best graduates."Responding to the impact of the strike, some parents said they had found it difficult to find alternative childcare.The BBC's Sarah Ransome said: "People in Plymouth have been telling me that finding alternative childcare because of the strike has been 'quite a headache'."A similar walkout by teachers took place in the east of England, the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber region on 1 October.Ms Blower said: "Mr Gove has done nothing to address the crisis of low morale in the teaching profession which threatens the continued provision of high quality education."Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said the "overwhelming majority of teachers" were on strike.She said: "Teachers are committed and dedicated public service workers. They do not take strike action lightly."No teacher has any wish to inconvenience parents or disrupt pupils' education, but this action is not the failure or due to the unreasonableness, of teachers."Plans for a national one-day walkout before Christmas have also been announced by the two unions.Speaking to BBC Sussex, Mr Cameron said responsibility for the strike "lies with the teaching unions"."I think it is very disappointing they have decided to go on strike," he said."And when we look at the things they are striking over, pensions and pay, they are things that have been decided independently by well-led reviews."I was at my children's school today in London. One class was not there but the rest of the school was operating."So, every praise to those teachers who have gone ahead and kept our schools open for our kids."A spokeswoman for the Department for Education (DfE) said 27% of the schools in the affected regions were closed, however, there was no figure available for how many were partially closed.She said: "The NUT and NASUWT have tried to create as much disruption for pupils and parents today as possible."In spite of this, thanks to many hardworking teachers and heads, only around a quarter of schools in the targeted regions were closed today."</body>

      <title>Osborne agrees to China nuclear deal</title>
      <description>The Chancellor, George Osborne, announces that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.</description>

      <body>The Chancellor, George Osborne, has announced that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.The announcement also said that Chinese firms might eventually be allowed to take majority stakes in British nuclear plants.Mr Osborne made the announcement on the last day of a trade visit to China.The first China deal could be as early as next week, with the go ahead for a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site.Also on Thursday, a report commissioned for the prime minister warned of a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years.The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits".Supply is expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15.Most existing coal-fired plants are expected to be closed in 2015 to meet European Union pollution directives, while many gas-fired power plants are not being used at the moment because gas is so expensive.These would take time and money to bring back on stream.The Hinkley C project, in Somerset, will be the first new nuclear power station since 1995.Hinkley C's construction will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EDF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs.EDF has been negotiating with three Chinese nuclear giants on the Hinkley C project - CGN, CNNC and SNPTC - all of which have been seen by the chancellor this week.Our business editor, Robert Peston, says he has been told that one or two of these will end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C.A DECC spokesperson said talks about a contract were underway: "Negotiations remain ongoing between the government and EDF on the potential terms of an investment contract for Hinkley Point C. No agreement has as yet been reached."A contract will only be offered if it is value for money, fair and affordable, in line with government policy on no public subsidy for new nuclear and consistent with state-aid rules."Mr Osborne made the announcement while on a visit to a nuclear plant in southern China on Thursday which is itself a collaboration between EDF and the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG).He said: "Today is another demonstration of the next big step in the relationship between Britain and China, the world's oldest civil nuclear power and the world's fastest growing civil nuclear power."The memorandum of understanding also includes roles for British companies in China's nuclear programme.China has 17 nuclear reactors in operation, which provide about 1% of its electricity production capacity.In the future, Chinese firms might be allowed more than just minority stakes in UK plants. The government said that "over time, stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes".At the weekend, the Energy Minister, Ed Davey, said he believed that a "massive" wave of investment from China, Japan and Korea would secure UK's power supply into the future.Securing future energy supplies is a major challenge.A portion of energy bills is being diverted to alternative energy investment in wind farms and solar energy.But these, renewable, energy sources cannot provide enough power for the country's energy needs.The industry regulator, Ofgem, has also warned of the "unprecedented challenge" to secure power supplies.It said spare electricity power production capacity could fall to 2% by 2015, increasing the risk of blackouts.</body>

      <body>A police officer who shot dead a man eight years ago has been refused permission to appeal against an inquiry which found there was "no lawful justification" for his actions.The officer, known as E7, killed Azelle Rodney in Edgware in 2005 after the car he was in was stopped by armed police.E7 said he opened fire because he believed Mr Rodney had picked up a gun.But the inquiry ruled E7 "could not rationally have believed" Mr Rodney was holding a sub-machine gun.E7 was seeking a declaration that the inquiry's conclusions relating to his use of force were "irrational", or an order quashing parts of the report which found his use of force was unjustified.In refusing the judicial review, Mr Justice Wyn Williams said he had "no doubt" there was "ample evidence to justify the finding" the officer did not have an honest belief that Mr Rodney had picked up the gun.The inquiry considered issues including what information the police had, how reliable it was, whether their approach minimised the risk to life and if stopping the car was done with only necessary force.Sir Christopher Holland, who carried out the independent investigation, said in his conclusions: "There was no lawful justification for shooting Azelle Rodney so as to kill him."E7's accounts of what he saw are not to be accepted."Prior to firing he did not believe that the man who turned out to be Azelle Rodney had picked up a gun and was about to use it."Further, on the basis of what he was able to see, he could not rationally have believed that."E7 told the inquiry he saw Mr Rodney start moving around, reaching down and then coming back up with his shoulders hunched.Mr Rodney was then shot six times, once each in the arm and back, and four times in the head.</body>

      <title>Prince Charles in pensions warning</title>
      <description>The Prince of Wales tells the pensions industry to use a longer-term investing approach or risk a 'miserable future' for the next generation.</description>

      <body>The Prince of Wales has told the pensions industry to use a longer-term investing approach or risk a "miserable future" for the next generation.He warned a National Association of Pension Funds' (NAPF) conference that the current focus on short term investing was "unfit for purpose".Prince Charles said the pensions industry was vital for the economy "now and in the future".The NAPF said it was "pleased" he was "shining a light on these issues."Prince Charles cited "mounting evidence" from Harvard and London Business Schools showing that businesses willing to improve their approach to environmental and social challenges were more likely to deliver long-term returns.The prince said investors had a "duty" to manage risks from rising populations, climate change and "unprecedented levels" of financial indebtedness, he said.He added: "I can only urge you to deploy your considerable human ingenuity to make that innovative and imaginative leap that the world so badly needs.""Otherwise your grandchildren and mine, for that matter will be consigned to an exceptionally miserable future."NAPF chief executive Joanne Segars said sustainability and environmental issues were important to long-term pension fund investors, and were the basis for providing good pensions for people in future.Former pensions adviser to the government Ros Altmann agreed with the prince's comments.She said: "Pensions are meant to deliver long-term value. What we don't want is to get hijacked by the short-term and sell our children's future away."Ms Altmann said it was "clear" that changes needed to be made."We are living for today in a dangerous way," she said.She said she understood why the short-term focus existed for political reasons, but that pension funds should not be operating on the same timetable.The government will enrol up to nine million more people in pensions during the next five years as fears grow that people are living for longer but not saving for their old age.A spokesperson for Saga, a company that focuses on the over 50s, said Prince Charles was "absolutely right" to speak out.He added: "Whilst the heir to the throne may have a secure future, many of his potential subjects have something altogether less savoury in store for their retirement."</body>

      <title>Crime falls 7% to record low - ONS</title>
      <description>Crime in England and Wales fell 7% in the year to June - a record low - official figures show.</description>

      <body>Crime has fallen 7% to a record low in the last year, the Crime Survey for England and Wales has shown.There were 8.5m incidents in the year to the end of June, compared with 9.1m the previous year.The drop comes despite a 9% rise in sexual offences, which was partly driven by the Jimmy Savile revelations of abuse.Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said England and Wales are safer than they have been "for decades".The headline crime figure is the lowest since the survey began in 1981, and has now fallen to half its peak level, recorded in 1995.However, the Office for National Statistics, which collates the survey, said the number of historical sexual offences - those which took place more than 20 years ago - recorded by the police has doubled.The Savile inquiry has encouraged greater numbers of people to report historical sexual offence to the police.The ONS said that in the last five years there has been a 35% rise in the number of rape offences recorded by the police - partly due to new guidance on the way in which such crimes are recorded.An increase in theft was also recorded by the Crime Survey, with offences up by 8% in the last year.Evidence suggests the rise was driven by the theft of smart phones, and involve pick-pocketing rather than violence or threats.The majority are counted as stealth thefts - where the victim is unaware items are being stolen.Meanwhile, though credit card fraud levels remained flat, overall fraud offences have jumped by 21% in the last year.The ONS said the cause of this rise would become clearer in the next one or two years, but it could be down to a new centralised method of recording fraud.Max Chambers, head of crime and justice at the think-tank Policy Exchange, said: "Whether you believe it's as the result of an ageing population, better policing and prevention, or the impact of the internet, there is little doubt that Britain is becoming a safer place to live, do business and raise a family."But crime is still too high and there are pockets of the country which remain blighted by anti-social behaviour and gang activity."While the latest figures show that the police have been able to cut crime substantially even with fewer resources, they must now redouble their efforts to tackle the hardcore of prolific offenders who commit offences that can often disproportionately hit the poor and the vulnerable."While welcoming falling crime rates, Jon Collins, deputy director of the Police Foundation - an independent policing think-tank - said it was important not to be "blind to new and emerging challenges".He said: "The police and the government should be wary of resting on their laurels."While crimes such as burglary and car crime are clearly not the problem that they once were, it's possible that the official crime figures are just not picking up the extent to which new opportunities for crimes like fraud and counterfeiting have emerged, particularly online."Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said: "Police reform is working and crime is falling."This is really positive news. Forces are rising to the challenge of making savings whilst cutting crime and delivering a better service to the public."England and Wales are safer than they have been for decades but we will continue to deliver measures which keep pace with the changing nature of crime and improve our ability to combat emerging issues."The Crime Survey for England and Wales asks people aged 16 and over living in households in England and Wales about their experiences of crime in the last 12 months. These experiences are used to estimate levels of crime in England and Wales.</body>

      <body>Gloria de Piero, the shadow minister for women and equalities, has accused a news agency of trying to obtain topless pictures of her taken when she was 15.In a blog post, the Labour MP said the agency claimed to be acting on behalf of a national newspaper and was offering thousands of pounds to people who might have copies of the pictures.She would find it "humiliating" if they were published, she told the BBC.She had grown up in poverty and had posed topless for the money, she added."It's part of me, it's part of my life, it's part of my story," she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour."I've got an amazing mum and dad, but after the age of about 10, no-one worked in my household due to my father's ill health."My parents had jobs, they never had careers, and they were very, very ambitious for their daughter to have a better life than them."The Ashfield MP said she had played truant on days when pupils were able to wear their own clothes, because she was ashamed of her wardrobe."I wanted some money, like my friends," she said of her decision to pose topless."There are reasons why I thought that they might be a way out for me, but I would respectfully say that I hope they are not published."I would find it embarrassing, humiliating."The existence of the pictures "says something about poverty, growing up in poverty", she added."I'm not going to be a victim here," she said, adding that she did not want to see politics full of people "who, at 15, are thinking 'Ooh, I might be a politician one day'"."Goodness, if someone had suggested that to me, at 15, I'd have thought they were absolutely barking."In her blog, she elaborated: "I don't think anyone wants politics to be open only to those people who were planning their political careers in their teens. I would like to see a politics that represents our country, including many more women from all walks of life, and that is something I am passionately committed to help bring about."No one should have to worry that something they did when they were young might prevent them from serving their community or getting involved in politics at a local or national level."Ms de Piero concluded: "It is now time to call off the hunt for these pictures and let me get on with the job I was elected to do, representing the people of Ashfield and serving in the shadow cabinet."</body>

      <description>Child protection agencies warn social workers to watch out for couples returning from Africa with "miracle babies" as they could be trafficked.</description>

      <body>Social services have been warned to watch out for couples returning from Africa with "miracle babies" as they could be a cover for trafficking.Child protection organisations Cafcass, ADCS and Children and Families Across Borders (CFAB) have issued guidance to all social workers in the UK.They want to help them recognise signs of staged fake births.The Family Court has seen five cases of couples attempting to bring babies into the UK whom they are not related to.One couple claimed fertility treatment combined with their strong Christian faith had resulted in them conceiving in Nigeria - but tests showed the child, who was later taken into care, was not theirs.A dozen more cases were detected by the British consulate in Lagos - though officials say that the real numbers could be much higher.Charities voice 'miracle baby' fearsAndy Elvin, chief executive of CFAB, described the cases as "disturbing" and urged social workers to involve the police, who can investigate whether couples have been involved in criminal activity or are the victims of a "cruel deception"."The most disturbing element is that babies are for sale," he said."In the 21st century, humans are being bought and sold for somewhere in the region of £12,000. It's something we thought went out with slavery."It's shocking that people are willing to sell babies, but it's just as shocking that people will buy them."Mr Elvin said that many of the birth mothers will have been coerced, and may even have been sold into prostitution."There are many victims, but the real victims are of course the children," he said."They won't know anything about their origins. It's like the dark days of adoption when people thought it best not to tell the child anything."The effect on a child who discovers their life to be a lie can be profound - and can lead to mental health problems later on."CFAB worked with Cafcass - the Children and Family Court Advisory Service - and ADCS (Association of Directors of Children's Services) to produce a multi-agency information leaflet to assist social workers to recognise and understand the signs of faked birth - such as a lack of antenatal appointments - and to encourage referrals to the relevant authorities.Mr Elvin said that the aim was to "suspend disbelief" of such practices occurring and to work to prevent what he described as a "100% increase" in cases since 2005.In October last year, the High Court ruled that a couple could keep a baby they brought back from Nigeria - even though tests showed they were not the biological parents.The woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, said she'd gone to the country for fertility treatment and was tricked into believing she had given birth.The presiding judge Mr Justice Coleridge said the pair - who he described as "people of the highest calibre and integrity" - were victims of the "most appalling scam".</body>

      <body>SNP leader Alex Salmond opened his party's conference by saying he believed people would choose the "hope of yes" rather than the "fears of no".The first minister's speech comes with the Scottish independence referendum 11 months away.He told delegates in Perth that Thursday 18 September 2014 was Scotland's "date with destiny".On that day, voters will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country".Mr Salmond said that the people of Scotland had their biggest opportunity to choose a better future.He told delegates on the first day of the four-day conference: "I believe that people will choose the hope of a yes vote, rather than the fear offered by no."And no-one now denies the reality that Scotland has got what it takes to be a successful, independent country."We know that 'project fear' - as people in the no campaign christened it - will say anything to talk down Scotland's abilities."They peddle nonsense such as mobile phone roaming charges after independence, the threat to annex Faslane, no whisky in embassies - nonsense which even they are forced to retract."The party leader went on to say that people in the no camp could not deny the economic viability and potential of "people-talented, resource-rich Scotland".He added that per head of population, Scotland had more top universities than any other country; was the EU's largest oil producer and had a thriving creative industries sector.Mr Salmond said: "When even the most bitter opponents of Scottish independence agree that Scotland has got what it takes, then it's clear that the only thing people have to fear is 'project fear' itself."At the start of his conference speech, Mr Salmond addressed the on-going dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant.He confirmed that he would be holding further talks with both the facility's operator Ineos and the Unite union.The facility remains shut down despite Unite calling off a planned strike.</body>

      <title>FA supports Hodgson over 'joke'</title>
      <description>The Football Association says England boss Roy Hodgson has its full support after claims he made an offensive joke.</description>

      <body>The Football Association has given its "full support" to Roy Hodgson after claims a comment made in a team-talk by the England manager caused offence.Hodgson was criticised for referring to a joke about a monkey and an astronaut at half-time in Tuesday's World Cup qualifier against Poland."He has and deserves the full support of the Football Association," FA chairman Greg Dyke said.Anti-racism campaigners Kick It Out praised the FA's "swift" response.It had called for an investigation into Hodgson's comments but, after the FA confirmed it had not received any complaints from the England players, it now considered the matter closed.A Kick It Out statement read: "We are pleased that the Football Association has investigated this matter swiftly and issued its findings immediately."If there has been no complaint on the back of the investigation then the matter can only be deemed as concluded."Kick It Out acts on behalf of the football community at large and when an allegation of a racist or discriminatory nature is made, it's the organisation's role to follow this up."Hodgson was reported  to have made the comments when trying to explain to right-back Chris Smalling that he needed to pass the ball to winger Andros Townsend more.The England manager later apologised and Townsend, 22, tweeted:  "I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken!"Dyke added: "Roy Hodgson is a man of the highest integrity, an honourable man who is doing a great job with the England team."He has fully explained to us what he said and the point he was making to the players in the dressing room at half-time on Tuesday night. He has also explained the context in which he made his remarks."He has made clear there was no intent to say anything inappropriate, and he was certainly not making any comments with any racist connotation. Importantly, he has apologised for any unintended offence that may have been taken."We will be making no further comment on this story and will now be giving Roy and the team our full support as we prepare for the World Cup in Brazil."England striker Wayne Rooney also showed his support for 66-year-old Hodgson on Twitter,  and via his personal website:  "To be honest it's really annoying that something such as this should see the light of day."All the lads know what type of guy Roy is, and to try and pin some form of label on him is absolutely ridiculous. Roy spoke to Andros straight away, and he took no offence whatsoever. Hopefully that's now the end of the matter."Former England striker Stan Collymore, 42, also defended the former Fulham and West Brom boss on Twitter,  suggesting the row undermines moves to eradicate racism from the sport."Demeans every anti-racism campaigner by having cheap pop at RH [Roy Hodgson] who said nothing wrong. Makes campaigners seem over-PC and petty. They're not," he said.However, Piara Powar, executive director of Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare), told the BBC that Hodgson had got it wrong."This was a silly phrase to use in a diverse workforce," said Powar."I think some players will see it as a reflection of the type of language still used by some coaches and some attitudes that still prevail."Here is the basis of the joke which Roy Hodgson is reported to have told his players. However, it is unclear if this is the exact transcript."Nasa decided they'd finally send a man up in a capsule after sending only monkeys in the earlier missions."They fire the man and the monkey into space."The intercom crackles, 'Monkey, fire the retros.'"A little later, 'Monkey, check the solid fuel supply.'"Later still, "Monkey, check the life support systems for the man.'"The astronaut takes umbrage and radioes Nasa, 'When do I get to do something?'"Nasa replies, 'In 15 minutes - feed the monkey.'"</body>

      <body>Prince William has hosted his first investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace.Among those honoured were Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, who was presented with an OBE.It represented an extension of the Duke of Cambridge's public duties after he left the Royal Air Force last month.Standing in for the Queen, William presented awards recognising achievements in a wide range of fields to recipients from across the UK.Andy Murray was on time for the ceremony despite tweeting that he had been held up by a random drugs test."In the middle of a drug test hahaha I'm goin to be late!!!" he wrote.Vicar Of Dibley producer Jon Plowman was also made an OBE by the prince, while broadcaster Aled Jones became an MBE for services to music, broadcasting and charity. Conservationist Helen Butler received an MBE.Around 25 such ceremonies are held every year, either in the ballroom at Buckingham Palace, the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh or at Windsor Castle.The majority are hosted by the Queen but some investitures are carried out by the Prince of Wales or Princess Royal.Prince William already carries out engagements connected to his charitable interests and those of the Royal Foundation he is joint patron of with the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.Following the end of a military career that has occupied the prince since January 2006, the full shape of his public duties has yet to be decided.The next year has been described as "transitional" by palace officials as the duke prepares to become a full-time royal.He plans to expand his conservation work, particularly on the protection of endangered species, through his Royal Foundation.</body>

      <title>Bee-friendly plants put to the test</title>
      <description>An experimental garden has revealed that the right plants can attract up to 100 times more pollinators, say scientists.</description>

      <body>Researchers have used an experimental garden to put pollinator-friendly plants to the test.The University of Sussex scientists counted the number of insects visiting the plants in their garden.They say their findings show that insect-friendly plants are just as pretty, cheap and easy to grow as less pollinator-friendly varieties.Their results are published in the Journal of Functional Ecology.PhD student Mihail Garbuzov used 32 different varieties of popular garden plants. These included some nectar-rich and highly scented plants he thought would be attractive to insects and some that seemed to be less attractive.While the small-scale study did not produce an exhaustive list of the best plants for pollinating insects, the team says the data has put a number on just how many more pollinators the right plants can attract.Mr Garbuzov told the BBC: "Some of the best plants attracted approximately 100 times as many insects as the worst."And the plants that are attractive to insects are not more expensive, and they're just as pretty."The researchers wrote in their paper that there was "great scope for making gardens and parks more insect friendly" by selecting the right plants.Tips for insect-friendly gardening are already available from a variety of sources, but the researchers say they are largely based on "opinion and general experience".The aim of this study, said Prof Francis Ratnieks, from the University of Sussex, was to "put that advice on a firmer scientific footing, by gathering information about the actual number of insects visiting the flowers to collect nectar or pollen".The researchers gathered their data simply by visiting each of the patches of flowers every day over two summers and counting the number of insects on the flowers.Their results did lead them to make some horticultural recommendations - they found that borage, lavender, marjoram and open-flower dahlias varieties were very good for insects.The colourfully named bowles mauve everlasting wallflower was also very attractive to pollinators, while the least attractive flowering plant for insects was the very popular geranium.Marjoram, the researchers say, was probably the best "all-rounder", attracting honey bees, bumble bees, other bees, hover flies, and butterflies.Borage was the best for honey bees and lavender and open-flowered dahlias were most attractive to bumblebees.The team put a number of varieties of lavender to the test and found that highly bred hybrids, including some with novel colours - such as white or pink - that have been carefully bred into the plants proved the most attractive to insects.Dr Nigel Raine, from Royal Holloway University of London, commented that with bee populations declining across the world, "we can all give bees a helping hand by planting the right flowers to give them the nectar and pollen they need"."This study highlights that it's important for bee-friendly gardeners to choose what you plant with care," he added."Gardeners and town planners should think carefully about the mixture of flowers they plant to ensure food is available for a wide range of bees and other important insect pollinators."It's also important to cater for the needs of the rarer species and provide food at times when there might be fewer wild flowers in bloom."</body>

      <title>Trust admits child deaths liability</title>
      <description>Belfast Health Trust accepts liability for the deaths of two children in its care during a public inquiry into hospital deaths in Northern Ireland.</description>

      <body>A health trust has admitted liability for the deaths of two children in its care during a public inquiry into hospital deaths in Northern Ireland.Claire Roberts and Adam Strain died months apart while they were being treated at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children in 1995 and 1996.Their deaths are being investigated by the inquiry into hyponatraemia-related deaths in Banbridge, County Down.The issue of hospital fluids management is central to the public inquiry.Hyponatraemia is the term for a low level of sodium in the bloodstream, which causes the brain cells to swell with too much water.Four-year-old Adam Strain died shortly after undergoing a kidney transplant at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children in 1995.Claire Roberts was nine when she died at the same hospital the following year.She had been admitted following vomiting and drowsiness and doctors prescribed intravenous fluids.However, Claire was given a fatal overdose of fluids and drugs.In the 17 years since her death, Belfast Health Trust had denied that fluid management played any role and wrongly attributed Claire's death to a brain virus.The trust maintained its stance during the child's inquest in 2006.However, at the public inquiry on Thursday, the trust's lawyer said his client now accepted it was liable for Claire Roberts' death and made "a full and frank admission of liability on behalf of the Belfast Trust".He said it also wanted to offer "a sincere apology for the shortcomings in the management of Claire's treatment" and acknowledged that it had failed to treat the child to an appropriate standard.During the hearing, the Belfast Health Trust also admitted publicly for the first time liability in the earlier case of Adam Strain.It had previously settled this case with Adam's family but a confidentiality clause prevented any detail of that settlement from emerging.The trust further acknowledged that guidelines had not been followed in the case of a third child, Connor Mitchell.The inquiry chairman, Justice John O'Hara QC, welcomed the admissions and acknowledged that it was "never easy to admit when mistakes had been made".Mr O'Hara said the families had made it clear that their pursuit of the truth was "in memory of their children" and that he hoped that today "they feel there is some added justification for what they have done".Speaking to BBC Northern Ireland after the hearing, Claire Roberts' parents welcomed the trust's apology and admission of liability as a small step forward but said there were still many questions over their child's death that had not been answered.The inquiry into hyponatraemia-related deaths is investigating fluid management issues after the deaths of five children in Northern Ireland hospitals.It is looking into the deaths of three of the children, the events following the death of another and a number of issues arising from the death of a fifth.The deaths all took place between 1995 and 2003, and in each case, the way in which fluids were given to the children following surgery is implicated in their deaths.Belfast Trust is the second Northern Ireland health trust to accept liability during the public inquiry.On August 30, the Western Health and Social Care Trust admitted liability over the death of nine-year-old Raychel Ferguson.Raychel died in June 2001, a day after an appendix operation at Altnagelvin Hospital, Londonderry.She was administered a lethal dose of intravenous fluid after her appendix was removed.</body>

      <body>There is no criminal offence if someone assists a woman in going to England for a lawful abortion, the Director of Public Prosecutions in NI has said.Barra McGrory made the comments after the BBC was told draft abortion guidelines had caused a "mood of fear" among medical staff.There have been calls for clarity after women carrying babies with fatal foetal abnormalities told their stories.Foetal abnormality is not a reason for abortion under Northern Ireland law.Draft guidelines were published in March, but following a consultation process, revised guidelines are being brought before the Stormont Executive within weeks.Health Minister Edwin Poots has said he would meet the Public Prosecution Service about the potential prosecution of staff involved in an abortion in certain circumstances.He said he was also taking legal advice from other sources. Mr Poots said he had work to do that needed to be handled sensitively and he would not be deflected from it.Mr McGrory told the BBC's Nolan Show said: "There is no criminal offence of aiding and abetting, counselling or procuring someone to have what is a lawful abortion in England," he said."We can see no circumstances in which anyone would fall foul of the criminal law in that regard."Mr McGrory added: "The circumstances in which you are talking, of these tragic cases of foetal abnormality, where individuals have felt it necessary to travel to England to have an abortion because of serious foetal abnormality, in those circumstances, I can envisage no situation where anyone giving advice and assistance in that regard would fall foul of the law."You cannot aid or abet or procure something which is not a crime in our law."Last week, the BBC's Nolan Show highlighted the cases of two women, whose babies had fatal foetal abnormality, who were refused terminations in Northern Ireland,Sarah Ewart travelled to England for an abortion because her baby was diagnosed with anencephaly, a severe brain abnormality.She said the baby's skull was not formed and it was brain dead.Another woman, Laura, who is 22 weeks pregnant with twins who are suffering from the same condition, appealed to Mr Poots to allow her to have an abortion in Northern Ireland.</body>

      <title>Ex-mayor denies ball-bearing blast</title>
      <description>A former mayor tells a trial that he was not responsible for a series of blasts in his home town earlier this year which included a home-made ball-bearing bomb.</description>

      <body>A former Denbigh mayor has told a trial that he was not responsible for a series of blasts in the town.It culminated in a home-made bomb being detonated under a car - scattering ball-bearings over a wide area.John Larsen told Caernarfon Crown Court that he had played no part in the explosions in the Lenten Pool area between January and April.The 46 year old denies causing an explosion, possessing explosives and three arson attacks on cars.During his trial, the prosecution has claimed that there was "a strong compelling case" that Mr Larsen was the man behind the booms and blasts heard and seen in the area.One witness described how she had seen the town councillor near cars just before an explosion detonated under a Land Rover car.The blast showered ball-bearings and shrapnel over a large area, smashing windows.One resident even found that one of the ball-bearings had hit a headboard on their bed.An explosives expert told the court earlier that the ball-bearings had either been packed or strapped on to the device and would have been ejected from the bomb at "several hundred metres per second" with the potential to cause serious injury of even death to any passersby.But addressing Mr Larsen, his defence barrister, Gordon Hennell asked him: "Did you ever use any ball-bearings as shrapnel in a device?""No, never," replied Mr Larsen, who had been the mayor of Denbigh in 1999.Mr Larsen told the jury that he had an interest in fireworks as one of his hobbies, alongside magic tricks.He also accepted that he had experimented with fuels for rockets.But Mr Hennell said the allegations against the defendant went further than experimentation."The suggestion is that on March 24 you have not simply experimented, but set off an explosive device which has got ball-bearings added," he said.Larsen maintained: "No, that's incorrect. I didn't do that."Asked bluntly whether he had played any part in the night-time explosions in the Lenten Pool area, the defendant replied: "No, not at all."He told the jury that he had been at home in bed when the blasts occurred except for "a few occasions", and that he only went out late at night to check his wife's car."It gets very rowdy at night," he added.Mr Larsen was arrested on 19 April 2013, and police found a mix of chemicals, modified fireworks, rockets, flares and a book on pyrotechnics at his home.He denies causing an explosion likely to endanger life or cause serious injury to property on March 24. He also denies three charges of arson in which cars were damaged, and possessing an explosive substance.The trial continues.</body>

      <title>School pupils offered TB screening</title>
      <description>Screening for tuberculosis (TB) will be offered to 124 pupils at a comprehensive school in Carmarthenshire after a staff member was diagnosed with the infection.</description>

      <body>Screening for tuberculosis (TB) will be offered to 124 pupils at a comprehensive school in Carmarthenshire after a staff member was diagnosed with the infection.Letters have been sent to parents at Ysgol y Strade, Llanelli, saying their children will be offered a blood test next Thursday.Health officials say the risk that the infection has spread to pupils is low.Precautionary screening is also being offered to 21 members of staff.They are those identified as being close contacts of the patient.Sion Lingard, acting consultant in health protection for Public Health Wales (PHW), said TB is difficult to catch and is treatable with antibiotics."We are emphasising to pupils, parents and staff that it is very rare for TB to be transmitted within a school environment and so we are offering screening as a precaution," he said."Close contact with an infectious individual over a long time period, such as living in the same household, is usually required for a person to become infected with TB."Another four cases of TB had been identified in the Llanelli area over the last year, he said, but none of these have links to the school."Investigations into these cases are continuing with the involvement of Hywel Dda Health Board with treatment, advice and screening offered where appropriate," Mr Lingard added.TB is an infection usually found in the lungs, but any part of the body can be affected.People can catch TB by breathing in the bacteria in tiny droplets sneezed or coughed out by someone who has the infection in their lungs.The most common symptom of TB is a persistent cough for more than three weeks, with spit which can sometimes be blood-stained.Other symptoms can include weight loss, a high temperature, and sweating, particularly at night.Public Health Wales said anyone who is concerned about their health should speak to their GP or contact NHS Direct Wales on 0845 46 47.</body>

      <title>Scottish Gas rise hits north hardest</title>

      <body>Scottish Gas customers in the north of Scotland are facing higher bills than the rest of the UK, after a decision by owners Centrica to increase prices.The price rise will see an average UK dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2% from 23 November.But regional differences mean domestic customers living north of Perth will see an average rise of 11.2% - the biggest in the UK.Customers in the south of Scotland will see an average increase of 9.5%.The smallest rise is a 6.8% increase in the south west of England.Scotland's electricity transmission network is split between Scottish Hydro in the north and Scottish Power which holds the licence for central and southern Scotland.Centrica, which owns the British Gas and Scottish Gas brands, said its regional price differences reflected variations in the network costs it was obliged to pay to the transmission companies around the country.Rival SSE has already announced an 8.2% increase in bills from 15 November.The Centrica move, which will affect nearly eight million people in the UK, includes an average 8.4% rise in gas prices and a 10.4% increase in electricity prices.The company said it "understands the frustration" of prices rising faster than incomes. The average annual household bill will go up by £123.On average, UK customers will see a dual-fuel bill increase to £1,444 a year.Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%.Energy regulator Ofgem said prices were determined by suppliers competing in the British energy market and it was up to them to justify their prices and profits to consumers.An Ofgem spokeswoman said: "Any price rise will not be welcomed by customers which is why it is important that Scottish Gas fully explain the reasons for the increase."Energy suppliers should be doing all they can to minimise the impact of these rising costs on energy bills by ensuring they are managing their costs as efficiently as possible."Suppliers must also ensure they are giving customers all the advice and help they need to save money on their energy bills, for example through energy efficiency."</body>

      <title>Salmond to hold Grangemouth talks</title>

      <body>Scotland's first minister is to hold talks with both sides involved in the dispute at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant.It is understood Alex Salmond earlier spoke to officials from the plant's operators Ineos.Mr Salmond confirmed in his opening address at the SNP conference in Perth he will hold further talks with both Ineos and the Unite union.The facility remains shut down despite Unite calling off a planned strike.The first minister told delegates at the SNP conference that officials from both Ineos and Unite had been quoted in the media as saying they believed Grangemouth had a "great future".He added: "What I will attempt to do is to take and build on that belief, and say to both Unite and Ineos that only by negotiation, cooperation and agreement can we get an effective resolution."We believe, and Scotland believes and expects, that Grangemouth as an industrial facility has a great future."Mr Salmond left the first day of the conference in Perth for the discussions in Edinburgh."Governments can't make agreements" in such disputes but can "encourage the circumstances in which agreements can be found", he told party delegates.Ineos said shutting down the Grangemouth complex had cost the company £20m so far.It has put proposals over pay and pensions to workers at the site, which has 1,400 employees and many more contractors.A letter outlining the proposed changes was being couriered to employees on Friday.BBC Scotland has been given details of the offer, which includes freezing the basic salary and offering no bonuses until at least the end of 2016.The shift allowance would also be reduced from £10,000 to £7,500 per year, while pensions would be transferred from a final salary to a defined benefits scheme.The company added that no job cuts were expected.It has asked for an answer to the proposals by Monday, and has said shareholders will discuss the complex's future on Tuesday.The company has said Grangemouth is "financially distressed" and must reduce costs.It has also asked for guarantees that no further strike action will be held by workers.Unite claimed the company had told staff they could lose their jobs and be reemployed on poorer terms unless they agreed to give up their final salary pension, and accept pay freezes and pay cuts, by 18:00 on Monday.Pat Rafferty, Unite's Scottish secretary, said: "This is cynical blackmail from a company that is putting a gun to the heads of its loyal workforce to slash pay, pensions and jobs."We are considering taking legal action over the company's menacing tactics and urge members not to be threatened into signing their livelihoods away."It is increasingly clear that the company is deliberately generating a dispute and hiding behind fancy accounting to attack its own workforce."On Wednesday, Ineos said Grangemouth "is shut and remains shut", despite Unite calling off a 48-hour strike that had been due to begin on Sunday.The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans.Ineos claims it is unable to immediately restart the complex, which had been shut down ahead of the planned strike.A spokesman said: "The Grangemouth site is three times the size of the City of London and it is an incredibly complex system of manufacturing plants all connected by miles of pipes carrying highly flammable materials."Shutting down the site and restarting again is not like switching the lights off and on. It takes days to shut down properly and it takes weeks to bring it back up again."When Unite forced us to shut down in 2008 we had two major incidents and it took eight weeks to get back to normal. In the first incident, we had a large fire on a compressor. If our employees had been close to the area then there would have been serious injuries or even fatalities."</body>

      <body>England will not be one of the top eight seeds at next year's World Cup in Brazil after sealing qualification with a 2-0 win over Poland on Tuesday.Fifa's latest world rankings determined the top seeds for the 2014 tournament.England who climbed from 17th to 10th, will now have to face one of the top-ranked nations in their group matches.But boss Roy Hodgson says he is not worried whether his team is "first or second out of the hat" when the draw takes place on 6 December.The Netherlands, who were runners-up in 2010, and 2006 winners Italy are also unseeded.But Switzerland, Belgium and Colombia are, following the release of the rankings on Thursday by football's governing body.Hosts Brazil and the remaining top seven ranked qualifiers will be kept apart in the group stages of next year's tournament.Those groups will be completed by teams from three different geographical regions.England will have to face one of Brazil, Spain, Argentina, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Colombia and probably Uruguay.Uruguay's place in Brazil depends on them winning a play-off against Jordan, ranked 70, next month. If they are beaten in the two-legged tie, the Netherlands will take the final seed ahead of Italy.The rankings' emphasis on recent results rather than teams' record in major tournaments means 2010 World Cup runners-up Netherlands and 2006 winners Italy miss out on being kept apart from the other traditional powerhouses of world football.Barring a slump down the Fifa standings for any of the three, the Netherlands, Italy and England are likely to be kept apart as high-ranked fellow European nations.France coach Didier Deschamps, whose side have to win a two-legged play-off to make the finals after finishing second to Spain in their qualifying group, has criticised the system."From my point of view it's not very logical,'' said the former Chelsea midfielder.He added that it was a "double punishment" that his side were in Group I, the only European one with five rather than six teams, meaning they had two fewer matches to earn ranking points.As well as a seed and an unseeded European qualifier, each of the World Cup groups is likely to be completed by a team from a combined Asia, Oceania and North and Central America pot and one of the unseeded African and South American qualifiers or the lowest-ranked European qualifier.Spain remain at the top of the rankings, ahead of Germany who leapfrog Argentina to take second spot.Scotland have climbed 28 places to 35th in the world after beating Croatia and Macedonia in the final two games of their unsuccessful qualification campaign.Wales are up eight places to 44th in the wake of their 1-1 draw with Belgium, while Northern Ireland drop four places to 90th following their 1-1 draw away to Israel.</body>

      <body>England coach Steve McNamara has named only one Burgess brother to start the friendly against Italy on Saturday.Loose forward Sam takes his place in the pack as England finalise their preparations for the World Cup,  which kicks off on 26 October.Uncapped brother George is named on the bench while his twin Tom faces Samoa for England Knights instead.Three of the four Burgess brothers were named in McNamara's 24-man squad, with oldest brother Luke missing out.Sam, George and Tom would become the first set of three siblings to appear on the pitch together for England - although that cannot now happen against Italy.Warrington Wolves forward Ben Westwood misses out on the friendly - England's first meeting with Italy - as he serves a one-match ban for a deliberate punch in the Super League Grand Final defeat by Wigan Warriors this month.Wigan captain Sean O'Loughlin will also miss the match, which kicks off at 16:30 BST at the Salford City Stadium.Zak Hardaker will join Tom Burgess in the development side, who will open up the double-header at 14:00 BST when they take on Samoa."We are delighted to be playing against Italy in the historic international," McNamara said."Italy have made tremendous progress and are well equipped with quality players representing them from the NRL and Super League."And he said he was confident England were well set for the friendly and the World Cup to follow."The make-up of the side looks very exciting, with the right blend of youth and experience," he said."Our preparation has been first-class and we have trained exceptionally well at our camp in Potchefstroom, South Africa."This is the best prepared side to come from England and we are ready for what promises to be the most competitive World Cup in history."Sydney Roosters captain Anthony Minichiello, 33, is the star name in Italy's team and he will line up alongside younger brother Mark, the Gold Coast Titans forward, in a side boasting plenty of NRL experience but sprinkled with raw youngsters.Head coach Carlo Napolitano intends to give all 24 of his squad members a run-out, with the exception of forward Kade Snowden, who is banned.England: Sam Tomkins (Wigan), Hall (Leeds), Ablett (Leeds), Cudjoe (Huddersfield), Briscoe (Hull FC); Chase (Castleford), Sinfield (c) (Leeds); Graham (Canterbury Bulldogs), McIlorum (Wigan), Mossop (Wigan), Hock (Widnes), Farrell (Wigan), Sam Burgess (South Sydney Rabbitohs).Replacements: Charnley (Wigan), Watkins (Leeds), Widdop (Melbourne Storm), Burrow (Leeds) Hill (Warrington), Roby (St Helens), George Burgess (South Sydney Rabbitohs)England Knights: Makinson (St Helens), Thornley (Wigan), Jones (St Helens), Hardaker (Leeds), Cockayne (Wakefield), Sarginson (London Broncos), Powell (Wigan); Tom Burgess (South Sydney), Hodgson (Hull KR), Taylor (Wigan), Ferres (Huddersfield), Whitehead (Catalan Dragons), Crosby (Wigan).Replacements: Green (Hull), Hughes (Wigan), Lawrence (Huddersfield), Dixon (London Broncos), Singleton (Leeds), Bowden (Hull), Logan Tomkins (Wigan).</body>

      <body>British Cycling says it is on course to achieve its target of getting one million more women cycling by 2020.The Women's Cycling Strategy was launched in March by the sport's national governing body to build on interest following the London Olympics.It says around 106,000 women have participated in programmes this year."There is also a real appetite for women to get into racing or to try personal challenge rides," said chief executive Ian Drake."In the six months since we launched our strategy, we've made some great progress and our plan to get one million more women cycling over the next seven years is firmly on track."So far this year, 24,000 women have taken part in British Cycling sportives and our female member base has increased by 19% since we launched our strategy."Maria Miller, the secretary of state for culture, media and sport, said: "With great role models such as Laura Trott (pictured above) and Becky James, an increase in women's races, a Women's Tour announced and more female coaches coming through, the sport is in a great position to keep up this momentum."Earlier this month, the women's Tour of Britain was given the same status as the men's race for its launch in 2014.In its six-month update, British Cycling  said 37,000 women have taken part in traffic-free cycle rides in 2013, adding that over a third of the total attendees were women.Britain's Shanaze Reade, a three-time BMX world champion, said: "For too long, cycling has been seen as a sport for men. We're starting to close that gender gap."Find out how to get involved in cycling near you by visiting the Get Inspired website.</body>

      <title>Where ill people are locked in cages with hyenas</title>
      <description>Somalia has one of the highest rates of mental illness in the world, but few sufferers receive any medical help. Some are chained up, others are subject to even more brutal treatments.</description>

      <body>Somalia has one of the highest rates of mental illness in the world and with a healthcare system devastated by years of war, most sufferers receive no medical help. Many are chained up - to trees or at home. Some are even locked in cages with hyenas. But one man is trying to change all that.Dr Hab's advert runs up to three times a day on Mogadishu's radio stations."He's gone crazy! He's running away!" screams the actor. "Chain him down!"The scenario is familiar in Somalia. A man has become possessed by spirits and the only option for his family is to restrain him and call the sheikh. But as the young man protests, a voice that challenges Somali tradition booms out."Stop with the chains!" the voiceover orders. "Take him to Dr Hab's hospital! If he's having mental problems, take him to Dr Hab. He won't chain him, he'll help him."Dr Hab is not actually a real psychiatrist. Rather it's the persona of Abdirahman Ali Awale, a nurse who after three months of specialist training from the World Health Organization (WHO), has made it his mission to rescue Somalia's mentally ill. He claims he is able to treat everything from post-natal depression to schizophrenia.But the alternative to a trip to Hab could be a visit to one of Somalia's popular herbalists or sheikhs who still advocate traditional - and sometimes barbaric - cures."There is a belief in my country that hyenas can see everything including the evil spirits people think cause mental illness," says Hab. "So in Mogadishu, you will find hyenas that have been brought from the bush and families will pay £350 ($560) to have their loved one locked in the room overnight with the animal."The expensive treatment - more than the average annual wage - is as brutal as it sounds. By clawing and biting at the patient, the hyena is thought to force the evil spirit out. Patients, including young children, have been known to die during the process."We are trying to show people that this is nonsense," says Hab. "People listen to our radio advert and they learn that mental illness is just like any other and needs to be treated with scientific methods."Hab's campaign was prompted by an incident in 2005 when he witnessed a group of female patients being chased through the streets by youths. "There was no-one to help them," he says. "I decided after that I would have to open Somalia's first mental hospital."The Habeb Public Mental Health Hospital in Mogadishu became the first of Hab's six centres across Somalia. Together, they have now treated over 15,000 patients.There were only three practising psychiatrists in the whole of Somalia at the last count, and Hab - despite his lack of advanced qualifications - is head of what has become the country's leading provider of mental health services. He even carries a letter from the minister of health that says so.Hab faces a near insurmountable task. WHO estimates that one in three Somalis either is or has been affected by mental illness, compared to a global average of one in 10. In parts of the country, where the population has been the most psychologically scarred from decades of conflict, the rate is even higher. Cases of post-traumatic stress disorder are common and the situation is further complicated by widespread substance abuse."Khat is a big, big problem," says Hab of the herbal stimulant which has been chewed for centuries in East Africa. Side effects are thought to include anxiety and even psychosis. "We treat them in the hospital and they leave, but then they start eating khat again. Sometimes I see the same patients seven or eight times."Western aid agencies in Somalia have often promoted projects targeting communicable diseases, not least because results are quicker and cheaper to obtain. Hab, meanwhile, says he is left to run his organisation with minimal resources and an erratic supply of psychotropic medicines that he sources from NGOs and private pharmacies.Even getting sufferers to recognise that their condition constitutes an illness is difficult. Psychological problems are more likely to be reported by Somalis as physical pain - headaches, sweating, and chest pain. Some concepts of mental illness do not even exist in Somali culture - depression, for example, translates as "the feelings a camel has when its friend dies".But nothing is more indicative of the population's poor understanding of mental health than the widespread practice of chaining-up sufferers to trees and in rooms. GRT, an Italian NGO, has documented sufferers who have been chained up their entire life."I myself have saved many patients who have been left to die," says Hab who drives a minibus into rural areas, unchaining people and taking them to one of his centres. "Parents, siblings, relatives - they've just been chained up to a tree and the family has gone."The WHO has funded a "Chain Free Initiative", with the aim of eradicating the practice altogether, starting with the use of chains in hospitals. But even Hab admits to having chained up some of his most aggressive patients.He tells the story of how, in 2007, one unintended consequence of his acquisition of a batch of the anti-psychotic drug, fluphenazine hydrochloride, was an increased appetite in his patients. They took to scaling the walls of his hospital in Mogadishu to scavenge for food. But still desperately unwell, some of the escapees had been shot when they ignored orders at a military checkpoint. Chaining them to their beds, concluded Hab, was the only option."Many patients take a long time to treat," he says. "There has been no outside help focussed on treating mental health problems and the main reason NGOs are not getting involved is because of the expense."Hab is motivated by the thousands of patients he believes remain chained up in private homes. He sends through a spreadsheet showing what he needs - new mattresses, food for patients, and diesel for his minibus. There is also a shortage of qualified psychiatrists and nurses. The daily struggle to provide for his patients and the suffering he witnesses is clearly taking its toll."Physiologically and mentally it's a very hard job" he says. "I was healthy when I started, now I suffer from diabetes. I am dealing with big, big problems all by myself."I have cried on TV, I have cried in public places, I have cried in front of presidents," he says. "Even now I feel like crying."</body>

      <title>Can kindness movements make a difference?</title>
      <description>There's a growing movement to commit random act of kindness, but do such acts make for a nicer society?</description>

      <body>Picking up litter. Buying someone in need a coffee. Or just doling out free hugs. There's a growing movement of people doing nice things for strangers, but do they make for a kinder society?Each week, Elisa Ng trawls the streets of Singapore picking up rubbish discarded by her fellow citizens. She is not searching for treasure hidden in the litter. Her only goal is to leave the city a little cleaner than before."I want to encourage other people to pick up a piece of litter every day," she says.Recently, she chased an errant lorry driver who had thrown a plastic bag from his window. "He looked quite apprehensive and seemed apologetic," she says.Thankless though the task seems, Ng is just one of many residents of the city who have been inspired by the Singapore Kindness Movement, a government-funded body which aims to promote helpful and courteous behaviour amongst its people."It definitely makes a difference," says William Wan, the leader of the movement. "We have changed the way that certain social norms are accepted. People are starting to give up their seats on buses now, which they never used to do."A similar organisation, the Random Acts of Kindness Foundation, was founded in Denver, Colorado, in response to the city's "Summer of Violence" in 1993, when dozens of people were killed in gang-related shootings, including several children. One victim of stray gunfire was just 10 months old.The organisation borrowed the writer Ann Herbert's call for people to "practice random acts of kindness, and senseless acts of beauty".The phrase has since been popularised on doormats and bumper stickers across the US and encourages Americans to surprise one another with good deeds.Kelsey Gryniewicz, a director at the foundation, advocates activities such as anonymously leaving hampers of food on neighbours' doorsteps and paying for the person queuing behind you at a coffee shop."It's not just about single acts, though," she says. "It's about changing your mentality from day to day."The World Kindness Movement represents the work of organisations from 23 different countries. "It has gone way past the level of community endeavour," says its secretary general Michael Lloyd-White.But measuring the impact of these groups is not easy.Each year, the Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) publishes a World Giving Index, which attempts to track certain types of giving behaviour in 146 countries across the globe.The data is extracted from an annual poll conducted by research firm Gallup and ranks countries according to the proportion of people who have volunteered, helped strangers at random, or donated money to charity in a typical month.In first position last year was Australia, where a third of the population volunteers each month and two-thirds claim to have helped a stranger and donated money to charity.Lisa Grinham, from CAF's Australian branch, says that the rise is due to the flooding that hit Queensland and Victoria the year before, pointing out that figures tend to rise in times of national hardship.Globally, however, the position is very different. "The trend that has been revealed is a disturbing one," says Dr John Law, the chief executive of the Charities Aid Foundation. The number of acts of kindness and charity dropped by hundreds of millions last year due to the global recession, he says.Singapore dropped from 91st to 114th place in the 2012 World Giving Index. The country's own Graciousness Index also indicated that fewer people had experienced "gracious acts" last year.William Wan of the Singapore Kindness Movement blames the decline on "bread-and-butter issues" such as the rising cost of housing and transport.In the US, which dropped from first to fifth place in the global index last year, a team of academics is working on a programme of compassion education in schools to try to reverse the decline.Richard J Davidson from the Center for Investigating Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin-Madison thinks that the level of kindness in society can be improved if children are taught to be more empathetic from an early age."Compassion should be regarded as a skill that can be cultivated through training," he says.The kindness curriculum is currently being taught in 10 schools across Wisconsin. The project is still at the research stage, but "the early signs are promising", he says.Not everybody is convinced that focussing on compassion in this way is helpful, however."We have made altruism a sacred object, so we've been blinded to its deleterious effects," says Barbara Oakley from the University of Oakland, Michigan.In a new book called Pathological Altruism, she argues against what she sees as a cultural obsession with the notion of kindness."There's a misguided view that empathy is a universal solvent. Helping others is often about your own narcissism. What you think people need is often not actually what they need."Kelsey Gryniewicz doesn't think that the American kindness movement is guilty of that charge, arguing that there are tangible, practical benefits to the activities they recommend."It doesn't have to be about cradling people in a bubble of kindness," she says.In Singapore, William Wan takes a more reflective view. "We must be realistic. We mustn't be naive. Kindness movements can't solve all our problems, but if they can solve some of our problems, why not use them?"There are more volunteering stories in the BBC News series Making TimeDo you carry out small acts of kindness for strangers, or for you local area?

      <title>How much better is standing up than sitting?</title>
      <description>Studies have claimed major health benefits for standing for much of the day as opposed to sitting. What's the difference in calories, asks Michael Mosley.</description>

      <body>Studies have claimed major health benefits for standing for much of the day as opposed to sitting. The difference is marked, explains Michael Mosley.Guess how many hours a day you spend sitting? Fewer than eight? More than 10? A recent survey found that many of us spend up to 12 hours a day sitting on our bottoms looking at computers or watching television. If you throw in the seven hours we spend sleeping then that adds up to a remarkable 19 hours a day being sedentary.Sitting down as much as this is clearly bad for us and some studies suggest that those who sit all day live around two years less than those who are more active. Most of us are guilty of excess sitting. We sit at work, in the car and at home, moving only to shift from one seat to another.Even if you exercise on a regular basis that may not be enough. There is mounting evidence that exercise will not undo the damage done by prolonged sitting. Our technology has made us the most sedentary humans in history.So why is sitting so damaging? One thing it does is change the way our bodies deal with sugar. When you eat, your body breaks down the food into glucose, which is then transported in the blood to other cells.Glucose is an essential fuel but persistently high levels increase your risk of diabetes and heart disease. Your pancreas produces the hormone insulin to help get your glucose levels back down to normal, but how efficiently your body does that is affected by how physically active you areWe wanted to see what would happen if we took a group of people who normally spend their day sitting in an office and ask them to spend a few hours a day on their feet instead.Standing while you are working may seem rather odd, but it is a practice with a long tradition. Winston Churchill wrote while working at a special standing desk, as did Ernest Hemingway and Benjamin Franklin.So with Dr John Buckley and a team of researchers from the University of Chester we conducted a simple experiment. We asked 10 people who work at an estate agents to stand for at least three hours a day for a week.Our lucky volunteers had mixed feelings about how they would get on."It'll be different, but looking forward to it, yes…""I think my feet might hurt - I'll have to wear sensible shoes…""The small of my back, it's going to hurt…""I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to stand up for all that time…[Laughs nervously]"We asked all the volunteers to wear an accelerometer - a movement monitor - to record just how much moving about they were doing. They also wore heart rate monitors and had glucose monitors that measured their blood sugar levels constantly, day and night.The evidence that standing up is good for you goes back to at least the 1950s when a study was done comparing bus conductors (who stand) with bus drivers (who don't). This study, published in the Lancet, showed that the bus conductors had around half the risk of developing heart disease of the bus drivers.Since then prolonged sitting has not only been linked to problems with blood glucose control, but also a sharp reduction in the activity of an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase, which breaks down blood fats and makes them available as a fuel to the muscles. This reduction in enzyme activity leads to raised levels of triglycerides and fats in the blood, increasing the risk of heart disease.We had good reason to believe that standing would make a difference to our volunteers, but we were also a little anxious as to how they would get on. This was the first time an experiment like this had been conducted in the UK. Would our volunteers stick to it?They did. One woman with arthritis even found that standing actually improved her symptoms.The Chester researchers took measurements on days when the volunteers stood, and when they sat around. When they looked at the data there were some striking differences. As we had hoped, blood glucose levels fell back to normal levels after a meal far more quickly on the days when the volunteers stood than when they sat.There was also evidence, from the heart rate monitors that they were wearing, that by standing they were burning more calories."If we look at the heart rates," John Buckley explains, "we can see they are quite a lot higher actually - on average around 10 beats per minute higher and that makes a difference of about 0.7 of a calorie per minute."Now that doesn't sound like much, but it adds up to about 50 calories an hour. If you stand for three hours a day for five days that's around 750 calories burnt. Over the course of a year it would add up to about 30,000 extra calories, or around 8lb of fat."If you want to put that into activity levels," Dr Buckley says, "then that would be the equivalent of running about 10 marathons a year. Just by standing up three or four hours in your day at work."Dr Buckley thinks that although going out and doing exercise offers many proven benefits, our bodies also need the constant, almost imperceptible increase in muscle activity that standing provides. Simple movement helps us to keep our all-important blood sugar under control.We can't all stand up at work but the researchers believe that even small adjustments, like standing while talking on the phone, going over to talk to a colleague rather than sending an email, or simply taking the stairs, will help.I have, of course, written this article while standing.Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Housing benefit review begins</title>
      <description>The government has commissioned independent firms to conduct research into the impact of its changes to housing benefit rules.</description>

      <body>A government commissioned review by independent firms has begun into the impact of housing benefit changes.Under reforms that took effect in April, council or housing association tenants of working age will lose some housing benefit if they are deemed to have more bedrooms than they need.The independent review of the policy was promised when the bill became law.Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was "responsible" to check on how any new policy worked in practice.In an exchange in the House of Commons on Tuesday deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman claimed that "for 96% of [affected] tenants, there is no smaller home to go to".Mr Clegg told her: "Lots of wildly different figures have been cited about the policy's impact. That is why we are commissioning independent research to understand its impact."I suspect that it varies enormously between one part of the country and another, and one local authority and another."He was asked about the review during his weekly phone-in on London's LBC radio, saying: "What I confirmed in the House of Commons is something that is not new, it's something that we announced back in March.With a "big policy like this, it'd be irresponsible for a government to say 'oh well, it's happening' and not work out or try and assess how it's actually being implemented on the ground", he said."So we've commissioned a number of independent bodies to provide an ongoing review about exactly how it's unfolding on the ground. The picture is really quite unclear at the moment."Nick Clegg's fellow Liberal Democrats signalled their dissatisfaction with the changes - called a bedroom tax by critics and a spare room subsidy by supporters - when they voted for a review of the policy at their party conference in September.A government spokesman said: "The Department of Work and Pensions routinely commissions research on their new policies."The deputy prime minister was referring to evaluation work already being carried out by an independent consortium into this policy."The research is being carried out by Ipsos-MORI and the Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research, a division of the University of Cambridge.The initial findings will be available in 2014 and the final report in late 2015, according to the Department of Work and Pensions.</body>

      <body>Lord West, the Labour peer and former security minister, has revealed that he was court-martialled about 30 years ago for losing confidential material.The former First Sea Lord and head of the navy was commenting on the government's move to simplify how government documents are classified.The designations Unclassified, Protect, Restricted and Confidential are to go, but Secret and Top Secret are to stay.The peer said it was a subject that went "straight to my heart".On the BBC's Daily Politics programme, he explained: "Some thirty years ago I was court-martialled for losing something that was classified, so as you can no doubt imagine, I pay particular attention to classification of these issues."The new regime will have just three classifications: Official, Secret and Top Secret.Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude noted that the previous system had been designed "decades ago".The reforms would "speed up decisions, make it easier to share information and save hard-working taxpayers' money," he added."There has been a tendency to over mark documents rather than to manage risk properly. This can devalue the basic security principles."We think the most important and sensitive materials should be protected as Top Secret or Secret but for other information the new Official category, with its renewed emphasis upon personal responsibility and accountability, will be appropriate for most of what government does."Lord West said: "It's time that this was done, and it's right that this was done."He continued: "It's quite clear that we have too much that's over-classified, and when you're working in an area where quite a lot of things are secret people think: 'Hmm, I'd better make that secret just in case.'"We end up with a plethora of these documents, and handling them, either on computers or sending them to someone else, is incredibly complex and expensive. You have to have special rules for doing it, specials ways of doing it."I did discover... that if I really wanted a minister to look at something I didn't just have it top secret, I would make a code word."And then they had to be indoctrinated into it, you would make them sign a piece of paper, and then they really wanted to see it."But if you gave them something that just said confidential, then they weren't so fussed."</body>

      <title>Labour plans levy on payday lenders</title>
      <description>Labour pledges to introduce a levy on the profits of payday lenders to help support credit unions and other low-cost borrowing alternatives.</description>

      <body>Labour has pledged to impose a levy on the profits of payday lenders to help support lower-cost lending from credit unions and boost money advice services.If elected in 2015, it would introduce an extra charge on the lenders, which charge up to 4,000% interest, on top of fees already paid by all finance firms.Shadow business minister Stella Creasy told the BBC it was "payback time for these payday lenders".Payday lenders say they provide a valuable service to their customers.But Ms Creasy, who became Labour's shadow consumer and competition minister in the recent reshuffle, said: "Some of these companies are making a million pounds a week."They need to pay their share for the damage they're doing."She said the firms were "aggressively targeting people, and once they've got them in their claws, they keep squeezing and squeezing them".Ms Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, added: "Many other industries have set up voluntary organisations, like Drink Aware and Gambling Aware, when their products are causing problems. Yet this industry sits around saying there's no damage being done."These companies need to take responsibility for the damage that they are causing in communities like mine, where I've got 18 of these companies on my high street alone."So we're proposing to put a levy on them that can be used to fund the expansion of credit unions, who need more capital to be able to lend, and also debt and money advice services to help people with their finances, because we are struggling with the cost of living in this country."Ms Creasy's interview preceded a speech by Labour leader Ed Miliband, in which he said the measure was designed to help those already in "desperate need" and people at risk of racking up huge debts they cannot repay in future.The industry has been referred to the Competition Commission and regulators have promised a tightening of the rules, with all borrowers set to be offered an "affordability" check before being given a loan.Mr Miliband claimed that the squeeze on living standards was causing a "personal debt crisis" with a third of those taking out payday loans currently doing so to meet the cost of heating their homes."The prices families have to pay keep on rising faster and faster than the wages they are paid," he said on a visit to south London. "For too many families the end of the month is now their own personal credit crunch."Labour has already said it will cap the cost of credit and give local authorities new powers to limit the spread of payday lending shops in town centres.But Mr Miliband added: "We must protect the most vulnerable people in our society from the worst of exploitation by payday lenders."And it is right that the companies that benefit from people's financial plight, accept their responsibilities to help ensure affordable credit is available."He said the party would consult on the rate of the levy and how it will be implemented.Payday lenders, along with all financial service providers, already pay fees to the Financial Conduct Authority to help fund services such as debt advice.The government currently spends £13m on supporting the growth of credit unions but Labour says these organisations do not have the capacity nor the resources to offer help to all those who need it.Labour says the "explosion" in the payday lending market - with it says has doubled in size to £2.2bn in the last four years - is directly related to what it says is a "cost of living crisis".As many as five million families plan to borrow money from payday lenders in the next six months, and more than 1.5 million households spend more than 30% of their income on unsecured credit repayments, it says.Ministers say proposals announced by the Financial Conduct Authority earlier this month, including a ban on some products and a limit on the times loans can be rolled over, will "call time" on unscrupulous lenders.The Church of England has condemned the practices and ethics of some payday lenders and pledged to launch its own credit service to force many of them out business.But lenders say they are helping people in genuine need with no-one else to turn to and that firms who are members of Consumer Finance Association are heavily regulated already.</body>

      <description>Knife death families suffer combat stress, hair loss and flashbacks</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-22966016</url>

      <body>National crime figures have shown that murders involving a knife have dropped 9% in the past year, from 207 in 2011-12 to 189 in 2012-13. The figures provide a dispassionate, statistical snapshot of these crimes, but do not yield the experiences of those left behind - the families. Here are some of their stories.The narrative of fatal knife crime is usually a simple one.A person is killed, the grieving family releases a tribute, the case goes to court and the person responsible is imprisoned.The police will then release a statement on behalf of the family in which the detectives are thanked for their help in securing justice.Some people might even use the word "closure".And that, appeals not withstanding, is that.Only it never is like that.The real impact of violent deaths on surviving families is rarely told. It does not fit the prescribed narrative with its neat beginnings, middles and endings.Mood swings, addiction, the loss of toenails and hair, suicide attempts, marital collapse, alienation from friends and difficulties with eating - the physical and social effects of bereavement are less reported.The after-effects of knife crime on the bereaved can resemble the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) experienced by post-combat soldiers, psychologists say.This is something Anne Oakes-Odger knows all too well.Her son Westley Odger, 27, was stabbed in the neck outside a cash machine in Colchester in 2005. He died of his injuries.The "reason" for the attack was that he told someone not to jump the queue.Ms Oakes-Odger, who lives in Essex, believes the psychological and physical impact of murder on surviving family members is poorly understood."You feel as though you are losing your mind," she says. "When a child is murdered, it is out of the normal course of events."The shock element creates a lot of physical and mental issues for every member of the family."One of the things which happened to me was my hair fell out in bunches and my toenails fell off. I thought that was peculiar to me, but I found out it wasn't."The loss of her hair and nails was, she says, a symptom of the stress of living in a sustained "flight or fight" state. She also suffered colour blindness."During the early years I was not seeing things in colour. I could only see in black and white and various shades of grey."There isn't a 'closure' with homicide."The criminal justice system itself hinders rather than helps, according to Ms Oakes-Odger. For months or years after a murder, the loved one is more "evidence" than person, and can be subjected to multiple post mortem examinations.And at the centre of proceedings sits not the victim, or their family, but the accused.Grieving while the wheels of justice roll, she says, is nigh on impossible. And by the time they do stop, the psychological damage is already done.The Ministry of Justice says it understands the "immeasurable suffering" experienced by victims' families and that it is committed to making sure more support than "ever before" is available to them.This includes the national Homicide Service, which offers such families a Victim Support caseworker and access to specialist counselling.The department is also "revamping" the Victim's Code which it says will make "major improvements for victims" and give them a clearer guide about their entitlements and sources of help.These are the type of measures Tanya (pictured above), who asked for her surname to be withheld, says she desperately needed.Her husband Gary, 59, was murdered by their son Ed who, after killing his father upstairs with a hammer and a knife, came downstairs and tried to kill her.She heard two "thuds" upstairs and believes had she not turned around to see her son before he attacked she too would have died.The killing happened a week before Christmas in 2007. The family had enjoyed a normal day and Ed had been upstairs in his room. He asked Gary to come up and help him fix his stereo.It was then that he killed him.Her son, who was 15 at the time, is serving 18 years for murder and attempted murder. He had denied the charges, claiming his state of mind was altered by the anti-depressant fluoxetine."I lost everything that day," she says.Like Ms Oakes-Odger, Tanya's toenails fell out. Even now, six years on, she still loses her nails when she is under stress.After her husband's murder, the former nursery worker could not bring herself to use knives - even cutlery knives - or face opening her post.Looking back, Tanya says there is precious little support offered to the families of people violently killed. The attention and support, she says, goes to the perpetrators.The victims' families, Tanya says, are - with the exception of police family liaison officers - left to find their own way through the emotional and practical debris of a disaster."There was nothing," she says. "And it takes so much for you to ask for help. And you just don't have the words. It would be much better if support was offered to you, even if you didn't take it there and then, but could take it along the way."My two other children (who were in their late teens when their father was murdered by their brother) had no support."Also difficult has been the expectations wider society places on the families."It has been five years but I still have days when it is hard - anniversaries. Some people are really good and know when you're not in the right place. Others say 'you're OK' and they expect you to be OK and so for those people, you are."I still have times when I have to put the knives away and when people are doing DIY with hammers... but it is part of everyday life, and you have to get used to it."For some, deaths can trigger a personal redefinition. A shy person learns to speak out, for example.Take Holly Watson. Now aged 20, she met her half-brother Lewis when she was 14.Just two years after they met, Lewis was dead. The 23-year-old was stabbed three times in Sudbury, Suffolk.The only photograph she has of Lewis, who was a keen angler, is of him holding a fish. She never got to say goodbye as he was dead before she got to hospital."That was hard," she says. "I had never seen a dead body before. And when the first body you see is your big brother, well that's hard to deal with."I became a bit of a recluse. At the beginning I hated the world and everybody in it."It was almost like a hysteria, with Lewis dying, the funeral and the waiting, like limbo land, and then the court case and then everybody said it would get easier with the closure, but it doesn't."Immediately after her brother's death, she was unable to pick up a cutlery knife."To begin with knives made me feel sick, I couldn't use them. We felt we could not hold something that had killed Lewis."Then there was the impact on her ambitions. Holly had always wanted to be a lawyer. But as she started to explore the law, she found many of the scenarios put to students in law exams involved knife crimes.Her ambitions for the law were put on hold.Next year she will turn 21. It is not an anniversary she is looking forward to. Her brother, she says, should be there for it. And should she ever marry, then Lewis should have been there for that too. But he won't be."I dread the day when I have children and I have to tell them that their uncle isn't here," she says."The biggest thing in getting over something like this is in accepting that the world is not always what you want it to be."Holly says she used to be shy. She is now an anti-knife violence campaigner.So too is Caroline Shearer.Her 17-year-old son Jay Whiston was fatally stabbed in the heart outside a house party in Essex last September.Exactly what happened remains unclear and is currently subject to court proceedings.Ms Shearer describes the days since her son's death as a "living torture" peppered only by the briefest of moments each morning, in the gap between sleep and consciousness, when the anguish of loss is kept at bay.She would love to have all of the happy memories she shared with Jay at the forefront of her mind.Instead, the recurring image which haunts her is of her boy on the cusp of adulthood lying dead on a mortuary slab."I was a mother of two children then, within three hours, I was a mother of one," she says."He was a normal, everyday, loving, caring boy. I always say he had such a huge heart, they couldn't have missed."The grief she describes is like a sledgehammer. There are gaps in the day when she might, for example, notice the weather, or have a conversation. And then the grief hits her, again and again.It is with her throughout the day - as she washes clothes, cooks meals or sees a car of the same colour as Jay's - and last thing at night as she falls asleep.And she too had difficulties with eating.She tells how shortly after Jay's death she struggled to use kitchen knives or cutlery - because of their association with the implement used to kill her son.None of the symptoms reported by the families surprise clinical psychologist Don Macleod.Mr Macleod has worked with families across the north west of England who have suffered tragedy. Some suffer PTSD symptoms more often associated with combat veterans.But for the families, he says, the expert knowledge needed to help them is often not there."I would be almost certain that your average GP would not actually tag what's going on with someone having that kind of reaction," says Mr Macleod."The GP might know there had been a murder in the family, but they might not have the time or indeed the skills and knowledge to be able to pinpoint that [PTSD] is what the issue is."Part of the issue is that the initial responses to grief - anger, anxiety, flashbacks and depression - are, although extremely unpleasant for the people suffering them, "completely normal" given the circumstances.They become an issue, he said, when they "become protracted" - such as with PTSD.Can these families ever recover?Ms Oakes-Odger thinks they can, but it is a slow, painful process which results not in a return to how things used to be but in acceptance of the way they are now."It is about finding a new 'normal'," she says, "a normal in which you can lead a purposeful life, one you can go forward with."</body>

      <body>Alan Milburn says he was asked by the coalition to "hold its feet to the fire" in examining its progress on social mobility and child poverty.But just how much will his words hurt?In this, the first of what is planned to be an annual "State of the Nation report", the commission led by the former Labour health secretary concludes that "Britain remains a deeply divided country", one where "being born poor often leads to a lifetime of poverty".The commission says austerity has made it even harder to break ingrained cycles of poverty, that "disadvantage and advantage cascade down the generations".It warns there is a danger that social mobility will go in to reverse after rising in the middle of the last century and "flatlining" towards the end of it.The post-war years saw a big expansion of the middle classes, as the professional jobs market grew and more people bought their own homes, but there has been little change in the last quarter of the century.Mr Milburn said over decades, the UK had become a wealthier society, but had "struggled to become a fairer one" and had more children living in poverty and lower levels of social mobility than "many other developed nations".A total of 2.3 million children (one in six) live in poverty, he said, and this made it essential that the pattern where "birth not worth" determined a person's chances in life was changed.Higher social mobility had become "the new holy grail of public policy". It is certainly something all parties now say they want to see.The report from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission has stinging words on some areas of government policy but they are sweetened with praise for others, including the fact that the coalition continues to "stick to its commitments" on ending child poverty and improving social mobility in "challenging times".Mr Milburn told journalists at a news conference the government "deserved credit" for that.But the target of ending child poverty by 2020 - begun under Labour and continued by the coalition government - would "in all likelihood" be missed, he said.His most stinging criticism seemed to be about the way the young were likely to pay the highest price for a lack of social mobility and poverty during the global financial crisis.He called for older generations to be asked to dig deeper.The number of young people who have been unemployed for two years or more is at a "20-year high", he said.And there was an "inter-generational unfairness" in terms of who was being asked to pick up the bill in the recession.He did not call for pension cuts, but Mr Milburn said politicians should be prepared to "break political taboos" to talk about whether wealthier pensioners should lose benefits currently available to all - particularly the winter fuel allowance and the free TV licence.Pensioners were usually more worried about their grandchildren than themselves, he said.The commission is also looking to employers to do more - to offer better training, pay higher wages and open up professions to a wider pool of people. Two-thirds of children living in poverty, the report says, are living in homes with a working parent.Schools and universities were also urged to do more.He said schools in some areas were letting down pupils from poorer homes and those from middle-income homes too.Schools should give more help to low-achievers from middle-income homes as well as the poorest, while the government should improve careers advice, give extra incentives for teachers to teach in the worst schools and pay colleges "by results they achieve for their students in the labour market - not the numbers they recruit".As for universities - which were the focus of an earlier report by the commission - he says the sector as a whole has drawn in more students from poorer homes but top institutions remain out of reach for too many.Each year, he said, there were 3,700 "missing" state school pupils who had achieved the grades needed to get in to universities in the Russell Group (which represents some of the UK's leading universities) but did not go to them.The commission called for the government to put social mobility at the heart of its policies and practices, so that it was a "golden thread" running through all it did. It concentrated on the overall UK picture, but pointed out that in Scotland and Wales, the issue "currently has a low profile".In an age of austerity, the report's authors suggest creating a fairer society will be a job for all - and far from pain-free.</body>

      <title>The problem with taking too many vitamins</title>
      <description>Can supplements actually be dangerous?</description>

      <body>Millions of people swear by vitamin supplements. But many are wasting their time and some could even be harming themselves, argues Dr Chris van Tulleken.In November 1912 a party of three men and 16 dogs set out from a remote base in eastern Antarctica to explore a series of crevasses many hundreds of miles away.Three months later just one of the men returned. His name was Douglas Mawson. His skin was peeling off and his hair was falling out. He had lost almost half his body weight. He recounted what Sir Edmund Hillary described as "the greatest story of lone survival in the history of polar exploration".A month into their journey, one of the team, along with the tent, most of the provisions and six dogs plunged into a crevasse, never to be seen again. Mawson and the other surviving member, Xavier Mertz, started to return to base, surviving in part by eating the remaining dogs. After a few weeks Mertz developed stomach pains and diarrhoea. Then his skin started to peel off and his hair fell out. He died incontinent and delirious a few days later.Mawson suffered similar symptoms. With the kind of understatement typical of his generation of polar explorers he described the skin of the soles of his feet peeling off: "The sight of my feet gave me quite a shock, for the thickened skin of the soles had separated in each case as a complete layer... The new skin underneath was very much abraded and raw."It was the suffering of early explorers and sailors that motivated the first studies of vitamins and their deficiency diseases.At first sight Mawson's story seems to be another such tale - starvation combined with a lack of some vital nutrient. In fact, Mawson's description of his symptoms is an almost textbook description of vitamin A overdose - probably from eating dog liver. As little as 100g of husky liver could give a hungry explorer a fatal dose.Mawson lived to the decent age of 76 but in his story we find the cautionary tale for our times - vitamins can be very bad for you.This piece is about what we have learned about vitamin supplements in the last few years - if you are healthy, and you live in a country like the UK, taking multi-vitamins and high-dose antioxidants may shorten your life.For most of us, for most of the time, they're unhealthy. "Argh!" I hear you say, "I spend loads of money on them and the claims on the packet are really persuasive. Everything, from my full head of hair to my sex life, depends on them!"I want to get into this in a bit more detail because the vitamin companies certainly don't agree with me. So why do we believe they're useful and why do we take them?Vitamins are essential for life, and there are groups of people even in the UK who benefit from specific supplementation, but general unsupervised vitamin pill-popping is more than just a waste of money. The problem is that we all feel very warm and fuzzy about vitamins because, firstly, the tales of deficiency are so horrific, secondly, we read breakfast cereal packs and thirdly, a double-Nobel laureate called Linus Pauling liked vitamin C in vast, vast doses.All this is packaged by the people now selling us vitamins over the counter into that most beguiling of all logical falsehoods - if a little is good, then more must be better.Now I knew the names of the most obscure vitamins long before medical school because I have always had a fondness for the kind of multicoloured, artificially flavoured breakfast cereals that are marketed using a combination of unlikely cartoon animals and claims of being "vitamin and mineral-enriched".And it has to be said that this vitamin and mineral enrichment of staple food has been one of the most effective public health interventions in history. It continues to save countless lives per year even in Europe.So, while you shouldn't eat dog liver in Antarctica, vitamin A deficiency hugely increases the risk of blindness and death in children with measles and diarrhoea in developing countries. So the World Health Organization recommends a very strict amount and cautions that higher doses can cause birth defects in early pregnancy among other problems.So vitamins do make a huge difference to life expectancy in some circumstances, which is persuasive, and the breakfast propaganda catches us in our most vulnerable, bleary-eyed, early morning state, hinting to us that these vitamins have some sort of catch-all, beneficial effect on our lives, that will transform us into the healthy, energetic beautiful people/cartoon creatures portrayed on the cereal box.These things contribute to a general ideal of healthfulness of vitamins. And then there's Linus Pauling.Whether or not you've heard of him, Linus Pauling is a major influence on vitamin and nutrient culture. It's almost impossible to imagine someone with more authority and credibility. He won two Nobel prizes and was, by all accounts, a genuinely good bloke. He wrote a book in 1970 saying that high doses of vitamin C could be effective in combating flu, cancer, cardiovascular disease, infections and degenerative problems.He took immense quantities himself, hundreds of times the required amount, and lived to a ripe old age surrounded by many great grandchildren. He was the poster boy for mega-dosing of vitamins and this contributed to the growth of an industry supported by the belief that supplementation of these molecules in our diet is beneficial in almost every way imaginable.But rather than taking one man's word for it, however credible, it's worth looking at the results of studies that look at what happens to people who take these supplements for long periods of time.Looking at any one individual study won't be very revealing to answer the question of whether vitamin supplementation is good for you. They're densely scientific and the conflicts of interest can be very hard to spot.For the answer you have to turn to what are called "systematic review papers". This is where independent scientists gather up all the available data and re-analyse it to answer big questions.Here's what a couple of them say:"We found no evidence to support antioxidant supplements for primary or secondary prevention [of diseases of any kind]. Beta-carotene and vitamin E seem to increase mortality, and so may higher doses of vitamin A. Antioxidant supplements need to be considered as medicinal products and should undergo sufficient evaluation before marketing". (See references below).Just to be clear - "increase mortality" - that means they're killing you. These are powerfully bioactive compounds but they're not regulated in the same way as drugs. Whatever you think about the regulation there should surely be a warning on the pack if there's data saying they're bad for us.The next question is - why are they bad for us? It's very hard to pick apart the data, partly because vitamins are a fabulously diverse group of chemicals.I'm going to include what people normally refer to as minerals under the heading of vitamins. They're required in the diet not for energy, but as chemical partners for the enzymes involved in the body's metabolism - cell production, tissue repair, and other vital processes.Their functions are understood largely by their deficiency diseases so we're not exactly sure of precisely what they all do or how they interact. Antioxidants provide a nice example. They soak up the very toxic, chemically-reactive by-products of metabolism called free radicals. These free radicals, left unchecked, can cause damage to DNA and may be linked to cancer.Your cells are full of antioxidants but surely taking more would be better? Right? Keep those cancer causing radicals under control? Well, unfortunately, your body's immune system fights infections by using free radicals to kill bugs. Exactly what effect huge quantities of extra antioxidants could have on this is not clear but it's easy to imagine that it might not be good and you could get more infections.Vitamin A is linked to increasing lung cancer in smokers. Excess zinc is linked to reduced immune function. Long-term excessive intake of manganese is linked to muscle and nerve disorders in older people. Niacin in excess has been linked to cell damage. And so on.And it gets more complicated still when you start mixing everything up in one tablet. For example, different minerals compete for absorption. If you take large quantities of calcium you won't be able to absorb your iron. If you take large quantities of iron you won't be able to absorb zinc. If you take vitamin C you'll reduce your copper level.So it's not just that taking lots of one thing is not good for you, it's that it may cause a dangerous reduction in something else even if you are also supplementing that. To work out the optimal ratios is all but impossible although some manufactures claim to have worked it out.So when are supplements recommended? The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends certain supplements for some groups of people who are at risk of deficiency, including:Your GP may also recommend supplements if you need them for a medical condition. If you decide to take supplements, stick to within the RDA, unless you've had guidance from a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist to exceed the dose. If you've got questions about dosage levels, consult a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist.The tales of deficiency combined with the success of enrichment programs means that it's easy to make that leap of logic that if a little is good then more must be better.And if you read my article last week on water you'll see where this is going. I could do this every week. The same article. Substitute water for vitamins/probiotics/antibiotics. Don't trust the science done by the people who are trying to sell them to you and don't assume that if some is good more must be better.It's like beer. Or coffee. Or computer games. Goldilocks was right about things needing to be just right.References:Bjelakovic G, Nikolova D, Simonetti RG, Gluud C.

      <title>The danger of rumination</title>
      <description>Can too much rumination be dangerous?</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country.A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind?Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation.But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be.The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them.A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK."We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool."Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown."The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety."The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others.The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion."But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says."The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem."This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology."Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years."When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says."If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head."Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming."There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me."Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head."Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders.And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum.In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems.So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them?"Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman.It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study."It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says."It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed."Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system."This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster."And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists."Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on FacebookFollow @BBCOuch on Twitter and on FacebookFollow @BBCOuch on Twitter and on Facebook, and listen to our monthly talk show</body>

      <body>The Future's Rosie recently won "best new blog" at the MAD (Mum and Dad) Blog awards. In it, Thomas Bachofner documents the progress of his two-year-old daughter, Rosie, who has Down's Syndrome. But why does he blog about it?I'm a graphic designer from Cheshire, not known for writing or reading any books. So it came as a surprise to me that I could even string a sentence together, let alone write a blog that is well received - I'm guessing it's because it comes from the heart.My site is about Rosie's achievements, such as last week when she stood up for the first time, but it also gives me an opportunity to do my little bit towards raising positive awareness of Down's.The first post was published on 14 February 2012 but the idea to share our story with the world came much earlier.When my wife Karen and I learnt that our unborn daughter had Down's syndrome, it was a shock, and it didn't feel like anybody understood our predicament.As a parent, you assume that everything will be fine. Our two boys, Harry and Joe, were born without complications. But we were told about Rosie's condition in such a negative way that we thought it would change our lives drastically for the worse.I found that all I wanted to do was read real-life parent stories from people in our situation, not the science and figures you become bombarded with when searching online. But there weren't many Down's syndrome parenting blogs around at the time and even fewer were written from a dad's perspective.I started to jot things down and was surprised to find that it helped get my emotions out. My scribbles eventually turned into The Future's Rosie which is having more of an impact on me and others than I could ever have predicted.Initially it was a handy way of telling my friends and family how I was feeling and it meant I didn't have to repeat myself over and over at what was a delicate time for me. But many of them began to share it with their friends and, before I knew it, my blog was being read by hundreds of people.I've shared lots of private thoughts about her development and how we as a family are all pitching in to help her.Last year I wrote about what I called "a barbaric-looking developmental aid" given to Rosie by her physio. It's a standing brace and we couldn't get her to use it. She hadn't wanted to walk or crawl, so we got Rosie's brothers to stand on the sofa and blow bubbles which made her reach up and support her body with her legs in order to strengthen them.I've covered learning the Makaton sign language, feeling full of pride when my young sons Harry and Joe stood on stage at school to give a talk about Down's to 250 kids, and I wrote about the weekend we all survived without Mummy being there.One of the hardest things I have done is write about Rosie's surgery. Children with Down's syndrome often have related heart difficulties and Rosie was born with a hole in the heart which needed fixing. My blog entry on that day included post-op pictures of my daughter - it felt like these might be useful for parents to see, if they too have to face the same operation with their Down's syndrome child.As Rosie got older, I quickly learned that my own pre-conceived ideas of Down's were both ignorant and outdated. I wanted to teach others about the reality in a non-patronising manner, so decided to use myself as an example in my own social media campaign. I did it from Rosie's perspective and called it Things I've Taught My Daddy.As with the blog, before I knew it the captioned images I shared on Facebook and Twitter had been seen by thousands worldwide.One of the messages I tried to communicate was that people with Down's are people first and foremost. They are more like their families than they are each other, though many people still find it difficult to see past the physical characteristics associated with the syndrome.Life with Rosie really is very normal, in fact she has been a far easier baby than both her older brothers were. The whole family love her to pieces and I genuinely wouldn't change a single thing about her - well, maybe the volume of her cries when she is hungry.After all "Down's syndrome" isn't who she is, it is just a part of her.Thomas Bachofner blogs at The Future's RosieYou can follow Ouch on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <body>A Supreme Court decision to dismiss the appeals of two prisoners seeking the right to vote draws the attention of some of Thursday's papers.The Sun welcomes the decision but worries the UK will "buckle to the Euro meddlers of Strasburg", who "insist that a voting ban for all lags" is against European law.In the Daily Mail, Tory MP Dominic Raab writes: "Even when we win we still lose".He says the judges decreed that British courts must "comply with Strasburg rulings" rather than just take them into account, which he says has been the position till now.The Times is also concerned by the small print, saying the prime minister's promise that prisoners would not get the vote under the coalition government "should prevail".Britain should withdraw altogether from the jurisdiction of Strasbourg and allow our own Supreme Court to "live up to its name", says the Express.Meanwhile, the Guardian has seen a leaked copy of an Ofsted report into the controversial Al-Madinah faith school in Derby, which describes it as "dysfunctional" and "in chaos".Another leak makes the front page of the Daily Telegraph which says its seen a secret Ministry of Defence report warning that a recruitment crisis could affect the Army's capability.And at the Times, an intervention from Prince Charles on pensions makes the splash.He apparently warned the "current focus on quarterly capitalism is becoming increasingly unfit for purpose" and said the next generation of pensioners - including his own grandchildren - could be "consigned to an exceptionally miserable future".A former police officer has told the Daily Mirror that "there wasn't a copper in Leeds who didn't know Jimmy Savile was a pervert".Ex-PC Paul Leonard says Savile once told him: "Clear off, I'm waiting for midnight when she turns sixteen."The Telegraph finds the decision by Royal Mail workers to go on strike, within days of the company's successful floatation, "almost hard to believe" and an "own goal".On the other side of the Atlantic and with a deal struck in Washington to end the budget crisis, the Times believes that, while President Obama has won a political victory, he would be wise not to gloat.The Tea Party "has a point" on the president's over-spending, the paper says.A member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee has told the Guardian that interest rates could conceivably rise next year.Spencer Dale, the bank's chief economist, says the desire to keep borrowing costs low for several years could be thwarted if stronger-than-expected growth is combined with unusually weak productivity.</body>

      <body>The number of badgers shot during a six-week cull in Gloucestershire has fallen short of its target, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has told MPs.Defra said 708 badgers had been killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650.Nigel Gibbens, chief veterinary officer, advised it should be extended. This could be for eight weeks.Badger campaigners have called the scheme a "massive failure" and said they would continue their protest .Mr Gibbens said extending the cull would achieve the "earliest and greatest possible impact" on bovine TB in Gloucestershire.Defra said Natural England was currently considering the application to extend the licence in Gloucestershire and a decision is "expected shortly".Mr Paterson told the BBC the cull figures were "not bad news" but admitted that those carrying out the killings had "got off to a slower start" in Gloucestershire."We must remember that these are pilots," he said."This has not been done before and we are learning, clearly, in each area. This isn't a sudden six-week period. These pilots are intended to go on for four years."Up to to the end of July, a further 20,000 perfectly healthy cattle have been hauled off to slaughter at horrendous expense to the taxpayer because we've lost control of TB."Mr Paterson said 305,000 cattle had been "lost" over the past 10 years and it was "not acceptable" to allow the disease to go on.The badger cull in Gloucestershire ended this week. A licence was granted last week to extend the badger cull in Somerset until 1 November.Defra said early indications from Gloucestershire are that, as in Somerset, the pilot had been "safe and humane".The government's original target was 2,900 badgers, based on a population estimate of 3,400 animals. The target was then revised to 1,650, from a population of 2,350.Last week Mr Paterson said the government was exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB.Stop the Badger Cull spokesman Jay Tiernan said the cull had been a "massive failure"."It's disgraceful," he said. "It clearly isn't safe, effective or humane."It is time for someone to bite the bullet and admit it's been a failure."Mr Tiernan said protests against the culls would continue.</body>

      <body>Pollutants in the air we breathe have been classed as a leading environmental cause of cancer by the World Health Organization.It said the evidence was clear they cause lung cancer.Sources of pollution include car exhausts, power stations, emissions from agriculture and industry - as well as heating in people's homes.The WHO said the classification should act as a strong message to governments to take action.The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a part of the WHO, has now classed air pollution in the same category as tobacco smoke, UV radiation and plutonium.It said air pollution had been know to cause heart and lung diseases, but evidence had now emerged that it was also causing cancer.The IARC said the most recent data suggested 223,000 deaths from lung cancer around the world were caused by air pollution.More than half of the deaths were thought to be in China and other East Asian countries. Rapid industrialisation has led to smoggy skies in cities such as Beijing.However, it is a global problem and concerns about air pollution were raised in Europe again this week.Data suggests there may also be a link with bladder cancer.Dr Kurt Straif, from IARC, said: "The air we breathe has become polluted with a mixture of cancer-causing substances."We now know that outdoor air pollution is not only a major risk to health in general, but also a leading environmental cause of cancer deaths."Cancer Research UK said it was not a surprise.Dr Julie Sharp, the head of health information at the charity, said: "It's important that people keep the risk from air pollution in perspective."Although air pollution increases the risk of developing lung cancer by a small amount, other things have a much bigger effect on our risk, particularly smoking."Dr Rachel Thompson, head of research interpretation at the World Cancer Research Fund International, said: "This latest evidence confirms the need for government, industry and multinational bodies to urgently address environmental causes of cancer."But there's also a lot we can do as individuals to lower our chances of developing the disease such as being more physically active and adopting a healthier diet."</body>

      <title>Osborne agrees to China nuclear deal</title>
      <description>The Chancellor, George Osborne, announces that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.</description>

      <body>The Chancellor, George Osborne, has announced that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.The announcement also said that Chinese firms might eventually be allowed to take majority stakes in British nuclear plants.Mr Osborne made the announcement on the last day of a trade visit to China.The first China deal could be as early as next week, with the go ahead for a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site.Also on Thursday, a report commissioned for the prime minister warned of a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years.The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits".Supply is expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15.Most existing coal-fired plants are expected to be closed in 2015 to meet European Union pollution directives, while many gas-fired power plants are not being used at the moment because gas is so expensive.These would take time and money to bring back on stream.The Hinkley C project, in Somerset, will be the first new nuclear power station since 1995.Hinkley C's construction will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EDF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs.EDF has been negotiating with three Chinese nuclear giants on the Hinkley C project - CGN, CNNC and SNPTC - all of which have been seen by the chancellor this week.Our business editor, Robert Peston, says he has been told that one or two of these will end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C.A DECC spokesperson said talks about a contract were underway: "Negotiations remain ongoing between the government and EDF on the potential terms of an investment contract for Hinkley Point C. No agreement has as yet been reached."A contract will only be offered if it is value for money, fair and affordable, in line with government policy on no public subsidy for new nuclear and consistent with state-aid rules."Mr Osborne made the announcement while on a visit to a nuclear plant in southern China on Thursday which is itself a collaboration between EDF and the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG).He said: "Today is another demonstration of the next big step in the relationship between Britain and China, the world's oldest civil nuclear power and the world's fastest growing civil nuclear power."The memorandum of understanding also includes roles for British companies in China's nuclear programme.China has 17 nuclear reactors in operation, which provide about 1% of its electricity production capacity.In the future, Chinese firms might be allowed more than just minority stakes in UK plants. The government said that "over time, stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes".At the weekend, the Energy Minister, Ed Davey, said he believed that a "massive" wave of investment from China, Japan and Korea would secure UK's power supply into the future.Securing future energy supplies is a major challenge.A portion of energy bills is being diverted to alternative energy investment in wind farms and solar energy.But these, renewable, energy sources cannot provide enough power for the country's energy needs.The industry regulator, Ofgem, has also warned of the "unprecedented challenge" to secure power supplies.It said spare electricity power production capacity could fall to 2% by 2015, increasing the risk of blackouts.</body>

      <description>A clawed spider-like creature reveals the most intact nervous system ever observed in an ancient fossil, 520 million years old.</description>

      <body>Scientists have discovered the best-preserved nervous system in an ancient fossil.Dating back 520 million years, the clawed spider-like fossil shows clear evidence of a brain and of nerve cords running through the creature's trunk.The specimen now confirms that the ancestors of spiders and scorpions were related, but branched off more than half-a-billion years ago.A team of international scientists present their work in Nature.The "great appendage" arthropods, are an extinct group of joint-legged creatures with large claw-like appendages - or growths - protruding from their heads.The nervous system tends to be similar between major groups of animals, which helps palaeontologists work out how they are related, explained Greg Edgecombe from the Natural History Museum in London."The nervous system is one of the more reliable tool-kits we have. We were trying to investigate whether there was evidence for the preservation of neural tissues from very early parts of the animal fossil record," he told BBC News."What we've been working with is fossils with very fine anatomical preservation from the Cambrian period. These have given us information about brains, the nerve cords and the neural tissue that goes into the eyes."New to science, the fossil was recently discovered in South China and is part of the genus Alalcomenaeus. This group had segmented bodies equipped with about a dozen pairs of appendages which enabled the creatures to swim or crawl.It was placed in a CT scanner and compared with other arthropods in order to understand its evolution. The team then used 3D software to see structures not visible on the surface of the fossil."People like myself who are mad keen on creepy crawlies want to understand how very strange early arthropods relate to living ones," added Dr Edgecombe."By having access to the nervous system it allows us to study the evolutionary relationships of very ancient fossils using the same kind of information that we would use for living animals."Co-author, Xiaoya Ma, also from the Natural History Museum, said: "It is very exciting to use new techniques to successfully reveal such a complete central nervous system from a 520-million-year old fossil, and in such detail."She told the BBC's Science in Action programme that the high resolution of the reconstructed image allowed the team to see "the concentrated neural structures in the head region". They could also observe the segments of the brain associated with the claw-like appendages.The fossil belongs to an extinct group of marine arthropods known as megacheirans, Greek for "large claws".To infer the evolutionary relationships between species, the fields of palaeontology and neuroanatomy together.Nicholas Strausfeld was from the anatomy side of the team at the University of Arizona, US."We now know that the megacheirans had central nervous systems very similar to today's horseshoe crabs and scorpions," said Prof Strausfeld."This means the ancestors of spiders and their kin lived side by side with the ancestors of crustaceans in the Lower Cambrian."He added that their prominent appendages were clearly used for grasping and holding."Based on their location, we can now say that the biting mouthparts in spiders and their relatives evolved from these appendages."The team says they expect to find more fossils dating even further back, which will shed new light onto the ancestors of many of today's arthropods.</body>

      <title>Push for 'smaller' Antarctic reserve</title>
      <description>The EU and US lead a new call for the creation of a scaled down marine protection zone in the Southern Ocean.</description>

      <body>A bloc of countries has issued a joint call for the creation of marine reserves in Antarctica.The group, which includes the US, EU, France, New Zealand and Australia, saw their initial plans thrown out by opposition from Russia earlier this year.But the new plan suggests significant scaling down of one reserve in the hope of securing agreement.It will be submitted to a meeting in Tasmania next week.The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), made up of 25 members with interests in the Southern Ocean, has been working since 2005 to establish marine protected areas (MPAs) in the region.At a special meeting in July, plans to establish two giant reserves in the Ross Sea and in east Antarctica were tabled by a number of countries.The Ross Sea proposal, supported by the US and New Zealand, would have banned commercial fishing in an area of 1.6m sq km.The other reserve, supported by France, Australia and the EU aimed to protect 1.9m sq km on the Pacific side of Antarctica.But Russia and the Ukraine questioned the legal basis of the plan that would have more than doubled the size of the world's marine reserves at a stroke.Other countries, including Norway, China and Japan queried the science and the size of the proposed reserves and wanted the inclusion of a "sunset clause", which meant the decision could be reviewed in the future.As CCAMLR operates on a consensus basis, the nations in favour of the plans were forced to withdraw.Now ahead of the Commission's annual meeting in Hobart, the proponents of the reserves have issued revised plans and a call for their adoption.Last month New Zealand and the US published details of a new Ross Sea plan. It cut the size of the reserve by 40% and left a question over the permanence of the arrangement.While the proposal for east Antarctica was also revised, it remains essentially the same in terms of the area covered."The original bigger Ross Sea plan is now off the table," Paulus Tak from the Pew Charitable Trust told BBC News."It is now for a smaller area than was originally proposed. They are making the concessions to get the opponents onboard."Whether that will be a useful move for Russia and the Ukraine who put forward legal objections, remains to be seen."In today's statement, the foreign ministers call on all members of the Commission to support the plans, saying that these regions are "widely recognised for their remarkable ecological and scientific importance".They argue that the proposals before the Commission are based on "sound and best available science and will provide a unique laboratory for marine research, and will have profound and lasting benefits for ocean conservation."However environmental campaigners like Paulus Tak are concerned that the proponents of the MPAs will make further concessions during the meeting."We call upon the states to maintain the ambition level, and as such each downgrading of the proposal is a matter of some concern from our side, but we want to see a successful outcome of these negotiations."Another issue that could hold up the MPA proposal is the US government shutdown, which could prevent the American delegation from attending.If that happens, the discussion on protecting the Antarctic could be held off for another year.Follow Matt on Twitter.</body>

      <title>Meteorite pulled from Russian lake</title>

      <body>Divers working at a Russian lake have recovered a half-tonne chunk of the space rock that exploded over Chelyabinsk earlier this year.The object plunged into Lake Chebarkul in central Russia on 15 February, leaving a 6m-wide hole in the ice.Scientists say that it is the largest fragment of the meteorite yet found.More than 1,000 people were injured when a 17m, 10,000-tonne space rock burned up over Central Russia, breaking windows and rocking buildings.Live footage showed a team pull out a 1.5-metre-long (five-foot-long) rock from the lake after first wrapping it in a special covering and placing it on a metal sheet while it was still underwater.The rock broke into three parts as it was pulled from the depths.Once ashore, it was placed on top of a scale for weighing.However, the scale broke as it hit the 570kg (1,255lb) mark.Dr Caroline Smith, curator of meteorites at London's Natural History Museum, confirmed that the object was a meteorite from characteristic features known as fusion crust and regmaglypts, which are obvious in images.She told BBC News: "Fusion crust forms as the meteoroid is travelling through the atmosphere as a fireball."The outer surface gets so hot it melts the rock to form a dark, glassy surface crust which we term a fusion crust. Regmaglypts are the indentations, that look a bit like thumbprints, also seen on the surface of the meteorite."Sergey Zamozdra, an associate professor at Chelyabinsk State University, told the Interfax news agency: "The preliminary examination... shows that this is really a fraction of the Chelyabinsk meteorite."This chunk is most probably one of the top 10 biggest meteorite fragments ever found."The divers' mission had been hampered by a number of factors. The rock fragment lay at 13m depth, not 6m or 8m as was originally thought.The Vesti 24 rolling news channel reported that divers had already recovered more than 12 pieces from Lake Chebarkul since the incident on 15 February.The station said that only four or five of them had turned out to be real meteorites.</body>

      <title>Few children 'connected to nature'</title>
      <description>Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a three-year study from the RSPB suggests.</description>

      <body>Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a study from the RSPB suggests.The three-year project found that only 21% of children aged 8-12 were "connected to nature".Girls were much more likely than boys to be exposed to the great outdoors, while children in Wales had the lowest score across the UK.The RSPB says that a perception among some adults that nature is dangerous or dirty could be holding children back.There has been an increasing amount of research in recent years underlining the lack of contact and experience with nature among modern children.Some have argued that this is having a negative impact on their health, education and behaviour.In 2012, the National Trust published a report on the phenomenon of "nature deficit disorder", though it is not recognised as a medical condition.The RSPB says its new study is the first to quantify the scale of British children's exposure, or lack of it, to the natural world.They came up with a definition of what "connected to nature" actually means and then developed a questionnaire with 16 statements designed to assess the level of connection among children.Some 1,200 children from across the UK were asked to agree or disagree with these statements. Only 21% of children in the UK had a level of connection with wildlife and the natural world that the RSPB believes should be realistic and achievable for all youngsters.This "realistic and achievable" value is based on the average scores of children visiting RSPB sites or who are junior members of the organisation.One interesting finding was the gender difference. While 27% of girls were at or above the "realistic and achievable" target, only 16% of boys were at the same level."We need to understand these differences," Sue Armstrong-Brown, head of conservation at the charity, told BBC News."Whether boys and girls are scoring differently on different questions, are girls more empathetic to nature than boys for instance? We need to analyse the data to find that out."The report also highlighted significant regional differences. Only 13% of children in Wales achieved the basic level of exposure, compared with almost twice this number in Northern Ireland and Scotland.The average score for London was higher than the rest of England. Overall urban children had a slightly higher connection than those living in rural areas.According to Sue Armstrong-Brown, the attitudes of adults may be having a significant effect on children."There is definitely an attitude out there, in some cases, that nature is not perceived as interesting or engaging. In some cases it is perceived as a dirty or unsafe thing, and that's an attitude that won't help a young person climb a tree."The RSPB hopes that its study will be taken up by government as one of the indicators on the state of children's wellbeing.Sue Armstrong-Brown believes that improving the natural connection for children is not only good for the youngsters, it is crucial for the future of nature conservation in this country."If we can grow a generation of children that have a connection to nature and do feel a sense of oneness with it, we then have the force for the future that can save nature and stop us living in a world where nature is declining," she said.Follow Matt on Twitter.</body>

      <title>Extreme weather 'keeps people poor'</title>
      <description>A new study says that extreme weather scenarios can counter efforts to reduce poverty for hundreds of millions of people.</description>

      <body>New research suggests that extreme weather events will keep people poor in many parts of the world.The authors argue that where disasters like drought are prevalent, they can be the most important cause of poverty.They say that up to 325 million people will be living in countries highly exposed to natural hazards by 2030.If aid is not used to reduce these risks, the progress made in fighting poverty could disappear.The report has been compiled by the Overseas Development Institute.It examines the relationship between disasters and poverty over the next 20 years, using population projections, climate models and estimations of how governments can cope with extreme events.The report suggests that up to a third of a billion people could be living in the 49 countries most exposed to the full range of natural hazards and climate extremes in 2030.In sub-Saharan Africa 118 million people in poverty will face extreme events.The big weather issues that will face most poor people are drought, extreme rainfall and flooding.An analysis of the data from rural Ethiopia and Andhra Pradesh in India suggests that where there is a strong risk of drought, then drought is also the single most important factor in keeping people poor, outstripping ill health or dowry payments."We've often heard that ill health is the biggest cause for impoverishment," said Dr Tom Mitchell, the ODI's head of climate change."But in the data, in drought prone areas, the biggest cause is the drought - in areas exposed to these hazards, they are the key causes of impoverishment."Developed countries haven't recognised the role that these extreme weather events have in keeping people poor, he says.The big problem is that, at present, money tends to flow in response to disasters, not to prevent them.Dr Mitchell says the recent Cyclone Phailin in India is a good example."The very fact that it killed so few people means that the chances of raising big finance for recovery efforts are going to be pretty slim. It has not got the big numbers attached to it," he said."I think there's a direct link between the ability to raise finance and the number of people killed. It's a perverse incentive."Part of the problem is that donor countries are not prioritising aid at the countries that need it most, in terms of disaster risk reduction."We've tended to provide much more financial support to a set of middle income countries, who can manage it better like the Philippines, Mexico and Indonesia who made really great strides in protecting their populations," said Dr Mitchell."What we've not done is focus on the poorest countries, the ones most exposed to issues like drought, for example, sub Saharan Africa, we've almost missed it off."The authors of the report argue that the way that vulnerable countries spend their money needs reforming too. Too often the money is spent on the capital city or on infrastructure and not on the poorest people.The report calls for the post-2015 development goals to include targets on disasters and climate change, to recognise the threat they pose to eradicating poverty by 2030."If the international community are serious about ending extreme poverty they need to get serious about reducing disaster risk for the poorest people," said Dr Mitchell."At the moment that's not happening, so the chance of ending extreme poverty is pie in the sky, it is just not going to work."Follow Matt on Twitter.</body>

      <title>3D printing 'entering the metal age'</title>
      <description>The European Space Agency has unveiled plans to "take 3D printing into the metal age" by building parts for jets, spacecraft and fusion reactors.</description>

      <body>The European Space Agency has unveiled plans to "take 3D printing into the metal age" by building parts for jets, spacecraft and fusion projects.The Amaze project brings together 28 institutions to develop new metal components which are lighter, stronger and cheaper than conventional parts.Additive manufacturing (or "3D printing") has already revolutionised the design of plastic products.Printing metal parts for rockets and planes would cut waste and save money.The layered method of assembly also allows intricate designs - geometries which are impossible to achieve with conventional metal casting.Parts for cars and satellites can be optimised to be lighter and - simultaneously - incredibly robust.Tungsten alloy components that can withstand temperatures of 3,000C were unveiled at Amaze's launch on Tuesday at London's Science Museum.At such extreme temperatures they can survive inside nuclear fusion reactors and on the nozzles of rockets."We want to build the best quality metal products ever made. Objects you can't possibly manufacture any other way," said David Jarvis, Esa's head of new materials and energy research."To build a [fusion reactor], like Iter, you somehow have to take the heat of the Sun and put it in a metal box."3,000C is as hot as you can imagine for engineering."If we can get 3D metal printing to work, we are well on the way to commercial nuclear fusion."Additive manufacturing with metal is not new; General Electric, for example, has used the technique to make fuel injectors for one of its aircraft engines. China claims to be using 3D printing to manufacture load-bearing components in aircraft.And in July, Nasa announced that it had successfully tested a 3D-printed rocket engine part.Amaze is a loose acronym for Additive Manufacturing Aiming Towards Zero Waste and Efficient Production of High-Tech Metal Products.The 20m-euro project brings together 28 partners from European industry and academia - including Airbus, Astrium, Norsk Titanium, Cranfield University, EADS, and the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy.Factory sites are being set up in France, Germany, Italy, Norway and the UK to develop the industrial supply chain.Amaze researchers have already begun printing metal jet engine parts and aeroplane wing sections up to 2m in size.These high-strength components are typically built from expensive, exotic metals such as titanium, tantalum and vanadium.Using traditional techniques to fashion metal objects often wastes precious raw material.Whereas additive manufacturing - building parts up layer-on-layer from 3D digital data - has the potential to produce almost "zero waste"."To produce one kilo of metal, you use one kilo of metal - not 20 kilos," says Esa's Franco Ongaro."We need to clean up our act - the space industry needs to be more green. And this technique will help us."Printing objects as a single piece - without welding or bolting - can make them both stronger and lighter.A weight reduction of even 1kg for a long-range aircraft will save hundreds of thousands of dollars over its lifespan."Our ultimate aim is to print a satellite in a single piece. One chunk of metal, that doesn't need to be welded or bolted," said Jarvis."To do that would save 50% of the costs - millions of euros."But Jarvis is candid about the problems and inefficiencies that still need to be overcome - what he calls the "dirty secrets" of 3D printing."One common problem is porosity - small air bubbles in the product. Rough surface finishing is an issue too," he said."We need to understand these defects and eliminate them - if we want to achieve industrial quality."And we need to make the process repeatable - scale it up."We can't do all this unless we collaborate between industries - space, fusion, aeronautics."We need all these teams working together and sharing."</body>

      <body>Prof Peter Higgs, the joint winner of this year's Nobel Prize for Physics, has promised to retire - once he turns 85.In a BBC Scotland interview, he also revealed that he turned down the offer of a knighthood because he did not want "that sort of title".Prof Higgs said he feels uncomfortable being likened to other Nobel winners.The 84-year-old said this was because his work on the particle which carries his name only took a very short time.He said: "I'm getting the prize for something which took me two or three weeks in 1964. It's a very small amount of my life."If you take Einstein for the example, his achievements were several orders of magnitude greater."Prof Higgs was born in Newcastle, but developed his theory while working at the University of Edinburgh.His landmark research defined what was to become known as the Higgs boson.Discovering the particle became one of the most sought-after goals in science, and the team of scientists from the European nuclear research facility Cern, who were behind the $10bn Large Hadron Collider (LHC), made proving its existence a key priority.In July 2012, physicists at Cern confirmed the discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson.Prof Higgs said he was offered a knighthood in 1999 by Prime Minister Tony Blair but refused the honour."I thought anything of that sort was premature," he explained, "and anyway, I didn't want that sort of title thank you.""As you know I've recently become a Companion of Honour but that's rather discreet. It's a couple of letters after your name."The physicist retired from full-time teaching 17 years ago but has remained active in sharing his knowledge with other scientists.He now intends to retire "properly" after his 85th birthday."I'm proposing to retire at the age of 85, next year," he confirmed."But flying around the world giving lectures is a fairly recent phenomenon because of the build up to this discovery at Cern."</body>

      <description>Some pollutants continue to pose a "significant threat" to European citizens' health and the environment, says a report by the European Environment Agency.</description>

      <body>Air pollution is continuing to damage European citizens' health and the environment, latest figures show.The European Environment Agency (EEA) listed tiny airborne particles and ozone as posing a "significant threat".However, the authors said nations had significantly cut emissions of a number of pollutants, including sulphur dioxide, lead and carbon monoxide.In a separate study, research identified a link between low birth-weight and exposure to air pollution.EEA executive director Hans Bruyninckx said that EU nations had made considerable progress over recent decades to reduce the visible signs of air pollution, with cities now no longer shrouded in blankets of smog.However, he added: "Air pollution is causing damage to human health and ecosystems. Large parts of the population do not live in a healthy environment, according to current standards."To get on to a sustainable path, Europe will have to be ambitious and go beyond current legislation."The EEA report showed that data suggested that up to 96% of the EU's urban population was exposed to fine particulate matter concentrations above UN World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.Even more, 98%, were subject to ground-level ozone concentrations above WHO recommended levels.As well has urban outdoor air quality, the report also highlighted that the natural environment was also continuing to suffer.It said ecosystem were subject to the pressure of air pollution impairing vegetation growth and harming biodiversity."The EEA also produced country-by-country breakdown of air quality data.Responding to the report's findings, Environment Commissioner Janez Potocnik said: "Air quality is a central concern for many people."Surveys show that a large majority of citizens understand well the impact of air quality on health and are asking public authorities to take action at EU, national and local levels."He added that he was willing to address those concerns in the Commission's Air Policy Review.Infant concernsA separate study, also published on Tuesday, concluded that a substantial proportion of the cases of low birth-weight (less than 2.5kg at 37 weeks of gestation) "could be prevented in Europe if urban air pollution was reduced".The findings, published in the The Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal, said: "The population attributable risk estimated for a reduction in [particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less] concentration to 10 micrograms per cubic metre during pregnancy corresponded to a decrease of 22% in cases of low birth-weight at term."A team of European researchers carried out what they describe as one of the largest studies of its kind, collating data from more than 74,000 births between 1994 and 2011 across 12 European nations.They explained that babies with low birth-weights were at greater risk of mortality and health problems than infants with higher birth-weights."Low birth-weight has been associated with wheezing and asthma in childhood, and with decreased lung function in adults," they observed but added that there was inconsistency in the findings."In addition to active and passive smoking, atmospheric pollution exposure is a highly prevalent and controllable risk factor for low birth-weight."Lead author Dr Marie Pedersen from the Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology in Barcelona, Spain, observed: "The widespread exposure of pregnant women worldwide to urban ambient air pollution at similar or even higher concentrations than those assessed in our study provides a clear message to policymakers to improve the quality of the air we all share."Current EU legislation has sent the annual mean limit on fine particulate matter at 20 micrograms per cubic metre for particles measuring 2.5 microns (PM2.5) or less.This is twice the concentration outlined in World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, which recommends an annual mean limit for PM2.5 exposure to 10 micrograms per cubic metre.These microscopic particles (the diameter of a human hair ranges between 15 and 180 microns) end up in the atmosphere from a range of sources, including road transport emissions, and have been linked to heart and lung disease, cancer and premature death.Prof Bruyninckx described the Lancet paper's findings as "very concerning", adding that despite progress being made in some areas, more action was needed to tackle air pollution."It is the explicit goal of the European Commission to narrow that gap, and in the long run, close that gap because we are... concerned about citizens' health," he told BBC News.But he explained: "Before you make binding legislation, you want to be on absolutely solid ground scientifically."Now, we know that [particulate matter] is having a significant impact so we need to adjust our rules and regulations accordingly."Commenting on the findings published in The Lancet, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists spokesman Dr Patrick O'Brien said the research was "very helpful in providing further evidence on the potential health impacts of air pollution".But he added: "Exposure to some level of air pollution is unavoidable in day-to-day life and the risk still remains fairly low."Other factors, such as smoking, high blood pressure or excessive alcohol consumption, may contribute more to the risk of having a low birth weight baby."</body>

      <description>Germany persuades the EU to delay introducing new limits on CO2 emissions from cars - and angers environmentalists.</description>

      <body>The German government has persuaded its EU partners to delay introducing new limits on CO2 emissions from cars.Environment ministers agreed to revise a deal, reached in July, that set a limit of 95g per km for the average car. That target for CO2 emissions was to take effect in 2020.But Germany, famous for its high-performance cars, says the 95g limit should not take full effect until 2024.Green activists deplored the new delay as a "shameful sop" to polluters.A leading German Green Party MEP, Rebecca Harms, accused Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel of "riding roughshod" over the EU's democratic process, because the 2020 agreement had already been reached between the European Parliament and the Council - the EU ministerial grouping."Weakening the agreed 2020 limits, which have long been known, is a shameful sop to German car manufacturers and will slow the development of new technologies to deliver more efficient and less polluting cars," Ms Harms said after the ministers' vote.Chancellor Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) are holding talks with the Greens on Tuesday on the possibilities of forming a coalition government. But many analysts believe a "grand" coalition between the CDU and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) is more likely to emerge.The UK was among the countries that supported the German environment minister's position on Monday, German ARD news reports.The German minister, Peter Altmaier, said "it's not a fight over principles but how we bind the necessary clarity in climate protection with the required flexibility and competitiveness to protect the car industry in Europe".Correspondents say there has been intense lobbying by luxury carmakers such as BMW and Daimler, maker of Mercedes, over the EU legislation.The emissions limits are part of the EU's drive to switch Europe to a low-carbon economy and slow the impact of climate change. There is also widespread concern about other pollutants from car exhausts.In a new report, the European Environment Agency (EEA) says more than 90% of European city dwellers are exposed to the most harmful particles in air pollution - PM and O3. Often the particles are transported for long distances across borders, it says.Under the German proposal, the 95g target for CO2 would be phased in - it would apply to 80% of cars by 2020, and then to all by 2024.The ministers' backing for Germany means a revised plan will now be negotiated with MEPs and the European Commission, and a deal may not be reached until after the May 2014 European elections.EU Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard said she was disappointed and rejected the German proposal, Reuters news agency reported.Critics say the delay will undermine investment in greener alternatives, like electric cars and more fuel-efficient engines.</body>

      <body>Scientists say they are more certain than ever about the impact of global warming on a critical weather pattern.The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) occurs in the Pacific Ocean but plays an important part in the world's climate system.Researchers have until now been unsure as to how rising temperatures would affect ENSO in the future.But this new study suggests that droughts and floods driven by ENSO will be more intense.The ENSO phenomenon plays a complicated role in the global weather system.The El Nino part of the equation sees a warming of the eastern and tropical Pacific, while its cooler sister, La Nina, makes things chillier in these same regions.Like water in a bathtub, the warmer or cooler waters slosh back and forth across the Pacific Ocean. They are responsible for rainfall patterns across Australia and the equatorial region, but their effects are also felt much further away.During the Northern Hemisphere winter, for example, you can get more intense rainfall over the southern part of the US in a warmer El Nino phase.For years, scientists have been concerned about how this sensitive weather system might be changed by rising temperatures from global warming.Now, in this new paper, published in the journal Nature, researchers give their most "robust" projections yet.Using the latest generation of climate models, they found a consistent projection for the future of ENSO.According to the lead author, Dr Scott Power from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, global warming interferes with the way El Nino temperature patterns affect rainfall."This interference causes an intensification of El Nino-driven drying in the western Pacific and rainfall increases in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific," he said.According to Dr Wenju Cai, a scientist at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), who was not involved with the study, the paper is "significant"."Up until now, there has been a lack of agreement among computer models as to how ENSO will change in the future," he explained."This paper is significant in that there is stronger agreement among different climate models in predicting the future impact."This study finds that both wet and dry anomalies will be greater in future El Nino years. This means that ENSO-induced droughts and floods will be more intense in the future."Follow Matt on Twitter.</body>

      <title>Bee-friendly plants put to the test</title>
      <description>An experimental garden has revealed that the right plants can attract up to 100 times more pollinators, say scientists.</description>

      <body>Researchers have used an experimental garden to put pollinator-friendly plants to the test.The University of Sussex scientists counted the number of insects visiting the plants in their garden.They say their findings show that insect-friendly plants are just as pretty, cheap and easy to grow as less pollinator-friendly varieties.Their results are published in the Journal of Functional Ecology.PhD student Mihail Garbuzov used 32 different varieties of popular garden plants. These included some nectar-rich and highly scented plants he thought would be attractive to insects and some that seemed to be less attractive.While the small-scale study did not produce an exhaustive list of the best plants for pollinating insects, the team says the data has put a number on just how many more pollinators the right plants can attract.Mr Garbuzov told the BBC: "Some of the best plants attracted approximately 100 times as many insects as the worst."And the plants that are attractive to insects are not more expensive, and they're just as pretty."The researchers wrote in their paper that there was "great scope for making gardens and parks more insect friendly" by selecting the right plants.Tips for insect-friendly gardening are already available from a variety of sources, but the researchers say they are largely based on "opinion and general experience".The aim of this study, said Prof Francis Ratnieks, from the University of Sussex, was to "put that advice on a firmer scientific footing, by gathering information about the actual number of insects visiting the flowers to collect nectar or pollen".The researchers gathered their data simply by visiting each of the patches of flowers every day over two summers and counting the number of insects on the flowers.Their results did lead them to make some horticultural recommendations - they found that borage, lavender, marjoram and open-flower dahlias varieties were very good for insects.The colourfully named bowles mauve everlasting wallflower was also very attractive to pollinators, while the least attractive flowering plant for insects was the very popular geranium.Marjoram, the researchers say, was probably the best "all-rounder", attracting honey bees, bumble bees, other bees, hover flies, and butterflies.Borage was the best for honey bees and lavender and open-flowered dahlias were most attractive to bumblebees.The team put a number of varieties of lavender to the test and found that highly bred hybrids, including some with novel colours - such as white or pink - that have been carefully bred into the plants proved the most attractive to insects.Dr Nigel Raine, from Royal Holloway University of London, commented that with bee populations declining across the world, "we can all give bees a helping hand by planting the right flowers to give them the nectar and pollen they need"."This study highlights that it's important for bee-friendly gardeners to choose what you plant with care," he added."Gardeners and town planners should think carefully about the mixture of flowers they plant to ensure food is available for a wide range of bees and other important insect pollinators."It's also important to cater for the needs of the rarer species and provide food at times when there might be fewer wild flowers in bloom."</body>

      <body>Elephants have a mysterious and "tangible energy" according to South African photographer Greg Du Toit.Now after a 10 year quest, his portrayal of this "energy" has been captured in an award-winning photo.Titled "Essence of Elephants", the work has earned him the overall title in this year's Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition.Preparation and passion, he says, were key to achieving the winning shot, taken from just over one metre away."There was one particular day when a baby elephant raced past right in front of my camera and I was ready. I had to be prepared for that moment," said Mr Du Toit.He took the picture at a waterhole in Botswana's Northern Tuli Game Reserve from a hide (a sunken freight container) that provided a ground-level view. He had been going to the area five or six times a year for 10 years."I chose elephants because I feel a very special energy and connection when I'm around them," he told BBC News."But although you feel that energy it's very difficult to translate that into a camera because an elephant is such a big animal and they're not very charismatic, whereas a predator is far more charismatic."Using a very slow shutter speed on a wide angle lens "allowed all that energy to come into my camera" making him able to depict "these gentle giants in an almost ghostly way".To achieve the cool blue hue he attached a polarising filter and set his white balance to a cool temperature.The Wildlife Photographer of the Year (WPY) "means a lot to me for various reasons", said Du Toit, especially because photos were submitted anonymously, putting professionals and amateurs on an equal footing."In my mind it's one of the last places in the world you can actually look at a wildlife photo and trust that the moment is authentic."Chair of the judging panel Jim Brandenburg said: "Greg's image immediately catapults us to African plains. This image stood out for both its technical excellence and the unique moment it captures - it is truly a once in a lifetime shot."This year's Young Wildlife Photographer of the year is 14-year-old Udayan Rao Pawar from India.His photo was of a fresh water crocodile with hatchlings on its head "kind of resembling a crown", explained Mr Pawar.He crept up on the nestling colony of gharials on the banks of the Chambal River,"When the dawn broke early in the morning I hid myself behind a rock, and when the morning light came I took those images."I could hear them making little grunting sounds. Very soon a large female surfaced near the shore, checking on her charges. Some of the hatchlings swam to her and climbed onto her head. Perhaps it made them feel safe."Despite conservation efforts, the gharial fresh water crocodile is on the verge of extinction with an estimated 200 mating pairs remaining."The Chambal River is the gharial's last stronghold but is threatened by illegal sand-mining and fishing", added Udayan.Wildlife photographer and Judge Tui De Roy said the composition and timing of the photograph was perfect."The mother's gaze seems directed at you, appealing to you to let her live and thrive in peace. This image is beautiful and thought provoking, but at the same time also wonderfully playful, making it a clear winner," he said.WPY is one of the most prestigious competitions in world photography. Organised by London's Natural History Museum and BBC Wildlife Magazine, it is now in its 49th year.Images are submitted anonymously by professional and amateur photographers alike. They are selected for their creativity, artistry and technical complexity and must be submitted as a raw file with no manipulations.The winners beat 43,000 entries submitted from 96 countries.

      <title>Apes comfort each other 'like humans'</title>
      <description>Observations of young bonobos reveal that, like children, those more able to manage their own emotions are more likely to comfort others.</description>

      <body>Young bonobos that are more "socially competent" are more likely to cuddle and calm other apes that are in distress, research has revealed.Scientists working at an African sanctuary found that bonobos that recovered quickly from an upsetting experience, such as a fight, were also more likely to comfort others.This mirrors findings from studies in children, and suggests bonobos manage their emotions in a very similar way.The work is published in PNAS journal.The researchers captured footage showing "emotionally competent" young apes rushing to hug other juveniles that were screaming after being attacked.Bonobos are already known as the "empathic apes". Previous studies have documented their responses to others' emotions.Prof Frans de Waal from Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University in Atlanta, said these new results revealed that their ability to console one another was part of this empathy.He added: "It's almost as if one first needs to have one's own emotional house in order before one is ready to visit the emotional house of another."This is true for children, and apparently also for bonobos."Prof de Waal's colleague and the lead researcher who gathered footage of these ape interactions was Dr Zanna Clay, also from Emory University.She explained that the sanctuary, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, provided a natural setting to study emotional behaviour, because the rescued orphan bonobos there behaved very differently from the apes that had been raised by their mothers.The Olola ya Bonoboo sanctuary is home to many bonobo victims of bushmeat hunting; apes that were taken from their mothers at an early age by hunters.These youngsters are cared for by humans and, after several years of this rehabilitation, they are transferred into a forested enclosure to join a group of bonobos.Watching the bonobos, Dr Clay found that rehabilitated orphans had much more difficulty managing their emotions.After a fight, Dr Clay explained, these orphan apes "would be very upset, screaming for minutes"."Mother-reared juveniles would recover and snap out of it in seconds," she added.The findings, the researchers say, indicate that "the way we develop our social and emotional skills and how we deal with the emotional world around us may be shared with that of our closest ape relatives".Richard Byrne is professor of evolutionary psychology at the University of St Andrews.He pointed out that the term "consolation" implies that we know about the emotion of the apes and their reasons for intervening, which, he said, "is not part of the observed data"."But they are our closest relatives, so personally I would argue that the best guess of their emotions is that they'd be the same as our own in a similar situation."</body>

      <title>'Diamond rain' on Saturn and Jupiter</title>
      <description>Diamonds as big as jewels fall as "rain" on Saturn and Jupiter, seeded by giant lightning storms, according to new calculations by US scientists.</description>

      <body>Diamonds big enough to be worn by Hollywood film stars could be raining down on Saturn and Jupiter, US scientists have calculated.New atmospheric data for the gas giants indicates that carbon is abundant in its dazzling crystal form, they say.Lightning storms turn methane into soot (carbon) which as it falls hardens into chunks of graphite and then diamond.These diamond "hail stones" eventually melt into a liquid sea in the planets' hot cores, they told a conference.The biggest diamonds would likely be about a centimetre in diameter - "big enough to put on a ring, although of course they would be uncut," says Dr Kevin Baines, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.He added they would be of a size that the late film actress Elizabeth Taylor would have been "proud to wear"."The bottom line is that 1,000 tonnes of diamonds a year are being created on Saturn."People ask me - how can you really tell? Because there's no way you can go and observe it."It all boils down to the chemistry. And we think we're pretty certain."Baines presented his unpublished findings at the annual meeting of the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society in Denver, Colorado, alongside his co-author Mona Delitsky, from California Speciality Engineering.Uranus and Neptune have long been thought to harbour gemstones. But Saturn and Jupiter were not thought to have suitable atmospheres.Baines and Delitsky analysed the latest temperature and pressure predictions for the planets' interiors, as well as new data on how carbon behaves in different conditions.They concluded that stable crystals of diamond will "hail down over a huge region" of Saturn in particular."It all begins in the upper atmosphere, in the thunderstorm alleys, where lightning turns methane into soot," said Baines."As the soot falls, the pressure on it increases. And after about 1,000 miles it turns to graphite - the sheet-like form of carbon you find in pencils."By a depth of 6,000km, these chunks of falling graphite toughen into diamonds - strong and unreactive.These continue to fall for another 30,000km - "about two-and-a-half Earth-spans" says Baines."Once you get down to those extreme depths, the pressure and temperature is so hellish, there's no way the diamonds could remain solid."It's very uncertain what happens to carbon down there."One possibility is that a "sea" of liquid carbon could form."Diamonds aren't forever on Saturn and Jupiter. But they are on Uranus and Neptune, which are colder at their cores," says Baines.The findings are yet to be peer reviewed, but other planetary experts contacted by BBC News said the possibility of diamond rain "cannot be dismissed"."The idea that there is a depth range within the atmospheres of Jupiter and (even more so) Saturn within which carbon would be stable as diamond does seem sensible," says Prof Raymond Jeanloz, one of the team who first predicted diamonds on Uranus and Neptune."And given the large sizes of these planets, the amount of carbon (therefore diamond) that may be present is hardly negligible."However Dr Nadine Nettelmann, of the University of California, Santa Cruz, said further work was needed to understand whether carbon can form diamonds in an atmosphere which is rich in hydrogen and helium - such as Saturn's."Baines and Delitsky considered the data for pure carbon, instead of a carbon-hydrogen-helium mixture," she explained."We cannot exclude the proposed scenario (diamond rain on Saturn and Jupiter) but we simply have no data on mixtures in the planets. So we do not know if diamond formation occurs at all."Meanwhile, an exoplanet that was believed to consist largely of diamond may not be so precious after all, according to new research.The so-called "diamond planet" 55 Cancri e orbits a star 40 light-years from our Solar System.A study in 2010 suggested it was a rocky world with a surface of graphite surrounding a thick layer of diamond, instead of water and granite like Earth.But new research to be published in the Astrophysical Journal, calls this conclusion in question, making it unlikely any space probe sent to sample the planet's innards would dig up anything sparkling.Carbon, the element diamonds are made of, now appears to be less abundant in relation to oxygen in the planet's host star - and by extension, perhaps the planet."Based on what we know at this point, 55 Cancri e is more of a 'diamond in the rough'," said author Johanna Teske, of the University of Arizona.</body>

      <body>Scientists are asking for the public's help to track the spread of a greedy slug species threatening to eat its way through British gardens and crops.The Spanish slug was first reported in the UK in January by Dr Ian Bedford, head of entomology at the John Innes Centre, Norwich.It can survive many slug pellets, eats crops spared by native species and tolerate drier conditions.A red-brown colour, pale or rich, can identify a suspected Spanish slug.Scientists fear it could breed with our native species to form a hybrid.The Iberian invader, Arion vulgaris, can reproduce in greater numbers and has unappealing habits, including eating dead animals and excrement.During the winter, many disappeared underground or died but their eggs survived and the species may have returned in greater numbers.Scientists are asking people to look for the slugs under logs and plant pots in their gardens, and record and photograph their findings using a dedicated SlugWatch website."We want photos and sightings from members of the public to help build a picture of how widespread the Spanish slug has become," said Dr Bedford."The reports may also give us an idea of whether it is breeding with our native species to form a hybrid combining the worst of the Spanish slug with tolerance to frosts and cold from our own species."Keith Norman, technical director of farming company Velcourt, said farmers were using up their entire allowance of slug pellets early in the season, leaving no other means of control."It is a disaster waiting to happen if the Spanish slug proliferates and establishes itself in the UK," said Mr Norman."The Spanish slug causes more eating damage and cannot be controlled with existing measures."The Slugwatch website was designed by Rachel Ayers, 17, a sixth-former at at Notre Dame High School. Norwich.She also designed cards identifying different species of slug for use in schools."We want people to survey their gardens, local areas and school grounds for slugs, or they can build a trap using instructions on the site," she said."One of the most interesting parts of the project was learning about slugs and how to identify them," said Rachel.There are 30 native species in the UK, four of which are classed as pests: the netted or grey field slug, the garden slug, the keeled slug and the large black slug.Slugs play an important role in the ecosystem. They are natural composters, breaking down vegetation, and provide food for hedgehogs, toads and some garden birds."We hope that as well as helping with research into the Spanish slug, people will learn a bit about the biology of these molluscs," said Dr Bedford."You never know, we may even help inspire someone to become a malacologist in the future."</body>

      <body>Cancer costs countries in the European Union 126bn euro (£107bn) a year, according to the first EU-wide analysis of the economic impact of the disease.The charity Cancer Research UK said it was a "huge burden".The figures, published in the Lancet Oncology, included the cost of drugs and health care as well as earnings lost through sickness or families providing care.Lung cancer was the most costly form of the disease.The team from the University of Oxford and King's College London analysed data from each of the 27 nations in the EU in 2009.The showed the total cost was 126bn euro and of that 51bn (£43bn) euro was down to healthcare costs including doctors' time and drug costs.Lost productivity, because of work missed through sickness or dying young, cost 52bn (£44bn) euro while the cost to families of providing care was put at 23bn (£19.5bn) euro.Overall, richer countries, such as Germany and Luxembourg, spent more on cancer treatment per person than eastern European countries such as Bulgaria and Lithuania.Lung cancer accounted for more than a tenth of all cancer costs in Europe. The deadly cancer tends to affect people at an earlier age than other cancers so the lost productivity through early deaths is a major factor.However, the overall economic burden is behind the costs of dementia and cardiovascular disease.An EU-wide study, by the same research group, showed cardiovascular diseases, including high blood pressure and stroke, cost 169bn euro (£144bn) a year while dementia cost 189bn euro (£169bn) in just 15 countries in Western Europe.Dementia has very high costs associated with long-term care while cardiovascular diseases include such a wide range of conditions it affects many more people than cancer.One of the researchers, Dr Ramon Luengo-Fernandez, from the Health Economics Research Centre at the University of Oxford, said: "By estimating the economic burden of several diseases it will be possible to help allocate public research funding towards the diseases with the highest burden and highest expected returns for that investment."Prof Richard Sullivan, from King's College London, said: "It is vital that decision-makers across Europe use this information to identify and prioritise key areas."More effective targeting of investment may prevent health care systems from reaching breaking point - a real danger given the increasing burden of cancer - and in some countries better allocation of funding could even improve survival rates."Sara Osborne, head of policy at Cancer Research UK, said: "The financial impact that cancer has on the economy across Europe due to people dying prematurely from the disease and time off work remains a huge burden."This study reinforces why research is vital to improve our understanding of the causes of cancer - so that we lessen the impact of the disease and develop better ways to prevent and treat the illness."We also need to understand why the UK's cancer mortality rates remain higher than many EU countries despite a similar spend on cancer care."</body>

      <title>New ideas for how Earth core formed</title>
      <description>Experiments on samples of iron and rock held at immense pressures have led to new ideas of how Earth's core formed.</description>

      <body>Experiments on samples of iron and rock held at immense pressures have led to new ideas of how Earth's core formed.Scientists from Stanford University have shown that iron metal will flow through rocks 1,000km beneath our feet.Using sophisticated X-ray imaging, they watched molten metal moving through rocks, squeezed to huge pressures between the tips of pairs of diamonds.Their results suggest that Earth's core did not form in a single step, but grew in a complicated sequence over time.The depths of Earth are complex and multi-layered.At the surface, the rocks forming the foundations of our cities, the stones that we build our lives upon, also provide the raw materials for society - metals, fuel, water and nutrients.These are no more than a thin geological veneer on the planet. In many respects, the deep Earth remains as much of a mystery as Jupiter or Mars.But new research in the journal Nature Geosciences gives new clues about how Earth may have taken shape and built its core.A group of scientists, led by Stanford's Prof Wendy Mao, have shown how metallic iron may be squeezed out of rocky silicates more than 1,000km beneath the surface to form a metallic core.If you were to follow Jules Verne on a journey to the centre of the Earth, you would find a chemistry dominated by just three elements, until you got almost half the way to the centre - that's the first 3,000km of your journey.Oxygen, silicon and magnesium (plus a little bit of iron) make up more than 90% of Earth's blanketing "ceramic" mantle.Electrically and thermally insulating, the mantle is like a rock-wool blanket around the core. The minerals of the mantle are the stony part of the planet. But as you delve deeper on this "thought field trip", things suddenly and drastically change.With more than half your journey ahead of you, you cross a boundary from the stony mantle into the metallic core. It is initially liquid in its upper stretches, and then solid right the way to the centre of the Earth.The chemistry changes too, with iron forming almost all of the core, segregated into Earth's dense inner sphere.The boundary between the metallic core and rocky mantle is a place of extremes. Physically, Earth's metallic liquid outer core is as different to the rocky mantle that overlies it as the seas are from the ocean floor here near Earth's surface.One might (just about) imagine an inverted world of storms and currents of flowing red-hot metal in the molten outer core, pulsing through channels and inverted "ocean" floors at the base of the mantle.The flowing of metal in the outer part of the core gives Earth its magnetic field, protects us from bombarding solar storms, and allows life to thrive.How Earth's core came about has puzzled Earth Scientists for many years. Experiments on mixtures of silicate minerals and iron, cooked up in the laboratory, show that iron sits in tiny isolated lumps within the rock, remaining trapped and pinned at the junctions between the mineral grains.This observation has led to the view that iron only segregates very early in the life of the planet, when the upper part of the rocky mantle was in fact super-hot and molten.It is thought that droplets of iron rained down through the red-hot magma ocean to settle at its base, resting on the solid deeper mantle, then sinking as large "diapirs" driven by gravity through the solid mantle to eventually form a core.The paper by Crystal Shi and Wendy Mao begins to paint a different picture."We know that Earth today has a core and a mantle that are differentiated. With improving technology, we can look at different mechanisms of how this came to be in a new light," said Prof Mao.Using intense X-rays to probe samples held at extreme pressure and temperature squeezed between the tips of diamond crystals, the researchers find that when pressure increases deep into the mantle, iron liquid begins to wet the surfaces of the silicate mineral grains.This means that threads of iron can join up and begin to flow in rivulets through the solid mantle - a process called percolation.It also means that iron can begin to segregate if the rocks are deep enough, even when the mantle is not a molten magma ocean."In order for percolation to be efficient, the molten iron needs to be able to form continuous channels through the solid," Prof Mao explained."Scientists had said this theory wasn't possible, but now we're saying - under certain conditions that we know exist in the planet - it could happen. So, this brings back another possibility for how the core might have formed."Commenting on the results, Geoffrey Bromiley, of the University of Edinburgh, UK, who was not involved in the study, told the BBC: "This new data suggests that we cannot assume that core formation is a simple, single-stage event. Core formation was a complex, multi-stage process that must have had an equally complex influence on the subsequent chemistry of the Earth."Their deep percolation model implies that early core formation can only be initiated in large planets. As a result, the chemistry of the Earth may have been 'reset' by core formation in a markedly different way from smaller planets and asteroids."As such, we might not be able to use geochemical data from meteorites to constrain the bulk composition of the Earth. This is currently an important assumption pervading Earth Science."The results were reliant on recent advances in 3D imaging of minuscule samples using powerful synchrotron electron accelerators that generate intense beams of X-rays.Similar to medical imaging, these sorts of experiments are revealing the nanoscale properties of minerals and melts. But they are also leading to new understanding of how huge objects like planets form and evolve.Dr Bromiley and his colleagues are now investigating the influence of other factors, like the deformation that asteroids and other bodies might have experienced on their chaotic pathways through the early Solar System, on their formation.He added: "The challenge now lies in finding a way to model the numerous processes of core formation to understand their timing and subsequent influence on the chemistry of not just the Earth, but also the other rocky bodies of the inner Solar System."We are increasingly observing metallic cores in bodies much smaller than the Earth. What process might have aided core formation in bodies that were never large enough to permit percolation of core forming melts at great depths?"</body>

      <body>Nobel Prize-winning scientist Prof Peter Higgs has revealed he did not know he had won the award until a woman congratulated him in the street.Prof Higgs, who does not own a mobile phone, said a former neighbour had pulled up in her car as he was returning from lunch in Edinburgh.He added: "She congratulated me on the news and I said 'oh, what news?'"The woman had been alerted by her daughter in London that Prof Higgs had won the award, he revealed.He added: "I heard more about it obviously when I got home and started reading the messages."The 84-year-old emeritus professor at the University of Edinburgh was recognised by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for his work on the theory of the particle which shares his name, the Higgs boson.He shares this year's physics prize with Francois Englert of Belgium, and joins the ranks of past Nobel winners including Marie Curie and Albert Einstein.The existence of the so-called "God particle", said to give matter its substance, or mass, was proved almost 50 years later by a team from the European nuclear research facility (Cern) and its Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland.Speaking for the first time about the award at a media conference at the University of Edinburgh, he said: "How do I feel? Well, obviously I'm delighted and rather relieved in a sense that it's all over. It has been a long time coming."An old friend told him he had been nominated as far back as 1980, he said.Prof Higgs added: "In terms of later events, it seemed to me for many years that the experimental verification might not come in my lifetime."But since the start up of the LHC it has been pretty clear that they would get there, and despite some mishaps they did get there".Stressing the involvement of other theorists and Cern, he added: "I think clearly they should, but it is going to be even more difficult for the Nobel Committee to allocate the credit when it comes to an organisation like Cern."I should remind you that although only two of us have shared this prize, Francois Englert of Brussels and myself, that the work in 1964 involved three groups of people, (including) two in Brussels."Unfortunately Robert Brout died a few years ago so is no longer able to be awarded the prize, but he would certainly have been one of the winners if he had still been alive."But there were three others who also contributed and it is already difficult to allocate the credit amongst the theorists."Although a lot of people seem to think I did all this single-handed, it was actually part of a theoretical programme which had been started in 1960."Prof Higgs was born in Newcastle, but developed his theory while working at the University of Edinburgh.The landmark research that defined what was to become known as the Higgs boson was published in 1964.Discovering the particle became one of the most sought-after goals in science, and the team of scientists behind the $10bn LHC at Cern made proving its existence a key priority.In July of last year, physicists at Cern confirmed the discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson.Prof Higgs, who had often been uncomfortable with the attention his theory brought, was in Geneva to hear the news, and wiped a tear from his eye as the announcement was made.Reacting to the discovery at the time, he told reporters: "It's very nice to be right sometimes."</body>

      <body>A major archaeological dig in Wiltshire has unearthed evidence of frogs legs being eaten in Britain, 8,000 years before France, it has been claimed.The team, which consists of Mesolithic period experts, also found other types of food including salmon and nuts.David Jacques, from the University of Buckingham, said people living there thousands of years ago were eating a "Heston Blumenthal-style menu".The team hopes to confirm Amesbury as the UK's oldest continuous settlement.The dig will run until 25 October.It is being filmed and made into a documentary by the BBC, Smithsonian, CBC and others to be screened at a later date. The project is being led by the University of Buckingham.Mr Jacques added: "This is significant for our understanding of the way people were living around 5,000 years before the building of Stonehenge and it begs the question - where are the frogs now?"The latest information is based on a report by fossil mammal specialist Simon Parfitt, of the Natural History Museum.He examined the discoveries from the dig which has resulted in 12,000 finds, including 650 animal bones, all from the Mesolithic era.Andy Rhind-Tutt, chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust and co-ordinator of the community involvement on the dig, said the studies at Amesbury could help explain why Stonehenge was created."No one would have built Stonehenge without there being something unique and really special about the area," he said."There must have been something significant here beforehand and Blick Mead, with its constant temperature spring sitting alongside the River Avon, may well be it."I believe that as we uncover more about the site over the coming days and weeks, we will discover it to be the greatest, oldest and most significant Mesolithic home base ever found in Britain."He added: "Currently Thatcham - 40 miles from Amesbury - is proving to be the oldest continuous settlement in the UK with Amesbury 104 years younger."By the end of this latest dig, I am sure the records will need to be altered."The site already boasts the biggest collection of flints and cooked animal bones in north west Europe.The term Mesolithic refers to specific groups of archaeological cultures defined as falling between the Palaeolithic and the Neolithic periods.</body>

      <body>Edinburgh Zoo's female giant panda, Tian Tian, is no longer expecting a cub, it has been announced.Experts said her hormone and behavioural signs indicated that she had conceived and carried a foetus until late term, but then lost it.Tian Tian was artificially inseminated in April and had been showing signs of pregnancy for several weeks.However, the zoo said she had now returned to the eating and behavioural patterns of a non-pregnant panda.Chris West, chief executive officer for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, said: "Such a loss has always been in our minds as a very real possibility, as it occurs in giant pandas as well as many other animals, including humans."Our dedicated team of keepers, veterinary staff and many others worked tirelessly to ensure Tian Tian received the best care possible, which included remote observation and closing the panda enclosure to visitors to give her quiet and privacy."We are conducting a detailed review of the scientific data collected, but I am totally confident that we did everything it was possible to do."The panda enclosure will remain closed until the end of the week to give Tian Tian time to get back into her routine and to give her keepers a chance to recuperate.Keepers insist Tian Tian received the best care possible and remain confident she will eventually give birth.Mr West added: "The majority of research centres and zoos with giant pandas around the world have not successfully bred until the third or fourth year."What we have achieved, considering we have had giant pandas for less than two years, is immense."New hormone research is beginning to indicate that lost pregnancies are more common in giant pandas than first thought, though at the moment no-one knows why."The zoo is renting Tian Tian and male panda Yang Guang from China for around £600,000 a year, hoping a cub or cubs would bring in more visitors.Some experts believe money spent on captive breeding would be better used to preserve the habitat of wild pandas.</body>

      <description>The Environment Agency says that it is shutting down 25 illegal waste sites every week.</description>

      <body>The number of illegal waste sites being shut down has increased by 70% in the past 12 months, according to the Environment Agency.Some 1,279 locations were identified and closed in 2012/13, according to its Waste Crime Report.However, construction waste continues to be a problem, while scrap cars were found at a quarter of all illegal sites.And the number of successful prosecutions was down by 30%.The legitimate waste and recycling industry currently generates over £12bn every year in the UK, and employs about 128,000 people.Illegal operators, on the other hand, usually offer to dispose of waste at extremely low prices, and are said to be diverting up to £1bn per year from legitimate businesses.Often the waste is buried or burned with no safeguards for the environment. As well as infestations of flies and acrid smoke, it can lead to serious pollution incidents.While local authorities deal with most cases of fly-tipping, the Environment Agency deals with larger-scale dumping and illegal exports of waste.Two years ago, it set up an illegal waste taskforce. Its latest report states that, over the past 12 months, it closed down an average of 25 of these sites every week."We've shut more sites down faster than ever," said Mat Crocker, head of waste at the agency."We put additional resources to it, we got more people in with the right skill sets, and we've also targeted our efforts at the right people so we can deal with it faster."While the number of sites being closed down is at record levels, the number of successful prosecutions for waste crime is down to its lowest level in four years.In 2102/13, 171 prosecutions were completed, leading to five custodial sentences. In 2011/12, there were 249 prosecutions with 10 ending in jail terms."We target our prosecutions at the most serious offenders," Mat Crocker explained. "Quite often by providing clear information and following it up with the right type of encouragement, people stop."Prosecution is just one of the tools in the bag, really."One feature of large-scale waste business is that dumpers are often clustered around key motorway links near London and in the North West.The agency identified 820 active sites in March this year - the vast majority around these pivotal transport routes.It also carried out inspections on shipping containers in an attempt to curb the illegal export of waste.Follow Matt on Twitter.</body>

      <body>The Conservative Party has said councils in Scotland have received more than 2,500 wind farm applications in the past 18 months.The party's figures indicate the local authorities facing the greatest workload in dealing with the proposals are Aberdeenshire, Highland and Orkney.The Conservatives said wind farms have become a "gravy train".The Scottish government said it has given councils additional funding to deal with the applications.The 2,508 applications represented, according to the Conservatives, seven every working day.Conservative energy spokesman Murdo Fraser said: "Alex Salmond has played to the gallery on this one, but the figures show the rush of wind farm applications remains intense."These applications put council planning departments under immense strain, and cause great concern to communities worried about the impact a massive wind farm on their doorstep will have."And even if a council does reject an application, there is a good chance the turbine-hungry Scottish government will overturn the ruling in pursuit of its own overly green policies."Mr Fraser added: "This surge has to stop, and the way to do that is ending ludicrous subsidies for an unreliable and intermittent energy source, and stop inviting companies to develop in areas which are clearly unsuitable."We appreciate that wind farms have a place, but the fact there are seven wind farm applications a day in Scotland proves this is a gravy train threatening to career out of control."The Scottish government has said its policy represents a "balance" between different interests.A spokeswoman said: "We recognise that some planning authorities face pressure from the volume of wind turbine applications they receive, and have identified additional funds to assist them."Seventeen bids were received for additional funds and earlier this year £725,000 was made available to support all of those bids."Our policy on wind farm applications aims to strike an appropriate balance between Scotland's massive green energy potential and the need to satisfactorily address the impacts on communities and the environment."</body>

      <title>Somerset badger cull given extension</title>
      <description>A licence has been granted to extend the badger cull in Somerset until 1 November.</description>

      <body>A licence has been granted to extend the badger cull in Somerset until 1 November.The planned six-week trial came to an end on Monday, but the firm behind it asked for more time after its marksmen fell short of killing the target of 70% of the badger population.A similar trial in Gloucestershire is due to end next week, with an application made to extend it also.Ministers and the NFU say badger culling is needed to control cattle TB.Around 28,000 cattle were slaughtered in 2012 at a cost of £100m to taxpayers.However, animal welfare groups say scientific evidence does not support the policy of shooting badgers in an attempt to control the disease.The government agency Natural England said on Friday that "criteria have been met to allow control of badgers to continue under licence in west Somerset for the purpose of preventing the spread of bovine tuberculosis"."The new licence authorises a three-week control operation to be carried out this autumn and supplements that authorised under the original four-year licence granted in October last year," it said on its website.It said the new licence allowed culling to continue and specified a minimum number of 165 badgers and a maximum number of 282 badgers "to deliver disease control benefits while reducing the risk of local extinction".An application to extend culling in Gloucestershire had also been received, said Natural England, and would be processed in due course.The Badger Trust said it had received a message from solicitors at Defra that a licence had been issued allowing the cull to start immediately and continue until midday on 1 November.The original plan was to kill 70% of badgers in the areas of west Somerset and Gloucestershire by free shooting.Across both regions this meant around 5,000 badgers were to be killed in total.But Defra said these targets were based on population estimates from 2012 that had turned out to be highly inaccurate.In west Somerset, the population, which had been estimated at 2,400, has now been revised downwards to 1,450. In Gloucestershire, the numbers have been lowered from 3,400 to 2,350.Environment Secretary Owen Paterson told the House of Commons that 850 badgers had been shot in Somerset during the six-week trial, just over 40% of an initial target of 2,081.</body>

      <body>Some subordinate female meerkats wet-nurse a dominant female's offspring in exchange for not being evicted from the group, a study suggests.Researchers found that females were more likely to do this if they had recently lost pups or had returned to the group following eviction.A group's dominant female aggressively suppresses other females from breeding through infanticide or eviction.The findings have been published in the Animal Behaviour journal."When dominant females are pregnant, in the last few weeks of the pregnancy they usually throw out the top level of subordinate females," explained co-author Kirsty Macleod, a zoologist at the University of Cambridge."That can be four or five subordinate females that are really strongly aggressed."This is because if a female is pregnant herself, she is more likely to kill the pups of another pregnant female in an attempt to try and secure care for her own pups."In the past, we thought that this behaviour was to try and stop the (dominant female's) pups being killed,"Ms Macleod told BBC News that it was much more beneficial for females to belong to a group."If they are on their own then they have a much more higher likelihood of being predated," she said."In many cases, these females are evicted and we never see them again, so returning to the group is really crucial to their survival."What we do see in the wild when they do return to the group is this extreme grovelling behaviour, so we can see that they are quite obviously trying to appease the dominant female. When they start lactating, this seems to fit with that behaviour [pattern]."Damp nipplesThe idea of subordinate females "paying rent" was based on data gathered from research carried out between 1996 and 2011, during which time scientists observed the behaviour of 40 groups of meerkats.Because most wet-nursing occurred underground in a group's burrows, females were identified as producing milk through the presence of suckle marks and sand being stuck to damp nipples."Just the sheer volume of data available to me meant that I could look at a lot of different things and fairly definitively make these assumptions, even if it is just short of saying that this is definitely what is happening," Ms Macleod explained.The meerkats in the study are part of a long-term project headed by the University of Cambridge and Professor Tim Clutton-Brock, who is a co-author on the paper.The project, carried out in the Kalahari region of South Africa, also featured in the TV natural history series, Meerkat Manor and a Natural World documentary, to be broadcast on BBC2 (except Scotland) at 2100 UK time."Wet-nursing by formerly evicted meerkats may be a way of 'paying rent' to be allowed back into the group without receiving further aggression," Ms Macleod observed.She added that researchers had long known about this "allolactation" behaviour among meerkats, with it occurring in almost half of the litters.But, she observed: "In a number of cases, it looks as if they are doing it when they are not pregnant themselves. Physiologically speaking, that is quite a big jump in terms of co-operative behaviour."The University of Cambridge researcher explained that wet-nursing was just one of a suite of co-operative behaviours that subordinate meerkats do."More common behaviour includes feeding the pups when they are a little older, such as catching a scorpion or other invertebrates and passing it on."They also babysit as well, so when the pups are very small a subordinate female will stay at the burrow for the entire day, meaning that [the adult is] losing all the benefits of foraging for that day."Ms Macleod said that she planned to carry out further research as part of her PhD research: "What I would like to look at in order to nail this (rent) idea down is whether the females that come back and start lactating are subject to less aggression."Basically, being a subordinate female meerkat is quite a rough deal because you are in a group and you are caring for another females' young."Then, if you try to have your own young, you are chased out of the group or your pups get eaten."So there is this constant and very complex trade-off between the costs of trying to leave the group and have your own offspring against the benefits are being in the group."</body>

      <title>Four 'flying ant days' in a month</title>

      <body>The UK experienced a month of flying ants this summer, scientists have said.Results from this year's flying ant survey show four peaks of ant emergence during a four week period and included data from social media for the first time.Last year's results dispelled the myth of a single flying ant day by revealing two peaks of activity over a fortnight.The results were presented by ecologist Professor Adam Hart during a 24 hour lecture as part of Biology Week.The flying ant survey is conducted by the Society of Biology and University of Gloucestershire."Last year we were surprised by two distinct flying ant days, so having such a long period of flying ant sightings this year was even more of a shock," said Prof Hart, ecologist from the University of Gloucestershire.Black garden ants (Lasius niger) are the most commonly seen flying ant in the UK when the summer skies fill with a mix of males and potential queens.The ants mate in the air and their nuptial, or mating flight, is the first step to founding a new colony.The first flying ant sightings this year were in late June - earlier than in 2012 - and continued into September.Like last year's survey, the results indicate that rather than a single 'flying ant day' there were multiple peaks in activity.Dr Rebecca Nesbit, survey coordinator from the Society of Biology explained that 2012 had two very distinct peaks, whereas 2013 had four main peaks. The 'ant season' was also longer, with the last flying ant day in 2013 two weeks after the last one in 2012."Neither year showed a single 'flying ant day' as anecdotes suggested we would find. It has raised interesting questions about whether individual ant nests are releasing flying ants on multiple days," Dr Nesbit told BBC Nature."The different patterns in 2012 and 2013 suggest flexibility in the ants' behaviour. It will be fascinating to see whether these patterns are seen again in following years, or whether we will see new patterns entirely," she said.The survey, which ran for the first time in 2012, encourages members of the public to submit their sightings of this summer spectacle to help scientists understand ant behaviour.This year the survey went one step further by using information from social media site Twitter alongside the submitted sightings.Christina Catlin-Groves from the University of Gloucestershire has been analysing the survey data and said: "Using Twitter has been really exciting for us; now a wealth of new data is available for monitoring the phenomenon."One of the main things it allowed the researchers to do was access data prior to the 2012 ant survey."The use of social media has really exciting potential for us and is something we hope to expand on for future years," Dr Nesbit told BBC Nature."The similarity between the time of day people were tweeting about flying ants and the times they reported seeing them in our survey was quite striking."Results suggest a peak flying time of 18:00 was remarkably consistent between years and that there were no distinct differences across the UK."It appears that different summer weathers lead to different patterns of flying ants, and with more years' worth of data we should be able to learn a lot more," she said.Biology Week is a series of events organised by the Society of Biology from 12 - 18 October.Join BBC Nature on Facebook and Twitter @BBCNature.</body>

      <title>Elephants 'understand human gesture'</title>
      <description>African elephants demonstrate what appears to be an instinctive understanding of human gestures, according to UK scientists.</description>

      <body>African elephants have demonstrated what appears to be an instinctive understanding of human gestures, according to UK scientists.In a series of tests, researcher Ann Smet, of the University of St Andrews, offered the animals a choice between two identical buckets, then pointed at the one containing a hidden treat.From the first trial, the elephants chose the correct bucket.The results are published in the journal Current Biology.The scientists worked with captive elephants at a lodge in Zimbabwe.Prof Richard Byrne, a co-author on the research, said the elephants had been rescued from culling operations and trained for riding."They specifically train the elephants to respond to vocal cues. They don't use any gestures at all," said Prof Byrne."The idea is that the handler can walk behind the elephant and just tell it what to do with words."Despite this, the animals seemed to grasp the meaning of pointing from the outset. This makes them the only non-human animals to understand the gesture without being trained to do so.In previous studies, Prof Byrne said, our closest primate cousins, the chimpanzees, proved to be "hopeless" at at similar task.Ms Smet added that she had been impressed by the animals' apparently innate understanding of the gesture."Of course we had hoped that the elephants would be able to learn to follow human pointing, or we wouldn't have done the experiment in the first place," she said."But it was really surprising that they didn't seem to have to learn anything."It seems that understanding pointing is an ability elephants just possess naturally and they are cognitively much more like us than has been realised."Prof Byrne said studying elephants helped build a map of part of the evolutionary tree that is very distant from humans."They're so unrelated to us," he told BBC News. "So if we find human-like abilities in an animal like an elephant, that hasn't shared a common ancestor with people for more than 100 million years , we can be pretty sure that it's evolved completely separately, by what's called convergent evolution."The researchers said their findings might explain how elephants have successfully been tamed and have "historically had a close bond with humans, in spite of being potentially dangerous and unmanageable due to their great size".But the scientists added the results could be a hint that the animals gesture to one another in the wild with their "highly controllable trunks".Ms Smet told BBC News: "The next step [in our research] is to test whether when an elephant extends its trunk upwards and outwards - as they regularly do, such as when detecting a predator, this functions as a point."</body>

      <title>Mixed fortunes for Cape vultures</title>
      <description>Expanding networks of pylons and power lines in southern Africa are extending Cape vultures' foraging range but it comes at a cost, say scientists.</description>

      <body>Cape vultures in southern Africa are using expanding networks of pylons and power lines to extend their range, say scientists.At the same time these lines are also contributing to this threatened bird of prey's decline through fatal collisions and electrocutions.The study involved a team of experts from the UK and South Africa tracking individual bird movements using GPS.The results are published in the online journal PLoS One.Southern Africa's Cape vultures (Gyps coprotheres) - like many other species of vulture - are in decline. Contributing factors include feeding on illegally poisoned carcasses and fatal collisions with wind turbines and power lines.To understand more about their movements, and how these vultures interact with power lines, a team of scientists fitted GPS devices to five adult and four immature birds."What we were trying to find out was how far they were going and what sort of areas they were feeding in," explained lead researcher Louis Phipps from Nottingham Trent University, UK.They thought the birds would be travelling large distances, but were not expecting the vultures to be travelling across almost the whole of southern Africa."Their individual home ranges on average cover an area larger than the British Isles which is a huge area and among the largest areas of any vulture," said Mr Phipps.From the capture site the birds travelled up to 1,000km (621 miles) in a straight line and as a group entered five different countries, regularly crossing international borders."It seems that their movement actually followed the pattern and distribution of where those [power] lines were and have been constructed," he said.According to Mr Phipps these vultures are using the pylons and power lines as roosting and perching sites where no other suitable perches are available, allowing them to travel beyond the recognised range for this species.And because they are spending more time in the vicinity of these power lines, the vultures are at a higher risk of colliding with the overhead wires. Even though they could travel further by using the power lines as roost sites, there is an increased risk of fatalities."So just as a mortality factor power lines are bad, but potentially they may be benefitting them by furthering their range to the west," Mr Phipps told BBC Nature.The study also examined the role of protected areas and wildlife reserves."Our data actually shows that although vultures, especially Cape vultures, definitely need these areas for protection...they actually spend most of their time foraging on private farmland."This leaves them exposed to the full range of threats in the wider landscape, more exposed to poisoned livestock carcasses and harmful veterinary drugs which was the cause of the Asian vulture population collapse."Mr Phipps explained that as GPS tracking is very accurate it shows exactly where vultures are foraging, building on this data in the future will allow co-ordinated cross border conservation measures to be implemented in exactly the right areas."There are lots of factors playing against each other that make the vultures' daily life a very big struggle," Mr Phipps told BBC Nature."On balance power lines are not a good thing for vultures."Join BBC Nature on Facebook and Twitter @BBCNature.</body>

      <title>The danger of rumination</title>
      <description>Can too much rumination be dangerous?</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country.A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind?Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation.But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be.The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them.A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK."We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool."Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown."The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety."The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others.The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion."But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says."The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem."This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology."Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years."When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says."If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head."Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming."There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me."Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head."Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders.And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum.In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems.So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them?"Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman.It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study."It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says."It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed."Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system."This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster."And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists."Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on FacebookFollow @BBCOuch on Twitter and on FacebookFollow @BBCOuch on Twitter and on Facebook, and listen to our monthly talk show</body>

      <body>Studies have claimed major health benefits for standing for much of the day as opposed to sitting. The difference is marked, explains Michael Mosley.Guess how many hours a day you spend sitting? Fewer than eight? More than 10? A recent survey found that many of us spend up to 12 hours a day sitting on our bottoms looking at computers or watching television. If you throw in the seven hours we spend sleeping then that adds up to a remarkable 19 hours a day being sedentary.Sitting down as much as this is clearly bad for us and some studies suggest that those who sit all day live around two years less than those who are more active. Most of us are guilty of excess sitting. We sit at work, in the car and at home, moving only to shift from one seat to another.Even if you exercise on a regular basis that may not be enough. There is mounting evidence that exercise will not undo the damage done by prolonged sitting. Our technology has made us the most sedentary humans in history.So why is sitting so damaging? One thing it does is change the way our bodies deal with sugar. When you eat, your body breaks down the food into glucose, which is then transported in the blood to other cells.Glucose is an essential fuel but persistently high levels increase your risk of diabetes and heart disease. Your pancreas produces the hormone insulin to help get your glucose levels back down to normal, but how efficiently your body does that is affected by how physically active you areWe wanted to see what would happen if we took a group of people who normally spend their day sitting in an office and ask them to spend a few hours a day on their feet instead.Standing while you are working may seem rather odd, but it is a practice with a long tradition. Winston Churchill wrote while working at a special standing desk, as did Ernest Hemingway and Benjamin Franklin.So with Dr John Buckley and a team of researchers from the University of Chester we conducted a simple experiment. We asked 10 people who work at an estate agents to stand for at least three hours a day for a week.Our lucky volunteers had mixed feelings about how they would get on."It'll be different, but looking forward to it, yes…""I think my feet might hurt - I'll have to wear sensible shoes…""The small of my back, it's going to hurt…""I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to stand up for all that time…[Laughs nervously]"We asked all the volunteers to wear an accelerometer - a movement monitor - to record just how much moving about they were doing. They also wore heart rate monitors and had glucose monitors that measured their blood sugar levels constantly, day and night.The evidence that standing up is good for you goes back to at least the 1950s when a study was done comparing bus conductors (who stand) with bus drivers (who don't). This study, published in the Lancet, showed that the bus conductors had around half the risk of developing heart disease of the bus drivers.Since then prolonged sitting has not only been linked to problems with blood glucose control, but also a sharp reduction in the activity of an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase, which breaks down blood fats and makes them available as a fuel to the muscles. This reduction in enzyme activity leads to raised levels of triglycerides and fats in the blood, increasing the risk of heart disease.We had good reason to believe that standing would make a difference to our volunteers, but we were also a little anxious as to how they would get on. This was the first time an experiment like this had been conducted in the UK. Would our volunteers stick to it?They did. One woman with arthritis even found that standing actually improved her symptoms.The Chester researchers took measurements on days when the volunteers stood, and when they sat around. When they looked at the data there were some striking differences. As we had hoped, blood glucose levels fell back to normal levels after a meal far more quickly on the days when the volunteers stood than when they sat.There was also evidence, from the heart rate monitors that they were wearing, that by standing they were burning more calories."If we look at the heart rates," John Buckley explains, "we can see they are quite a lot higher actually - on average around 10 beats per minute higher and that makes a difference of about 0.7 of a calorie per minute."Now that doesn't sound like much, but it adds up to about 50 calories an hour. If you stand for three hours a day for five days that's around 750 calories burnt. Over the course of a year it would add up to about 30,000 extra calories, or around 8lb of fat."If you want to put that into activity levels," Dr Buckley says, "then that would be the equivalent of running about 10 marathons a year. Just by standing up three or four hours in your day at work."Dr Buckley thinks that although going out and doing exercise offers many proven benefits, our bodies also need the constant, almost imperceptible increase in muscle activity that standing provides. Simple movement helps us to keep our all-important blood sugar under control.We can't all stand up at work but the researchers believe that even small adjustments, like standing while talking on the phone, going over to talk to a colleague rather than sending an email, or simply taking the stairs, will help.I have, of course, written this article while standing.Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>The story behind the hidden number 1,729</title>
      <description>Why is the number 1,729 hidden in Futurama episodes?</description>

      <body>The year 1913 marked the beginning of an extraordinary relationship between an impoverished Indian clerk and a Cambridge don. A century later, their remarkable friendship has left its mark in the strangest of places, namely in Futurama, the animated series from The Simpsons creator Matt Groening and physics graduate David X Cohen.GH Hardy (1877-1947) and Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920) were the archetypal odd couple. Hardy, whose parents were both teachers, grew up in a middle-class home in Surrey, England. At the age of two he was writing numbers that reached into the millions, so it was no surprise that he eventually read mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he joined an elite secret society known as the Cambridge Apostles.Ramanujan was born in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. At the age of two he survived a bout of smallpox, but his three younger siblings were less fortunate, each one dying in infancy. Although he was enrolled in a local school, Ramanujan's most valuable education was thanks to a library book, A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure Mathematics by GS Carr, which contained thousands of theorems. He investigated these theorems one by one, relying on a chalk and slate for calculations, using his roughened elbows as erasers.Aged 21, he married Janakiammal, who was just 10 years old. Unable to afford college fees and needing to support his wife, Ramanujan got a job as a clerk. Nevertheless, he continued his interest in mathematics in his spare time, developing novel ideas and proving fresh theorems.Curious about the value of his research, Ramanujan began to write to mathematicians in England in the hope that someone would mentor him, or at least give him feedback. Academics such as MJM Hill, HF Baker and EW Hobson largely ignored Ramanujan's pleas for help, but Hardy was mesmerised by the two packages he received in 1913, which contained a total of 120 theorems.Hardy's reaction veered between "fraud" and so brilliant that it was "scarcely possible to believe". In the end, he concluded that the theorems "must be true, because, if they were not true, no-one would have the imagination to invent them".The British professor made arrangements for the young Indian, still only 26, to visit Cambridge. Hardy took great pride in being the man who had rescued such raw talent and would later call it "the one romantic incident in my life".The resulting partnership gave rise to discoveries in several areas of mathematics and Ramanujan's genius was recognised in 1918 when he was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society.The young Indian savant would later say that many of his theorems were whispered to him in his sleep by Namagiri, an avatar of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi: "While asleep, I had an unusual experience. There was a red screen formed by flowing blood, as it were. I was observing it. Suddenly a hand began to write on the screen. I became all attention. That hand wrote a number of elliptic integrals. They stuck to my mind. As soon as I woke up, I committed them to writing."Ramanujan's career was brilliant, but ended prematurely when he began to suffer from tuberculosis. He returned to India in 1919 and died the following year, aged 32.However, the life of Ramanujan continues to fascinate modern mathematicians, including Dr Ken Keeler, who swapped his job as a researcher to join the writing team behind the science fiction sitcom Futurama.He is actually one of a number of mathematicians who write for The Simpsons and its sister series Futurama. They have retained their love for the subject and they continue to express their passion for numbers by smuggling mathematical references into both series.For example, in order to pay homage to Ramanujan, Keeler has repeatedly inserted 1,729 into Futurama, because this particular number cropped up in a famous conversation between Hardy and Ramanujan.According to Hardy, he visited Ramanujan in a nursing home in 1918: "I remember once going to see him when he was lying ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one and that I hoped it was not an unfavourable omen. 'No,' he replied. 'It is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.'"Their exchange can be unpacked and expressed as follows:1,729 = 1³ + 12³ = 9³ + 10³It is rare that a number can be split into two positive cubes, and even rarer that it can be split into two positive cubes in two different ways, and 1,729 is the smallest number that exhibits this property.It is in recognition of Ramanujan's comment that Bender, Futurama's cantankerous robot, has the unit number 1729.The number also appears in an episode titled "The Farnsworth Parabox". The plot involves Futurama characters hopping between multiple universes, and one of them is labelled "Universe 1729".Moreover, the starship Nimbus has the hull registration number BP-1729.This has certainly helped keep Ramanujan's memory alive, but it is probably not the sort of immortality that Hardy had in mind when he wrote: "Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten, because languages die and mathematical ideas do not. Immortality may be a silly word, but probably a mathematician has the best chance of whatever it may mean."Keeler is proud of his mathematical references in Futurama, and he is philosophical about the many years he spent as a mathematician before becoming a comedy writer: "Everything that happens to us has some effect on us, and I do suppose that the time I spent in grad school made me a better writer. I certainly don't regret it."For example, I chose Bender's serial number to be 1,729 and I think that reference alone completely justifies my doctorate."I don't know if my thesis advisor sees it that way though."Simon Singh answered readers' questions on Twitter using #AskSimonSingh.Q: What is the second highest number after 1729 and do these numbers have a name?A: Mathematicians tend to focus on what is the smallest number that is the sum of 2 cubes in 3, 4, 5… ways. So 87539319 is smallest number that is the sum of 2 cubes in 3 ways. In "Bender's Big Score" Fry takes cab #87539319.Q: Can you write about Kaprekar's constant 6174 sometime? I think it's better than 1729!A: Not enough space to explain Kaprekar's constant, but I mention Harshad numbers in my book - Kaprekar invented (?) these too.Q: Why does mathematics scare such a large proportion of the public?A: I have a three-year-old son and can see that counting is not a natural process. Maybe the surprise that anybody ever gets maths?Q: I wouldn't say it is rare for a number to be a sum of two cubes, there are infinitely many such numbers.A: Fair point.Q: What is the next big conjecture to be proven? The Riemann Hypothesis?A: Mathematicians seem to rate The Riemann Hypothesis highly. Not something I would ever write about, as it's too complex for my writing talents.Q: What's the next number after 1729 for positive cubes?A: Not sure, but (as you hint) we can look at (-)ve cubes too. Bender's serial number is 2716057, which is 952³ + (-951)³.Q: I see that #AskSimonSingh is due to take place at 16:30BST. Could you reschedule it for 17:29BST? :)A: This is a very good idea. But it is 17.29 somewhere.Q: I don't have a question. I just want to say I really like you as a human beingA: Thanks. I guess that is as opposed to liking me as an alien or an amoeba?Q: Why is the number 1,729 hidden in Futurama episodes?A: Many of the writers were mathematicians, and still love numbers, so this is their way of expressing that love.Q: Without computers, how was Ramanujan able to compute properties like the 1729?A: In a way 1729 spot was not miraculous. Many may know that 12³=1728, or 9³=729. Rest is easy. Except it seems that Ramanujan could do this over and over again. Every number was his personal friend.Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <body>New film Gravity promises to rekindle the debate over how "hard" - or accurate - science fiction should be. Should film-makers adhere to basic scientific principles, or should audiences just feel the magic instead, asks Peter Ray Allison.The relationship between science and science fiction has always been tempestuous.Gravity focuses on two astronauts stranded in space after the destruction of their space shuttle. Since Gravity's US release (it comes to the UK in November) many critics have praised the film for its scientific accuracy.But noted astrophysicist Dr Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, had several issues with the accuracy of Gravity's portrayal of space.Through a series of posts on Twitter, Tyson - who later emphasised that he "enjoyed the film very much" - highlighted various errors.He noted the Hubble space telescope (orbiting at 350 miles above sea level), the International Space Station (at 250 miles), and a Chinese space station could never be in line of sight of one another. On top of that, most satellites orbit west to east, yet in the film the satellite debris was seen drifting east to west.Tyson also noted how Sandra Bullock's hair did not float freely as it would in zero-gravity. This is arguably not so much an error in physics, but a reflection of the limitations of cinematic technology to accurately portray actors in zero-gravity. That is, of course, without sending them into space for the duration of the film.There has always been a drive for scientific accuracy within science fiction, especially within the "hard science fiction" literary sub-genre. But sci-fi, especially in film, tends to have a more flamboyant approach, where realism is often dispensed with in favour of visual flair.The Michael Bay film Armageddon is known for its woeful number of inaccuracies, from the space shuttles separating their rocket boosters and fuel tanks in close proximity to each other (risking a collision) and to objects falling on to the asteroid under a gravitational pull seemingly as strong as the Earth's. More than one interested observer tried to work out how big the bomb would have to be to blow up an asteroid in the way demanded in the movie. Answer: Very big indeed.Nasa is reported to have even used Armageddon as part of a test within their training programme, asking candidates to identify all the scientific impossibilities within the film.Despite the presence of physicist Prof Brian Cox as a scientific adviser on Danny Boyle's Sunshine, artistic licence seeped in. There's a communications "dead-zone" around the Sun - not something easily explicable using real world rules.Despite claims to the contrary, Red Planet was riddled with scientific implausibilities, from the compatibility between modern equipment and 30-year old Russian technology (imagine attempting to connect a modern PC with a Sinclair Spectrum), to the Martian "nematodes" which had been eating algae that had been sent from earth for the past 30 years. The nematodes should have been worms but looked closer to beetles. And there was no explanation as to how they had evolved to eat non-Martian algae nor what they had eaten before.The science across the film was so "creative" that Nasa refused to act as scientific adviser on the film.But perhaps the biggest example of scientific licence occurs in a plethora of space-based dramas."The most commonly lauded example of 'bad science', intentionally placed into science fiction, is that of sound," says Ed Trollope, spacecraft operations engineer at technology firm Telespazio VEGA Deutschland. "Because space is a vacuum, there is no sound, which means all those explosions and engine noises shouldn't be there."There's a simple cinematic reason for having the sound of an explosion when a spacecraft blows up - it feels right to the viewer. But other conventions are more difficult for scientists to accept."My pet peeve is inertia," says Trollope. "There are many good reasons for keeping your engines on in space, but 'maintaining speed' is not one of them. If you turn your engines off, you don't stop."Some do it slightly better than others. "I'd prefer not to single out a single film/book/series for this particular error, because it's so common - but I will laud the old television show Babylon 5, for doing a wonderful job of representing the mechanics of spaceflight inertia so nicely," explains Trollope.2001: A Space Odyssey's silent scenes of space craft, with their rotating Stanford torus design, were closer than many later examples to the reality of travelling in space."A classic case of scientific inaccuracy was the first edition of Ringworld by Larry Niven, a novel which won both the Hugo and Nebula awards in 1971," suggests science fiction author Charles Stross. "The author inadvertently set up a series of scenes which implied that the Earth spun on its axis in the wrong direction." Niven fixed it in the second printing.The Duncan Jones film Moon was lauded for a reasonably accurate portrayal of what lunar mining for Helium-3 could look like in the future. Helium-3 is rare on Earth but less rare on the Moon, and using an automated method with a human overseer might be possible. But the economics behind the mining is not explained.The alien signal in Contact is a prime example of what Seti (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) is looking for. This is perhaps not surprising as Contact was written by astronomer Carl Sagan. The use of mathematics in the transmission of the message seems reasonable and the time lag in the sending and receiving of the signal is also accurately represented in the film.Science fiction is not just expected to accurately portray science but also to anticipate future developments."Science fiction hits some predictive targets," says science fiction author Neal Asher, "but rather in the way that a clip fired from an assault rifle will hit some of the enemy hidden in the jungle, but mostly hits trees and leaves.""One of the past criticisms of science fiction has been that it's all 'zap-guns and rocket ships'," suggests Asher. "Now the science fiction writer can smugly point out the LaWs - the US navy laser system - knocking down drones, and then wax lyrical about the X Prize, Virgin Galactic and Elon Musk's SpaceX."Richard Blott, principal consultant at Space Enterprise Partnerships, recalls an early episode of Star Trek ("Spock's Brain", 1968) where the latest space ship is described as having an "ion drive"."Nowadays most new communications satellites have ion engines and they have powered missions to Vesta and Ceres," says Blott."In the end," Asher concludes, "science fiction is not there to make accurate predictions about the future, it is there to entertain and stimulate the imagination. There is absolutely no doubt that many of the imaginations it stimulates belong to scientists. To some extent it drives and directs science."Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on FacebookWhich films got science right, and which got it wrong?

      <title>Whose science is it anyway?</title>
      <description>Progress in science has never observed national borders</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24477064</url>
      <date>1381505509</date>

      <body>Science can only develop by ignoring national borders, says Lisa Jardine.Since its modern beginnings in the 17th Century, science has been the most global of pursuits. Information and experimentation have criss-crossed national borders, as the curious have tried to explain the properties of natural phenomena.Marie Curie, discoverer of radium and winner of two Nobel prizes, put the matter characteristically bluntly: "Science is essentially international. It is only through lack of a historical sense that national qualities have been attributed to it."Not that you would think so if you have followed the science news this week. As the Nobel prizes for 2013 have been announced, each nation's media have rushed to claim the winners as their own."Three Americans win joint Nobel prize for medicine," shouted the headline in the New York Times. "A German and two Americans win the Nobel prize for medicine," counter-claimed Der Spiegel.One of this year's winners is indeed German born and trained, though he has worked for many years in the United States.On Tuesday the prize for physics went, as expected, to Britain's (or should that be Scotland's) Peter Higgs.Of the five other physicists who could lay claim to having made crucial early theoretical breakthroughs in relation to the Higgs-Boson particle, it was Francois Englert of Belgium alone who shared the prize with Higgs.Predictably, every Belgian newspaper I consulted on Wednesday morning ran a banner headline along the lines of "Belgian wins Nobel prize for physics", relegating Higgs to the second or third paragraph.Higgs and Englert published their theories of how certain particles acquire mass independently in 1964 - Higgs working in Edinburgh, and Englert and his long-term colleague Robert Brout in Brussels.It has been characteristic of advances in science since the beginning that a single problem is worked on - and ultimately solved at about the same time - by individuals and teams in different countries, who read the same papers, correspond and meet intermittently at academic conferences.An example on a much more modest scale from the period closest to my own heart as a historian, the 17th Century, is the investigation of a phenomenon known today as Prince Rupert's drops. As it happens, this too linked scientists in Britain and the Low Countries.If a globule of molten glass is dropped into a bucket of cold water, it cools to form a tear-shaped drop of a size that fits into the palm of your hand with a long, slender tail.This tadpole-shaped drop has extraordinary properties. The main body of the tear is remarkably strong - you can stand on it, or hit it with a hammer, without it breaking.But if the tiniest fragment is broken from the tail, the entire drop shatters and explodes with a loud bang, disintegrating into dust - watch one shatter in this clip from Smarter Every Day on YouTube.This combination of strength and weakness, and its potential explosive possibilities, demanded an explanation.Prince Rupert's drops seem first to have attracted scientific interest in Germany in the 1640s. By the 1650s they were being examined and discussed in France and the Netherlands, with a whole range of theories being produced concerning the drop's strange properties. One of the earliest recorded attempts at an explanation involved the Dutch polymath Sir Constantijn Huygens and the amateur scientist Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle.Cavendish was domiciled in Antwerp at the time, exiled from Britain during the Commonwealth period. In a letter to her following a visit, Huygens recorded a conversation they had about the drops - at the time known as "Dutch tears" - in her private chemistry laboratory. There, each week, she apparently "dirtied several white petticoats" worn as overalls to protect her clothing while she conducted experiments.Enclosing several specimens, Huygens begs her to investigate their properties. "The King of France is as yet unresolved in the question, notwithstanding he hath been curious to move it to an assembly of the best philosophers of Paris."The duchess replied a week later. She expressed her gratitude to Huygens for seeking her opinion. In her view, the cause of the explosion when the tip of the drop was broken was that there was a tiny quantity of volatile material trapped inside which reacted violently on contact with air.With a nice feminine touch, she observed that if liquid had somehow been inserted into the drops (actually, the drops contain no liquid) it would have required no greater skill than that employed to make fashionable glass earrings."Women wear at their ears for pendants as great wonders, glass bobs with narrow necks as these glasses have tails, and yet it is filled with several colours silks and coarse black cotton-wool, which to my sense is more difficult to put into these glass pendants, than liquor into these glass guns."The correspondence continued for some weeks, though neither party could come up with anything like an acceptable explanation.In 1661, the properties of the "glass bubbles" were demonstrated at a meeting of the recently formed Royal Society in London. Several of its founding members had recently returned from continental Europe at the Restoration of Charles II - including the king's German cousin Prince Rupert, who gave his name to the drops. So it is not surprising that specimens of what diarist Samuel Pepys called "Chymicall glasses" came with them."The king sent by Sir Paul Neile five little glass bubbles," the minutes of the meeting record, "in order to have the judgement of the society concerning them."Anxious to impress the king (whose financial support the society was actively seeking) the members responded immediately. More drops were produced and experimented on two days later, and a full report of the experiments given to the society at its weekly meeting by the president.These were shared with the French traveller Balthasar de Monconys when he attended the Royal Society. He made his own French translation of the report, and discussed the drops and their properties with the scientific community in Leiden when he visited shortly afterwards.It was my scientific hero Robert Hooke, the society's curator of experiments - the person in charge of those experiments recorded in 1661 - who made an important early contribution to explaining this strange phenomenon, based on the differential cooling of the glass itself after it was plunged into water, and drawing an analogy with the way the locked stones in brick arches collapse instantaneously and violently once the keystone is removed.Hooke used his new microscope to examine drops which had been shattered, but held intact with strong glue. His contributions to a theoretical explanation cover 11 closely-argued pages in his 1665 Micrographia.In the 19th Century the great Lord Kelvin added his contribution. But the behaviour of these "Dutch tears" was not fully explained until the 1920s. So multiple connections between at least four European nations contributed to the eventual properly scientific understanding of "Prince Rupert's drops".I might add that Margaret Cavendish's involvement in the story is not her only appearance in early modern science. Pepys described in his diary a sensational London social event in 1667, when the duchess paid a ceremonial visit to the Royal Society at the invitation of its president and fellows - the only woman to do so before the modern era. Among the experiments carried out for her were several involving Robert Boyle's famous "evacuating engine" or air pump.It is tempting for the historian to claim landmark events in science on behalf of the nation to which he or she belongs. I have come close to doing as much myself, when I hinted that Hooke might have been the first to provide an explanation for the behaviour of Prince Rupert's drops. Brian Cox begins his recent Science Britannica TV series by announcing: "In these films I want to explore Britain's pivotal role in creating modern science."But science has always ignored national borders, in pursuit of the fullest possible understanding of nature. Even at the height of the Anglo-Dutch wars in the mid-17th Century, correspondence full of information and data continued to be exchanged uncensored between Dutch scientists and the Royal Society in London.Higgs and Englert have been quick to point out that the crucial experimental work at CERN that confirmed their Nobel-prize winning theoretical breakthrough was the result of global teamwork, involving thousands of researchers and almost 100 nationalities.To be true to the benefits of a scientific future we have to honour its equally international past.Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <description>US government employees head back to work after President Barack Obama signed a law ending a government shutdown and extending the US debt limit.</description>

      <body>Hundreds of thousands of US government employees are heading back to work after President Barack Obama signed a law ending a 16-day government shutdown and extending the US debt limit.The cross-party deal came hours before the US government risked running out of money to pay its bills."There are no winners," Mr Obama said, adding the US would "bounce back".The deal followed 16 days of partial government shutdown, which began when Congress failed to agree on a budget.Congress voted through the deal less than a day before a deadline to raise the $16.7tn (£10.5tn) debt limit.The measure approved in Washington funds the government to 15 January, and extends the US treasury department's borrowing authority until 7 February.The deal does not resolve the budgetary issues that fiercely divide Republicans and Democrats. Instead, it establishes a cross-party committee of legislators tasked with crafting a long-term budget deal over the coming months.A faction of Republicans in the hardline Tea Party movement had pushed for the confrontation as a way to gut Mr Obama's healthcare reform.However, Mr Obama and the Democrats refused to negotiate, and the law commonly known as Obamacare escaped relatively unscathed.On Thursday, Mr Obama thanked congressional leaders for their help ending the government shutdown and raising the debt limit, but said both had "inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy"."Nothing has done more to undermine our economy the last three years than the kind of tactics that create these kinds of manufactured crises," he said.Mr Obama said politicians had to stop listening to "talking heads" and activists "who profit from conflict" and instead focus on growing the economy and creating a responsible budget."The American people are completely fed up with Washington," he said. "How business is done in this town has to change."Mr Obama called the political crises "a spectacle" which had hurt America's credibility in the world.And to the conservative Republicans who pushed the showdown as a way to extract policy concessions, he said, "Go out there and win an election."Politicians, bankers and economists had warned of global economic calamity unless an agreement to raise the US government's borrowing limit were reached.IMF head Christine Lagarde's positive response to the news was tempered by a call for further action."It will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner," she said in a statement.Economists have estimated the shutdown cost the US economy billions of dollars.The shutdown affected Americans and visitors to the US in countless ways: most national parks were closed, medical research ground to a halt, and ordinary paperwork went unfinished, delaying visa applications, business permits and safety inspections.Hundreds of thousands of employees were put on leave without pay during the shutdown, with many forced to delay purchases or even payment of routine bills. A few days into the shutdown Congress passed a law ensuring they would receive back pay.Before dawn on Thursday, the US Office of Personnel Management, which manages the federal workforce, announced in a terse statement on its website that government workers should return to work as regularly scheduled.A senior manager at the Department of the Interior, which oversees the national parks system and other public land, reminded employees to disable "out of office" email messages, change voicemail prompts, and "check on any refrigerators and throw out any perished food"."We appreciate your sacrifices through these difficult times and we understand that the lapse in government activities has imposed hardships on you, your families, and the people we serve," Rhea Suh, assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, wrote.Federal workers returning to the downtown Washington DC office of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were greeted by Vice-President Joe Biden and a welcome note from their boss, agency head Gina McCarthy."I know the past couple of weeks have been difficult, especially for families," Ms McCarthy wrote. "Let me be one of the first to welcome you back to EPA and tell you that we have certainly missed you!"A security officer at the building said the shutdown had been "depressing" and had made her realise how much she enjoyed her job."I enjoy checking in 500 people every day," said Ettereteen Welch.Spurred on by hardline conservatives, congressional Republicans forced the stand-off by linking budget measures to healthcare reform.Despite reluctant support from the House Republican leadership for the bill approved on Wednesday, most of the party's lawmakers in the House voted against it.Among those who opposed it was chairman of the House budget committee Paul Ryan, who called the deal a "missed opportunity"."Today's legislation won't help us reduce our fast-growing debt," he said."In my judgement, this isn't a breakthrough. We're just kicking the can down the road."Republican Senator John McCain told the BBC he was "very relieved" that the political crisis had ended."I'm guardedly optimistic and confident that we won't revisit it this way again," he said."The reaction of the American people is very, very negative, and understandably so."</body>

      <body>Chemical weapons inspectors in Syria have been unable to access one of the designated sites because of safety concerns, the world's chemical weapons watchdog has told the BBC.It is the first time they have been unable to complete a scheduled visit, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) spokesman said.But overall the experts were pleased with their progress so far, he said.Their mission to rid Syria of chemical weapons was set up by a UN resolution.It followed international outrage at a chemical weapons attack near the Syrian capital Damascus in August.Meanwhile, Syrian state TV reports that a Canadian United Nations worker, missing since February, has been released in Damascus.Carl Campeau had been working as a legal adviser to the UN Disengagement Observer Force that patrols the ceasefire line between Syria and Israel in the Golan Heights.The Syrian government says the Canadian was kidnapped by rebels but has now been handed over to a UN representative.The OPCW's work in Syria marks the first time the international chemical weapons watchdog - which won this year's Nobel Peace Prize - has been asked to oversee the destruction of a weapons armoury during a conflict.The organisation, which is based in the Dutch city of The Hague, said the team in Syria had completed nearly 50% of their work of inspecting more than 20 sites and destroying equipment.Under the UN resolution, Syria's chemical weapons production equipment must be destroyed by 1 November and stockpiles must be disposed of by mid-2014.The deadline for Syria to submit its "destruction plan" was 15 November, the OPCW said on Thursday.But despite the good progress, inspectors were forced to turn back at one site after failing to receive assurances that they would be safe, OPCW spokesman Michael Luhan told the BBC.There had been a number of security incidents over the last few days, which had given them "cause for concern", he said.On Wednesday night there had been a mortar attack near the hotel the inspectors are staying in in Damascus and over the weekend a number of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were detonated in cars nearby, he said.Meanwhile, an international conference on a political solution to Syria's conflict could take place in Geneva on 23-24 November, Qadri Jamil, Syria's deputy prime minister, said on Thursday.He made the announcement after talks at the foreign ministry in Russia, Syria's main international ally.More than 100,000 people have been killed in the fighting that has ravaged Syria for two-and-a-half years, according to the UN.More than two million people have fled Syria and some 4.5 million have been forced from their homes within the country.Casualty figures vary for the chemical weapons attack on the Ghouta agricultural belt around Syria's capital, Damascus, on 21 August.It was estimated to have killed hundreds of people. The United States and other Western powers blamed the attack on President Bashar al-Assad's forces.But Mr Assad accuses Syrian rebels of being behind it.</body>

      <body>Campaign group Amnesty International has urged Iran not to go ahead with a repeat execution for a drug smuggler who survived a botched hanging.The condemned man, named as Alireza M, was found alive in a morgue after being hanged at a jail in the north-eastern city of Bojnord last week.He is now being nursed to recovery in preparation for his repeat execution."The verdict was the death sentence, and it will be carried out once the man gets well again," an official said.Human rights groups believe Iran is second only to China in the number of people it puts to death for crimes ranging from murder and rape to spying and drug-trafficking.In a separate incident reported by Iranian media on Monday, relatives of a condemned murderer in the western province of Ilam tried to stop his execution at a prison by hurling a grenade.Around 30 people were injured but the hanging went ahead.Alireza M, 37, was left to hang for 12 minutes, after which a doctor declared him dead.But when the prisoner's family went to collect his body from the prison morgue the next day, they found he was still breathing."We found him alive again, which made his two daughters very happy," an unnamed family member told Iranian state media.The man was then moved to a hospital where he was being kept under armed guard."The horrific prospect of this man facing a second hanging, after having gone through the whole ordeal already once, merely underlines the cruelty and inhumanity of the death penalty," said Philip Luther, director of Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa Programme, in a press release.He called for both a stay of execution for the hanging survivor and a moratorium on all executions in Iran.According to Amnesty, at least 508 people may have been executed in Iran this year to date. Most of those killed had been convicted of drug trafficking, it said.</body>

      <body>The Guardian journalist who broke the Snowden leaks story is to join a new media project being set up by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.Glenn Greenwald confirmed he was leaving the UK newspaper for the mass media outlet being planned by the French-born billionaire.Laura Poitras, the documentary-maker who connected Greenwald with Edward Snowden, is also expected to join.Mr Snowden leaked details of US government surveillance programmes.The former US intelligence contractor is now living in Russia, where he was granted temporary asylum after fleeing Hong Kong in June, shortly after the revelations were published.On Wednesday, British Prime Minister David Cameron accused The Guardian of having knowingly compromised national security by publishing the leaks.Greenwald, a US citizen based in Brazil, insists that none of the information he published could have damaged national security.Announcing his new project in a statement, Mr Omidyar said he wanted to support "independent journalists in a way that leverages their work to the greatest extent possible, all in support of the public interest".His project, he said, was in its early stages but he had approached Greenwald and found that he and fellow Americans Poitras and Jeremy Scahill, an investigative journalist, were already contemplating something similar."We had a lot of overlap in terms of our ideas, and decided to join forces," said Mr Omidyar.The billionaire said his new outlet would be independent of other media with the focus on allowing independent journalists to "pursue the truth in their fields"."And, I want to find ways to convert mainstream readers into engaged citizens," he said in the statement.Mr Omidyar's existing projects include the US-based Omidyar Network, a philanthropic investment firm which operates in some of Africa's most troubled countries.Forbes magazine estimated the Frenchman's net worth to be $8.5bn (£5.3bn; 6.3bn euros) last month.Announcing his departure in a statement on Tuesday, Greenwald said he was embarking on a "once-in-a-career dream journalistic opportunity".</body>

      <body>Eleven Nobel prize-winners have written to Vladimir Putin asking the Russian president to drop charges against 30 Greenpeace activists and journalists.The 30, who come from 18 nations, were held last month during a protest against oil drilling in the Arctic.The signatories - including Archbishop Desmond Tutu - described the charges of piracy as "excessive".But Mr Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, responded that the president had no power to influence the courts.The Greenpeace activists, who complain of being detained in harsh conditions, face up to 15 years in prison if convicted.So far all bail applications in the case have been refused.The Netherlands has launched legal action to try to free the activists and the ship, and more than 1.4m people have joined a Greenpeace campaign demanding their release.In the letter, which was released by Greenpeace, the laureates urge Mr Putin "to do all you can to ensure that the excessive charges of piracy against the 28 Greenpeace activists, freelance photographer and freelance videographer are dropped, and that any charges brought are consistent with international and Russian law."We were heartened by your statement, on September 25th, that you did not believe the Greenpeace crew members were pirates," the letter goes on to say."As you know, the Greenpeace activists were unarmed and used only peaceful means to demonstrate their opposition to the oil drilling operations threatening the Arctic."Arctic oil drilling is a dangerous, high-risk enterprise. An oil spill under these icy waters would have a catastrophic impact on one of the most pristine, unique and beautiful landscapes on earth," the letter continues.It is also signed by former East Timor President Jose Ramos Horta, Northern Irish peace campaigner Betty Williams, and Iranian human rights activist Shirin Ebadi.But Putin spokesman Mr Peskov said the laureates had addressed their appeal to the wrong person, reported Russian news agency RIA Novosti."The president treats Nobel prize winners and their opinions with great respect and attention. But in this case, the president is a wrong addressee," the agency quoted him as saying.He said President Putin could not file or drop charges."Investigative bodies deal with it, and everyone should wait for the end of the investigation process and the court's verdict."A law is a law," he added.</body>

      <body>Thousands of schoolchildren in Paris and other parts of France have been demonstrating in anger over the expulsion of two foreign teenagers.Twenty secondary schools in the French capital were disrupted as children joined a march, clenching fists in solidarity with the expelled pupils.Some demanded the sacking of the Interior Minister, Manuel Valls.In one case, a Roma schoolgirl was sent back to Kosovo and in the other, a student was repatriated to Armenia.There has been widespread indignation at the manner in which border police picked up schoolgirl Leonarda Dibrani, whose family had lost its bid for asylum in France after five years in the country.Leonarda, 15, was escorted from her school bus by a teacher, in front of other children, in the eastern region of Doubs on 9 October.The row has caused strains within the government of Socialist President Francois Hollande, whose most popular minister with the wider public is Mr Valls, according to recent opinion polls.Mr Valls has drawn protests over his hard line on Roma immigrants, which is reminiscent of Mr Hollande's conservative predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy.Schoolchildren left class to show solidarity both with Leonarda and Khatchik Kachatryan, a 19-year-old student in Paris who was expelled on Saturday to Armenia.Mr Kachatryan was arrested for shoplifting in September, at which point police discovered he had entered France illegally, the French daily Le Figaro reports.Reports suggest that he was detained on his return to the former Soviet republic for seeking to escape doing military service."Bring back Khatchik and Leonarda, they belong here," marching pupils chanted on Thursday, holding up signs calling for Mr Valls to resign.The president of France's National High School Students' Union, Ivan Dementhon, said students were angry at the way the Dibrani family had been treated."The expulsion of the young Leonarda is particularly shocking because it was done in a school environment," he said."It's not tolerable that students with or without documents are expelled. Everybody should have a right to education, and that is why all high school students are here."Journalists who visited the Dibrani family in Kosovo on Wednesday found them living in a house in the northern town of Mitrovica, despite earlier suggestions that they were homeless.It has also emerged that the father, Resat, was investigated by the French authorities for allegedly beating his family.Mr Valls insists that the deportation of Leonarda and the rest of her family was carried out in line with established procedure."It is of course a difficult subject but any immigration policy requires respect for the law, respect for individuals and great firmness," he said this week. "I am accountable for that to the French people."Amnesty International recently reported that more than 10,000 Roma had been evicted from temporary camps in France in the first half of the year.Some 20,000 Roma have settled in France, coming mainly from Romania, Bulgaria and parts of the former Yugoslavia like Kosovo.</body>

      <body>At least 15 people have been killed in a suicide bomb in a village near the northern Iraqi city of Mosul.The attack hit the village of Mwafaqiya in Nineveh province, inhabited by members of the Shabak minority.The Shabak largely follow a faith considered an offshoot of Shia Islam. No group has said it carried out the latest attack but the Shabak have been targeted by Sunni Muslim militants.Sectarian violence has surged across Iraq in recent months.Qusay Abbas, a former Shabak representative in the Mosul provincial council, said the attack happened early in the morning."A suicide truck bomber detonated himself amidst the houses of my village," he told Reuters."There are still some people under the debris of their houses."The UN envoy to Iraq, Nickolay Mladenov, condemned the attack in a statement and called for an end to the violence."The recent rise in violence in the Nineveh province calls for urgent action and strengthened security cooperation" between the central government and local officials, as well as with authorities in the Kurdish autonomous region that borders Nineveh, Mr Mladenov said.Correspondents say the failure of the Shia-led government to address the grievances of Iraq's Sunni Arab minority - which complains of being excluded from government jobs and senior posts and of abuses by security forces - has driven the surge in unrest.Last month, a suicide bomb attack on a Shabak funeral in Nineveh killed more than 20 people.Violence has reached its highest level since 2008, with the UN saying that more than 5,700 people have been killed across the country this year.Almost 1,000 people were killed and more than 2,000 wounded in September alone, the UN says, one of the highest monthly dead tolls for years.</body>

      <body>Security has been increased in Uganda after the US warned of a terror threat similar to last month's attack by militants in neighbouring Kenya.The BBC's Patience Atuhaire in Kampala says that car boots and pedestrians' bags are being searched as they enter the Nakumatt Oasis shopping centre.Government spokesman Ofwono Opondo told the BBC he was glad that the US had passed on its intelligence.Somalia's al-Shabab attacked Kampala in 2010, killing more than 70 people.Two restaurants where patrons were watching the football World Cup on TV were hit by suicide bombers.Al-Shabab also says it was behind the September attack on the Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi, in which at least 67 people were killed.Both Uganda and Kenya have sent troops to Somalia to help the UN-backed government fight the militants.The US embassy in Kampala said it was assessing the reports of a possible attack but said it had no information about when or where it might happen.Mr Opondo told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme that the security services had already thwarted several terror attacks in Uganda."The reason they have not been successful is that security has been able to get good information in good time and neutralise [the attacks] in good time," he said.</body>

      <body>Five children have been killed by an old mortar shell as they dug for scrap metal in South Sudan's capital, Juba.The five were looking for metal in an old army barracks, a military spokesman told the BBC.The BBC's James Copnall says unexploded ordinance and mines remain a big problem in South Sudan, following decades of civil war.There are clear-up operations under way in several areas of South Sudan, but such explosions kill people every year.The children, aged 10-14, were killed in a former barracks in Juba's Souk Sita district, army spokesman Col Philip Aguer said.He said that a Ugandan man who was with them, presumably to buy the scrap metal, was wounded.South Sudan gained independence in 2011 after a long conflict with the north but it remains one of the world's least developed countries.In addition to the explosives left over from the war, rebels have been accused of laying new mines, particularly in Unity state near the border with Sudan, our correspondent reports.This has at times made travel around the area dangerous, he adds.</body>

      <title>Syrian refugees 'detained in Egypt'</title>
      <description>Syrian refugees fleeing to Egypt face unlawful detention, often in deplorable conditions, or deportation, Amnesty International says.</description>

      <body>Syrian refugees in Egypt often face illegal detention or deportation, Amnesty International says.The authorities are holding hundreds of Syrian refugees in deplorable conditions, among them children as young as one, the rights group says.Some of them are accused of being Muslim Brotherhood supporters, and being complicit in the recent political violence in Egypt, Amnesty said.The Egyptian authorities have not yet responded to the findings.The UN estimates that by the end of 2014 more than eight million Syrians could have been forced from their homes, and the number of refugees outside Syria could hit 5.2 million.Syria's civil war began in the wake of the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011, which saw Egypt's long-time President Hosni Mubarak toppled."The Egyptian authorities have a duty to provide protection to anyone who has fled the conflict in Syria and is seeking safe refuge in their country," Sherif Elsayed Ali, Amnesty International's head of refugee and migrants' rights, said in a statement."At present Egypt is failing abysmally to meet its international obligations to protect even the most vulnerable refugees."Instead of offering vital help and support... the Egyptian authorities are arresting and deporting them."Prior to the military ousting of President Mohammed Morsi, Syrian refugees told Amnesty International that they felt safe and protected in Egypt.However, in July and August, following Mr Morsi's removal, their situation turned for the worse when some public figures and parts of the mainstream media started accusing Syrians of being supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and taking part in pro-Morsi demonstrations, Amnesty said."My kids can't play outside anymore. They are cursed by the other kids, told really bad words… There were 1,700 [refugees] living in the area, but now there are no more than 500," a Syrian refugee in a suburb of 6 October City outside Cairo told Amnesty this month.The campaign group's report - "We cannot live here any more": Refugees from Syria in Egypt - says this change in atmosphere has prompted some Syrians to try to reach Europe by boat.Many of those detained had been stopped whilst trying to make the hazardous crossing across the Mediterranean Sea.The report says the Egyptian navy has intercepted around 13 boats since August and, according to UN refugee agency, arrested 946 people, 724 of whom remain in detention.Several lawyers said they were prevented from representing refugees detained in police stations along the Mediterranean coast, the report said.Scores of Syrian children are being detained, many without their parents and some detainees have been held in unsanitary conditions in police stations without food or medical assistance, it said.During a visit to a police station in the port city of Alexandria last week, Amnesty researchers found about 40 Syrian refugees unlawfully and indefinitely detained, including 10 children, the youngest of whom were one-year-old twins held there since 17 September.Several detainees told Amnesty International that police threatened to transfer them to Al-Khalifa prison in Cairo unless they signed papers accepting deportation to countries in the region or back to Syria.Lawyers told researchers that in at least two instances refugees were collectively deported back to Damascus, Amnesty says.Earlier this month a group of 36 mostly Palestinian refugees from Syria were deported to Damascus.Amnesty said many of them are believed to have been detained in Damascus at the Palestine Branch of Syrian Military Intelligence, one of the most feared sections of Syria's secret service."Sending refugees back to a bloody conflict zone is a serious violation of international law," Mr Ali said.The report was also critical of new restrictions on Syrian nationals entering Egypt, requiring them to have a visa and security clearance before arrival.</body>

      <body>China's capital, Beijing, has announced measures to combat worsening air pollution, state-run media report.They include taking half of the city's four million private cars off the roads on days when there are serious levels of pollution.The system will be based on a vehicle's licence plate - odd numbers will be allowed on the roads one day, even numbers the next.Motor vehicles are considered a major source of pollution.The new system will give out four different degrees of air pollution warning - blue, yellow, amber and red, Xinhua news agency reports.On days when an amber warning is given, factories will stop production and work will be halted on construction and building sites.Restaurants which offer an open-air barbecue will be ordered to close temporarily and fireworks will be banned throughout the city.When a red warning is issued, the new car restriction measure will be implemented. Schools and kindergartens will also be closed.The measure to restrict the number of private cars from using the road is proving to be controversial.Critics have aired their concern that those who can afford to buy two or more cars will able to drive any day when the restriction is in force.Users of Weibo, China's version of Twitter, have also criticised the restriction for targeting ordinary people as cars used by government officials and civil servants are exempted.One user said that whenever there is a problem in Beijing, "ordinary people are the first to be forced to pay the price for it".Beijing has almost 21 million permanent residents, according to official estimates.There is also a large migrant population in the city, but no exact official figures are available.Most people relied on bicycles and public transport to get around in the city before private car ownership became popular.</body>

      <body>American film director Michael Bay has been injured in an attack in Hong Kong while filming on the set of his latest Transformers film.Two men have been arrested on suspicion of blackmail and assault after they demanded money from the film crew, police have said.Mr Bay, 48, received injuries to the right side of his face.But he declined to seek treatment and continued filming in a busy area of Hong Kong island.A local newspaper in Hong Kong reported that three men caused what it called "a huge disturbance" to the filming of the American science fiction film.It said that the men could have missed out on disturbance fees which the film crew paid to shop and business owners whose businesses were likely to be affected during filming.The two men approached Mr Bay on the set during filming, a police spokeswoman told Reuters.One of them demanded payment of HK$100,000 ($12,900; £8,030).As the discussion continued, the man assaulted Mr Bay and also attacked three police officers who tried to intervene, police say.The officers received treatment at hospital for minor injuries.Police also arrested a third man at the scene.There has been no comment from Mr Bay or his crew on the incident.The fourth instalment of the Transformers franchise starring Mark Wahlberg and Nicola Peltz is scheduled for public release in June 2014.Hong Kong's striking Victoria Harbour is believed to be among the film's locations, along with the city's dense and bustling streets.</body>

      <title>Scientist 'solves' yeti mystery</title>
      <description>Research by a British scientist concludes the legendary Himalayan yeti may in fact be a sub-species of brown bear.</description>

      <body>Research by a British scientist has concluded that the legendary Himalayan yeti may in fact be a sub-species of brown bear.DNA tests on hair samples carried out by Oxford University genetics professor Bryan Sykes found that they matched those from an ancient polar bear.He subjected the hairs to the most advanced tests available.He says the most likely explanation for the myth is that the animal is a hybrid of polar bears and brown bears.Prof Sykes told the BBC that there may be a real biological animal behind the yeti myth."I think this bear, which nobody has seen alive,... may still be there and may have quite a lot of polar bear in it," he said."It may be some sort of hybrid and if its behaviour is different from normal bears, which is what eyewitnesses report, then I think that may well be the source of the mystery and the source of the legend."Prof Sykes conducted the DNA tests on hairs from two unidentified animals, one from Ladakh - in northern India on the west of the Himalayas - and the other from Bhutan, 1,285km (800 miles) further east.The results were then compared with the genomes of other animals that are stored on a database of all published DNA sequences.Prof Sykes found that he had a 100% match with a sample from an ancient polar bear jawbone found in Svalbard, Norway, that dates back to between 40,000 and 120,000 years ago - a time when the polar bear and closely related brown bear were separating as different species.The species are closely related and are known to interbreed where their territories overlap.The sample from Ladakh came from the mummified remains of a creature shot by a hunter around 40 years ago, while the second sample was in the form of a single hair, found in a bamboo forest by an expedition of filmmakers around 10 years ago.Prof Sykes said that his results were "completely unexpected" and that more work needed to be done interpreting them.He said that while they did not mean that "ancient polar bears are wandering around the Himalayas", there could be a sub-species of brown bear in the High Himalayas descended from an ancestor of the polar bear."Or it could mean there has been more recent hybridisation between the brown bear and the descendant of the ancient polar bear," he said.In 2008 scientists in the US examined hairs given to the BBC which some had claimed were from a yeti.The scientists concluded that in fact the hairs - obtained from the north-east Indian state of Meghalaya - belonged to a species of Himalayan goat known as a Himalayan Goral.</body>

      <body>A Pacific Islander is attempting to claim asylum in New Zealand on grounds that climate change is threatening his country.Ioane Teitiota told New Zealand's High Court that parts of his homeland, Kiribati, were already swamped by rising sea levels.He is attempting to appeal against an immigration department decision to refuse him asylum.The high court has reserved a decision on his appeal."There's no future for us when we go back to Kiribati," Mr Teitiota told the tribunal.He said that his family, including his three New Zealand-born children, would suffer harm if forced to return to Kiribati.Most of the atolls that make up Kiribati are very low-lying and at risk from rising sea levels.Mr Teitiota has lived in New Zealand since 2007, although his work visa recently expired.His lawyer said that Mr Teitiota was being "persecuted passively by the circumstances in which he's living, which the Kiribati government has no ability to ameliorate".The immigration department had refused Mr Teitiota asylum earlier this year on the grounds that he did not face persecution or threats to his life if he returned to Kiribati."The sad reality is that the environmental degradation caused by both slow and sudden-onset natural disasters is one which is faced by the Kiribati population generally," the Immigration and Protection Tribunal wrote in June.It added that the Kiribati government was taking steps to tackle the risks posed by climate change.Last year, the Kiribati government approved a plan to buy land from Fiji in case rising sea levels forced it to relocate its citizens.On Wednesday, the Auckland High Court reserved a decision on Mr Teitiota's appeal. A decision is expected in the coming weeks.</body>

      <body>Newark Mayor Cory Booker has won a special election to represent New Jersey in the US Senate.Mr Booker, 44, defeated Republican Steve Lonegan in a race to replace Senator Frank Lautenberg, a Democrat who died in June.With almost all of the vote counted, Mr Booker led Mr Lonegan by 55% to 44%.The Democratic mayor of New Jersey's largest city will become the second black senator in the current Congress and the first from New Jersey.On Thursday, Mr Booker acknowledged the Senate's low approval ratings in the wake of the highly partisan government shutdown and debt ceiling debate.But, he told MSNBC television's Morning Joe he was a "scrapper" who looked forward to tackling tough issues."I'm hoping to join with a lot of good people from both sides of the aisle," he said.Considered a conservative activist, Steve Lonegan, 57, is a former mayor in Bogota, New Jersey, and the former New Jersey state director of Americans for Prosperity - a group funded by the billionaire Koch brothers, which advocates a limited role for government.Mr Booker has been mayor of Newark since 2006, when he came to power promising to turn round a city suffering from high unemployment, public corruption and rampant crime.Widely billed as a rising star in the Democratic Party, Mr Booker is a progressive on social issues, supporting same-sex marriage, healthcare reform and gun control.Both candidates sought to boost their campaigns with the backing of celebrities.While Mr Lonegan received the support of the former Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Cory Booker won the endorsement of US talk show host Oprah Winfrey.Mr Booker will serve the remaining 15 months of the late Mr Lautenberg's term and will have to run for re-election in November 2014.When he arrives in the Senate, replacing Republican appointee Jeff Chiesa, the Democrats will increase their control of the upper chamber to 55-45.</body>

      <body>A 25-year-old Mexican with the autistic condition Asperger's has won the right to make key decisions about his life without parental consent.The Supreme Court ruled in favour of Ricardo Adair by four votes to one.Mr Adair said that Mexican legislation violated the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.It banned him from doing simple tasks by himself, such as applying for a passport, because of his condition.A judge will be appointed to agree which decisions Mr Adair will be allowed to make without the consent of a parent or guardian.The groundbreaking ruling is expected to have wider implications for the rights of people with autism in Latin America, says the BBC's Will Grant."I want to be allowed to decide what to do, where to go, where and with whom I want to live or travel, where to work or study," Mr Adair told the Mexican Supreme Court.Mexican legislation makes straightforward tasks, such as buying a mobile phone, enrolling in university or applying for a driving licence, very difficult for people with Asperger's syndrome or other forms of autism.Mr Adair said all papers had to be signed by his parents or legal guardians.He began his battle two years ago and has been supported in his fight by a non-profit organisation."All we wanted was for Ricardo's own free will to come first, and now the court has recognised that," his lawyer, Andres Gomez Montt, told the BBC.Mr Adair said he wanted to read the full court ruling before making further comments, but expressed his satisfaction at the decision."They have asserted our rights and I believe this is a great step forward," he said.Mexican legislation on people with disabilities was drafted with the intention of protecting them, by taking away legal responsibility for their actions, but Mr Adair's mother says the law is out of date."Many children have different levels of disability. Some need more support, some need less. This should be about giving to each one what they need," Leticia Robles told BBC Mundo earlier this year.The UN's World Health Organization describes autism spectrum disorders as "a group of complex brain development disorders".It affects one in each 160 children around the world on average, the WHO says."These disorders [which include Asperger's syndrome] are characterized by difficulties in social interaction and communication and a restricted and repetitive repertoire of interests and activities."</body>

      <body>At least six people have been killed and two injured in a gas explosion in the central Mexican state of Puebla, officials say.It is not yet clear what caused the blast at the natural gas storage plant at the Chachapa industrial park.The explosion set off a fire which engulfed much of the area.The main highway linking Mexico City and Veracruz was closed for more than four hours as firefighters brought the blaze under control.Businesses and homes were evacuated in a radius of 3km (two miles).The blast occurred at 18:30 local time (23:30 GMT) at the plant owned by Tomza Gas. Local officials said most of the workers had already finished their shift, keeping the number of casualties relatively low.Four of the bodies were found soon after the blast. Two other burnt bodies were found later in the plant's rubble.The victims have not been identified.Governor Rafael Moreno Valle has visited the site.Some 100 people who spent the night in hostels and improvised shelter have now been allowed to return home.Tomza sells and install gas tanks and cylinders for household, commercial and industrial use.There have been a series of gas-related accidents in Mexico. More than 20 people were killed when a lorry carrying gas tanks exploded on a highway on the outskirts of Mexico City in May.And in September 2012, 26 people died in a fire at a gas plant owned by the state oil company Pemex in the city of Reynosa.</body>

      <body>An appeal court in Tunisia has acquitted rapper Ahmed Ben Ahmed, known as Klay BBJ, on charges of insulting the authorities in his songs.The rapper was jailed in September for six months for insulting the police at a concert in the resort of Hammamet."The court has decided to reject the accusations," the AFP news agency quotes the judge as saying.During the performance in August, he sang alongside fellow rapper Weld El 15, who has been on the run since then.They had both initially been sentenced in absentia in August to 21 months in prison.Klay BBJ lost an appeal in September and was immediately jailed.But on his second appeal hearing in Grombalia, south of the capital, Tunis, the judge said his sentenced had been annulled and he was released.Weld El 15, whose real name is Ala Yaacoub, has been in trouble before for his song The Police Are Dogs.He was given a two-year sentence in June, which was later suspended but he went into hiding following his latest conviction in August.Since the 2011 revolution, which toppled long-time President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, there have been tensions between secular Tunisians and Islamists."Our songs criticise the current situation in Tunisia and the government, no more and no less," AFP news agency quoted Klay BBJ as saying in September.A coalition led by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party has been in government since elections in 2011.</body>

      <description>Sportswear company Puma cancels a lengthy contract with the South Africa FA because of match-fixing allegations involving the national team in 2010.</description>

      <body>Sportswear giant Puma has ended its association with the South African FA (Safa) following the match-fixing scandal involving the national team.The news comes two days after banking group Absa ended its six-year association with Bafana Bafana.In December, a Fifa investigation found 'compelling evidence' that four South Africa friendlies had been fixed prior to their hosting of the 2010 World Cup.In a statement, Puma announced the deal had ended with "immediate effect"."Following match fixing allegations made against Safa along with inappropriate responses from within the football organisation (including the suspension of senior officials), PUMA terminated the contract with immediate effect," the press release read.Former Safa president Kirsten Nematandani, who lost his post in last month's elections, and four fellow officials were suspended in 2012 before being reinstated a month later pending further investigation.South Africa, which staged the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations earlier this year, has failed to qualify for the 2014 World Cup, so becoming the first hosts to miss the next edition of the tournament in a quarter of a century.The country's football has been in a steady state of decline since winning the Africa Cup of Nations in 1996, with the side's last actual qualification for the World Cup coming back in 2002.Yet Puma has blamed the 2010 games against Thailand, Bulgaria, Colombia and Guatemala as the primary reason for ending a deal that began in 2011 and which was expected to run until at least 2018."PUMA abides by a code of ethics in all areas of its business operations and expects its partners to adhere to the same values," its statement read."PUMA would like to state that with notable exception to the issues in question it enjoyed a good working relationship with SAFA, and wishes them well for the future."Safa has yet to publicly comment on the matter.</body>

      <body>A woman who was gang-raped in the Indian city of Mumbai in August has fainted in court while giving evidence.The photojournalist, who was attacked while on assignment in a deserted mill, was taken to a local hospital.Earlier the victim, aged 22, identified four of the men accused of raping her.Women's safety has been the focus of attention in India since a brutal gang rape and murder in Delhi last year, after which the Indian government strengthened its sexual violence laws.The photojournalist, who cannot be identified, had been giving evidence for more than four hours when she collapsed, said public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam.The victim was very composed, but was "under mental pressure", Mr Nikam told the BBC.He said she had identified all four men who stood trial in court on Thursday. A fifth suspect is being tried separately by a juvenile court.The photographer also identified pornographic video clips that she said she was shown while she was raped, said the special public prosecutor.Proceedings were stopped when the rape survivor collapsed, Mr Nikam said.Last month, four men were convicted and sentenced to death over the gang-rape and murder of a young woman in Delhi in December.The case led to widespread protests across India and highlighted the extent of attacks on women in the country.A bill containing harsher punishments for rapists, including the death penalty, was approved by India's parliament earlier this year.But many working in the legal system say not enough is done to protect those who bring rape cases to court.</body>

      <body>A plane carrying 49 passengers and crew that crashed in southern Laos hit bad weather as it came into land, officials in the South East Asian nation said.The Lao Airlines plane, flying from the capital Vientiane, crashed into the Mekong river on Wednesday near its destination of Pakse.All 44 passengers and five crew are believed to have died.Footage of the scene on Thursday showed divers in the Mekong river, pulling out parts of the wreckage.The passengers and crew came from a total of 10 nations, the airline said.Seventeen Laos nationals were on board, plus travellers from France, Australia, Thailand, Vietnam, Canada, China, Malaysia, Taiwan and the US."Upon preparing to land at Pakse Airport the aircraft ran into extreme bad weather conditions and was reportedly crashed into the Mekong river,'' the Laos Ministry of Public Works and Transport said in a statement.State-run Laos news agency quoted an eyewitness as saying that the plane "appeared to be hit by a strong wind, causing its head to ascend and pushing it away from the airport area".A senior aviation official from Laos was quoted in other reports as saying the tail end of Typhoon Nari may have been a factor in the crash.An Agence-France Presse (AFP) reporter on the scene told of debris floating in the river and suitcases buried in mud on the river banks."The search teams in Laos are taking the bodies to a local hospital," Thai foreign ministry spokesman Sek Wannamethee told AFP.An official in Pakse was quoted as saying at least six bodies had been retrieved.The plane was an ATR 72-600 twin turboprop engine aircraft. Its manufacturer, ATR, said in a statement that the plane was "delivered from the production line in March 2013".The company said it would co-operate fully with the investigation.Australian's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said that six Australians, including four members of one family, were aboard the plane. An Australian aid worker and his father were also among those believed to have been killed.DFAT released a photo of the two Australians - father and son Gordon and Michael Creighton.The family said in a statement that they had "lost a father, a husband, a son, a brother, a fiance and a best mate in one tragic circumstance".Relatives of the Rhodes family also released a photo of Gavin, a tax consultant, his wife, Phoumalaysy and their two young children.A DFAT spokesperson said that consular officials were in contact with the families of the victims and were travelling to Pakse.However, a DFAT statement said: "Lao authorities have told our embassy in Vientiane they do not expect any survivors.''The route between the capital Vientiane and Pakse is popular with the growing numbers of tourists visiting Laos, correspondents say.Lao Airlines is small company, with just 14 aircraft in its fleet. It flies several domestic routes and has flights to other countries in the region like China, Thailand and Singapore.</body>

      <body>A French court has postponed the trial of a Norwegian neo-Nazi musician after his lawyer requested more time to read documents and prepare his defence.Kristian "Varg" Vikernes will now face trial in June 2014 on charges of inciting racial hatred and glorifying war crimes.The Norwegian was accused of planning a terrorist act after his wife, a licensed gun holder, bought weapons.French authorities later conceded there was no plot and the two were released.Mr Vikernes is a self-proclaimed neo-Nazi who was once in touch with his compatriot Anders Breivik, the Norwegian far-right militant who killed 77 people in attacks in Norway in 2011.In May 1994 Mr Vikernes received a prison sentence for murdering the guitarist of a rival black metal band and setting fire to churches in Norway.After his release in 2009 he moved to France with his wife and children.French authorities placed him under surveillance. On 16 July they arrested the couple in the southern region of Correze after the wife began buying shotguns.Officials later said she had a valid firearms permit and released the pair.Mr Vikernes has vowed to sue the French authorities for arresting him with "no good reason" and "in the most brutal way possible".He says officials have not returned his firearms or his ceremonial weaponry, including his swords, spears, and helmets.Since coming to France, Mr Vikernes has continued releasing music and writing.He will be tried on incitement charges related to postings on his blog which prosecutors say were "anti-Semitic and xenophobic".Through his writings he promotes what he calls "Odalism", an ideology based on the idea that White Europeans should re-adopt "native European values".</body>

      <title>Nazi's body moved to Italian airport</title>
      <description>The body of Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke is taken to a Rome airport after his funeral was called off, amid reports it could be sent to Germany.</description>

      <body>The coffin of Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke has been taken to a military airport near Rome after a funeral was halted following angry protests.Italian officials said contacts had been made with Germany, amid media reports that Priebke's body could be flown there.Priebke died under house arrest last week. He had been jailed for life over the killing of more than 300 civilians.Italian media say his body could be kept at the airport for the time being.A funeral in Albano Laziale, south of Rome, was called off on Tuesday amid scuffles between protesters and Nazi sympathisers.A senior official in Rome province, Giuseppe Pecoraro, was quoted on Wednesday as saying Italian authorities had "initiated contacts with Germany.""It's not in my remit to decide on a cremation or a place of burial, but we are working to resolve the situation according to what is most suitable," he said.Both Argentina - where Priebke lived for nearly 50 years before being extradited to Italy - and Priebke's hometown in Germany have previously refused to take the body.A spokesman for the German foreign ministry said he knew of no laws preventing a German who had died abroad from being buried in Germany, but that it was normally "a matter for the relatives" to decide.The row coincided with commemorations held for the 70th anniversary of the roundup of Jews in the Rome ghetto and their deportation to Auschwitz during World War II.Priebke died on Friday, aged 100.He was one of the SS officers overseeing the killing of men and boys at Rome's Ardeatine Caves in 1944, one of the worst massacres in Italy during World War II.In a reprisal for the killing of 33 German soldiers in Rome by resistance fighters, 335 Italian civilians were shot dead. It is believed that Adolf Hitler ordered 10 Italians killed for every German.Though Priebke admitted his role in the massacre, he never expressed any remorse and maintained he was following orders.He was extradited in 1994 after investigative journalists from US television network ABC News tracked him down in Argentina.In 1998, he was sentenced to life in prison. However, he pleaded that he was too old and sick for jail, and was soon allowed to switch to a regime of house arrest.The Vatican had issued an unprecedented ban on holding Priebke's funeral in any Catholic church in Rome, but a Catholic splinter group, the Society of St Pius X, offered to hold the ceremony.As the coffin was taken to the Society's seminary in Albano Laziale on Wednesday, protesters shouted "murderer" and "executioner" and clashed with Nazi sympathisers as his coffin passed."We had to cancel the funeral yesterday because there was a risk that it could have become a neo-Nazi demonstration," said Mr Pecoraro.Priebke's lawyer, Paolo Giachini, said it had been stopped because the authorities had prevented friends and family entering.</body>

      <description>World powers and Iran have had "their most detailed talks ever" on Iran's nuclear programme, the EU's top foreign policy official says.</description>

      <body>World powers and Iran have had "their most detailed talks ever" on Iran's nuclear programme, the EU's top foreign policy official Catherine Ashton says.The two sides have held two days of discussions in Geneva. Further talks will take place on 7 and 8 November.Baroness Ashton and Iranian FM Mohammad Javad Zarif called the talks "substantive and forward-looking".International negotiators were carefully considering an Iranian proposal, a joint statement said.The discussions in Geneva brought together Iranian officials and representatives of the "P5+1" - the permanent members of the UN Security Council (Britain, China, France, Russia and the US) plus Germany - also known as the E3+3."The participants also agreed that E3+3 and Iranian nuclear, scientific and sanctions experts will convene before the next meeting to address differences and to develop practical steps," the statement went on.At a news conference afterwards, Mr Zarif said he hoped the talks would lead to the "beginning of a new phase in our relations" and would help resolve "an unnecessary crisis".He said that he expected international negotiators would need time to "digest and respond to" Iran's proposal.Iran has previously said its proposal at the two-day summit in Geneva has the "capacity to make a breakthrough".In previous rounds, Iran and the world powers largely talked past one another but now they appear to be getting into actual details, the BBC's James Reynolds reports from Geneva.One official at the talks suggested that the reticence to make details of the Iranian proposal public was a positive sign - real discussions don't take place in public, our correspondent adds.White House spokesman Jay Carney said Iran had shown a "level of seriousness and substance that we have not seen before".Russia's response, however, was more cautious. "There is no reason to break into applause; things could have worked out better," Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted as saying by Interfax news agency.UK Foreign Secretary William Hague welcomed the fact that "diplomats have for the first time begun more substantive discussions with Iran"."Iran will need to take the necessary first steps on its programme and we are ready to take proportionate steps in return," he added.The West suspects Tehran of seeking to build nuclear weapons, but Iran says its programme is purely for peaceful purposes.Earlier, Deputy Foreign Minster Abbas Araqchi said snap visits to Iranian nuclear sites could be part of a "last step" of any deal.Lowering uranium enrichment levels could also be part of a final deal, Mr Araqchi told Iranian media.The Iranian team at the talks was led by Mr Zarif, although much of the actual negotiating was said to have been delegated to Mr Araqchi.The talks are the first since Hassan Rouhani - seen as a relative moderate - became Iran's president in August.International negotiators want Tehran to take specific steps to prevent it from ever being able to make nuclear weapons, the BBC's James Reynolds in Geneva reports.In return, they promise to lift some of international sanctions which have been imposed in recent years.Key international demands include the acceptance by Iran of a comprehensive verification regime - with unannounced checks - and a reduction in Iran's level of uranium enrichment.Iran subscribed to a fuller inspection regime under the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which was known as the additional protocol, until 2006.Mr Zarif said the reintroduction of the additional protocol was not currently being discussed.Western nations have demanded that Iran halt the production and stockpiling of uranium enriched to 20% - a step away from achieving a nuclear weapons capability.They also want Iran to send some of its stockpiles abroad, and shut down the Fordo production site near the city of Qom, where most of the higher-grade enrichment work is done.Since 2006 the UN Security Council has imposed a series of sanctions - including asset freezes and travel bans - on entities and people involved in Iran's nuclear programme.Separate US and EU sanctions have targeted Iran's energy and banking sectors, crippling its oil-based economy. Iran wants the sanctions lifted.Mr Araqchi had earlier insisted there could be no question of Iran relinquishing its stockpiles of enriched uranium."We will not allow even a gram of uranium to go out of the country," he was quoted as saying by Iranian media.</body>

      <body>At least 21 people have been killed by an explosion that struck a minibus in southern Syria, activists say.Six women and four children were among those who died when the vehicle hit a landmine in the town of Nawa, in the province of Deraa, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.Opposition activists blamed forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad.The area is in rebel-held territory, but is close to the Tal al-Jumaa army base, which is currently under siege.The UN says more than 100,000 people have been killed in the fighting that has ravaged Syria for two-and-a-half years - with civilians often in the firing line.The Syrian Observatory also reported on Wednesday that at least 41 people had been killed in violent clashes between Kurdish fighters and al-Qaeda-affiliated rebels in the oil-rich north-eastern province of Hassaka.Twenty-nine of the dead were from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) and al-Nusra Front, while the others were Kurdish fighters.The group also said government forces had been shelling rebel-held areas in Daraa province and the outskirts of the capital, Damascus, and carried out air raids in Hama and Idlib provinces.ISIS rebels were also involved in an incident on the border with Turkey, close to the Syrian town of Azaz. The Turkish army said it fired four artillery shells at ISIS positions in response to a mortar round that landed close to a military post inside Turkey.In a separate development, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said its inspectors had "conducted verification activities" at a total of 11 sites in Syria identified by the government as part of its chemical weapons programme.Activities had also included "critical equipment destruction at six sites as well as some Category 3 weapons destruction", a statement added.Unfilled munitions and devices, and any other equipment designed to aid in the deployment of chemical weapons, fall into Category 3.Syria acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and agreed to the destruction of its chemical weapons arsenal after hundreds of people were killed on 21 August, when rockets filled with the nerve agent sarin were fired at several suburbs of Damascus.The Syrian government and opposition blame each other for the attack.</body>

      <title>British Gas raises prices by 9.2%</title>

      <body>British Gas is to increase prices for domestic customers, with a dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2% from 23 November.The increase, which will affect nearly eight million households in the UK, includes an 8.4% rise in gas prices and a 10.4% increase in electricity prices.The company said it "understands the frustration" of prices rising faster than incomes. The average annual household bill will go up by £123.PM David Cameron has urged consumers to switch suppliers for the best deal.Energy Minister Ed Davey has described the latest price rise as "extremely disappointing news" for customers.Rival SSE has already announced an 8.2% increase in bills from 15 November.On average, customers will see a dual-fuel bill increase to £1,444 a year.However, there are significant regional variations. On average, the biggest increase in a dual-fuel bill is an 11.2% rise in the north of Scotland, in the Scottish Hydro Electric region. The smallest is a 6.8% increase in the south west of England.The company said that the cost of buying energy on the global markets, delivering gas and electricity to customers' homes, and the government's "green" levies, were all factors in the decision to put up prices."I know these are difficult times for many customers and totally understand the frustration that so many household costs keep on rising when incomes are not keeping pace," said Ian Peters, managing director of British Gas Residential Energy."We haven't taken this decision lightly, but what is pushing up energy prices at the moment are costs that are not all directly under our control."The company, which operates as Scottish Gas in Scotland, said it made a profit of five pence in the pound after tax.British Gas, the UK's biggest energy supplier, said in May that a profit boost would be used to delay future price rises. This came because customers used 18% more gas in the first four months of the year owing to the cold weather.At the time, a spokesman said: "We will use that [cold weather benefit] to effectively hold prices for as long as possible."Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%.Caroline Flint, shadow energy secretary, said: "These latest price rises show clearer than ever why Labour's price freeze is needed." Party leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election.But the prime minister branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas.Mr Cameron also said he was disappointed with the British Gas' announcement."I would encourage customers who are not happy with the service they're getting, are not happy with the prices, to go to the switching sites online and see whether they can get a better deal," he said.Pressed on whether the government could do more to tackle the underlying issues, Mr Cameron added: "What we can do, which is what we are doing, is to try to get new suppliers into the market."Energy Minister Ed Davey also described the latest price rise as "extremely disappointing news" for customers of British Gas. He questioned the claim that costs imposed by the government were increasing as much as bills and told the Commons that unhappy consumers should consider switching suppliers.However, industry analysts expect other suppliers to announce price rises in the coming weeks, which could affect consumers' switching decisions."The question now is whether it will be a trickle or a stampede. However, the fact is that households will be struggling to afford to keep warm this winter," said Tom Lyon, of price comparison website Uswitch.com.Personal finance commentator and campaigner Martin Lewis said it was important that, if consumers do decide to switch, they should focus on fixed rate tariffs.Because only two of the energy companies have currently put their prices up, those who switch now are likely to be hit with price rises if they switch to another variable rate tariff.He said people can "beat the price hikes" by going to fixed tariffs.Adam Scorer, of watchdog Consumer Futures, said: "We would urge anyone worried about their energy costs to shop around to try to find a better deal and ensure they are on the cheapest payment method, such as direct debit."There are also some discounted insulation and heating measures available and we would encourage people to take advantage of this to cut their bills."Mr Davey said that British Gas would need to justify its decision "openly and transparently".Many of British Gas's customers made their annoyance at the price rise known during a Twitter question and answer session with customer service Bert Pijls earlier this afternoon.</body>

      <body>Working parents in Britain "simply do not earn enough to escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn has warned.Two-thirds of poor children are now from families where an adult works, his report found.Many low and middle-income children face being "worse off" than their parents because of falling earnings and rising prices, Mr Milburn added.Wealthier pensioners' benefits should be cut and minimum pay raised, he said.The former Labour health secretary suggested some benefits currently protected from cuts - such as free TV licences and winter fuel allowances for pensioners - could be means tested in order to share the burden of austerity more fairly.But a spokesman for David Cameron said: "The prime minister believes it is right to make commitments to pensioners in relationship to state provision."The government has pledged to safeguard such benefits until the next general election.In its first report, the government's Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission warned the target of ending child poverty by 2020 would "in all likelihood be missed by a considerable margin" - leaving as many as two million children in poverty.Poverty is defined as having a household income that is less than 60% of the national median income.The latest government figures on poverty, released in June, show the median UK household income for 2011/2012 was £427 a week - 60% of that figure was £256 a week.In that year, 17% of children, or 2.3 million, were classed as being in poverty while 15% of working-age adults, or 5.6 million, were in poverty.For pensioners, meanwhile, that figures was 16% - or 1.9 million.The report said Britain still had "high levels of child poverty and low levels of social mobility" with a rising number of children in "absolute poverty" coming from working families.Two thirds of children officially deemed as being poor now came from a family where at least one parent was working - and in three out of four of those cases, at least one of their parents was working full time, the report found.It also said the "twin problems of high youth unemployment and falling living standards" were storing up problems for the future.Among its key recommendations the report urged the government to:"Just as the UK government has focused on reducing the country's financial deficit it now needs to redouble its efforts to reduce our country's fairness deficit," the report said.Single mother Judith Healy, who works from home as a telemarketer, said that, while her wages had not gone up, her expenses had continued to increase.She said she was worried about paying energy bills this winter."We didn't ask to get in this situation, we are doing the best that we can in the circumstances that we have and that's really what it's about - it's survival now," she told BBC News.Mr Milburn told the BBC: "Today child poverty is a problem for working families rather than the workless or the work-shy."Around five million people in the country, mainly women, were earning less than the living wage, which is about £7.45 an hour outside of London, he said."These are the people frankly who do all the right things, they go out to work, they stand on their own two feet, they look after their families - they're the strivers not the shirkers - and yet they're all too often the forgotten people of Britain and I think they desperately need a new deal."Mr Milburn said that while ministers and employers could do more, it was unrealistic to expect the government to continue topping up low pay using working tax credits.He advocated a scheme for pairing bright children with the best teachers in an effort to raise attainment.Mr Milburn has previously said social mobility - the idea that individuals can better themselves in terms of educational opportunity, job prospects and salaries from one generation to the next - is "flat-lining".Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg welcomed the report, but warned that "punishing pensioners isn't going to help a single child achieve more in life".Enver Solomon, of the National Children's Bureau charity, said the report was "a wake-up call for all political parties by stating that our country is dramatically polarised between the haves and have- nots"."As the commission states, there is an urgent need to rebalance the distribution of resources so that the burden of austerity is more equally shared," he said.Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said the "powerful report" showed "ordinary families' living standards [were being] squeezed and social divisions [were] deepening as a result of this government's decisions to put a privileged few first".On Wednesday, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed the number of unemployed people in the UK fell by 18,000 to 2.49 million in the June-August period.</body>

      <title>Osborne agrees to China nuclear deal</title>
      <description>The Chancellor, George Osborne, announces that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.</description>

      <body>The Chancellor, George Osborne, has announced that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.The announcement also said that Chinese firms might eventually be allowed to take majority stakes in British nuclear plants.Mr Osborne made the announcement on the last day of a trade visit to China.The first China deal could be as early as next week, with the go ahead for a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site.Also on Thursday, a report commissioned for the prime minister warned of a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years.The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits".Supply is expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15.Most existing coal-fired plants are expected to be closed in 2015 to meet European Union pollution directives, while many gas-fired power plants are not being used at the moment because gas is so expensive.These would take time and money to bring back on stream.The Hinkley C project, in Somerset, will be the first new nuclear power station since 1995.Hinkley C's construction will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EDF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs.EDF has been negotiating with three Chinese nuclear giants on the Hinkley C project - CGN, CNNC and SNPTC - all of which have been seen by the chancellor this week.Our business editor, Robert Peston, says he has been told that one or two of these will end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C.A DECC spokesperson said talks about a contract were underway: "Negotiations remain ongoing between the government and EDF on the potential terms of an investment contract for Hinkley Point C. No agreement has as yet been reached."A contract will only be offered if it is value for money, fair and affordable, in line with government policy on no public subsidy for new nuclear and consistent with state-aid rules."Mr Osborne made the announcement while on a visit to a nuclear plant in southern China on Thursday which is itself a collaboration between EDF and the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG).He said: "Today is another demonstration of the next big step in the relationship between Britain and China, the world's oldest civil nuclear power and the world's fastest growing civil nuclear power."The memorandum of understanding also includes roles for British companies in China's nuclear programme.China has 17 nuclear reactors in operation, which provide about 1% of its electricity production capacity.In the future, Chinese firms might be allowed more than just minority stakes in UK plants. The government said that "over time, stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes".At the weekend, the Energy Minister, Ed Davey, said he believed that a "massive" wave of investment from China, Japan and Korea would secure UK's power supply into the future.Securing future energy supplies is a major challenge.A portion of energy bills is being diverted to alternative energy investment in wind farms and solar energy.But these, renewable, energy sources cannot provide enough power for the country's energy needs.The industry regulator, Ofgem, has also warned of the "unprecedented challenge" to secure power supplies.It said spare electricity power production capacity could fall to 2% by 2015, increasing the risk of blackouts.</body>

      <title>Windows 8.1 gets global release</title>
      <description>Microsoft has released the Windows 8.1 update for its flagship operating system.</description>

      <body>Microsoft has released the Windows 8.1 update for its flagship operating system.The download seeks to address some of the criticisms levelled at the original version of Windows 8.In particular, the update restores the start button and allows a computer to boot up with a traditional desktop interface.The launch comes at a critical time for Microsoft as it seeks a new boss, with PC sales experiencing a long decline.Windows 8 sought to bridge the gap between touchscreen devices, such as tablets and smartphones, and more traditional form laptops and desktop machines. As such it had an interface built of tiles that could be tapped or swiped to open applications.However, many people found the tiled interface did not work well for some of the things they were used to doing with a computer.The changes in 8.1 include:A host of other changes, including better support for multi-tasking and improved links to Microsoft's Xbox game console, are also in the update.Windows 8 was created to capitalise on the growing popularity of tablets and other portable gadgets. Microsoft needs to get people using its software on these machines because sales of desktop machines are in sharp decline.Global shipments of PCs hit a five-year low in early October, according to figures from market research firm Gartner. Sales of PCs had now fallen for six quarters in a row, it added. The downward trend in sales statistics were confirmed by IDC, which added that the decline would probably continue into 2014.The shrinking sales are important for Microsoft because traditionally the bulk of its revenue comes from people and companies buying laptops and desktops and office software to run on them.It is not clear that Microsoft is adjusting to the changes in the types of gadgets that people use. In July, Microsoft was wrote off $900m (£559m) following poor sales of its own-brand Surface touchscreen devices.At the same time, Microsoft has undergone a major reorganisation and has bought phone maker Nokia. It is also launching a new version of its Xbox games console and has begun searching for a new chief executive.Servers ready to dispense the update were turned on at 07:00 New York time (12:00 BST). The update is free to those already running Windows 8. Charges will apply if users upgrade to 8.1 from Windows 7. The update comes just over a year after the launch of Windows 8.</body>

      <body>US investment bank Goldman Sachs has reported a 20% drop in third quarter revenues, but protected profits by trimming employees' pay and benefits.Revenues sank to $6.27bn (£3.9bn) in the July-to-September period, as fixed income trading fell sharply.However, profit was $1.52bn, almost unchanged from a year earlier."The third quarter's results reflected a period of slow client activity," said chief executive Lloyd Blankfein in a statement.Shares in the bank fell by more than 4%, before recovering slightly.Fixed income trading revenue at the bank declined by 44%, far more than the declines seen in comparable banks such as Bank of America and JP Morgan.However, Mr Blankfein said business could improve following the deal to resolve the budget impasse in Washington."As longer term US budget issues are resolved, we could see an improvement in corporate and investor sentiment that would help lay the basis for a more sustained recovery," he said.In order to shore up its balance sheet, the bank cut costs primarily by setting aside less for bonuses and other forms of banker pay.The amount set aside for employee compensation was $2.38bn, down 35% from a year earlier.</body>

      <title>FA supports Hodgson over 'joke'</title>
      <description>The Football Association says England boss Roy Hodgson has its full support after claims he made an offensive joke.</description>

      <body>The Football Association has given its "full support" to Roy Hodgson after claims a comment made in a team-talk by the England manager caused offence.Hodgson was criticised for referring to a joke about a monkey and an astronaut at half-time in Tuesday's World Cup qualifier against Poland."He has and deserves the full support of the Football Association," FA chairman Greg Dyke said.Anti-racism campaigners Kick It Out praised the FA's "swift" response.It had called for an investigation into Hodgson's comments but, after the FA confirmed it had not received any complaints from the England players, it now considered the matter closed.A Kick It Out statement read: "We are pleased that the Football Association has investigated this matter swiftly and issued its findings immediately."If there has been no complaint on the back of the investigation then the matter can only be deemed as concluded."Kick It Out acts on behalf of the football community at large and when an allegation of a racist or discriminatory nature is made, it's the organisation's role to follow this up."Hodgson was reported  to have made the comments when trying to explain to right-back Chris Smalling that he needed to pass the ball to winger Andros Townsend more.The England manager later apologised and Townsend, 22, tweeted:  "I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was meant and none was taken!"Dyke added: "Roy Hodgson is a man of the highest integrity, an honourable man who is doing a great job with the England team."He has fully explained to us what he said and the point he was making to the players in the dressing room at half-time on Tuesday night. He has also explained the context in which he made his remarks."He has made clear there was no intent to say anything inappropriate, and he was certainly not making any comments with any racist connotation. Importantly, he has apologised for any unintended offence that may have been taken."We will be making no further comment on this story and will now be giving Roy and the team our full support as we prepare for the World Cup in Brazil."England striker Wayne Rooney also showed his support for 66-year-old Hodgson on Twitter,  and via his personal website:  "To be honest it's really annoying that something such as this should see the light of day."All the lads know what type of guy Roy is, and to try and pin some form of label on him is absolutely ridiculous. Roy spoke to Andros straight away, and he took no offence whatsoever. Hopefully that's now the end of the matter."Former England striker Stan Collymore, 42, also defended the former Fulham and West Brom boss on Twitter,  suggesting the row undermines moves to eradicate racism from the sport."Demeans every anti-racism campaigner by having cheap pop at RH [Roy Hodgson] who said nothing wrong. Makes campaigners seem over-PC and petty. They're not," he said.However, Piara Powar, executive director of Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare), told the BBC that Hodgson had got it wrong."This was a silly phrase to use in a diverse workforce," said Powar."I think some players will see it as a reflection of the type of language still used by some coaches and some attitudes that still prevail."Here is the basis of the joke which Roy Hodgson is reported to have told his players. However, it is unclear if this is the exact transcript."Nasa decided they'd finally send a man up in a capsule after sending only monkeys in the earlier missions."They fire the man and the monkey into space."The intercom crackles, 'Monkey, fire the retros.'"A little later, 'Monkey, check the solid fuel supply.'"Later still, "Monkey, check the life support systems for the man.'"The astronaut takes umbrage and radioes Nasa, 'When do I get to do something?'"Nasa replies, 'In 15 minutes - feed the monkey.'"</body>

      <body>Pakistan ended South Africa's 15-match unbeaten run with a seven-wicket victory in the first Test in Abu Dhabi.Chasing 40 to beat the world number one side on day four, Pakistan wobbled on 7-3 before completing only a fourth ever victory over the Proteas.South Africa had previously been bowled out for 249 and 232, either side of centuries from Khurram Manzoor and Misbah-ul-Haq taking Pakistan to 442.In their last Test match, Pakistan lost by 24 runs to Zimbabwe.Misbah's side had also been whitewashed 3-0 in South Africa in February, but they continued a fine run of form in the United Arab Emirates - their adopted home after a terrorist attack on the Sri Lanka team in Lahore in 2009.Since then, Pakistan are unbeaten in nine matches in the UAE - a streak that includes the 3-0 whitewash of England in 2012.Victory over the Proteas was delayed by the efforts of AB De Villiers and Robin Peterson, who at least ensured Graeme Smith's side avoided an innings defeat.The tourists began the final day on 72-4 - still 121 short of making Pakistan bat again - and slipped further into trouble at 133-6 when Faf du Plessis drilled at off-spinner Saeed Ajmal, who took a fine return catch.De Villiers, though, found an ally in Peterson for a busy stand of 57, only for the wicketkeeper to fall 10 short of a century, driving Junaid Khan to Shan Masood Khan.Peterson's defiance continued, but with Ajmal wrapping up the tail for four wickets in the innings and seven in the match, Pakistan were facing a meagre target.They stumbled as Vernon Philander and Dale Steyn tore through the top three, but Misbah, supported by Younus Khan, led his side to victory on 28 not out, sealing the win by hitting Peterson for six.Pakistan lead the two-Test series 1-0, with the second match beginning in Dubai on Wednesday.</body>

      <body>England will not be one of the top eight seeds at next year's World Cup in Brazil after sealing qualification with a 2-0 win over Poland on Tuesday.Fifa's latest world rankings determined the top seeds for the 2014 tournament.England who climbed from 17th to 10th, will now have to face one of the top-ranked nations in their group matches.But boss Roy Hodgson says he is not worried whether his team is "first or second out of the hat" when the draw takes place on 6 December.The Netherlands, who were runners-up in 2010, and 2006 winners Italy are also unseeded.But Switzerland, Belgium and Colombia are, following the release of the rankings on Thursday by football's governing body.Hosts Brazil and the remaining top seven ranked qualifiers will be kept apart in the group stages of next year's tournament.Those groups will be completed by teams from three different geographical regions.England will have to face one of Brazil, Spain, Argentina, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Colombia and probably Uruguay.Uruguay's place in Brazil depends on them winning a play-off against Jordan, ranked 70, next month. If they are beaten in the two-legged tie, the Netherlands will take the final seed ahead of Italy.The rankings' emphasis on recent results rather than teams' record in major tournaments means 2010 World Cup runners-up Netherlands and 2006 winners Italy miss out on being kept apart from the other traditional powerhouses of world football.Barring a slump down the Fifa standings for any of the three, the Netherlands, Italy and England are likely to be kept apart as high-ranked fellow European nations.France coach Didier Deschamps, whose side have to win a two-legged play-off to make the finals after finishing second to Spain in their qualifying group, has criticised the system."From my point of view it's not very logical,'' said the former Chelsea midfielder.He added that it was a "double punishment" that his side were in Group I, the only European one with five rather than six teams, meaning they had two fewer matches to earn ranking points.As well as a seed and an unseeded European qualifier, each of the World Cup groups is likely to be completed by a team from a combined Asia, Oceania and North and Central America pot and one of the unseeded African and South American qualifiers or the lowest-ranked European qualifier.Spain remain at the top of the rankings, ahead of Germany who leapfrog Argentina to take second spot.Scotland have climbed 28 places to 35th in the world after beating Croatia and Macedonia in the final two games of their unsuccessful qualification campaign.Wales are up eight places to 44th in the wake of their 1-1 draw with Belgium, while Northern Ireland drop four places to 90th following their 1-1 draw away to Israel.</body>

      <body>Glee creator Ryan Murphy has confirmed the musical show will end after the next series, it has been reported.Speaking at a media event in Los Angeles, Murphy said he had planned for the sixth season to revolve around the characters of Rachel and Finn.However, following the death of actor Cory Monteith, who played Finn, in July, he was forced to create a new ending, TV Line reported.He added he had penned a new finale that would be in Monteith's honour."The final year of the show, which will be next year, was designed around Rachel and Cory/Finn's story," Murphy said."I always knew that, I always knew how it would end. I knew what the last shot was - he was in it. I knew what the last line was - she said it to him."So when a tragedy like that happens you sort of have to pause and figure out what you want to do, so we're figuring that out now."Murphy said he planned to pitch his new ending for the show to US network Fox later this month."I think it's very satisfactory and kind of in [Monteith's] honour, which I love," he added.The show said goodbye to the actor in a special tribute episode broadcast in the US last week.In April this year, Fox renewed Glee for a fifth and sixth season as part of a two-season deal.It had been hinted the sixth series could be the last, however it was not confirmed at the time.</body>

      <body>American character actor Ed Lauter, recently seen in the Oscar-winning The Artist, has died aged 74, it has been announced.Lauter played chauffer to the female character Peppy Miller, played by Oscar nominee actress Berenice Bejo.Publicist Edward Lozzi said Lauter died on Wednesday of mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the lung, commonly caused by asbestos exposure.He also starred in ER and opposite Burt Reynolds in 1974's The Longest Yard.Lauter played a sadistic prison guard whose team squares up to Reynolds' team of misfit convicts in a game of American Football.He also starred in a 2005 remake, starring Adam Sandler.The original landed him a starring role in Alfred Hitchcock's final movie Family Plot in 1976.Last year, Lauter starred with Clint Eastwood and Justin Timberlake in the baseball movie Trouble With the Curve.The actor, who started out as a stand up comic was also famed for his impersonations of movie stars.Lozzi told the Hollywood Reporter: "He called me as Clint Eastwood from the set of Trouble With the Curve last year. We really thought it was Eastwood!"He was also known to do impersonations of black and white stars James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart.Born in Long Island, New York in 1938, Lauter made his Broadway debut in the original 1968 stage production of The Great White Hope, which also starred James Earl Jones.His TV debut was came in a 1971 episode of private eye series Mannix and he made his first big screen appearance in the Western, Dirty Little Billy.Standing at 6ft 2in and prematurely bald with a long, square face, Lauter was often cast as thugs or stern authority figures.He was quoted as saying: "I like those roles. Lee Marvin once told me, 'When you play a heavy, every once in a while make the audience like you a little bit. Then they'll think, 'Wait a minute, he's not such a bad guy. Did you see the way he petted that dog?'"Lauter played the recurring character Dick Healy in the US version of Shameless and had several projects in post-production.A charitable foundation is being established to honour his work and an annual scholarship fund will be awarded to aspiring young actors.His family, which includes four children and his wife of eight years, Mia, have asked that donations be made to the foundation.</body>

      <description>Former Smiths singer Morrissey uses his autobiography to criticise the legal system and music business and reveals his first full relationship came with a man when he was in his 30s.</description>

      <body>Former Smiths singer Morrissey has used his autobiography to criticise the UK legal system and music business; and revealed his first full relationship came with a man when he was in his 30s.The star was scathing about the judges in his 1990s legal battle with former bandmate Mike Joyce, describing one as the "pride of the pipsqueakery".The Smiths' record label Rough Trade, he said, had been "brutally drab".And he accused music paper NME of being out to "get Morrissey" in the 1990s.The star, who is normally protective of his private life, opened up about a relationship with Jake Walters that began in 1994.He wrote about how Walters followed him back to his house after meeting him at a restaurant and "steps inside and stays for two years"."For the first time in my life the eternal 'I' becomes 'we', as, finally, I can get on with someone," he wrote.He also revealed how he later discussed having a baby - or, as he put it, a "mewling miniature monster" - with Tina Dehgani, with whom he described having an "uncluttered commitment".Giving his version of his 1996 court battle with Joyce, who was seeking 25% of The Smiths' earnings, Morrissey accused the drummer of "constant inaccuracies and assumptions vomited out with leaden fatigue" in court.The group, one of the most revered bands in British music, split up in 1987 after five years together.The presiding judge, John Weeks, came in for particularly scathing criticism, portrayed caustically in the book as an "unsmiling Lord of the Hunt, with an immutable understanding of the world of The Smiths"."The pride of the pipsqueakery, John Weeks begins his judgment by falling flat on his face: He brilliantly announces to the world how The Smiths formed in 1992 - his judicial accuracy not to be questioned!" Morrissey wrote.Geoff Travis, who signed The Smiths to Rough Trade, was another who failed to impress Morrissey.When the singer and guitarist Johnny Marr turned up for an appointment, Morrissey claims he waved them away and refused to listen to their music until Marr "pinned him to the swivel chair".Travis, Morrissey drily noted, "would have found himself wandering from kaftan to kaftan" if it had not been for The Smiths, who the singer claimed "saved his life and made it count in the long run".The singer's bitter and long-running row with the NME began, he said, when a new editor took over and "allegedly called a staff meeting at which he has passed the command that his staff writers must now 'get Morrissey'".In 1992, the magazine questioned whether he was racist after he appeared on stage with a Union Jack. It put him on its cover under the headline: "Flying the flag or flirting with disaster?"The singer also detailed the brutality of teachers at St Mary's school in Stretford, Manchester, where each day was "Kafka-esque in its nightmare".One teacher, he recounted, "stands and stares and stands and stares" at naked boys in the shower, while another was recalled for the way he rubbed anti-inflammatory cream into the young Morrissey's wrist after he had fallen over."At 14, I understand the meaning of the unnecessarily slow and sensual strokes, with eyes fixed to mine," Morrissey wrote.The autobiography was published on Thursday as a Penguin Classic. It had been due for release in September, but was delayed by what Morrissey described as "a last-minute content disagreement".</body>

      <title>Could Westgate deal a fatal blow to the ICC?</title>
      <description>Could Nairobi siege cause fight against impunity to collapse?</description>

      <body>Western nations backing Kenya's counter-terrorism efforts face a moral dilemma over whether to defer the International Criminal Court (ICC) trial of President Uhuru Kenyatta after last month's Islamist attack on the Westgate shopping centre, write BBC Africa's Solomon Mugera and Moses Rono.The challenge is compounded by the tone coming from Nairobi that strongly suggests that Mr Kenyatta might not turn up for his trial at The Hague in November.Since being indicted on charges, which he denies, of organising violence after the disputed 2007 elections, Mr Kenyatta has consistently said he would co-operate with the ICC.But the reality of what having a president on trial abroad really means struck home when Islamist militants seized the Westgate mall in the Kenyan capital last month, leading to the deaths of at least 67 people.Mr Kenyatta's deputy, William Ruto, was in The Hague in a related case at the time and he had to ask the court for special dispensation to adjourn the hearings and return home."Suppose Kenyatta was in The Hague attending his trial at the time the siege happened?" a source at the presidency wondered at the time.Independent Horn of Africa analyst Abdullahi Boru views the situation as a conundrum pitting justice against security."The West faces a dilemma of principle versus realpolitik," he told the BBC."Do they insist on saying the court should go ahead with the cases, or capitulate to the demands of the African Union (AU) and Kenya?"African leaders have asked the UN Security Council to postpone Mr Kenyatta's trial - they have long accused the ICC of unfairly targeting African leaders.They further asked the Kenyan president and Mr Ruto not to show up for their respective trials until the UN hears the request for a deferral.The UK and France have championed the ICC as a vital tool to help bring to justice those politicians who carry out atrocities in their quest for power and would be loath to undermine the court by agreeing to the AU demand.The US supports that principle but has not signed up to the ICC for fear its own soldiers could be prosecuted.During Kenya's election campaign earlier this year, the UK and the US warned that a Kenyatta victory would have "consequences" for the country.In the event, he turned this around, successfully portraying it as neo-colonial meddling in Kenya's sovereign affairs and was elected president.Even before Westgate, this put the West in a difficult position.Alongside Ethiopia, Kenya is a key ally in counter-terrorism efforts in the region.Nairobi hosts a significant number of African offices for major multilateral organisations, and the world headquarters for the United Nations Environmental Programme.As the biggest, most developed city in East Africa, it is home to a large number of Western expatriates.Kenya also has strong intelligence - and other - links with the US and Israel.As al-Qaeda and its branch in neighbouring Somalia, al-Shabab, have stepped up attacks in the region, both US and Israeli targets in Kenya have been hit by al-Qaeda militants.The UN Security Council is now expected to decide whether to defer the trial of Mr Kenyatta or let it continue - both options entail considerable risks.George Kegoro, the executive director of the International Commission of Jurists-Kenya, told the BBC that extensive lobbying was going on, including a recent visit to Addis Ababa by the 15 Security Council members for consultations with AU officials.In Kenya, the debate is raging.Kenyan law scholar Makau Mutua criticised the AU resolution seeking a deferral of Mr Kenyatta's case."The message is we can kill; we can maim; we can commit genocide; we can rape our people with impunity and that no court can bring us to account for those crimes," he told Kenya's private NTV channel.While the US-educated Kenyan president is generally known to be easy going and diplomatic, at the AU summit, he lashed out at the court, and the West, leading many to ask whether he would still attend his trial."The ICC has been reduced into a painfully farcical pantomime, a travesty that adds insult to the injury of victims," Mr Kenyatta said."It stopped being the home of justice the day it became the toy of declining imperial powers."While campaigning for the March 2013 presidential vote, Mr Kenyatta called his trial at the ICC "a personal challenge".That now appears to have changed.Presidency spokesman Manoah Esipisu has quoted the president as saying: "I am no longer a private citizen observing personal obligations."He did not elaborate but he seems to be suggesting that the president's trial is now a matter of national sovereignty.In the event that the UN fails to delay his case and Mr Kenyatta opts not to attend his trial, observers believe a warrant of arrest would be issued, turning him, and Kenya, into something of an international pariah, like Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir.Such an eventuality is fraught with serious political risks, including possible destabilisation, which would undermine regional counter-terrorism efforts.If Kenya were to react by withdrawing from the fight against al-Shabab, that would be a massive boost to the Islamist cause in the region.However, Kenya's constitution specifically states that officials indicted by international courts must co-operate, making a boycott difficult for Mr Kenyatta unless the UN Security Council comes to his aid.And the stakes are also high for the ICC.This is by far its biggest case and backing down would deliver a potentially fatal blow to the court, which has been heavily criticised for only delivering one conviction in more than a decade."In the long-term, the Kenya cases are existential for the ICC," Mr Boru said."Failure in the Kenyan case will cement the feeling the court, aside from targeting Africans, has also failed to get successful prosecution of big fish."That leaves the UN Security Council trying to square the circle of delivering justice without potentially destabilising East Africa.</body>

      <title>China girls barred from 'boys' jobs'</title>
      <description>The jobs China just won't let women do</description>

      <body>In China - as in many countries - more women than men are entering university. But are there jobs for the girls out in the real world?Manicurist or courtroom judge? Cake decorator or radio host? For the cost of a ticket, children in Beijing can test out dozens of possible careers at the I Have a Dream theme park.But even in this imaginary world, these children - and their parents - stick to rigid gender stereotypes.The most popular attraction for girls is the chance to dress up as flight attendants. After dragging tiny suitcases onto a fake plane cabin, they learn to serve meals from a miniature trolley."Straighten your uniforms!", the girls are told, as they stand in neat rows, nervously tugging at their sleeves.Many boys choose to work as customs agents or security guards - in costumes complete with fake rifles and mini bullet-proof vests.In China, the idea that girls can't or shouldn't do the same jobs as boys is passed on early. It's a lesson that extends into university and beyond.Six hundred kilometres south of Beijing, at the China Mining and Technology University in China's eastern Jiangsu province, a group of mining engineering students listen intently to their professor.They're the envy of others at this school, since they belong to one of China's so-called "green card majors", courses that all but guarantee employment after graduation.But this program has one clear entrance requirement: men only."China's labour law suggests mining work is unsuitable for women, so we ask women to refrain from applying to our major," explains one of the department's senior professors, Shu Jisen.This university is not alone. Out of respect for women's safety, it says, China's education ministry bans girls from studying a variety of subjects across China, from tunnel engineering to navigation.At one university in Dalian, northern China, females are barred from studying naval engineering - because months on board a ship would be tough for women to endure, one admissions officer explained to the BBC.Slightly different reasons are given for severely restricting the number of women who can study at Beijing's People's Police University, which has a strict quota, limiting girls to comprise 10-15% of the student body.An admissions officer refused to be interviewed in person. But over the phone, he told the BBC that women were not allowed into the university in large numbers because there were not many jobs open to them after graduation, since most people in China expected police officers to be male.Jiangsu's mining engineering department cites similar practical considerations. Women would not be able to carry heavy mining equipment, they explain, and they would not be able to escape the mine as quickly in an emergency."Some jobs are really inappropriate for women," Prof Shu argues."If they force their way into these jobs, they will waste energy that can be better used elsewhere."Some refuse to accept those reasons. A small but feisty network of students and lawyers is fighting the restrictions. Using electric razors, they shaved their heads in series of well-publicised protests across China last year."It was blatant gender discrimination," argues one of the student activists, Xiao Meili."No-one had stood up to these universities before, and told them these policies were wrong. Why didn't anyone want to change anything? It really made me very angry."But more are starting to question the ban. In the university lunch canteen in Jiangsu, girls, here to study everything from management to mathematics, can't stomach the restrictions."If someone can endure tough working conditions, that person should be allowed to do it," explains one student."Universities should lift the limitations and allow people to make their own choices, instead of just barring them."The activists' network is also battling gender quotas at many Chinese universities that favour boys.In recent years, females across the country scored top marks in China's all-important college entrance exam. But schools want their courses to achieve a balance between genders, so they regularly lower the admissions standards for boys, leaving girls with higher marks out of luck.China's ministry of education insists that it does not allow fixed gender ratios when admitting students, "except for military academies, national defence and public security colleges", according to China's state news agency, Xinhua.But unofficially, the quotas are still in place at many schools, according to the activists.They hope to eradicate all written policies banning girls from applying to any majors, a goal activist Xiao Meili feels they can reach within a year.And hidden prejudice against women in education? That presents a bigger challenge."Sexism is in every corner of life in China, and people get so used to it that it's easy to ignore it," she says."People got used to the idea that men did things better than women. But when women started to excel, people got scared and thought of that as a problem."</body>

      <title>Jubilation and suspicion in Iran's press over nuclear talks</title>

      <body>While Iran's reformist dailies are upbeat about the constructive tone of Tehran's latest round of talks with world powers on its nuclear programme, the country's conservative press remains suspicious of Western intentions.However, both camps think that the West should respond to Iran's expressed readiness to compromise by offering concessions of its own.The optimism that followed the negotiations in Geneva is reflected in buoyant headlines splashed across Iran's reformist newspapers."Luminous lights of Geneva," is Etemad's front page headline above a picture of Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and the EU's foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton standing next to each other."Nuclear deadlock broken in Geneva," proclaims pro-government newspaper Iran, while Sharq opts for "Geneva smiles".In its editorial, Etemad praises the new government of President Hassan Rouhani and says that Iran wants to open a new chapter in the nuclear negotiations. The paper warns, however, that this should not be interpreted as a sign that Iran was ready to make concessions.Tehran has shown "flexibility", and the West needs to seize this opportunity so that talks could move forward, says Etemad.Writing in Sharq, Gholamali Khoshru, a former member of Iran's nuclear negotiating team, calls for the country's right to develop atomic energy to be recognised. He suggests that in order to facilitate the talks, the West should make a "symbolic gesture" and ease the international sanctions imposed on Tehran.The thought was echoed in the editorial in moderate daily Arman. The paper hails Iran's proposals at the talks as a "positive move", but writes that Iran also needs to see "some concessions" from the other side.Arman also comments on demands that Iran should once again accept the additional protocol to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which would allow unannounced inspections of its nuclear facilities. This "will not be a sign of weakness... it will demonstrate Iran's confidence that its nuclear programme is peaceful," the paper argues.The tone in Iran's conservative papers is more cautious, with some even using a language more reminiscent of the country's previous administration under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad."Western sanctions cannot change Iran's policy," says a defiant headline in Resalat.Qods leads with "Zarif: we will monitor P5+1's change in approach".Keyhan also quotes Iran's foreign minister in order to emphasize a point that the West too must make concessions. "Zarif: America should display good will in practice," says its headline.Keyhan suggests that "instead of offering confidence to the enemy, you have to make them believe that you have the capability, despite all the opposition and hostility, to continue on your path."The enemy has to believe that the impact of its pressure and its power to exert pressure is not enough to make the other side surrender," the paper argues.For Resalat, the US continues to "direct the scene of the talks and set the rules of the game". The daily warns that many steps have yet to be taken to "untie the knot of the talks".BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

      <title>Is Brazil the target of industrial espionage?</title>
      <description>Why US security agency is taking an interest in Brazil</description>

      <body>It was not quite the kind of attention Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff wanted to attract to her country's mining and oil riches.Documents leaked by former US National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden in September have suggested that the NSA spied on Petrobras, Brazil's state oil giant.The allegations caused uproar in Brazil, and prompted President Rousseff to cancel her state visit to Washington, where she had wanted to showcase Brazil's energy riches to potential investors.Even though over a month has passed since the allegations were broadcast on Brazil's TV Globo, the United States has so far failed to reassure Brasilia about the aims of its surveillance programme.The report on TV Globo, co-authored by Rio-based US journalist Glenn Greenwald, raised the question whether the NSA might have been engaging in industrial espionage against Brazil.It is an allegation which has been firmly denied by Washington, but one that has touched a sore spot in Brazil.Petrobras is Brazil's largest company and a major source of revenue for the government. It is also developing Brazil's massive deepwater oil reserves.On 21 October, Brazil will auction off the rights to develop the biggest of these new oilfields, Libra, to international companies.So the allegation that the NSA engaged in industrial espionage - and targeted Petrobras in particular - came at the most sensitive of times.But Timothy Edgar, who was the White House director of privacy and civil liberties from 2006 to 2009, believes the rationale for spying on a country such as Brazil could be better explained by the strict rules within which the NSA operates."I can tell you that the US does not engage in industrial espionage," he told the BBC."If there were security reasons why intelligence was being gathered in Brazil, it would be legitimate if it was done under a framework [of national security]."If it was for industrial purposes, it would be basically a violation of US policy," he explained.He says that, in general, the US intelligence agencies' priorities are about preventing international terrorism, curbing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and fighting international drug trafficking.But information about military and political leaders of other countries - especially those perceived as opponents of the US in the international arena - can also be flagged up as intelligence priorities, according to Mr Edgar.Despite a recent warming of relations between Washington and Brasilia, many analysts say it would not come as a surprise if Brazil had been included among these priorities.Brazil has used its strategic assets, including those in the energy sector, to expand its geopolitical sphere of influence and to strengthen its bonds with other emerging powers in the southern hemisphere.In the process, Brasilia has often gone counter to US interests on issues such as the war in Syria and the containment of Iran's nuclear programme.Mr Edgar says that from the point of view of intelligence-gathering, spying on Brazil would make sense if there was a security-related reason, a "legitimate intelligence nexus", for example, to understand the energy supplies within the hemisphere.But it is this "intelligence nexus" which Washington has so far failed to provide.The US intelligence services remained tight-lipped about their reasons for allegedly monitoring Brazil's electronic communications, including those of Ms Rousseff herself.Washington's silence further compounded Ms Rousseff's anger prompting her not only to cancel her state visit scheduled for 23 October, but also to deliver a harsh criticism of the US during the United Nations General Assembly last month.She called the US surveillance programme an attack on the "sovereignty and the rights of [Brazil's] people and businesses".She also dismissed Washington's explanation that its monitoring of communications was for Brazil's own good, saying emphatically that Brazil "knows how to protect itself!".President Barack Obama has promised that a current review of NSA procedures will reassure "allies" such as Brazil, by ensuring that intelligence collected by the secret services amounts to "information that's necessary to protect our people".It is unclear how long the review will take and whether it will reassure Ms Rousseff.But with Mr Greenwald saying he plans to reveal more information about US surveillance practices in the coming weeks, Ms Rousseff's Washington visit seems unlikely to be rescheduled for the near future.</body>

      <title>Silk Road: Will cybercrime evolve?</title>
      <description>Has illegal marketplace Silk Road's demise protected society?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24526677</url>
      <date>1381970464</date>

      <body>Silk Road, the infamous online marketplace for drugs and other illegal goods, was closed down by the FBI earlier this month. Since then its alleged founder, Ross Ulbricht - who denies being the site's operator known as Dread Pirate Roberts - has been taken into custody, and police forces around the world have been making arrests.It is a blow to the sale and distribution of harmful substances, including cocaine and heroin, as well as disrupting other criminal activities arranged online, such as the sale of weapons and hitmen for hire.But for how long will society have been made safer?Does it mean the end for illegal marketplaces hidden in the so-called "deep web", which depend on the anonymity provided by the Tor network and the Bitcoin digital currency to attract buyers and sellers?Or is it little more than a minor inconvenience?One man with first-hand experience of FBI takedowns is Emmanuel Gadaix.He was one of the directors of Megaupload, the popular file-sharing website founded by Kim Dotcom that was closed down by the US Department of Justice in January 2012."This changes nothing in the same way that the closure of Megaupload changed nothing," he says."All that happens if you bust him [Dread Pirate Roberts] is that two new people come along."The closure of Silk Road is no more the end of online narcotics sales as the arrest of Al Capone was the end of organised crime."Another man with similar experience is a twenty-something expat Irishman who calls himself H2.0.He is the ex-spokesman for a deep web drugs marketplace called Atlantis, which was closed down by its operators shortly before the Silk Road takedown for "security reasons".Criminals may be more than willing to prey on others, but when it comes to their own dealings they want to feel safe, and H2.0 says Silk Road had managed to build a strong brand in the underworld."It was a pillar of trust in an otherwise Wild West of dodgy scamsites," he says.But he is sure an alternative to Silk Road will emerge."We could be in for a period of sites popping up for a few months and closing [just] as fast. Silk Road will be replaced fast but the trust will take longer."Other marketplaces for illegal goods still exist in the deep web - Sheep and Black Market Reloaded (BMR) are two of the better-known ones - and it appears that former Silk Road sellers are already setting up shop in them."I do know one vendor who was previously one of the top-selling vendors on Atlantis," H2.0 adds."He moved to Silk Road as soon as Atlantis closed, and two weeks after Silk Road closed he is already set up on Sheep and BMR."Vendors even seem confident enough to carry forward the same usernames and reputations from Silk Road, which shows they don't seem too worried about being tracked."But security expert Brian Krebs thinks the takedown is significant."It once again dispels the myth of anonymity on the web, or in this case on the deep web," he suggests."That's a big deal because clearly many buyers and sellers in this community were under the impression that their actions somehow could not be traced online."In the future, illegal deep web marketplaces are likely to attempt to reassure drug dealers and their customers that their communications with each other are secure by making it easy to encrypt conversations.It turns out that a software package called BitWasp that aims to provide this is already under development, and as an open source project will be available free to anyone who wants it.The man behind BitWasp is known in internet circles as afk11. He currently spends between 30 and 50 hours a week developing it, he tells the BBC. He describes himself as unemployed, 21 years old and from Ireland.Afk11 claims his motivation is to help promote the virtual currency Bitcoin, suggesting it could become a popular way to pay for concert tickets and other events."Just because people want to remain private doesn't mean things are suspicious," he says.But does he believe that drugs marketplace operators will also use his software? "The short answer would be yes, they probably will," afk11 says."We're not specifically gearing our project towards the 'dark web' although it will certainly have features which are popular on it, such as PGP encryption."But it's more important to us that Bitcoin becomes adopted by the masses."The next generation of illegal marketplace operators will be much harder for the FBI or other law enforcement agencies to catch, according to a Bangkok-based security expert and broker of security exploits known as the Grugq."You can be famous, or a criminal, but you can't be a famous criminal," he says."[Dread Pirate Roberts] was advertising everywhere and attracting attention - which is never a good thing."He says that the new marketplaces will last longer because the operators won't make the same mistakes."Each bust works as evolutionary pressure, selecting out the insecure sites and training the other ones what to do better, so there will be better and better services (for buyers and sellers) with each iteration of these marketplaces after each bust," he says.Mr Krebs concurs: "Denizens of these communities will learn from their mistakes... with the result that the up-and-coming communities probably will be more difficult to penetrate and take down."But the Grugq believes that despite the protection and anonymity that Tor, Bitcoin and encryption can provide, many marketplaces and their users will get caught thanks to old-fashioned police techniques."What you will see with these sites is that as they become higher-profile, undercover agents will infiltrate them as vendors or customers," he says."They may even work their way into the inner circle and become administrators working for the site."One thing the Silk Road takedown has done is show that operators of illegal marketplaces can and do get caught.And ultimately it's the fear of that happening that may put many people off embarking on a criminal career in the deep web."I think a legit career move is best for me," H2.0 concludes."Whoever wants to be the next Dread Pirate Roberts better be able to handle the stress. I didn't like it."</body>

      <title>Young Indonesians work towards political change</title>
      <description>Young Indonesians make effort to challenge political apathy</description>

      <body>Ask Pingkan Irwin what she will be doing on any given Saturday night and her answer is likely to surprise you.Unlike many of her contemporaries, the 28-year-old is not heading out for a night on the town.Instead, this digital marketing strategist is most likely to be found representing the democracy advocacy group she helped to set up, Ayo Vote!, at a trendy Jakarta venue.Ms Pingkan and another friend set up Ayo Vote! - which is Indonesian for "Let's Vote" - in 2010.They felt that young Indonesians seemed politically apathetic, but believed that this stemmed in a large part from ignorance."Indonesia's younger generation, of which I'm a part, is pretty complacent because in the cities at least, our lives are pretty comfortable right now," she said."A lot of the time my friends tell me that it doesn't matter whether I vote or not, politicians are all corrupt anyway."Ms Pingkan felt one of the main reasons why young Indonesians weren't getting involved in politics was because they didn't really know what their rights were or what a functional democracy actually looked like, despite the country's relatively recent transition to democracy."We are basically offering a course in Politics 101 to young voters," she said. "That's why we've set up our website and kicked off this campaign."In Asia, Indonesia stands out as one of the youngest and newest democracies. Fifteen years ago, it was young Indonesians who led the revolution that transformed the country from a dictatorship into the bustling democracy it is now.Indonesia is a remarkably young society, with some estimates saying as much as two-thirds of the population is under 30. That's a significant proportion of the electorate - and political parties are keen to harness their voting power.But many young Indonesians say they are increasingly jaded. They complain that they are fed up with politics and despair of what appear to be rising levels of corruption at every tier of government.Ms Pingkan, however, is not the only one trying to make a difference.Muhammad Iman Usman is also currently working for YCAB - a non-profit group which promotes economic empowerment for women in Indonesia and beyond. He's responsible for raising funds in the US for the organisation."There are a lot of young people who are doing a lot of exciting things in Indonesia these days to help our community - we just need to create spaces for them to get involved," Mr Muhammad said."We can't afford to do nothing. The reality is that many politicians in Indonesia are corrupt, but we can't neglect the fact that politics is also an important element in how we live. So we need to get involved and prepare the younger generation for when we are in charge."Marcella Chandra Wijayanti is another person trying to get involved. Eschewing the comforts of corporate life, she spent a year in rural Indonesia, teaching underprivileged children in a programme run by the Teach Indonesia movement, Gerakan Indonesia Mengajar."When I told my parents and friends that I was going to Rote Ndao in East Nusa Tenggara, they were shocked. Some had never heard of the place before. It's a tiny island, and I'm a city girl!" the 25-year-old laughed."I graduated as an economics student - I should have been a banker or in finance. But I saw this as a way to pay back to my nation. I was lucky to have a good education, but there are hundreds of thousands of Indonesian children who don't have these opportunities simply because of where they are born."Ms Marcella spent a year in the tiny island community of Rote Ndao, teaching fifth graders and their teachers how to implement the national curriculum properly."Only 2% of the teachers on the island where I was teaching had graduated from university. That means the majority of teachers were all high school leavers!" she said, still incredulous two years on.The experience profoundly changed Ms Marcella view of her future career path."I always thought I'd end up in the corporate world. After I finished my stint there though, I joined the Education and Culture Ministry, and my plan is to get a masters in public policy next year. If we youngsters don't help our own country, who will?"That's the same motivation that led Yoga Dirga Cahya to give up a cushy job in Singapore's National Environment Agency and enter politics to try and win a seat in next year's parliamentary elections.The 26-year-old is running for a seat that covers central and south Jakarta, and overseas voters."I don't believe politics is dirty," he said via telephone from Hong Kong, where he is spreading his message to migrant Indonesian workers. "It's only dirty because the people inside are dirty. If you really want to make a change, then you have to do it from the inside."Having lived in Singapore for nine years, Mr Yoga said he saw the plight of Indonesian migrant workers - in particular maids - first-hand."I remember telling my local parliamentarians in Jakarta about their misfortunes, but it fell on deaf ears", he said."So I decided to get involved. Some people may think being young or not politically connected is disadvantageous, but it means I'm free from the past and money politics. It means I can start from a clean slate."But given the fact that the Indonesian parliament has such a bad reputation, is he worried his foray into this field could taint his values?"Sure I worry about that, but we as young people can't stay away from the political world," he said. "Then only bad politicians will join the system.""We need young Indonesians to engage and run the show so that it won't just be the old faces that keep being the only options for us to choose from."</body>

      <body>American film director Michael Bay has been injured in an attack in Hong Kong while filming on the set of his latest Transformers film.Two men have been arrested on suspicion of blackmail and assault after they demanded money from the film crew, police have said.Mr Bay, 48, received injuries to the right side of his face.But he declined to seek treatment and continued filming in a busy area of Hong Kong island.A local newspaper in Hong Kong reported that three men caused what it called "a huge disturbance" to the filming of the American science fiction film.It said that the men could have missed out on disturbance fees which the film crew paid to shop and business owners whose businesses were likely to be affected during filming.The two men approached Mr Bay on the set during filming, a police spokeswoman told Reuters.One of them demanded payment of HK$100,000 ($12,900; £8,030).As the discussion continued, the man assaulted Mr Bay and also attacked three police officers who tried to intervene, police say.The officers received treatment at hospital for minor injuries.Police also arrested a third man at the scene.There has been no comment from Mr Bay or his crew on the incident.The fourth instalment of the Transformers franchise starring Mark Wahlberg and Nicola Peltz is scheduled for public release in June 2014.Hong Kong's striking Victoria Harbour is believed to be among the film's locations, along with the city's dense and bustling streets.</body>

      <title>Morrissey opens up in autobiography</title>

      <body>Former Smiths singer Morrissey has used his autobiography to criticise the UK legal system and music business; and revealed his first full relationship came with a man when he was in his 30s.The star was scathing about the judges in his 1990s legal battle with former bandmate Mike Joyce, describing one as the "pride of the pipsqueakery".The Smiths' record label Rough Trade, he said, had been "brutally drab".And he accused music paper NME of being out to "get Morrissey" in the 1990s.The star, who is normally protective of his private life, opened up about a relationship with Jake Walters that began in 1994.He wrote about how Walters followed him back to his house after meeting him at a restaurant and "steps inside and stays for two years"."For the first time in my life the eternal 'I' becomes 'we', as, finally, I can get on with someone," he wrote.He also revealed how he later discussed having a baby - or, as he put it, a "mewling miniature monster" - with Tina Dehgani, with whom he described having an "uncluttered commitment".Giving his version of his 1996 court battle with Joyce, who was seeking 25% of The Smiths' earnings, Morrissey accused the drummer of "constant inaccuracies and assumptions vomited out with leaden fatigue" in court.The group, one of the most revered bands in British music, split up in 1987 after five years together.The presiding judge, John Weeks, came in for particularly scathing criticism, portrayed caustically in the book as an "unsmiling Lord of the Hunt, with an immutable understanding of the world of The Smiths"."The pride of the pipsqueakery, John Weeks begins his judgment by falling flat on his face: He brilliantly announces to the world how The Smiths formed in 1992 - his judicial accuracy not to be questioned!" Morrissey wrote.Geoff Travis, who signed The Smiths to Rough Trade, was another who failed to impress Morrissey.When the singer and guitarist Johnny Marr turned up for an appointment, Morrissey claims he waved them away and refused to listen to their music until Marr "pinned him to the swivel chair".Travis, Morrissey drily noted, "would have found himself wandering from kaftan to kaftan" if it had not been for The Smiths, who the singer claimed "saved his life and made it count in the long run".The singer's bitter and long-running row with the NME began, he said, when a new editor took over and "allegedly called a staff meeting at which he has passed the command that his staff writers must now 'get Morrissey'".In 1992, the magazine questioned whether he was racist after he appeared on stage with a Union Jack. It put him on its cover under the headline: "Flying the flag or flirting with disaster?"The singer also detailed the brutality of teachers at St Mary's school in Stretford, Manchester, where each day was "Kafka-esque in its nightmare".One teacher, he recounted, "stands and stares and stands and stares" at naked boys in the shower, while another was recalled for the way he rubbed anti-inflammatory cream into the young Morrissey's wrist after he had fallen over."At 14, I understand the meaning of the unnecessarily slow and sensual strokes, with eyes fixed to mine," Morrissey wrote.The autobiography was published on Thursday as a Penguin Classic. It had been due for release in September, but was delayed by what Morrissey described as "a last-minute content disagreement".</body>

      <body>Glee creator Ryan Murphy has confirmed the musical show will end after the next series, it has been reported.Speaking at a media event in Los Angeles, Murphy said he had planned for the sixth season to revolve around the characters of Rachel and Finn.However, following the death of actor Cory Monteith, who played Finn, in July, he was forced to create a new ending, TV Line reported.He added he had penned a new finale that would be in Monteith's honour."The final year of the show, which will be next year, was designed around Rachel and Cory/Finn's story," Murphy said."I always knew that, I always knew how it would end. I knew what the last shot was - he was in it. I knew what the last line was - she said it to him."So when a tragedy like that happens you sort of have to pause and figure out what you want to do, so we're figuring that out now."Murphy said he planned to pitch his new ending for the show to US network Fox later this month."I think it's very satisfactory and kind of in [Monteith's] honour, which I love," he added.The show said goodbye to the actor in a special tribute episode broadcast in the US last week.In April this year, Fox renewed Glee for a fifth and sixth season as part of a two-season deal.It had been hinted the sixth series could be the last, however it was not confirmed at the time.</body>

      <body>American character actor Ed Lauter, recently seen in the Oscar-winning The Artist, has died aged 74, it has been announced.Lauter played chauffer to the female character Peppy Miller, played by Oscar nominee actress Berenice Bejo.Publicist Edward Lozzi said Lauter died on Wednesday of mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the lung, commonly caused by asbestos exposure.He also starred in ER and opposite Burt Reynolds in 1974's The Longest Yard.Lauter played a sadistic prison guard whose team squares up to Reynolds' team of misfit convicts in a game of American Football.He also starred in a 2005 remake, starring Adam Sandler.The original landed him a starring role in Alfred Hitchcock's final movie Family Plot in 1976.Last year, Lauter starred with Clint Eastwood and Justin Timberlake in the baseball movie Trouble With the Curve.The actor, who started out as a stand up comic was also famed for his impersonations of movie stars.Lozzi told the Hollywood Reporter: "He called me as Clint Eastwood from the set of Trouble With the Curve last year. We really thought it was Eastwood!"He was also known to do impersonations of black and white stars James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart.Born in Long Island, New York in 1938, Lauter made his Broadway debut in the original 1968 stage production of The Great White Hope, which also starred James Earl Jones.His TV debut was came in a 1971 episode of private eye series Mannix and he made his first big screen appearance in the Western, Dirty Little Billy.Standing at 6ft 2in and prematurely bald with a long, square face, Lauter was often cast as thugs or stern authority figures.He was quoted as saying: "I like those roles. Lee Marvin once told me, 'When you play a heavy, every once in a while make the audience like you a little bit. Then they'll think, 'Wait a minute, he's not such a bad guy. Did you see the way he petted that dog?'"Lauter played the recurring character Dick Healy in the US version of Shameless and had several projects in post-production.A charitable foundation is being established to honour his work and an annual scholarship fund will be awarded to aspiring young actors.His family, which includes four children and his wife of eight years, Mia, have asked that donations be made to the foundation.</body>

      <body>A former BBC radio presenter described as a "dominant predator" has been found guilty of sexually abusing boys.Ex-BBC Radio Norfolk and Radio Clyde broadcaster Michael Souter, 60, was convicted of 19 sexual assaults on seven boys aged between 11 and 16.Souter was a Venture Scouts leader, a volunteer mentor to young people and was even allowed to adopt a child.Judge Mark Lucraft warned him he faced "a long period of imprisonment" when he is sentenced on 31 October.Souter, of Loddon, Norfolk, stared straight ahead without emotion as the judge spoke.The jury at Norwich Crown Court also found him guilty of seven counts of making and possessing indecent images of under-18s, after a six-week trial.The court heard Souter used his celebrity status to abuse his victims.He carried out the attacks between 1979 and 1999.The jury of nine men and three women took three hours to reach verdicts.Det Con Peter Sayer, who led the Norfolk Police investigation, said: "Souter used various opportunities to abuse children whilst being in a position of absolute trust."Chris McCann, head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) complex casework unit for the East of England, said: "Michael Souter presented himself to people as a local celebrity from radio and television, happy to be involved in charity events, the Scout movement and as a youth mentor for Norfolk social services."All this was a smokescreen to hide his true intention: to become close to young boys so he could sexually abuse them, confident that his celebrity status would mean they would not be believed."A BBC spokesperson said: "The crimes that Michael Souter has been found guilty of today are truly shocking and the BBC condemns them in the strongest possible terms."Michael Souter has not worked for the BBC since the early 1990s."</body>

      <body>US filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen have received France's highest cultural honour at a ceremony in Paris.The brothers, who won three Oscars in 2008 for their crime drama No Country For Old Men, were each made a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters.Accepting the award, Joel said: "Sometimes life plays jokes on you - some of them are very unfortunate, some of them are very fortunate."This is one of the most fortunate jokes I think life has played on us."The award is given by the French government to people who "significantly contributed to the enrichment of the French cultural inheritance".Eight of the Coen's films have premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, with 1991's Barton Fink winning the Palme d'Or.Their latest film, Inside Llewyn Davis, also won the Grand Prize of the jury at this year's festival.Released in the UK next January and starring Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake, the film tells the story of a struggling singer-songwriter against the backdrop of the 1960s New York folk scene.French Culture Minister Aurelie Filippetti, who presented the honour to the pair, said: "We have extremely strong links between French cinema and American cinema so it's natural there's this recognition for two of the greatest directors in the US today."Other recent recipients of the honour from the world of film and music include Ringo Starr, Bono and Bruce Willis.</body>

      <body>The BBC has revealed how it plans to mark the centenary of World War I.Programming and events will span four years, across television, radio and online, from 2014-2018, echoing the time frame of the war itself."I want 2014 to be remembered for our national commemoration of all those who served on the battlefield and on the Home Front," said BBC chief Tony Hall."And a chance for us all to learn something new about a war we think we know well."The season will include 130 newly commissioned programmes, spanning almost 2,500 hours.Among them will be two major TV dramas on BBC One: The Ark will take viewers into the lives of the medics and their patients at a fictional field hospital behind the trenches in France; while The Passing Bells tells the story of the war through the eyes of two very ordinary young men.On BBC Two, Ian McDiarmid stars in 37 Days, which will explore the politics behind the build-up to war. The events will also be retold on BBC Radio 4 in 1914 Day-by-Day, a 42-part series featuring archive news excerpts, from the day of the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand to the outbreak of war five weeks later.Radio 4 will also air two dramas. Homefront is the story of "the 41 million Britons who didn't fight in the great war but whose hearts were pinned on the five million who did", and will run across four years in 15-minute instalments, pitting fictional stories against a background of truth.Tommies, a series of plays narrated across the four years of war, revolves around British Empire soldiers, focusing on a sergeant in the Lahore division of the Indian army and a group of signallers.Kate Adie tells The Story of Women in World War I on BBC Two, and relates the role of women as nurses, ambulance drivers and surgeons during the great war."We are setting out to broaden people's understanding of the war, to commemorate and remember those who were caught up in it and to tell both well-known stories from fresh perspectives and original stories so far untold," said Adrian Van Klaveren, BBC controller behind the centenary season.Horrible HistoriesThe season will also include programming about poetry, paintings and music, as well as programmes by eminent historians including Sir Max Hastings, Christopher Clark and Niall Ferguson, tackling some of the biggest debates about World War I.Meanwhile, BBC Children's and BBC Learning will seek to explain the war to younger viewers, through programmes including a specially-commissioned Horrible Histories."A century on, we should perhaps remember and respect that sacrifice," said Jeremy Paxman, who fronts the documentary series, Britain's Great War, looking at the impact of the World War I."And realise that more than any other event, this was the one that made modern Britain."</body>

      <body>Comedian Russell Brand is to edit a special edition of British political magazine the New Statesman.The 38-year-old will preside over a revolution-themed issue, with contributions from Alec Baldwin, Noel Gallagher and Naomi Klein.In a statement, Brand said his "first act" as editor would be to rename the magazine "the Nude Statesman".The comedian has recently been engaging with politics, appearing on both BBC Question Time and the Andrew Marr show.His Question Time performance received mixed reviews. A polemic about the treatment of drug addiction, of which he has experience, went down well, but his views on Syria and the banking crisis were felt to be too simplistic.The star, who quit the BBC in 2008 over the "Sachsgate" prank phone call row, also caused a storm at the GQ Man Of The Year awards last month, after criticising the event's sponsors, Hugo Boss.Receiving the award for Oracle Of The Year, Brand declared: "If anyone knows a bit about history and fashion, they'll know it was Hugo Boss who made uniforms for the Nazis."He was subsequently ejected from the ceremony, but defended his comments in a column for The Guardian."The jokes about Hugo Boss were not intended to herald a campaign to destroy them," he wrote, before skewering the uneasy relationship between celebrity culture, politicians and corporate sponsors at such events."Subsequent to my jokes, the evening took a peculiar turn," he noted."Like the illusion of sophistication had been inadvertently disrupted by the exposure. It had the vibe of a wedding dinner where the best man's speech had revealed the groom's infidelity. With Hitler."Previous guest editors of New Statesman include the former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, whose criticism of the coalition government's policies caused a political row.Chinese artist Ai Weiwei took the helm last year, and his issue won an Amnesty International award for human rights journalism.In a statement announcing his issues, Brand said: "I am honoured to be editing an issue of the New Statesman."My first act is to edit the name of the magazine to the Nude Statesman, which will allay fears that this populist move will descend into puerility."This issue will either recapture the glory of JB Priestley's piece which created the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, or plunge the title into despair not seen since it alleged that John Major was giving Downing Street's caterer an unconventional bonus."I am also suggesting a 'Man of the Year' award ceremony and am looking for sponsors with a spotless past.

      <body>Comedy Central was forced to repeat an old episode of South Park after a power cut prevented this week's scheduled episode from being finished.Computers at South Park Studios in Los Angeles were down for three hours on Tuesday, halting work on the episode Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers.Co-creator Trey Parker told fans "it sucks" but admitted it was inevitable."After all these years of tempting fate by delivering the show last minute, I guess it was bound to happen," he said.It is the first time he and Matt Stone have missed one of their tight deadlines in 16 years, after famously starting each show from scratch just six days before it is due to air.Most animated TV shows are written several months in advance, but South Park's creators hope to keep the show current and fresh by working to a tight deadline.The US office of Comedy Central said in a statement on Wednesday: "From animation to rendering to editing and sound, all of their computers were down for hours and they were unable to finish episode 1704, Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers, in time for air tonight."The planned episode was replaced with a repeat of Scott Tenorman Must Die, an episode featuring British band Radiohead, which fans had voted their second favourite of all time in a poll in 2011.The team posted pictures of the blackout on the show's Twitter feed and revealed that Goth Kids 3 was now scheduled for next week.Earlier this year Parker and Stone's musical The Book of Mormon opened to rave reviews in London's West End, after a sell-out debut on Broadway.They confirmed two years ago that they would continue animating the adventures of South Park's Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman until 2016.The show recently kicked off its 17th series in the US to its highest ratings since 2011, with 4.3 million viewers tuning in across three broadcasts.The taboo-breaking animation is broadcast on Comedy Central in the UK at a week's delay and Goth Kids 3 is now expected to air on 30 October at 22:00 BST. Scott Tenorman Must Die will be broadcast in its original slot on 23 October.</body>

      <title>Man Booker gets youngest winner</title>
      <description>New Zealand author Eleanor Catton becomes the youngest ever winner of the £50,000 Man Booker Prize for her novel The Luminaries, which is also the longest to win in the prize's history.</description>

      <body>New Zealand author Eleanor Catton has, at the age of 28, become the youngest ever winner of the £50,000 Man Booker Prize for her novel The Luminaries.Her 832-page tale of the 19th-century goldfields is also the longest work to win in the prize's 45-year history."It's a dazzling work. It's a luminous work. It is vast without being sprawling," said Robert Macfarlane, chair of the judges.Catton was announced as the winner on Tuesday night at London's Guildhall.When her name was called out, "it almost seemed like the rest of the room ceased to exist," she told the BBC's World Update.Her book, a Victorian mystery tale set during the New Zealand gold rush, is intricately structured according to astrological charts - with each section exactly half the length of its predecessor.When it was shortlisted last month, the judges described it as a "Kiwi Twin Peaks"."You begin it and you think you are in the clutches of a big baggy monster," said Macfarlane on Tuesday, adding that what followed was an "accelerating, quickening tilt to the narrative"."We have returned to it three times now and we have dug into it - to use its own metaphors - and the yield it has offered at each new reading has been extraordinary," he said.The prize, announced live on the BBC News Channel, was presented this year by the Duchess of Cornwall.On receiving the award, Catton admitted that her lengthy, complex novel had been "a publisher's nightmare", saying she had been compelled to buy a bigger handbag to carry it around.She then thanked her publishers for striking the "elegant balance between making art and making money".The other authors on the shortlist were NoViolet Bulawayo, for We Need New Names; Jim Crace, for Harvest; Jhumpa Lahiri, for The Lowland; Ruth Ozeki, for A Tale for the Time Being; and Colm Toibin, for The Testament of Mary.Crace had been the bookies' favourite to win, with Catton reported to have a late surge of support over the weekend.Macfarlane said the judges' final decision had been made after "just under two hours of pretty tough discussion".Canadian-born Catton was raised in New Zealand and is the second writer from that country to win the prize. The first was Keri Hulme in 1985 with The Bone People - her first and only novel.The Luminaries is the longest ever Booker winner, beating Hilary Mantel's 672-page Wolf Hall which won in 2009.Macfarlane joked: "Those of us who didn't read it on e-readers enjoyed a full upper-body work-out."Set in 1866, The Luminaries begins with Walter Moody arriving to make his fortune on the New Zealand goldfields. He stumbles across a tense gathering of 12 local men, who have met in secret to discuss a series of unsolved crimes.Moody is then drawn into a mystery involving a missing wealthy man, a prostitute who has tried to end her life, and an enormous fortune which has been discovered in the home of a luckless drunk.Catton began writing the novel at the age of 25 and completed it when she was 27. She turned 28 last month.The previous youngest winner was Ben Okri, who was 32 when he won for The Famished Road in 1991. Kiran Desai was previously the youngest woman to win, at 35, with The Inheritance of Loss in 2006."One can approach this as a murder mystery with seances, corpses, lawsuits and puzzles," said Macfarlane."It does require investment… but it operates like the best kind of goldmine. You pan and then the yields are huge."Jonathan Ruppin, web editor for Foyles, said: "For those who are simply looking for a great story, the murder mystery at the heart of the book is thoroughly gripping and that alone should ensure very strong sales."But there is so much more to it: a vivid cast of characters who leap from the page, a joyful celebration of language and some remarkable experiments with the underlying process of novel writing; critics who have dismissed it as a pastiche of 19th-century fiction have scarcely scratched the surface."Catton is a writer of rare insight and intelligence, who is at the vanguard of the evolution of the novel."I'm confident that she is destined to be one of the most important and influential writers of her generation."The six shortlisted writers each win £2,500 and are presented with a hand-bound edition of their book. As winner, Catton receives a further £50,000.This year marks the 45th year of the prize, which was won last year by Hilary Mantel for Bring Up the Bodies, the sequel to Wolf Hall.Next year the Man Booker Prize will be open to authors writing in English from all corners of the globe. It is currently awarded to English-language authors from the Commonwealth, including the UK, Ireland and Zimbabwe.The decision has split the literary establishment, with critics saying that American novelists will come to dominate the prize.</body>

      <title>Stoppard struggles to write play</title>
      <description>Award-winning writer Sir Tom Stoppard, 76, says he is finding it hard to remember how to write a stage play, as he attempts his first since 2006.</description>

      <body>Award-winning writer Sir Tom Stoppard, 76, has admitted struggling to remember how to write a play.He told The Times that he has found it hard to find time to focus on what will be his first stage play in seven years."I can't just put things aside for a day and come back. My brain just isn't good enough anymore," said Sir Tom, whose career has also seen him write extensively for TV, radio and film."I know what I want to do in the next six months. I don't know if I can."Sir Tom, whose radio play Darkside - inspired by Pink Floyd album The Dark Side of the Moon - was recently broadcast on BBC Radio 2, told the newspaper (subscription) that he was hoping to find a hideaway so that he could concentrate on writing."When I was younger I could do something useful just by being free for half a day, but now I need five days to get the world I've left out of my head and ten days or a fortnight not talking to anyone to hold what I need to hold inside my head," he said.Sir Tom added: "I wish I could remember how to write a play. I can't remember how they happened."However the writer, who spent four years adapting Ford Madox Ford's book Parade's End for a BBC drama which aired last year, admitted taking on multiple projects could be to blame."There are too many things I find it difficult to say no to," he said. "So I'm clearing the desk and planning to work without interruption."Sir Tom, who won an Oscar for the Shakespeare in Love screenplay he co-wrote with Marc Norman, also adapted Anna Karenina for the big screen last year.Breaking BadHe has written more than 30 plays for the stage, including The Real Thing and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, and this latest untitled project would be his first since Rock'n'Roll in 2006.It is said to tackle "the intersection of science and metaphysics".Earlier this month, Sir Tom collected this year's Pen Pinter Prize at the British Library in London.It was established in 2009 in memory of playwright Harold Pinter, to be awarded to a writer who casts an "unflinching, unswerving" gaze upon the world and shows a "fierce intellectual determination...to define the real truth of our lives and our societies".But when asked about his long-term plans, Sir Tom joked that it involved "a very protracted deathbed in which I watch Breaking Bad and all the box sets people keep talking about."</body>

      <title>Mysterious elephant wins photo prize</title>
      <description>Elephants have a mysterious and "tangible energy" according to South African photographer Greg Du Toit whose picture has earned him one of the world's top photo awards.</description>

      <body>Elephants have a mysterious and "tangible energy" according to South African photographer Greg Du Toit.Now after a 10 year quest, his portrayal of this "energy" has been captured in an award-winning photo.Titled "Essence of Elephants", the work has earned him the overall title in this year's Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition.Preparation and passion, he says, were key to achieving the winning shot, taken from just over one metre away."There was one particular day when a baby elephant raced past right in front of my camera and I was ready. I had to be prepared for that moment," said Mr Du Toit.He took the picture at a waterhole in Botswana's Northern Tuli Game Reserve from a hide (a sunken freight container) that provided a ground-level view. He had been going to the area five or six times a year for 10 years."I chose elephants because I feel a very special energy and connection when I'm around them," he told BBC News."But although you feel that energy it's very difficult to translate that into a camera because an elephant is such a big animal and they're not very charismatic, whereas a predator is far more charismatic."Using a very slow shutter speed on a wide angle lens "allowed all that energy to come into my camera" making him able to depict "these gentle giants in an almost ghostly way".To achieve the cool blue hue he attached a polarising filter and set his white balance to a cool temperature.The Wildlife Photographer of the Year (WPY) "means a lot to me for various reasons", said Du Toit, especially because photos were submitted anonymously, putting professionals and amateurs on an equal footing."In my mind it's one of the last places in the world you can actually look at a wildlife photo and trust that the moment is authentic."Chair of the judging panel Jim Brandenburg said: "Greg's image immediately catapults us to African plains. This image stood out for both its technical excellence and the unique moment it captures - it is truly a once in a lifetime shot."This year's Young Wildlife Photographer of the year is 14-year-old Udayan Rao Pawar from India.His photo was of a fresh water crocodile with hatchlings on its head "kind of resembling a crown", explained Mr Pawar.He crept up on the nestling colony of gharials on the banks of the Chambal River,"When the dawn broke early in the morning I hid myself behind a rock, and when the morning light came I took those images."I could hear them making little grunting sounds. Very soon a large female surfaced near the shore, checking on her charges. Some of the hatchlings swam to her and climbed onto her head. Perhaps it made them feel safe."Despite conservation efforts, the gharial fresh water crocodile is on the verge of extinction with an estimated 200 mating pairs remaining."The Chambal River is the gharial's last stronghold but is threatened by illegal sand-mining and fishing", added Udayan.Wildlife photographer and Judge Tui De Roy said the composition and timing of the photograph was perfect."The mother's gaze seems directed at you, appealing to you to let her live and thrive in peace. This image is beautiful and thought provoking, but at the same time also wonderfully playful, making it a clear winner," he said.WPY is one of the most prestigious competitions in world photography. Organised by London's Natural History Museum and BBC Wildlife Magazine, it is now in its 49th year.Images are submitted anonymously by professional and amateur photographers alike. They are selected for their creativity, artistry and technical complexity and must be submitted as a raw file with no manipulations.The winners beat 43,000 entries submitted from 96 countries.

      <description>Child abduction thriller Prisoners holds on to the top spot on the UK box office chart in a weekend that saw no release make more than £1 million.</description>

      <body>Child abduction thriller Prisoners has held on to the top spot on the UK box office chart in a weekend that saw no release make more than £1 million.The Hugh Jackman movie remained the UK's number one picture for the third week in succession, despite making only £968,990 between Friday and Sunday.Its takings were almost twice that of WikiLeaks drama The Fifth Estate, which opened in a disappointing sixth place.The film made £502,495 in its first three days in UK and Ireland cinemas.Previews of animated movie Turbo, not included in this week's chart, are understood to have taken more than any title in the official Top 15.The DreamWorks release officially opens in the UK on Thursday and will have its preview takings added to its first weekend tally.The lacklustre landscape allowed Edinburgh-based musical Sunshine on Leith to claim second place in this week's chart after opening last week at three.Dexter Fletcher's film, which features songs by Scottish sibling duo The Proclaimers, took £732,296 in its second weekend on release.Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine is ranked at number three with a third weekend tally of £642,241.The film, which boasts an Oscar-tipped performance by Cate Blanchett, has now made £3.33m, making it Allen's most profitable title ever at the UK and Ireland box office.With Filth at four and Rush at five, The Fifth Estate held the dubious honour of being this week's highest new entry.This is despite a major promotional push and the presence of Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch as WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.Its failure to woo UK audiences was further underlined by the performance of marital drama Le Week-End at number seven.On a screen-for-screen basis, Roger Michell's film - which stars Jim Broadbent and Lindsay Duncan as a long-married couple spending a weekend in Paris - made more than twice as much as its tech-savvy rival.Further down the chart, action sequel Machete Kills languished in 12th place with a three-day tally of £165,586.Its takings were only marginally superior to those recorded by Romeo and Juliet, an adaptation of the William Shakespeare play by Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes, whose £137,448 tally saw it open outside this week's Top 15.</body>

      <title>Fassbender too 'busy' for Oscar push</title>
      <description>Actor Michael Fassbender says he will not campaign for an Oscar nomination, despite being hotly tipped for his role in 12 Years A Slave.</description>

      <body>Michael Fassbender has said he will not campaign for an Oscar nomination, despite being hotly tipped for his role in 12 Years A Slave."It's just a grind. And I'm not a politician. I'm an actor," the Irish Prometheus star told GQ magazine.Two years ago, Fassbender hit the campaign trail, chasing an award for his performance as a sex addict in Shame, but failed to earn a nomination."I won't put myself through that kind of situation again," he added.Fassbender is widely considered a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination for his role as Edwin Epps, a sadistic Louisiana plantation owner, in the new film which has been directed by Shame's Steve McQueen."You know, I get it. Everybody's got to do their job. So you try and help and facilitate as best you can."But the X-Men star - who is currently filming the latest sequel in the Marvel franchise, Days of Future Past - says he will be "too busy working" to take part in the endless parade of screenings and interviews that Oscar campaigning requires."I just don't really have time," he told GQ's Zach Baron."I'll be in New Zealand. I'll be on the other side of the world," he added, explaining that he will be shooting his production company's first feature - a Western - before moving on to film Macbeth, opposite Marion Cotillard.Last year, the 36-year-old called award ceremonies "a vanity thing", adding, "It does become important to you. And it shouldn't."In 2012, Joaquin Phoenix flatly refused to campaign for an Oscar for his role in The Master, deeming the awards circuit "total, utter bulls**t". The actor went on to win a best actor nomination.The film, 12 Year a Slave reunites Fassbender with McQueen, who gave the actor his first big break when he cast the actor as Bobby Sands in Hunger.It will open across the UK in January and is the harrowing story of a free black man Solomon Northup, played by Britain's Chiwetel Ejiofor, who is kidnapped and sold at auction.Fassbender will next be seen on the big screen in Ridley's Scott's The Counselor.In some US awards related news, it was also announced that the release of Gone Girl has been moved to October next year, putting the film - based on Gillian Flynn's bestselling book - in contention for the 2015 awards season.The thriller, starring Ben Affleck and directed by David Fincher, will open on the same weekend in the US as Fincher's multi award-winning The Social Network opened in 2010.</body>

      <title>Epic row over final cut of Noah film</title>
      <description>Black Swan director Darren Aronofsky is at loggerheads with Paramount over the final cut of his biblical epic Noah.</description>

      <body>Black Swan director Darren Aronofsky is at loggerheads with Paramount over the final cut of his biblical epic Noah.The film, which is reported to have surpassed its $125m (£78m) budget, has received negative reactions following test screenings across the US.According to the Hollywood Reporter, screenings have taken place in New York, Arizona and Orange County to allow for religious diversity.Christian and Jewish audience reactions were said to have been "worrisome".The film is based on the story of Noah, who in the Bible was warned of an impending flood and built an ark to carry two of each species of animal to safety.The film, which is set for release next March, stars Russell Crowe as Noah, alongside Anthony Hopkins, Emma Watson and Ray Winstone.It also involves extensive CGI, including all the featured animals."We had to create an entire animal kingdom," Aronofsky told the Director's Guild of America's Quarterly magazine earlier this month"We chose the species and they were brought to life with different furs and colours. We didn't want anything fully recognisable but not completely absurd either," explained the New York-based filmmaker.'Wacko'Aronofsky, whose Oscar-winning movies have included Black Swan and The Wrestler, is well known for his left-field work with a body of films that includes Requiem for a Dream, Pi and The Fountain.Last year, screenwriter Brian Godawa obtained a version of the Noah script and posted his summary online, deeming the film "Environmentalist Wacko".He concluded that the film was "an uninteresting and unbiblical waste of a hundred and fifty million dollars that will ruin for decades the possibility of making a really great and entertaining movie of this Bible hero."In July, Aronofsky screened footage for the church-based Echo conference in Texas and subsequent tweets from audience members suggested the preview was well received.Paramount, which is sharing the cost of the film with New Regency, is reportedly eager not to alienate the Christian audience but it currently remains unclear as to whether the studios or director have rights over the final cut.Rob Moore, vice-chairman of Paramount, told the Hollywood Reporter the film was undergoing a "normal preview process" and the result will be "one version of the movie that Darren is overseeing".He said the studio had "a very long post-production period, which allowed for a lot of test screenings."While Aronofsky "definitely wants some level of independence," he added, "he also wants a hit movie.""We're getting to a very good place, and we're getting there with Darren," he added..</body>

      <body>Grunge band Nirvana are among 16 acts nominated for entry into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.It is the first time the US rock group behind the seminal 1991 album Nevermind have been eligible for admission.Rules state that candidates must have released their debut album or single at least 25 years before 2012.Linda Ronstadt, Hall and Oates, Peter Gabriel and British prog-rock band Yes are among the other hopefuls receiving their first nominations.Ronstadt's nomination follows the 67-year-old's revelation in August that she has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.More than 600 music industry personnel will vote to select the inductees, who will be announced in December.An induction ceremony for the chosen honourees will be held in New York in April.Brit rockers Deep Purple, Kiss and The Replacements are among the other bands in contention.Rap artists N.W.A and LL Cool J and folk legend Cat Stevens - who now performs as Yusuf Islam - have also been shortlisted.Disco stars Chic, funk band the Meters and the Paul Butterfield Blues Band have received nominations for the second consecutive year.If selected for induction, Nirvana will enter the Hall of Fame almost exactly 20 years on from frontman Kurt Cobain's suicide in April 1994.According to the Hall of Fame's nomination citation, the Seattle rockers are "proof that the right band with the right noise can change the world".Gabriel, previously inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2009 as a member of Genesis, is in contention again for his work as a solo singer-songwriter.Based in Cleveland, Ohio, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has been inducting performers since 1986.This year's inductees included late disco queen Donna Summer, hip-hop group Public Enemy and singer-songwriter Randy Newman.</body>

      <body>Maxine Powell, the etiquette instructor who taught Motown Records' artists how to carry themselves during the label's '60s heyday, has died at the age of 98.Her Artists Development Department - known as Motown's Finishing School - was considered as important to its operations as any singer or producer.Some of its training included teaching Marvin Gaye to sing with his eyes open and the proper way to exit a limousine.Powell died of natural causes on Monday at a hospital in Southfield, Michigan.Her death comes less than two months after a tribute event held in her honour at the Motown Museum in Detroit.The August event saw singer Smokey Robinson describe Powell as an "integral part" of the label's legacy.Born in Texarkana, Texas, Powell was raised in Chicago and began her career as an actress before moving to Detroit.There she opened the Maxine Powell Finishing School, which led to her being brought to Motown to help prepare its artists for their lives in the spotlight.Label chief Berry Gordy remembered some of Powell's advice to her students included "do not protrude the buttocks"."You had style," said the Motown founder in a videotaped tribute played on 26 August. "You gave them class.""I love all the Motown artists,'' Powell said on that occasion, adding she intended to teach "until there's no breath left in my body".According to a Motown Museum spokeswoman, she died at Southfield's Providence Hospital "peacefully surrounded by Motown family and close friends".</body>

      <body>The music industry has a "culture of demeaning women" that forces stars to sell themselves as sex objects, according to singer Charlotte Church.Church said she was "pressurised" into wearing revealing outfits in videos by male executives when she was 19 or 20.Now 27, the star said young female artists were routinely "coerced into sexually demonstrative behaviour in order to hold on to their careers".She made her comments during BBC 6 Music's annual John Peel Lecture.Her stinging attack on sexism in the music industry comes amid a heated debate over the sexual imagery used by pop stars like Miley Cyrus and Rihanna.The music business is "a male dominated industry with a juvenile perspective on gender and sexuality" and increasingly wants "sex objects that appear child-like", Church claimed.The star accused record labels of encouraging young singers "to present themselves as hypersexualised, unrealistic, cartoonish, as objects, reducing female sexuality to a prize you can win".She continued: "When I was 19 or 20 I found myself in this position, being pressurised into wearing more and more revealing outfits."The lines that I had spun at me again and again - generally by middle-aged men - were: 'You look great, you've got a great body, why not show it off?'"Or: 'Don't worry, it will look classy, it will look artistic.' I felt deeply uncomfortable about the whole thing, but I was often reminded by record label executives just whose money was being spent."She recalled feeling "massively uncomfortable" about dancing suggestively in little more than a basque and knee-high boots in the video for her single Call My Name in 2005."Whilst I can't defer all blame away from myself, I was barely out of my teenage years and the consequence of this portrayal of me is that now I'm frequently abused on social media, being called slut, whore and a catalogue of other indignities," she said."Now I find it difficult to promote my music in the places it would be best suited because of my history."She particularly criticised Miley Cyrus, Rihanna and Robin Thicke.Cyrus's routine at the MTV Awards last month, in which she danced provocatively with Thicke and made suggestive gestures with a foam finger, sparked a furore over whether she had gone too far.Sinead O'Connor wrote an open letter to the pop star, warning her not to be exploited by the music business.Church also accused video websites of doing too little to prevent young viewers from being able to see explicit videos, and supported Annie Lennox's recent call to give pop videos film-style age ratings.In her speech, delivered at the Radio Festival at The Lowry in Salford, Church added that radio stations should consider dropping singles by artists whose images were too risque.She said: "As Tony Hall, the BBC's director general, announces the new iPlayer channel for Radio 1, the question must be asked - should programmers take into consideration the image of an artist when deciding whether to play and promote their music?"There are countless examples from the last few years of songs that have been in high rotation, that have little to no artistic worth, but are just plain rude."BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour broadcast a special live edition on Saturday, dedicated to women in music, to mark the lecture.</body>

      <body>Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom will begin a regular audit of the quality of broadcasters' subtitles from next year.It follows complaints by viewers about inaccurate subtitles, or subtitles which are delayed, freeze or disappear.Under the new measures, broadcasters will be asked to monitor the quality of their subtitling on live TV shows every six months, for two years.Subtitles are used by more than a million people in the UK suffering from hearing impairments.In the past, viewers have made clear that, although pre-prepared subtitling is generally of good quality, the quality of live subtitles is often poor. In particular, the speed, accuracy and synchronisation (or latency) of live subtitles.A consultation, which began in May and ended in July, suggested more problems arose when pre-recorded programmes were delivered to broadcasters too late to allow subtitling to be prepared in advance.Ofcom intends to publish the first of its reports on subtitling standards in the spring of 2014.In addition, the watchdog is asking broadcasters to report on any technical problems that disrupted subtitling.These reports will allow broadcasters and viewers to monitor progress and see where there is room for improvement.Ofcom will also use this evidence to consider whether changes to its current guidelines are necessary, and whether there is a need to set targets for broadcasters.Following the consultation, some broadcasters have advocated greater use of block subtitling (in which a chunk of text appears on screen rather than a word by word basis) in programmes containing a mix of pre-recorded and live content, such as news bulletins.Viewers have made clear that they prefer block subtitles, provided this does not come at the cost of increased delays, and as such, Ofcom has encouraged their use by broadcasters.It has also called on broadcasters to consider a time delay to live programmes, which are not time-sensitive, in order to improve the quality of subtitles .Ofcom's Claudio Pollack said the watchdog was taking "important steps towards improving the quality of subtitling on live programmes"."Ofcom expects regular reporting by broadcasters to help improve subtitles over time, as well as allowing us to identify exactly which areas need most progress."Seventy TV channels now provide subtitling in the UK.</body>

      <body>Award-winning comedian and actor John Bishop is to host the Royal Variety Performance next month.It will feature stars such as Gary Barlow, the cast of hit West End musical Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Attraction, the winners of this year's Britain's Got Talent.Brit Award winner Olly Murs will also perform on 25 November, with the show set to be screened by ITV in December.Stand-up star Bishop said he "never imagined" he would host the show."As a child, the Royal Variety Show was like the Grand National and the FA Cup final - it was something our family always watched - the only difference being that we didn't bet on the winner," he said."I trust my parents will be proud when they take their seats in the audience, although I have told my dad not to shout, 'Come on son.' It's not a match or a horse race!"Dame Edna Everage will take a break from her farewell tour to appear in the variety show, with more acts set to be announced nearer the time.The evening at the London Palladium hopes to feature the best musical performers, theatre, comedy and speciality acts from the UK and abroad, as well as several surprises.The event is staged in aid of the Entertainment Artistes' Benevolent Fund - whose patron is the Queen - which helps people from the world of entertainment who are in need of care and assistance.Each year the winner of ITV's Britain's Got Talent gets the chance to perform on the show as part of their prize.This year's competition was won by Hungarian shadow dancers Attraction at the show's grand final in June.At the time judge Simon Cowell said: "It just shows that this country welcomes people from all over the world and they loved this act."</body>

      <title>BBC censured for Salford move costs</title>
      <description>The BBC is criticised by the Public Accounts Committee for paying "excessive" allowances to some staff for relocating to its offices in Salford.</description>

      <body>The BBC has been criticised for paying some staff "excessive" allowances for relocating to its Salford offices.The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said the scale of some allowances was "difficult to justify".But the committee said the BBC "did a good job" overall, completing the move on time and within the £224m budget.A BBC statement said it was pleased the committee had "recognised BBC North was delivered on time, under budget and with no break in services".BBC Sport, Children's, radio station 5 live and BBC One Breakfast were among the services that moved from London to MediaCityUK in Salford in an attempt to make the corporation better reflect the UK.More than 850 staff relocated to Salford, with the last movers there by April 2012.The committee's report said relocation costs for 11 staff members exceeded £100,000 per person, with one costing £150,000. The average relocation cost was £28,000."Some relocation allowances that the BBC paid to staff to move to Salford seem excessive and its recording of exceptions, some of which resulted in higher payments, was inadequate," the report said.The BBC said that the 11 cases reflected the higher stamp duty and other costs involved in relocating staff who owned high-value properties in the South East, according to the PAC report.Around 10% of relocating staff received allowances that were exceptions to the BBC's standard policy, the PAC added, noting the reasons for many of these were not clearly recorded.But the committee concluded "the BBC completed most aspects of the move to Salford successfully".In the long term, it said the success of the move "depends on the BBC achieving the wider benefits it promised".It continued: "These include reducing the gap between northern and southern audiences in the BBC's market share and stimulating economic and other regional benefits, including creating up to 15,000 jobs."The report went on to suggest the BBC "risks becoming overly dependent" on the Peel Group, the property giant which owns the BBC's Salford buildings.It also said signing a 10-year contract to use TV studios was "risky" because the pace of technological change could see the BBC having to pay for studio services it did not need.The committee also said it was "dismayed" by the failure of the Digital Media Initiative, a BBC IT project that was scrapped in May at a cost of £100m. It said it would examine the matter further later this year.In response, the BBC statement added: "We have just celebrated two years of award-winning TV, radio and online content and the whole region is sharing in the momentum of MediaCity with spend by the public service broadcast channels in the region up from 15.9% to 20%."Speaking on the BBC Blog on Wednesday, Peter Salmon, director of BBC North, said there were "lessons to be learned" from what he called "the biggest move in British broadcasting history".He also admitted the corporation "made a couple of slip-ups" in relocating 854 people from the south of England to the north and said it would "never happen again".However, Mr Salmon said that MediaCity remained "a big success story for the north of England".And he insisted that the "flexible nature" of the BBC's deal with the Peel Group meant "we don't pay them a penny that we don't use to put programmes on air"."What underpins the success of the site... are the brilliant skills of the people we recruited," he continued."That's why the place is thriving - because great people make it work, every hour of every day."</body>

      <title>Real story behind Scottsboro Boys</title>
      <description>The real story behind the civil rights musical</description>

      <body>The Scottboro Boys, which opens at The Young Vic tomorrow, is a musical based on the true story of a group of black teenagers wrongly accused of rape. Their case became a milestone in the history of US civil rights - but the daughter of one of the real Scottsboro Boys mainly recalls her father's private suffering.Professor Dan Carter first published his book on the Scottsboro Boys trials as long ago as 1969, so he's become adept at summarising how the complex legal and human saga began."One day in the spring of 1931 a group of hobos, black and white, were travelling on a train in north Alabama. A fight broke out and the train had to be stopped near the town of Scottsboro. Nine young black men - the youngest was 13 - were arrested."But then the Deputy Sheriff realised two of the white hobos were in fact women. The young women worried they might be accused of prostitution, so they accused the black boys of having raped them."I think anyone today who studied the evidence would conclude no rapes occurred. In any case, what happened after March 1931 took on an astonishing life of its own. What happened on the train was just a part of the story."For the rest of the 1930s, the Scottsboro Boys (as they soon became known) were front page news in America.At the first of numerous trials, eight of the nine received death sentences and some of them spent long periods on Death Row. That ultimately no one was executed was in part the doing of the Communist Party USA.The communists paid for the services of celebrated attorney Samuel Leibowitz to defend the Boys. The involvement of political radicals infuriated Alabamans - some of whom didn't much enjoy being lectured by a Jewish lawyer from New York.But Dan Carter says the party's money and organising abilities proved crucial. "Without them, some of the Scottsboro Boys would surely have gone to the electric chair."At times it seemed the Scottsboro Boys had become pawns in a protracted face-off between liberal America and the conservative (and still segregated) south.But over the years the authorities in Alabama lost faith in the evidence against the Boys, who were now men. And perhaps Alabama decided the whole thing was more trouble than it was worth, with repeated appeals to the Supreme Court in Washington.The last of the nine men walked free in 1950, almost two decades after the original charges.Clarence Norris had been paroled in 1946. Seeking a fresh start he assumed his brother's identity and moved north to New York City. He married and took jobs as a warehouseman and in sanitation.His daughter Deborah Webster remembers with absolute clarity the day her father told her and her sister about his earlier life."I was around 14 or 15 and he was in his late 50s. I was shocked at what he told me. Shocked."As a teenager in New York I had never heard of the Scottsboro Boys so he had to explain the whole story. But the fact my father spent years in jail for something he didn't do hurt me deeply.""I could see the hurt in his eyes too - and I will never forget it. The pain never left him. It wasn't just his freedom that was taken from him. He didn't have his family anymore and he'd had to assume someone else's identity. Who wouldn't be pained at that?But Deborah thinks ultimately the revelation helped her understand her father better."My father was very distant. There were times he came off a little too hard. I used to always feel he had no heart at all. But, in later years, I could connect and understand where all that was coming from. It was from a real dark place.""He wasn't educated, due to his situation when he was a young man. So I would get home from school and he would ask me to read his mail to him."I thought he was checking up on my schooling but then I realised he didn't know how to read. With all the things he went through we had modest means and we struggled a lot. We're still struggling."But my father never spoke of any hate. He never taught us to be prejudiced and I honour him for that. That had to take a special kind of human being to not have that in his heart after all he'd been through."In 1976, Alabama governor George Wallace agreed to a full pardon for Clarence Norris. Speaking for the TV cameras, after years of lying low, Clarence Norris said he held hate for no one. He wished only that 'these other eight Boys' were around.Deborah recalls that the pardon brought her father great happiness. "He even learned how to read. I took great pride in that, to see him overcome a lot of the barriers he had to face. I will always remain proud of my father and I'm very honoured to be his daughter."Three years ago Deborah and her son Harsan were invited to the original New York production of The Scottsboro Boys. The story might not seem a natural fit for a musical - so had she hesitated?"I was in two minds at first, though I was thrilled that all these years later people are still interested in the Scottsboro Boys. But the way the play was brought across it took a lot of the harshness out of the actual story. So I could sit there and enjoy it. Music lightens the heart."Some see the Scottsboro trials as a precursor of the civil rights movement of later years. Dan Carter says one effect was an important Supreme Court judgement which made it illegal to exclude black jurors in a trial.Professor Carter has been at the forefront of those seeking a full pardon for all nine Scottsboro Boys. It's thought the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles may decide before the end of the year."I'm pretty optimistic," says Professor Carter. "Of course everyone concerned is dead or presumed dead. But even if it's only a symbol of reconciliation and respect it's one many people would welcome profoundly."The Scottsboro Boys opens at the Young Vic 18 October.Listen to Vincent Dowd's Witness on the Scottsboro Boys via BBC iPlayer Radio or download the programme from the BBC World Service podcast archive.</body>

      <title>NoNoNo: Whistling their way to chart success</title>
      <description>Pop trio NoNoNo on their songwriting secrets</description>

      <body>Swedish imports NoNoNo are about to launch an assault on the UK charts with their intoxicating pop anthem Pumpin Blood. Despite its whistled refrain, it was born from the band's frustrations with the music industry, they tell the BBC.It's late August and Stina Wappling is chilling out at her country house in the woods, one-and-a-half hours north of Stockholm.She needs the rest, because soon she'll be spun across Europe and the US in a promotional whirlwind for her band's breakout single Pumpin Blood.A cheery pop riot, it's climbing up the global airplay charts after being featured on an advertisement for a certain popular phone brand."I haven't heard it on the TV because I don't have a telly," admits Wappling, "but I know it's there".She doesn't have any qualms about her music being used in a commercial. "It's one way to get the music across to more people," she argues, at a time when broadcasters have abandoned pop music shows."So I don't mind it, as long as it's not a commercial for something evil or bad."Such as?"I wouldn't want to be in a diet bar commercial."Wappling has been around the music industry since she was 17, when Warner Brothers signed her to a publishing contract.She spent her summers working with various songwriters while she completed a psychology degree in Brighton - but the dream didn't live up to the reality."People are really hit-oriented," she says. "They want to replicate something that is a hit right now - like that would be the best thing that could ever happen."But that made me really sad, and I started thinking I didn't like writing music that much."Disillusioned, she started working as a psychiatric nurse in a day centre for people with mental disorders."You help them with their medicine and their day-to-day activities," she explains. "They're in apartments surrounding the centre, so they can always come in to you if they have a problem or they want to talk."She also found a way to put her musical talents to use."I don't know if it's proven, but there are two people I work with who are really amazing with music," she says. "It seems it can relax a haunted brain."If you have schizophrenia or something like that, and there's lots of impulses firing off in the brain, music can help you focus and get into a space where you're free from voices and illusions for a little bit."I feel like I've experienced that. It can be really good for someone who has those kinds of disorders."Wappling hasn't entirely given up on psychiatry ("when I'm 40, I'm going to be a therapist," she says) but music eventually came calling again.Her salvation came in the form of Astma and Rocwell (Tobias Jimson and Michel Flygare), two producers who turned out to be kindred spirits."It kind of happened gradually," she says."I was working on my solo project and they were working as producers, and we noticed we liked the same kind of songs."Their tastes were so similar, in fact, that it started to cause problems."We always wanted to keep the songs for our own projects!" the singer laughs. "In the end, it was so much better if we could put all our energy into one project."Everyone had been thinking about it unconsciously. When Tobias and Michel asked me, it was like 'of course'. It was almost a relief."And so, NoNoNo was born in summer 2012.The name, disappointingly, is not a tribute to 2 Unlimited's No Limits (ageing ravers take note: Stina is too young to remember it). Instead, it's a two finger salute to the uninspired writers they'd been working with."It's so scary to say no, to close a door," says Wappling."You worry that you won't know what to do next. But I think it's more probable that you'll find something you really want to do when you give yourself space."So we think NoNoNo is something that's positive. You have so much more freedom than you think."With its defiant, optimistic lyrics ("And the whole wide world is whistling!") Pumpin Blood was one of the first songs the band completed."It almost wrote itself," recalls Wappling."It all started with Michel having the whistling tune on a very basic track. He played it to me and it made me really, really happy, instantly."I was like, 'I really want to write something on top of this.'"Whistling is a dangerously unstable element for any songwriter to handle: For every Sitting On The Dock Of The Bay, there's a Wind Of Change. Were they worried it might go wrong?"If it had been 'let's make a whistling hit,' then maybe we'd have had to worry," says the singer."But it came without a plan. We don't really analyse the music we make - because if you calculate it, that's when it can get a little bit cheesy."While Pumpin Blood is poised for a UK release in November, we're playing catch-up with Scandinavia, where it was a major hit earlier this year.The single was preceded by another, equally-infectious record, Like The Wind, which marries the squawking vocals of Kate Bush to the stroppy percussion of fellow Swede Lykke Li.As a result, the band are under pressure to release an album at home, while touring the rest of the world as newcomers."The plans are different everywhere," says Wappling. "Everything is really ahead in Sweden. It's a little bit difficult to keep it straight in your head!"The album is almost finished, she says. They just need a decent idea for the title."Oh, I had a really, really awful one just before I went to sleep," she cringes. "Peace, Love and Cinnamon Buns!"Very strange. I don't even know where it came from. So I gave up and fell asleep."Pumpin Blood is released in the UK on 3 November. NoNoNo play the Ja Ja Ja Festival, a celebration of Nordic music, at London's Roundhouse 9 November.</body>

      <title>Winslet on her 'fragile' new role</title>
      <description>Kate Winslet on playing an agoraphobic mother</description>

      <body>Kate Winslet has said her new film Labor Day marks a departure from the strong, feisty women she is used to playing.The Titanic and Little Children star appears alongside Josh Brolin in a much more "fragile" role, as a troubled single mother who is forced to take an escaped prisoner into her home."I haven't really played a character who was so obviously weak in so many ways," Winslet said at the London Film Festival."That was intriguing to me. But I admired her strength as well and I felt it was very important that she was strong, because I think that we all have the capacity to be both of those things, no matter how broken a person can sometimes be."Winslet, who won an Oscar for her performance as Nazi concentration camp guard Hanna Schmitz in The Reader, said she loved the fact that her character Adele still managed to be "a good mother" to her teenage son.And she admitted to mothering 14-year-old co-star Gattlin Griffith, who played son Henry, off camera too."It was one of the most wonderful working relationships that I've ever had," said Winslet."I just knew that I had to really be his friend and I wanted to guide him. I mean he was really my priority on set."Luckily the actress also found time to bond with Brolin, who revealed he "adored" his co-star."I think we were very lucky," said Winslet. "Because I mean I hate Leo (DiCaprio) for example.""Obviously that was a joke!" she quickly added, referring to the long-running friendship with her Titanic and Revolutionary Road co-star DiCaprio.Brolin, who plays Frank, a man on the run after 19 years behind bars, revealed they have come in for some stick about the relationship that develops between him and Adele."You know I've heard it a couple of times. 'It's not very likely this would happen'," said Brolin"And then you go in to watch Jurassic Park, and you go, 'But this would?' You know, it is indeed a movie."For director Jason Reitman, who has had hits with Juno, Up in the Air and Young Adult, the film marks a slight departure from his usual style."Reading a book or a script for the first time that you're considering directing, it's either love at first sight or its not," explained Reitman of the story, based on a novel by Joyce Maynard."I just clicked with this book. It made me weep. Having spent a career of just trying to make people laugh, it's kind of nice to be after their tears."However one particular scene involving Adele, Henry and Frank making a peach pie could certainly diffuse the tension.It bears striking similarities to the famous pottery scene between Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore in 1990 film Ghost."You know it's funny, I keep on hearing this Ghost reference and it's kind of awesome," Reitman told the BBC."The Ghost scene, and I guess my pie scene, boarder on being ridiculous. They're an inch away from being satirical and yet they're earnest and lovely."And he revealed pies actually played quite a large role on set."Joyce (Maynard) taught me to how to make a pie, Joyce taught Josh to make a pie. Josh made a pie every single day of this shoot," said Reitman."You'd show up at his cottage and he'd be there in an apron, this picture of masculinity, talking about 'look at the crust!'. He'd get all excited."Brolin said he honed his catering skills while working in a restaurant for three years when he was younger, but his career never took off as his father James Brolin had hoped he would be a lawyer."I like cooking very much, I cook for my kids all the time," said Brolin."I cooked many pies, this is true. When you watch the film, we gain more weight. Every 15 minutes you see everybody a little bit heavier."Labor Day is being screened as part of the London Film Festival, but will be released across the UK in February.</body>

      <title>Press views: David Brent's band</title>
      <description>What did critics make of Ricky Gervais's first gig as David Brent?</description>

      <body>Ricky Gervais has performed the first of two gigs as The Office character David Brent with his band, Foregone Conclusion, at London's Bloomsbury Theatre. Gervais revived his well-loved cringeworthy character from the hit series with a performance on Comic Relief earlier this year. Brent has recently appeared on YouTube giving guitar lessons.After a disarming warm-up spot by comedy rap artist Doc Brown and a perfunctory intro from The Office's Keith (a heavy-breathing, scotch-egg eating Ewen MacIntosh), a goatee-d Brent and co ploughed through the numbers. They got whoops and cheers. They even raised the roof with that jaunty reggae spoof Equality Street.But even with an encore of the properly catchy Free Love Freeway - the song that first demonstrated Brent's thwarted talent - the set was over after 40 minutes or so. There was little between-songs banter, and from that squirm-making figure who famously "fused Flashdance with MC Hammer" in his infamous goon-ish dance, surprisingly few moves.Read the full review hereThis is much more enjoyable than Gervais's own recent stand-up, which displays Brent-esque insensitivity but few of that character's redeeming features. What it isn't, though, is particularly sophisticated musical comedy. The laughs derive from Brent's foot-in-mouth personality and the occasional choice couplet: "you know just where you're heading," he sings in Slough, "it's equidistant 'tween London and Reading."Read the full review herePlaying air guitar in between vocals and sipping on a cheap can of Fosters, the good news is success won't ruin David Brent. Ricky Gervais was performing songs as Brent from The Office for the first time in concert on Monday night. The 500 tickets sold out in 60 seconds and fans were not disappointed, giving him and the band a standing ovation at the end of a 40-minute set.My personal highlight was Lady Gypsy, where we learned Brent "lost his heart" and his virginity after "18 summers on earth" to a traveller. This folk-tinged song about his awkward conversation with the girl before they went to bed had the crowd including Professor Green and DJ Greg James in stitches.Read the full review hereThe encore could only be Freelove Freeway from The Office - "The love is free and the freeway's long," now given the turbo-charged amplified treatment. And then Brent was gone. Hitting the A4 freeway back to Slough no doubt. This 45-minute work in progress was terrific and there is talk of bigger shows. I'm not sure how much further the joke could be stretched. Knowing Ricky Gervais though, all the way to the O2 Arena.Read the full review hereThe styles are mixed. In Ooh La La he employs every Americana stereotype; Spaceman Came Down is a thinly-disguised parody of Chris De Burgh; and then there's his cringeworthy be-diddly-diddly-diddly-deeing attempts at white-boy rap in the Comic Relief song which started this revival, Equality Street.We could probably have done with more between-song banter; that's what gives the songs context and allows us to laugh more at Brent; and it's hard to believe such a raging egotist wouldn't try to hog the microphone. The first half of the gig seemed to just coast, but in the second, it simply become fun; tracks enjoyable either on an ironic level or just because everyone else is having a good time.Read the full review here</body>

      <title>British Gas raises prices by 9.2%</title>

      <body>British Gas is to increase prices for domestic customers, with a dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2% from 23 November.The increase, which will affect nearly eight million households in the UK, includes an 8.4% rise in gas prices and a 10.4% increase in electricity prices.The company said it "understands the frustration" of prices rising faster than incomes. The average annual household bill will go up by £123.PM David Cameron has urged consumers to switch suppliers for the best deal.Energy Minister Ed Davey has described the latest price rise as "extremely disappointing news" for customers.Rival SSE has already announced an 8.2% increase in bills from 15 November.On average, customers will see a dual-fuel bill increase to £1,444 a year.However, there are significant regional variations. On average, the biggest increase in a dual-fuel bill is an 11.2% rise in the north of Scotland, in the Scottish Hydro Electric region. The smallest is a 6.8% increase in the south west of England.The company said that the cost of buying energy on the global markets, delivering gas and electricity to customers' homes, and the government's "green" levies, were all factors in the decision to put up prices."I know these are difficult times for many customers and totally understand the frustration that so many household costs keep on rising when incomes are not keeping pace," said Ian Peters, managing director of British Gas Residential Energy."We haven't taken this decision lightly, but what is pushing up energy prices at the moment are costs that are not all directly under our control."The company, which operates as Scottish Gas in Scotland, said it made a profit of five pence in the pound after tax.British Gas, the UK's biggest energy supplier, said in May that a profit boost would be used to delay future price rises. This came because customers used 18% more gas in the first four months of the year owing to the cold weather.At the time, a spokesman said: "We will use that [cold weather benefit] to effectively hold prices for as long as possible."Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%.Caroline Flint, shadow energy secretary, said: "These latest price rises show clearer than ever why Labour's price freeze is needed." Party leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election.But the prime minister branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas.Mr Cameron also said he was disappointed with the British Gas' announcement."I would encourage customers who are not happy with the service they're getting, are not happy with the prices, to go to the switching sites online and see whether they can get a better deal," he said.Pressed on whether the government could do more to tackle the underlying issues, Mr Cameron added: "What we can do, which is what we are doing, is to try to get new suppliers into the market."Energy Minister Ed Davey also described the latest price rise as "extremely disappointing news" for customers of British Gas. He questioned the claim that costs imposed by the government were increasing as much as bills and told the Commons that unhappy consumers should consider switching suppliers.However, industry analysts expect other suppliers to announce price rises in the coming weeks, which could affect consumers' switching decisions."The question now is whether it will be a trickle or a stampede. However, the fact is that households will be struggling to afford to keep warm this winter," said Tom Lyon, of price comparison website Uswitch.com.Personal finance commentator and campaigner Martin Lewis said it was important that, if consumers do decide to switch, they should focus on fixed rate tariffs.Because only two of the energy companies have currently put their prices up, those who switch now are likely to be hit with price rises if they switch to another variable rate tariff.He said people can "beat the price hikes" by going to fixed tariffs.Adam Scorer, of watchdog Consumer Futures, said: "We would urge anyone worried about their energy costs to shop around to try to find a better deal and ensure they are on the cheapest payment method, such as direct debit."There are also some discounted insulation and heating measures available and we would encourage people to take advantage of this to cut their bills."Mr Davey said that British Gas would need to justify its decision "openly and transparently".Many of British Gas's customers made their annoyance at the price rise known during a Twitter question and answer session with customer service Bert Pijls earlier this afternoon.</body>

      <description>US government employees head back to work after President Barack Obama signed a law ending a government shutdown and extending the US debt limit.</description>

      <body>Hundreds of thousands of US government employees are heading back to work after President Barack Obama signed a law ending a 16-day government shutdown and extending the US debt limit.The cross-party deal came hours before the US government risked running out of money to pay its bills."There are no winners," Mr Obama said, adding the US would "bounce back".The deal followed 16 days of partial government shutdown, which began when Congress failed to agree on a budget.Congress voted through the deal less than a day before a deadline to raise the $16.7tn (£10.5tn) debt limit.The measure approved in Washington funds the government to 15 January, and extends the US treasury department's borrowing authority until 7 February.The deal does not resolve the budgetary issues that fiercely divide Republicans and Democrats. Instead, it establishes a cross-party committee of legislators tasked with crafting a long-term budget deal over the coming months.A faction of Republicans in the hardline Tea Party movement had pushed for the confrontation as a way to gut Mr Obama's healthcare reform.However, Mr Obama and the Democrats refused to negotiate, and the law commonly known as Obamacare escaped relatively unscathed.On Thursday, Mr Obama thanked congressional leaders for their help ending the government shutdown and raising the debt limit, but said both had "inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy"."Nothing has done more to undermine our economy the last three years than the kind of tactics that create these kinds of manufactured crises," he said.Mr Obama said politicians had to stop listening to "talking heads" and activists "who profit from conflict" and instead focus on growing the economy and creating a responsible budget."The American people are completely fed up with Washington," he said. "How business is done in this town has to change."Mr Obama called the political crises "a spectacle" which had hurt America's credibility in the world.And to the conservative Republicans who pushed the showdown as a way to extract policy concessions, he said, "Go out there and win an election."Politicians, bankers and economists had warned of global economic calamity unless an agreement to raise the US government's borrowing limit were reached.IMF head Christine Lagarde's positive response to the news was tempered by a call for further action."It will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner," she said in a statement.Economists have estimated the shutdown cost the US economy billions of dollars.The shutdown affected Americans and visitors to the US in countless ways: most national parks were closed, medical research ground to a halt, and ordinary paperwork went unfinished, delaying visa applications, business permits and safety inspections.Hundreds of thousands of employees were put on leave without pay during the shutdown, with many forced to delay purchases or even payment of routine bills. A few days into the shutdown Congress passed a law ensuring they would receive back pay.Before dawn on Thursday, the US Office of Personnel Management, which manages the federal workforce, announced in a terse statement on its website that government workers should return to work as regularly scheduled.A senior manager at the Department of the Interior, which oversees the national parks system and other public land, reminded employees to disable "out of office" email messages, change voicemail prompts, and "check on any refrigerators and throw out any perished food"."We appreciate your sacrifices through these difficult times and we understand that the lapse in government activities has imposed hardships on you, your families, and the people we serve," Rhea Suh, assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, wrote.Federal workers returning to the downtown Washington DC office of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were greeted by Vice-President Joe Biden and a welcome note from their boss, agency head Gina McCarthy."I know the past couple of weeks have been difficult, especially for families," Ms McCarthy wrote. "Let me be one of the first to welcome you back to EPA and tell you that we have certainly missed you!"A security officer at the building said the shutdown had been "depressing" and had made her realise how much she enjoyed her job."I enjoy checking in 500 people every day," said Ettereteen Welch.Spurred on by hardline conservatives, congressional Republicans forced the stand-off by linking budget measures to healthcare reform.Despite reluctant support from the House Republican leadership for the bill approved on Wednesday, most of the party's lawmakers in the House voted against it.Among those who opposed it was chairman of the House budget committee Paul Ryan, who called the deal a "missed opportunity"."Today's legislation won't help us reduce our fast-growing debt," he said."In my judgement, this isn't a breakthrough. We're just kicking the can down the road."Republican Senator John McCain told the BBC he was "very relieved" that the political crisis had ended."I'm guardedly optimistic and confident that we won't revisit it this way again," he said."The reaction of the American people is very, very negative, and understandably so."</body>

      <title>Osborne agrees to China nuclear deal</title>
      <description>The Chancellor, George Osborne, announces that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.</description>

      <body>The Chancellor, George Osborne, has announced that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.The announcement also said that Chinese firms might eventually be allowed to take majority stakes in British nuclear plants.Mr Osborne made the announcement on the last day of a trade visit to China.The first China deal could be as early as next week, with the go ahead for a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site.Also on Thursday, a report commissioned for the prime minister warned of a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years.The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits".Supply is expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15.Most existing coal-fired plants are expected to be closed in 2015 to meet European Union pollution directives, while many gas-fired power plants are not being used at the moment because gas is so expensive.These would take time and money to bring back on stream.The Hinkley C project, in Somerset, will be the first new nuclear power station since 1995.Hinkley C's construction will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EDF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs.EDF has been negotiating with three Chinese nuclear giants on the Hinkley C project - CGN, CNNC and SNPTC - all of which have been seen by the chancellor this week.Our business editor, Robert Peston, says he has been told that one or two of these will end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C.A DECC spokesperson said talks about a contract were underway: "Negotiations remain ongoing between the government and EDF on the potential terms of an investment contract for Hinkley Point C. No agreement has as yet been reached."A contract will only be offered if it is value for money, fair and affordable, in line with government policy on no public subsidy for new nuclear and consistent with state-aid rules."Mr Osborne made the announcement while on a visit to a nuclear plant in southern China on Thursday which is itself a collaboration between EDF and the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG).He said: "Today is another demonstration of the next big step in the relationship between Britain and China, the world's oldest civil nuclear power and the world's fastest growing civil nuclear power."The memorandum of understanding also includes roles for British companies in China's nuclear programme.China has 17 nuclear reactors in operation, which provide about 1% of its electricity production capacity.In the future, Chinese firms might be allowed more than just minority stakes in UK plants. The government said that "over time, stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes".At the weekend, the Energy Minister, Ed Davey, said he believed that a "massive" wave of investment from China, Japan and Korea would secure UK's power supply into the future.Securing future energy supplies is a major challenge.A portion of energy bills is being diverted to alternative energy investment in wind farms and solar energy.But these, renewable, energy sources cannot provide enough power for the country's energy needs.The industry regulator, Ofgem, has also warned of the "unprecedented challenge" to secure power supplies.It said spare electricity power production capacity could fall to 2% by 2015, increasing the risk of blackouts.</body>

      <title>Prince Charles in pensions warning</title>
      <description>The Prince of Wales tells the pensions industry to use a longer-term investing approach or risk a 'miserable future' for the next generation.</description>

      <body>The Prince of Wales has told the pensions industry to use a longer-term investing approach or risk a "miserable future" for the next generation.He warned a National Association of Pension Funds' (NAPF) conference that the current focus on short term investing was "unfit for purpose".Prince Charles said the pensions industry was vital for the economy "now and in the future".The NAPF said it was "pleased" he was "shining a light on these issues."Prince Charles cited "mounting evidence" from Harvard and London Business Schools showing that businesses willing to improve their approach to environmental and social challenges were more likely to deliver long-term returns.The prince said investors had a "duty" to manage risks from rising populations, climate change and "unprecedented levels" of financial indebtedness, he said.He added: "I can only urge you to deploy your considerable human ingenuity to make that innovative and imaginative leap that the world so badly needs.""Otherwise your grandchildren and mine, for that matter will be consigned to an exceptionally miserable future."NAPF chief executive Joanne Segars said sustainability and environmental issues were important to long-term pension fund investors, and were the basis for providing good pensions for people in future.Former pensions adviser to the government Ros Altmann agreed with the prince's comments.She said: "Pensions are meant to deliver long-term value. What we don't want is to get hijacked by the short-term and sell our children's future away."Ms Altmann said it was "clear" that changes needed to be made."We are living for today in a dangerous way," she said.She said she understood why the short-term focus existed for political reasons, but that pension funds should not be operating on the same timetable.The government will enrol up to nine million more people in pensions during the next five years as fears grow that people are living for longer but not saving for their old age.A spokesperson for Saga, a company that focuses on the over 50s, said Prince Charles was "absolutely right" to speak out.He added: "Whilst the heir to the throne may have a secure future, many of his potential subjects have something altogether less savoury in store for their retirement."</body>

      <body>Retail sales grew by 0.6% in September compared with the previous month, following an unexpected fall in August.The Office for National Statistics also said sales volumes had risen by 2.2% compared with September 2012, despite a fall of sales in supermarkets.The retail sales figures are based on a monthly survey of 5,000 UK retailers.The performance of the retail industry is seen as an indicator of the wider economy and the strength of consumer spending.Furniture sales provided the biggest driver for the monthly rise in sales, owing to a pick-up in the housing market. Sales volumes in household goods stores grew by 3%.Retail sales have see-sawed in recent months. In July, the fine summer weather pushed sales up higher than expected, with barbecue food selling well.Then, a month later, consumers reined in spending, particularly on food, leading to a drop in sales volumes.In September, analysts had expected a rebound, but not to the degree seen in the latest official figures.In addition to household goods, sales at clothing, footwear and textile retailers increased by 1.2% compared with August.Ian Geddes, UK head of retail at Deloitte, said although confidence was rising, growth in wages remained "stubbornly low", so many consumers were "yet to benefit" from having more money.He said pressure was on for retailers to get their product and brand "exactly right"."Those who deliver highly desirable and creative products with distinctive and well-understood branding continue to reap the rewards," Mr Geddes added.David Tinsley, UK economist at BNP Paribas, said he expected recovery in the housing market to "start to show up shortly".But he said wages would have to rise before a more sustainable recovery could happen."We would not be surprised to see some softer patches in retail spending ahead," he added.</body>

      <description>Workers at the Grangemouth complex are being told about cuts the plant's owners want to see in pay and pensions.</description>

      <body>Workers at the Grangemouth complex are being told about changes the plant's owners want to see in pay and pensions.Ineos said Grangemouth is "financially distressed" and must reduce costs.But Unite the union has hit back with an analysis of accounts suggesting Ineos is in better health than it is saying.Unite said it has "blown a hole" in the claims of losses, and that the Swiss-based company has been "pulling the wool" over the country's eyes.On Wednesday, Ineos said Grangemouth "is shut and remains shut", despite Unite's strike threat being called off.The company is putting proposed contract changes to the workforce, expecting an answer by Monday. The company will discuss the complex's future with shareholders on Tuesday.Speaking on BBC radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Ineos director Tom Crotty denied any suggestion that the company was holding its workforce to ransom.Mr Crotty said: "That is certainly not the case. Let's be clear here - the reason the site is shut down today is because Unite called a strike for the weekend over the Stephen Deans issue."The reason we are not reopening it is because we have no assurances from Unite they will not continue to force us to close by having more industrial action."We will keep talking to the union as well, but we are going to talk directly to our employees and put it to them."We are going to talk to the workforce about the survival plan and ask them to support that survival plan, because we believe very, very strongly that Grangemouth has a great future but only if we can make the changes that are required to make it competitive. We are in a global market here. If we don't make changes it will not have a future."Ineos said it was conducting direct consultations with employees on the changes to pensions and terms and conditions.It said the changes had already been highlighted in the company's Survival Plan.They said this would include "a top quality money-purchase pension scheme to replace the unaffordable final salary scheme" and maintain their salary (typically £55,000 per year).Ineos also said it wanted "a more modern approach to workplace representation".Calum MacLean, Ineos Grangemouth (UK) chairman, said: "This is D Day for Grangemouth."The site is safely closed whilst we consult the workforce. If we can get the changes we want, the company has committed to investing a further £300 million in the site which will help secure its long term survival."In a separate development, Labour MP Michael Connarty claimed in the Commons there may have been "some sort of collusion" between the government and Ineos to enable the company, he said, to "break the workforce".The Falkirk East and Linlithgow MP said it was clear that "planning" went into the shutdown of the refinery in order to ensure that fuel supplies to Scotland could continue if the dispute is prolonged.Mr Connarty claimed that Ineos chief executive Jim Ratcliffe was the "equivalent of a Russian oligarch" and may have been involved in "collusion with this government to store up supplies so he can take on the workforce and break them".Ineos has supported its claims of "financial distress" with evidence from its auditor, PwC.This showed negative earnings of £110m between 2010 and this year, and capital expenditure of £468m. This has been described as a loss of £579m.However, Unite asked Richard Murphy, an accountant and tax campaigner, to assess the claims, and to find out more about Ineos' finances.He concluded that the claim of a £579m "loss" is misleading, as it includes capital spending and is cash flow.Mr Murphy admitted that it is hard to find which parts of the Ineos business cover operations at Grangemouth.But his assessment of the company called Ineos Chemicals Grangemouth Ltd suggests that the company has added special one-off measures to make the accounts look bad, including the write-off in valuation of the petro-chemical plant.Mr Murphy says a deferred tax allowance of £117m implies that the company expects to make around £500m in profits over several years.His assessment says the pension fund gained £7m, sales grew 50% and operating profit grew by 56%.Unite says the findings "blow a hole" in the Ineos financial claims. Pat Rafferty, regional secretary of Unite, commented: "We believe the company is using fancy accounting tricks to pull the wool over the country's eyes and treat us with contempt."The company gives the impression it is broke and it may need to close the Grangemouth site, but we believe this is just a ploy to justify attacking its workforce and to demand government handouts".An Ineos source confirmed that the complex structure of its finances means the analysis has failed to account for internal transfers and loans and that it is "naive".The BBC understands that a report on the investigation into Stephen Deans, the union representative whose case initially triggered the Grangemouth dispute, will be delivered to Ineos by legal advisers on Thursday.The company has said previously the investigation would be completed by 25 October.Meanwhile, BP says the Forties Pipeline System, which brings oil and gas ashore from more than 50 North Sea fields, is continuing to operate normally at the moment.The pipeline and BP's processing plant at Kinneil depends on steam from the neighbouring Ineos facility at Grangemouth.A spokesman for BP said: "At the moment the Kinneil plant and the Forties pipeline are operating normally."But as the shutdown of Grangemouth continues, BP could not guarantee that this would continue to be the case.The spokesman said what happened next was a matter for Ineos.</body>

      <body>US investment bank Goldman Sachs has reported a 20% drop in third quarter revenues, but protected profits by trimming employees' pay and benefits.Revenues sank to $6.27bn (£3.9bn) in the July-to-September period, as fixed income trading fell sharply.However, profit was $1.52bn, almost unchanged from a year earlier."The third quarter's results reflected a period of slow client activity," said chief executive Lloyd Blankfein in a statement.Shares in the bank fell by more than 4%, before recovering slightly.Fixed income trading revenue at the bank declined by 44%, far more than the declines seen in comparable banks such as Bank of America and JP Morgan.However, Mr Blankfein said business could improve following the deal to resolve the budget impasse in Washington."As longer term US budget issues are resolved, we could see an improvement in corporate and investor sentiment that would help lay the basis for a more sustained recovery," he said.In order to shore up its balance sheet, the bank cut costs primarily by setting aside less for bonuses and other forms of banker pay.The amount set aside for employee compensation was $2.38bn, down 35% from a year earlier.</body>

      <description>Working parents in Britain no longer earn enough to "escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn warns in his first report.</description>

      <body>Working parents in Britain "simply do not earn enough to escape poverty", the government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn has warned.Two-thirds of poor children are now from families where an adult works, his report found.Many low and middle-income children face being "worse off" than their parents because of falling earnings and rising prices, Mr Milburn added.Wealthier pensioners' benefits should be cut and minimum pay raised, he said.The former Labour health secretary suggested some benefits currently protected from cuts - such as free TV licences and winter fuel allowances for pensioners - could be means tested in order to share the burden of austerity more fairly.But a spokesman for David Cameron said: "The prime minister believes it is right to make commitments to pensioners in relationship to state provision."The government has pledged to safeguard such benefits until the next general election.In its first report, the government's Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission warned the target of ending child poverty by 2020 would "in all likelihood be missed by a considerable margin" - leaving as many as two million children in poverty.Poverty is defined as having a household income that is less than 60% of the national median income.The latest government figures on poverty, released in June, show the median UK household income for 2011/2012 was £427 a week - 60% of that figure was £256 a week.In that year, 17% of children, or 2.3 million, were classed as being in poverty while 15% of working-age adults, or 5.6 million, were in poverty.For pensioners, meanwhile, that figures was 16% - or 1.9 million.The report said Britain still had "high levels of child poverty and low levels of social mobility" with a rising number of children in "absolute poverty" coming from working families.Two thirds of children officially deemed as being poor now came from a family where at least one parent was working - and in three out of four of those cases, at least one of their parents was working full time, the report found.It also said the "twin problems of high youth unemployment and falling living standards" were storing up problems for the future.Among its key recommendations the report urged the government to:"Just as the UK government has focused on reducing the country's financial deficit it now needs to redouble its efforts to reduce our country's fairness deficit," the report said.Single mother Judith Healy, who works from home as a telemarketer, said that, while her wages had not gone up, her expenses had continued to increase.She said she was worried about paying energy bills this winter."We didn't ask to get in this situation, we are doing the best that we can in the circumstances that we have and that's really what it's about - it's survival now," she told BBC News.Mr Milburn told the BBC: "Today child poverty is a problem for working families rather than the workless or the work-shy."Around five million people in the country, mainly women, were earning less than the living wage, which is about £7.45 an hour outside of London, he said."These are the people frankly who do all the right things, they go out to work, they stand on their own two feet, they look after their families - they're the strivers not the shirkers - and yet they're all too often the forgotten people of Britain and I think they desperately need a new deal."Mr Milburn said that while ministers and employers could do more, it was unrealistic to expect the government to continue topping up low pay using working tax credits.He advocated a scheme for pairing bright children with the best teachers in an effort to raise attainment.Mr Milburn has previously said social mobility - the idea that individuals can better themselves in terms of educational opportunity, job prospects and salaries from one generation to the next - is "flat-lining".Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg welcomed the report, but warned that "punishing pensioners isn't going to help a single child achieve more in life".Enver Solomon, of the National Children's Bureau charity, said the report was "a wake-up call for all political parties by stating that our country is dramatically polarised between the haves and have- nots"."As the commission states, there is an urgent need to rebalance the distribution of resources so that the burden of austerity is more equally shared," he said.Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said the "powerful report" showed "ordinary families' living standards [were being] squeezed and social divisions [were] deepening as a result of this government's decisions to put a privileged few first".On Wednesday, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed the number of unemployed people in the UK fell by 18,000 to 2.49 million in the June-August period.</body>

      <description>Microsoft has released the Windows 8.1 update for its flagship operating system.</description>

      <body>Microsoft has released the Windows 8.1 update for its flagship operating system.The download seeks to address some of the criticisms levelled at the original version of Windows 8.In particular, the update restores the start button and allows a computer to boot up with a traditional desktop interface.The launch comes at a critical time for Microsoft as it seeks a new boss, with PC sales experiencing a long decline.Windows 8 sought to bridge the gap between touchscreen devices, such as tablets and smartphones, and more traditional form laptops and desktop machines. As such it had an interface built of tiles that could be tapped or swiped to open applications.However, many people found the tiled interface did not work well for some of the things they were used to doing with a computer.The changes in 8.1 include:A host of other changes, including better support for multi-tasking and improved links to Microsoft's Xbox game console, are also in the update.Windows 8 was created to capitalise on the growing popularity of tablets and other portable gadgets. Microsoft needs to get people using its software on these machines because sales of desktop machines are in sharp decline.Global shipments of PCs hit a five-year low in early October, according to figures from market research firm Gartner. Sales of PCs had now fallen for six quarters in a row, it added. The downward trend in sales statistics were confirmed by IDC, which added that the decline would probably continue into 2014.The shrinking sales are important for Microsoft because traditionally the bulk of its revenue comes from people and companies buying laptops and desktops and office software to run on them.It is not clear that Microsoft is adjusting to the changes in the types of gadgets that people use. In July, Microsoft was wrote off $900m (£559m) following poor sales of its own-brand Surface touchscreen devices.At the same time, Microsoft has undergone a major reorganisation and has bought phone maker Nokia. It is also launching a new version of its Xbox games console and has begun searching for a new chief executive.Servers ready to dispense the update were turned on at 07:00 New York time (12:00 BST). The update is free to those already running Windows 8. Charges will apply if users upgrade to 8.1 from Windows 7. The update comes just over a year after the launch of Windows 8.</body>

      <body>A UK banking regulator is joining a widening global investigation into possible manipulation of the foreign exchange markets.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has joined the Swiss regulator, FINMA, in investigating allegations of collusion between traders.Recent media reports suggest they used instant messaging services to work together to fix exchange rates.Hong Kong authorities are also looking into the matter."We can confirm that we are conducting investigations alongside a number of other agencies both in the UK and abroad into a number of firms relating to trading on the foreign exchange (forex) market," the FCA said in a statement."As part of this we are gathering information from a wide range of sources including market participants. Our investigations are at an early stage and it will be some time before we conclude whether there has been any misconduct which will lead to enforcement action."Royal Bank of Scotland confirmed it was among those contacted by the FCA, and said it was co-operating fully.Any indication of manipulation is significant because of the huge size of the foreign exchange market. Transactions generate more than $5tn (£3.1tn) a day.The involvement of UK regulators had been widely expected, due to the central role that London plays in the market. More than 40% of foreign exchange trading takes place in the UK.</body>

      <body>(Close): Well received results from BSkyB boosted its shares, but the wider market fell despite news of a temporary deal to avoid a US debt default.BSkyB shares jumped 7.1% after the pay-TV firm reported a 7% rise in first-quarter revenues.The firm said it ended the quarter with 11.2 million retail customers, a rise of 71,000 in the period.The FTSE 100 index was up by 4.57 points at 6,576.16. This follows the news of a US deal.On the currency markets the dollar fell as analysts felt the US Federal Reserve was now unlikely to start tapering its stimulus programme until at least the start of 2014.The pound rose 1.3% against the dollar to $1.61620.In corporate news, SABMiller rose 4.2% after the brewing giant reported a 4% rise in net revenues, helped by growth in Africa and Latin America.Outside the FTSE 100, shares in Rank Group fell 2.6% after the gaming group said it expected full-year operating profits to be "marginally below market expectations".The firm said like-for-like revenues for the 15 weeks to 13 October fell 7%, which it blamed on July's hot weather hitting the number of people attending its venues, and a "disappointing performance" from its Mecca bingo brand.</body>

      <title>Warning of future UK power shortages</title>
      <description>The UK power system is likely to be stretched "close to its limits" in the coming years, a new report warns.</description>

      <body>There is a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years, according to a report commissioned for the prime minister.The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits".Supply is particularly expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15.Last week the National Grid warned of a higher risk of blackouts this winter.The new study was commissioned by the prime minister's Council for Science and Technology to find out how stretched power supplies are likely to be during this decade."Although the electricity supply is expected to be sufficient to cover predicted levels of demand, it is likely to stretch the system close to its limits, notably during the winter of 2014-15," the report said.Dr John Roberts, one of its authors, added: "We've looked back at real events that happened in the past which caused shocks to our system - like very cold winters, like major power stations shutting down."If those things happen again in the future and we don't take measures to correct what's going on, then there's a serious risk that we will have power shortages."To avoid what its authors called "a blackout scenario by 2020", the report called on ministers to:Reacting to the report, Business Minister Michael Fallon said: "The lights are not going to go out. There will be a tightness in supply if nothing is done but stuff is being done."We've opened six new gas plants already. Another is being built. You're going to hear very soon about our investment in new nuclear power stations."Two years ago the UK had a buffer between energy supply and demand of 16%, but this winter that will fall to 5% and it could hit 2% by 2015, according to the National Grid and the energy regulator, Ofgem.</body>

      <title>Labour plans levy on payday lenders</title>
      <description>Labour pledges to introduce a levy on the profits of payday lenders to help support credit unions and other low-cost borrowing alternatives.</description>

      <body>Labour has pledged to impose a levy on the profits of payday lenders to help support lower-cost lending from credit unions and boost money advice services.If elected in 2015, it would introduce an extra charge on the lenders, which charge up to 4,000% interest, on top of fees already paid by all finance firms.Shadow business minister Stella Creasy told the BBC it was "payback time for these payday lenders".Payday lenders say they provide a valuable service to their customers.But Ms Creasy, who became Labour's shadow consumer and competition minister in the recent reshuffle, said: "Some of these companies are making a million pounds a week."They need to pay their share for the damage they're doing."She said the firms were "aggressively targeting people, and once they've got them in their claws, they keep squeezing and squeezing them".Ms Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, added: "Many other industries have set up voluntary organisations, like Drink Aware and Gambling Aware, when their products are causing problems. Yet this industry sits around saying there's no damage being done."These companies need to take responsibility for the damage that they are causing in communities like mine, where I've got 18 of these companies on my high street alone."So we're proposing to put a levy on them that can be used to fund the expansion of credit unions, who need more capital to be able to lend, and also debt and money advice services to help people with their finances, because we are struggling with the cost of living in this country."Ms Creasy's interview preceded a speech by Labour leader Ed Miliband, in which he said the measure was designed to help those already in "desperate need" and people at risk of racking up huge debts they cannot repay in future.The industry has been referred to the Competition Commission and regulators have promised a tightening of the rules, with all borrowers set to be offered an "affordability" check before being given a loan.Mr Miliband claimed that the squeeze on living standards was causing a "personal debt crisis" with a third of those taking out payday loans currently doing so to meet the cost of heating their homes."The prices families have to pay keep on rising faster and faster than the wages they are paid," he said on a visit to south London. "For too many families the end of the month is now their own personal credit crunch."Labour has already said it will cap the cost of credit and give local authorities new powers to limit the spread of payday lending shops in town centres.But Mr Miliband added: "We must protect the most vulnerable people in our society from the worst of exploitation by payday lenders."And it is right that the companies that benefit from people's financial plight, accept their responsibilities to help ensure affordable credit is available."He said the party would consult on the rate of the levy and how it will be implemented.Payday lenders, along with all financial service providers, already pay fees to the Financial Conduct Authority to help fund services such as debt advice.The government currently spends £13m on supporting the growth of credit unions but Labour says these organisations do not have the capacity nor the resources to offer help to all those who need it.Labour says the "explosion" in the payday lending market - with it says has doubled in size to £2.2bn in the last four years - is directly related to what it says is a "cost of living crisis".As many as five million families plan to borrow money from payday lenders in the next six months, and more than 1.5 million households spend more than 30% of their income on unsecured credit repayments, it says.Ministers say proposals announced by the Financial Conduct Authority earlier this month, including a ban on some products and a limit on the times loans can be rolled over, will "call time" on unscrupulous lenders.The Church of England has condemned the practices and ethics of some payday lenders and pledged to launch its own credit service to force many of them out business.But lenders say they are helping people in genuine need with no-one else to turn to and that firms who are members of Consumer Finance Association are heavily regulated already.</body>

      <body>The number of unemployed in the UK fell by 18,000 to 2.49 million in the June-August period, official figures show.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also said the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance last month fell by 41,700 to 1.35 million.The unemployment rate drops to 7.7%, down from 7.8% the previous quarter.The number of people in work, both full-time and part-time, reached a record high of 29.87 million in the quarter, up 155,000.The ONS looks at demand for full-time work and whether part-time workers would rather work longer hours.It said almost 1.5 million people were part-time because they could not find full-time jobs, the highest figure since records began in 1992.The unemployment rate has become a key economic indicator for the Bank of England which, under its recently appointed new governor, Mark Carney, is targeting the unemployment rate.It says it will not consider raising interest rates from their record low of 0.5% until it falls to 7%.The ONS also reported average earnings rose by 0.8% in the year to August.The BBC's chief economics correspondent, Hugh Pym points out this increase in regular pay (excluding bonuses) equalled the lowest recorded in the history of this series.He adds that the fall of 0.1% in average earnings in the public sector over the year to August was the first time such a decrease had been recorded.There was a sharp difference in the number of men and women in part-time employment, with male part-timers increasing by 21,000 and women in part-time work falling by 13,000.But more women were finding full-time work than men, with male full-time employment up by 69,000 compared with a rise of 79,000 for women.Youth unemployment remains just below the one-million mark, with 958,000 unemployed 16 to 24-year-olds, down by 1,000 over the quarter.The number of people unemployed for more than a year fell by 15,000 to 900,000. Those without work for between six months to a year rose by 29,000 to 446,000, but there was a fall of 32,000 people unemployed for up to six months, leaving 1.1 million in that position.The worst affected areas in the UK were in Birmingham Ladywood where the unemployment rate stands at 11.4% and in West Belfast where it is 9.3%.The Prime Minister, David Cameron, said the figures were "good news".He added: "These are welcome figures. Of course, we all want to see living standards improve, and last year disposable income increased. But the way to deliver on living standards is to grow the economy, keep producing the jobs and cut people's taxes."The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, said Mr Cameron should admit that there was "a cost-of-living crisis in this country".Mr Miliband said: "Today's economic figures show a welcome fall in unemployment. They also show that prices have risen faster than wages and that is 39 out of 40 months that living standards have fallen since he became prime minister."The Institute of Directors (IoD) said the jobs data showed the recovery was "job-lite".The IoD's chief economist, Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: "Today's labour market figures are not surprising. Just as employment losses during the recession were lower than expected, so too are employment gains with recovery. This isn't a jobless recovery but it is a job-lite one."The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) gave a cautious welcome to the figures.Its chief economist, David Kern, said: "Although concerns remain over youth and long-term employment, the figures show that Britain's labour market is strong and flexible, and that the economy should record satisfactory growth in the third quarter. The large fall in inactivity is particularly pleasing, as more people are returning to the workforce and are looking for jobs."He added that he expected the unemployment rate to continue to fall steadily and that the 7% unemployment rate targeted by the Bank of England would be reached in the autumn of 2015, a year earlier than the Bank had indicated.</body>

      <body>Thousands of schools are closed across much of England as teachers strike over pay, pensions and jobs.Teachers in London, Cumbria, the South East, North East and South West have been taking part with nearly 3,500 schools shut or partially closed.The action is part of a continuing campaign of regional strikes involving members of the NUT and NASUWT unions.Prime Minister David Cameron said the strike was "inconvenient for parents" and "not good for pupils' education".NUT general secretary Christine Blower, said the union regretted the disruption caused to pupils and parents but teachers felt they had "no other choice".Major rallies have been taking place in Bristol, Durham and London, with smaller events in other areas, including Brighton, Carlisle and Plymouth.Teachers are objecting to proposals by Education Secretary Michael Gove to bring in performance-related pay, increase their workloads and make changes to their pensions.Twenty out of 33 London boroughs have provided information to BBC London 94.9 about the number of schools affected so far.Of those, about 445 schools are completely closed and 450 partially closed.And in Tyne and Wear, at least 471 schools have been affected by the industrial action.Head teacher Roberta Kirby, from Fernhurst Junior School, in Portsmouth, said the government had "declared war" on teachers.More than 200 schools in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight are affected by the action.She said: "If we cannot offer good wages and a pension that staff pay into that reflects the work they do, then we are not going to be able to attract the best graduates."Responding to the impact of the strike, some parents said they had found it difficult to find alternative childcare.The BBC's Sarah Ransome said: "People in Plymouth have been telling me that finding alternative childcare because of the strike has been 'quite a headache'."A similar walkout by teachers took place in the east of England, the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber region on 1 October.Ms Blower said: "Mr Gove has done nothing to address the crisis of low morale in the teaching profession which threatens the continued provision of high quality education."Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said the "overwhelming majority of teachers" were on strike.She said: "Teachers are committed and dedicated public service workers. They do not take strike action lightly."No teacher has any wish to inconvenience parents or disrupt pupils' education, but this action is not the failure or due to the unreasonableness, of teachers."Plans for a national one-day walkout before Christmas have also been announced by the two unions.Speaking to BBC Sussex, Mr Cameron said responsibility for the strike "lies with the teaching unions"."I think it is very disappointing they have decided to go on strike," he said."And when we look at the things they are striking over, pensions and pay, they are things that have been decided independently by well-led reviews."I was at my children's school today in London. One class was not there but the rest of the school was operating."So, every praise to those teachers who have gone ahead and kept our schools open for our kids."A spokeswoman for the Department for Education (DfE) said 27% of the schools in the affected regions were closed, however, there was no figure available for how many were partially closed.She said: "The NUT and NASUWT have tried to create as much disruption for pupils and parents today as possible."In spite of this, thanks to many hardworking teachers and heads, only around a quarter of schools in the targeted regions were closed today."</body>

      <body>The number of people relying on food banks to survive has tripled over the last year, according to new figures.The Trussell Trust, which runs 400 food banks across the UK, said it handed out supplies to more than 350,000 people between April and September this year.A third of those being helped were children, and a third needed food following a delay in the payment of benefits.A cross-party group of MPs has been set up to investigate the surge in demand.The Labour MP Frank Field, appointed by David Cameron as the government's poverty advisor, will head up the committee along with Conservative Laura Sandys.Mr Field said they would investigate the impact of benefit of cuts, low wages and high food prices.The Trussell Trust said the problem was so severe that some people using food banks have started to hand back items that need cooking, as they cannot afford to use the energy.The Trust is calling for a public enquiry into why so many people are having difficulty feeding themselves."The level of food poverty in the UK is not acceptable," said Chris Mould, the Trust's executive chairman."It's scandalous, and it is causing deep distress to thousands of people, " he added.Food banks work through a system of referrals.Professionals including doctors and social workers hand out vouchers, which in the first instance can be exchanged for three days' worth of emergency food.The Trust said that the problem of hunger in the UK is getting worse.Rising living costs and stagnant wages are forcing more people to live on a "financial knife edge", it said.It also forecast that rising energy prices this winter are likely to see more people "choosing between heating and eating."It admits that one reason for the rise in the numbers is that there are twice as many food banks in existence as last year.But the Trust says the number of people using them has still tripled, and that even the well-established food banks are reporting significant rises in their use.It claims that problems with benefit payments is a major factor."We're talking about mums not eating for days because they've been sanctioned for seemingly illogical reasons," said Mr Mould."Or people leaving hospital after a major operation to find that their benefits have been stopped or delayed," he added.However the government has taken issue with the report."The Trussell Trust itself says it is opening three new food banks every week, so it's not surprising more people are using them," said a government spokesperson.On the matter of benefit payments, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said that there was "no robust evidence that welfare reforms are linked to increased use of food banks".It also said that benefit processing times have steadily improved over the past five years, with 90% now being paid within 16 days.There was further evidence of increased demand for food hand-outs from FareShare, an organisation which distributes supplies to more than 1000 charities across the UK.It said requests for its services had risen by 15% over the last year.The supermarket giant Tesco has now agreed to donate all its fresh surplus food to FareShare, so providing 7 million meals a year to those who need them.</body>

      <title>Cuts and tax rises in Irish budget</title>
      <description>The Irish government announces spending cuts and tax rises worth 2.5bn euros (£2.1bn) in what it hopes will be the final Irish budget of the IMF bailout era.</description>

      <body>The Irish government has announced spending cuts and tax rises worth 2.5bn euros (£2.1bn) in what it hopes will be the final budget of the bailout era.A number of social welfare benefits are to be withdrawn or reduced. A grant to help with funeral costs and a telephone allowance for pensioners have been cut.The price of a pint of beer and a packet of cigarettes will both increase from midnight by 10 cents (8p).The opposition accused the government of targeting the elderly in the budget.The savings measures include a review of the Irish medical card system, which entitles eligible people to access certain health services free of charge.The government said it aims to save 113m euros (£95m) by removing all "ineligible and redundant" medical cards, but the opposition said the changes would mean many pensioners would lose access to free health care.There will also be greater restrictions on sickness benefit - the number of days a person must report sick from work before they are eligible to claim will double from three to six days.Maternity benefit is being "standardised" for new claimants, in a move the government said will save 30m euros (£25m) over the next year.However, the government is introducing free GP care for all children under five years of age, and has set aside 37m euros (£31m) to provide this new benefit.The main opposition party, Fianna Fáil, said the medical card changes would badly affect 35,000 pensioners and accused the minister of "robbing grandparents so he can give free GP care to their grandchildren".There will be no change to the state pension, child benefit or carers' allowances, and pensioners will still be entitled to free public transport and TV licences.Finance Minister Michael Noonan said his government was "100% committed to the 12.5% corporation tax rate".The Irish coalition had come under pressure from Europe to raise the business tax in the aftermath of the international bailout.But Mr Noonan said the Republic of Ireland's corporation tax rate was a "settled policy" and "will not change".The Irish economy is emerging from one of the deepest recessions in the eurozone, having sought an 85bn euros (£72m) international bailout in November 2010.At the weekend, Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny told his annual party conference the Republic of Ireland was on track to exit the bailout programme by December.Mr Noonan introduced his budget by saying: "The story of insolvent Ireland is familiar to all our people and the sacrifices people have had to make in recent years are well known.He said financial assistance from the IMF and the European authorities "came at a high price" as Ireland had "lost its sovereignty".However, he said that Tuesday's budget was the first since 2007 to be delivered against a backdrop of rising employment."By the time the majority of the measures that I have announced today become law on the first of January next, I am confident that Ireland will have left the EU/IMF programme."We will have closed this chapter of Ireland's history that began for most of us with the governor of the Central Bank announcing to the Irish public that the country would be forced to turn to the lenders of last resort."There will be no promissory notes, there will be no Anglo Irish Bank and there will be no bank guarantee. We will have exited the programme and Ireland will have been handed back her purse."Mr Noonan added: "We are well along the recovery path and it is time now, as a nation, to begin to look forward."Fianna Fáil finance spokesperson, Michael McGrath, said: "We all hope the country is on the cusp of recovery but I believe it is too early too early to draw any definitive conclusions on that front."He said: "This is a budget that targets the elderly, it targets those who hold medical cards, it targets young mothers, it abandons people struggling to kept their home, and yet again, incredibly, the government has gone out of its way to insulate the better off from the worst affects of this budget".Mr McGrath criticised the withdrawal of the 850 euros (£718) bereavement grant and said the way that pensioners in particular had been treated in the budget was "nothing short of disgraceful"."Not only will many of them now lose their medical card, they will have higher prescription charges, they will lose their telephone allowance, their bereavement grant is gone and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) is going up."Even the dead, minister, are not safe from this government. As if it isn't enough to take a property tax from the estate of those who are deceased, but the modest grant that their loved one gets to given them the dignity of a decent burial is now being removed by this government," Mr McGrath added.</body>

      <body>UK house prices have risen to a record level, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).In August, the ONS's house price index stood at 185.8, surpassing its previous peak of 185.5 in January 2008.The average price of a house or flat in the UK is now £247,000, the ONS said, the highest figure since the index was first calculated in 1968.The figures suggest house prices are rising in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but still falling in Scotland.Prices across the UK rose by 3.8% in the year to August 2013, up from 3.3% in July. However, excluding London and the South East - where property values have seen the biggest increases - prices rose by just 2.1%.Other measures, including surveys from the Halifax and Nationwide, indicate that house prices are still well below record levels.Earlier this month, the Halifax reported that the average price of a house was £170,733, nearly £30,000 short of the peak seen in July 2007.The difference in average prices is due to the different methodology used by the ONS.The ONS index is calculated on actual transaction prices, whereas the Halifax and Nationwide use mortgage approvals.The ONS figures are also higher because expensive properties in London get a larger weighting in their calculations.The number of transactions is also well below that seen at the height of the housing boom.The news may add to concerns that the UK could be facing a house price "bubble", although many feel that these fears have been overplayed.Howard Archer, the chief UK economist of IHS Global Insight, said: "We are a long way off from an overall housing market bubble emerging."However, he also warned that the government's Help to Buy scheme could inflate prices significantly.The scheme, already underway, allows homebuyers to put down a deposit of just 5%.If a buyer defaults on a mortgage, lenders will be able to reclaim some of the money from the government."There is a significant risk that house prices could really take off over the coming months, especially if already appreciably improving housing market activity and rising buyer interest is lifted markedly further by Help to Buy," he said.On Monday, the new deputy governor of the Bank of England, Sir Jon Cunliffe, told MPs that it "doesn't look that we are in a bubble".However, he added that there was a possibility the Help to Buy scheme could cause problems for households."In terms of whether it leads to households becoming overexposed, because they can borrow higher amounts, there is is a possibility it could do that, and that would create more of a risk," he told members of the Treasury Committee.A report from the housing charity Shelter is calling for house prices to be stabilised.It says that otherwise most people in their 20s will stand less than a 50% chance of ever owning a property to live in.</body>

      <title>UK inflation rate unchanged at 2.7%</title>
      <description>The UK's inflation rate remained at 2.7% in September, official figures show, as a fall in fuel prices was offset by upward pressure from air fares.</description>

      <body>The UK's inflation rate, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), remained unchanged in September.Petrol and diesel prices fell, but this was offset by upward pressure from air fares, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.It means prices are still rising faster than wages, which rose by 1.1% on average over the same period.The retail prices index (RPI) measure of inflation fell slightly to 3.2% from 3.3% in August.Air fares fell 18.7% in the year to September, the ONS said, but this was smaller than the 25.2% decrease seen a year ago and so had an upward impact on the inflation rate.September's CPI figure is used to set the rate for some benefits, including the state pension and those for disabled people and carers.The Bank targets CPI inflation of 2%, but is currently holding off raising interest rates to control inflation because the unemployment rate is too high.Under the Bank's policy of forward guidance, it has said it will not consider raising interest rates until the unemployment rate has fallen to 7% or below.However, the Bank has said it could choose to raise rates if it thinks inflation will still be above 2.5% in 18 months to two years' time.The ONS numbers showed that food inflation stood at around 4.8%, little changed on last month.The price of fruit and vegetables rose slightly, driven by an increase in the cost of plums and organic apples, as well as cauliflowers, onions and premium potato crisps.However, a drop in the price of other foods including bread and cereals, fish, jam and chocolate had a downward effect."The disconnect between wages and prices continues apace and following news from the service industry that consumer facing companies are struggling will cast further doubt on a consumer-driven recovery," said Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the currency brokers World First.The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said September's RPI figure would be used to calculate next year's increase in business rates meaning the jump would hurt High Street shops.The BRC said the increase would mean retailers would now pay £3.44 in business rates for every £1 they pay in corporation tax in 2014."Across the country today, retailers are adding up what this increase in the RPI will mean for the cost of their business rates next year. Many will be wondering whether they will be able to stay open," said Helen Dickinson, director general at the BRC.</body>

      <title>Cooking up a successful food business</title>
      <description>UK ready meals boss Charlie Bigham talks about how he was inspired to set up his company, and how he grew it successfully.</description>

      <body>Inspiration can often come from strange places. For UK ready meals boss Charlie Bigham it was being unable to sleep at the border between Iran and Pakistan.Mr Bigham was 28 years old at the time, and he and his then girlfriend were travelling from the UK to India by camper van."It was very, very hot, and we were in a really tough place," he says. "I couldn't sleep, so I just laid there restlessly thinking about what I was going to do for a living when we got back home."I decided there and then that I was going to set up a food business, and it was going to look a bit like this."Mr Bigham had previously worked as a management consultant in London, before he and his girlfriend quit their jobs to go travelling for nine months.His ambition was to set up his own company when they returned to the UK, and now he had his idea - he was going to establish a business that made upmarket ready meals.Mr Bigham was not going to let the fact that he had never worked in the food industry before put him off, and instead he decided he would quickly set about gaining the knowledge and skills he needed.And so upon his return to the UK he got a job at a delicatessen in London's fashionable Notting Hill area."I've always been really interested in food, but I had no food industry experience, so I knew I had to get some cheese under my fingernails, so to speak," he says.He ended up spending almost four months at the deli, and at the same time did lots of research, and working on recipes."It became clear that the idea of making meals which are then sold via shops was a very good idea for a business because it was a massive market, yet one which was very straightforward to start up in," says Mr Bigham."I knew we could start under the radar before any bigger rivals could crush us, and then build quite quickly."In November 1996, 11 months after his return from travelling, and now married to his girlfriend, Mr Bigham launched the business with £25,000 of savings, calling it simply "Charlie Bigham's".To begin with, it was just him and one chef based at a small facility in London's Park Royal business estate.Mr Bigham says: "We had just three product lines to start with - zesty Caribbean lamb, Cajun chicken with salsa, and salmon with a dill and cream sauce. I think we made just 20 meals in total in that first week."To get sales moving, Mr Bigham, now 47, says he simply started "knocking on people's doors"."I went round all the posh delis in London, and the big department stores with food halls. Everyone was approachable, and said, 'Yeah we'll give you a go'."I just had to be mildly persuasive, and I'm not a salesman."What greatly helped us, is that you have to remember that at the time, most ready - or convenience - meals, as I prefer to call them, were pretty dreadful."We were one of the first to make quality ones without anything artificial. This set us apart and made shops interested in stocking us."But while selling to posh stores in London was pleasing, Mr Bigham realised that in order to grow the business he needed to win a contract with one of the UK's supermarket groups. And so he cold-called Waitrose."I just picked up the phone and rang the Waitrose switchboard. I managed to persuade a lovely woman on the phone to put me through to a buyer. I got a meeting, and the buyer said she would give us a go."Charlie Bigham's meals have been stocked by Waitrose ever since, initially at 40 stores for a successful trial period, and then nationwide. Online supermarket Ocado, and Booths, the north of England supermarket chain, have since followed suit.The company now employs 200 people across two sites at the Park Royal business park, and has an annual turnover of £20m, which is now growing at 19% per annum.Mr Bigham says his former job as a management consultant helped him manage the company's growth over the past 17 years.But he is the first to admit that luck and good timing played a major role in his success."The only way you can ever set up a successful business is to be lucky," he says. "It is the thing you need more than anything else. Anyone who says otherwise is just lying."Mr Bigham says that most important piece of luck was all to do with timing."I set up a food business just as interest in food was blossoming in this country. Suddenly there was a wealth of TV chefs, and the national newspapers all added food sections at weekends."And the supermarkets were all being brave and looking outwards towards new suppliers. There was no planning or forethought about all this on my part, it was pure luck."Mr Bigham today gives himself the job title "chairman and creative director". This followed his decision back in 2010 to bring in someone else to handle the chief executive role."It has enabled me to focus on the bits of the business I'm really interested in - product development, and the big strategic picture - working out plans for the next three to five years," he says."The bit in the middle [the day-to-day financial decisions etc] I'm easily bored by, and is best done by someone else."Looking ahead, Mr Bigham says the company has no plans to start exporting, because the freshness, and therefore limited shelf life of his products, makes it too expensive.Nor does he ever intend to move production away from London to somewhere cheaper, because he says he is loyal to his hard-working staff."I'm proud of what we have done to date, but I'm in no way complacent. Owning your own business is a hugely privileged position to be in, because I work with people I have chosen - not many people can say that."</body>

      <title>Do sweat the small stuff</title>
      <description>Experts say paying attention to small details is a crucial part of a firm's success, particularly customer-facing ones.</description>

      <body>Jan Smits is standing in his hotel room staring at his watch and he's not very happy.But Mr Smits is no ordinary guest. He's the Asia, Middle East and Africa chief executive of International Hotels Group (IHG), the world's largest hotel chain.On a trip to India to see how young graduates are trained within the company he has just realised that the time taken to prepare the hotel rooms for bedtime - the so-called turndown service - is not standardised.At the Crowne Plaza New Delhi Rohini the process of turning down the duvet cover and closing the curtains took five minutes, but it should only take two minutes.It seems surprising that someone so senior, a member of the firm's executive committee, is concerned about this kind of small detail which one would assume would fall squarely under the remit of housekeeping.But for IHG, like all businesses, time equals money. If a regular process such as this takes longer than it should, then repeated 678,000 times for each of its rooms worldwide, the extra time spent would be significant and ultimately costly.But it's not only crucial for financial reasons, but so that a guest, whether they are staying at a Crowne Plaza in India or America, has the same experience each time.Mr Smits says IHG uses so-called "standard operating procedures" to ensure this level of standardisation. These outline every single step involved in any regular process, such as a turndown or checking a guest into the hotel, to ensure it is both efficient and consistently creates the same end result."From my experience here tonight there's just a little bit more room to make sure it's exactly the same across all the Crowne Plazas. We're very close but it can't be very close. it needs to be the same each time to create a great brand," he says.While it may appear obsessive, experts argue paying attention to these kinds of details is not only important, but is a crucial part of a firm's success, particularly customer-facing ones.That's because creating a standard and consistent experience can be a good way of making customers loyal to a particular brand."Ultimately it drives customer loyalty and repeat business. As long as it's an enjoyable experience people tend to go to what they know even when they're in another country," says Bridget McVerry, a principal at management consultancy Oliver Wyman where she focuses on the retail sector.She points to fast food chain McDonald's as an example. "You know what you're going to get and not just from a product point of view, but from the overall experience," she says.Recent research by Oliver Wyman in the US found that differences in customer experience were the reason behind one quarter to one third of the variation in sales and profits of individual shops within a chain. Improving the consistency of the customer experience drove sales improvements of 10% or more.And it's not just a good way of creating loyal customers, it can help create loyal employees: retail chains which focused on providing a consistent customer experience - where employees knew what they were supposed to do and were given the training and tools to do it - had staff turnover rates 50% or more below industry norms.Given the very real difference the research shows that focusing on the customer experience can have, Ms McVerry believes that it's something chief executives should be involved with, at least initially in terms of defining what she calls their "mantra'"- the experience that the business wants to deliver to its customers.Of course, the more branches a firm has the harder it can be to ensure customers have the same experience each time they visit.Coffee chain Starbucks has more than 19,000 stores worldwide, including 730 in the UK, and while Ian Cranna, vice president of marketing at Starbucks UK, admits that being consistent can be hard, he says customer feedback indicates it is important."One of the things they value most about Starbucks is the friendly, personal service and the consistent high quality coffee. They are just not willing to take a risk on a poor experience or product when they have just a few moments on their morning commute or school run," he tells the BBC.To ensure that customers' experiences are the same, whether they order their coffee in London or Manchester, Mr Cranna says all new Starbucks staff are trained in its cultures and values before they are let anywhere near a coffee machine. These cultures and values - which include making the coffee shops a "third place" for customers away from home and work - are the same in each of the 60 countries in which it operates."The culture and values are fundamentally important, with straightforward functional training alone it would be very hard to maintain the high quality consistent experience we strive to offer," he says.As IHG's Mr Smits says: "The devil is in the detail. You have to be very disciplined and empower your leaders to make it happen."Escape from the Boardroom is a five-part series broadcast on BBC World News on Saturdays at 02:10 and 15:10, and Sundays at 09:10 and 21:10 (all times GMT).</body>

      <body>For many would-be entrepreneurs, getting a Master of Business Administration (MBA) qualification is seen as essential.Yet with the most prestigious MBA courses in the US costing more than $100,000 (£62,000) in tuition fees alone, they don't come come cheaply.But does the celebrated qualification, and its teaching of a wide range of business skills, give its holders a big advantage when they set up their first firms?Or would people be better off if they instead simply went straight to setting up in business and learning on the job?Eoin Bara, owner of Dublin-based design agency V7, was pleased to be able to call on the assistance of someone with an MBA.Back in 2012, the company was facing a problem - it was growing too fast.With big clients including Intel and Goldman Sachs, V7 went from two to 12 employees in six months.Mr Bara says he didn't know how to manage this growth.So he decided to ask an MBA-qualified management consultant to come in and take an objective look at the company, and guide them on what they needed to do next.The MBA was able to show where the company was making losses, how they could make better use of their time, and how to plan for the future."We got more clarity on the day-to-day, which allowed us to focus on the future," says Mr Bara. "We didn't use to focus on the future at all."While author and journalist Philip Delves Broughton acknowledges the benefits of an MBA, he also thinks the cost can be a serious impediment.Mr Broughton wrote the book Ahead of the Curve, which outlines his experience on the MBA programme at Harvard Business School."One of the worst things you can do as an entrepreneur, starting young and getting going, is saddle yourself with a load of debt," he says."That's a disaster, because it really hobbles you," he adds, referring to tuition fees of more than $55,000 (£34,000) per year for his two-year programme at Harvard.The high cost of an MBA was a major reason why American tech entrepreneur Brenden Mulligan dropped out of his course at Northwestern University in Illinois.Mr Mulligan is the co-founder of Cluster, a mobile phone app which enables people to share photo albums.He calculates that he was spending $150 (£90) per hour on the MBA, and does not think it was worth it. He left roughly halfway through the course having spent around $45,000 (£28,000)."I just didn't get much of a return to investment on that money compared to other ways I've spent money supporting myself being an entrepreneur," explains Mr Mulligan, who is now based in San Francisco.He suggests budding tech entrepreneurs actually get experience in their field by joining or doing an internship at a small start-up first, rather than sign up for an MBA course.By contrast, London-based business investor Reshma Sohoni is firmly in the pro-MBA camp.Ms Sohoni, co-founder of technology start-up investment fund Seedcamp, says that if a new business is to do well, having someone on board with an MBA is crucial."Any organisation that's really gotten anywhere has MBA talent," says Ms Sohoni, who has an MBA herself.Ms Sohoni finds that from her experience, people with MBAs have a better sense of how to make a business more commercial, and have a much better understanding of running a business in general.It is something that some other entrepreneurs with MBAs agree with, including Andrew Carroll, who co-founded the e-receipts company Paperless Receipts.Having completed his MBA at the Cass Business School in London, Mr Carroll, 34, says he has a good understanding of a broad range of business concepts."I wouldn't be able to do what I'm doing now without having it, because it gives you a lot of knowledge about everything," he says."So I can now sit happily in a meeting with a hedge fund manager or with a marketing director or a finance director. I may not know everything they talk about but I'll know most of it."For entrepreneur Tobias van Amstel, 29, experience is more than important than having an MBA.The Dutchman is based in London, where he co-founded Signkick, an online booking platform for advertising on billboards."I would advise everybody just to get started and fail at your first company and learn as much as you can and then start your second company," he says."That was actually the best education I could think of to start Signkick," he says of his first business, a hotel booking website."The things I learnt there were so much more valuable than what any education could have taught me."But despite much encouragement for young people with ideas to just start their own enterprises, American entrepreneur and seed investor Alex Hoye, 44, is sceptical.He spent several years working at Disney and McKinsey before doing an MBA at Harvard in the early 1990s, and is now based in London."I think there's a huge value to not learning everything the hard way," he suggests.Mr Hoye believes prior experience is hugely important for entrepreneurs, and this can be gained either through work or through an MBA programme."I'm against the popular notion that one should just get out and do it," he says. "I disagree. I think you can learn a lot of the hard knocks by working with pros, or getting an MBA."He thinks the practice of going over case studies during an MBA is especially helpful in recognising patterns and successful business practices.But despite these useful skills, Mr Hoye does question the high cost."To be honest, there's a very good chance I would give it a miss if I were 26 now," he says.</body>

      <body>Italian football club Inter Milan has become the latest European club to be taken over by foreign investors.A trio of Indonesian businessmen led by media tycoon Erick Thohir have bought a 70% stake in the club.The club did not disclose the value of deal, but various reports estimated it to be between 250m - 300m euros ($340m; £210m - $405m; £250m).The two sides had been negotiating for some time amid efforts by the club to bring in fresh capital.Massimo Moratti, the president of the club, said the club's "history is going to be enriched by a new season thanks to our new international partners who, I am sure, will contribute to a continued string of successes"."The new partners' enthusiasm and pragmatism are certainly a guarantee for the future," he added in a statement.Mr Thohir is also a co-owner of DC United, a Major League Soccer club in the US and has also served as vice president of the Indonesian Olympic Committee.The other two partners in the deal are Rosan Roeslani and Handy Soetedjo.Mr Roeslani also owns a stake in DC United, while Mr Soetedjo was involved in the purchase of basketball team Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 2011.</body>

      <title>Evans to give up Pirates ownership</title>

      <body>Cornish Pirates owner Dicky Evans has announced plans to step aside at the end of the season, but insists he will continue to help finance the team.The 67-year-old plans to sell 150 shares in the club and has committed to providing £400,000 in funding on a two-year rolling basis.The businessman has been involved at the Pirates since 1994."We need to alter the ownership of the club in readiness for the next push as I'm not getting younger," said Evans.In a lengthy statement on the Cornish Pirates website,   Evans laid out his vision for the future of the club over the next few years and explained his decision to change the ownership model."I have to think of my family for a change, four people who have been incredibly supportive of me," he added."I intend to step aside, not down, at the end of the season as the owner of the company and hand over ownership to the many superb friends and supporters who follow the team."Consequently, over the next eight months to the end of this current financial year we need to develop a plan to enable friends and supporters of the Cornish Pirates worldwide to take ownership through a basic share issue format."They will be taking over a company clear of all loans and debt - paying a nominal £1 for the whole shareholding."The Pirates have risen up the leagues to the Championship during Evans' time at the club, but have so far found the ultimate prize of a place in the Premiership frustratingly out of reach.Evans said the need to move to a stadium in a more central location in Cornwall - ideally in Truro - was a key hurdle for the club to clear in order to progress and increase their fanbase.The pursuit of a larger stadium in Truro has been a long-running issue for the Pirates, who are currently based at Mennaye Field in Penzance in the far south-west of the county.The club have led a nomadic existence in recent seasons having played at Kenwyn near Truro and at Camborne during the last decade."This is the next major step in securing our future," added Evans."The stadium will come eventually and it's essential that the Cornish Pirates are in a position to move to the centre of Cornwall and consolidate on the business and spectator support available there, witnessed by the year we spent at Kenwyn - our most successful year at this level financially."The rugby will be of the highest calibre possible within the budget constraints that are always with us and the party atmosphere will continue both home and away."Cornish people deserve a top-class sporting team and venue - we have the ability to produce the former and as each obstacle to a stadium is surmounted there is no doubt that will come."The Pirates are a vital part of this dream - let's not let it go down the tubes."Evans also plans to offer some "iconic players" and coaches Ian Davies and Harvey Biljon long-term contracts until the end of the 2015-16 season as part of a commitment to working closely with the wider Cornish rugby community."Hopefully we can work with the senior Cornish clubs such as Redruth and Launceston to provide our qualified coaches on an almost full-time basis," he said."At the same time we can work with these clubs to lend them Pirates squad players."And there is no reason why other players with coaching qualifications cannot work with other Cornish clubs at no salary cost to that club."We have a deep squad this year and will continue to target all competitions. Once we have decided and agreed which players we think will make the grade we will commence negotiations and we will be cutting our cloth to suit."Our budget funds next season should be sufficient to enable us retain a very competitive side."</body>

      <title>Rangers forced to postpone their AGM</title>
      <description>Rangers' annual meeting is delayed after shareholders seeking changes to the club's board won a court decision.</description>

      <body>Rangers have been forced to postpone their 24 October annual meeting after shareholders seeking changes at board level won a court decision.Lord Tyre granted an interim interdict at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, preventing the AGM from going ahead.Rangers had said there was not enough time for four directors nominated by shareholders to be put up for election.But the group said Rangers had broken the law by failing to ensure the motion was on the agenda.It is the latest development in a battle for control of the Scottish League One leaders.The group wants Malcolm Murray, who was club chairman until April, Paul Murray, who was a director until last year, director of Loch Lomond Golf Club Scott Murdoch and Alex Wilson, a former HR director with BT, to be appointed to the board.Paul Murray told BBC Scotland's Sportsound programme : "Today was all about shareholder democracy. We wanted to put in front of the shareholders, the fans and the other stakeholders of the club the ability to have a democratic vote at the AGM."We submitted four nominations on 27 September. Those have been shown today to have been perfectly valid legal notices."The club's board chose to ignore those notices and issue an AGM notice that is flawed and set a date of 24 October that is now having to be rearranged.""I think both [chief executive] Craig Mather and [finance director] Brian Stockbridge have to seriously consider their positions tonight because I think they are untenable."The board chose to tie us up in all sorts of legal mechanisms that were reported today in court and we've been vindicated."Richard Keen QC, representing the shareholder group, accused the club of engaging in "guerrilla warfare" in its battle to prevent a group of shareholders from joining the Ibrox board.He told Lord Tyre the directors of the club had "committed an offence" by not informing other shareholders of the requisition."An offence has been committed by every member of this board," Keen said."The board have placed themselves in a very difficult situation by failing to discharge their statutory obligations. They have committed an offence."If I am right, the consequences of that must be visited upon them."Mather and his fellow board members have been sued by the requisitioners.The current Rangers board has so far blocked the attempts at change, claiming the application was not properly authenticated and that it did not arrive on time.Keen claimed the signatures requested by the board had been offered "timeously" before adding: "These requests have been sent by the relevant companies and, on the face of it, there is no reason to doubt their validity."However, Heriot Currie QC, representing the board of Rangers International Football Club, told Lord Tyre: "The petitioners have known since 12 September that they had to organise themselves for a shareholder meeting by no later than 30 October."The Murrays, along with shareholders Ian Cormack, John Graham and Colin Howell, made requests in writing to Rangers International Football Club plc to give notice to members of the resolutions to appoint new directors at the AGM on 27 September.They maintained they had enough support from institutional shareholders to take them over the key threshold of 5% of the total voting rights to allow such a move.Currie said there was no obligation on the part of the company to circulate the resolutions and claimed documents and related information were supplied that at the very least raised "very significant doubt" over three of the backers of the move making valid requisitions.Rangers must re-arrange their AGM to be held before the end of December and must give shareholders at least 21 days' notice.They say they will fix a new date "as soon as possible" with the requisitioners' business included, but they have defended their decision to initially oppose the notices.Following the Court of Session decision, Rangers issued a statement on their website  : "The board of directors of the company received clear and firm advice from its solicitors and senior and junior counsel that on the face of documents provided by the petitioners, the notices had not been signed in a manner that was authorised and as a result the directors were obliged to seek further clarification from those shareholders."Every effort was made to engage with the petitioners on these issues. However, the petitioners chose to resolve the matter in court. In Lord Tyre's opinion, these irregularities did not invalidate the notices."</body>

      <title>How bad are US debt levels?</title>
      <description>How does the US compare with other major economies?</description>

      <body>Taken out of context, the numbers are staggering. The US has a total debt pile of almost $17 trillion (£10.6 trillion), which is expected to rise to almost $23tn in the next five years.But how does that compare with other major economies?Japan is not far behind, with current debts totalling $11.5tn. By any standards, these are big, big numbers.And these countries are not alone - almost every major global economy has debts of more than a trillion dollars, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).But context is needed - after all, debt is not necessarily a problem if you have the income to cover it.That is why the two most common measures used to gauge a nation's indebtedness are:Some governments actually run a surplus - in other words their income exceeds their expenses. Running a surplus is one of the best ways to reduce overall levels of debt.Looking at debt-to-GDP tells us that total US debt is roughly equivalent to its annual economic output. It is by far the largest economy in the world, and has the largest debt pile.Japan is the world's third largest economy, but its huge pile of debt is more than double its GDP. The only other country whose debts outstrip economic output is Italy, although a number of others come close - namely the UK, France and Canada.Even Germany, traditionally seen as fiscally responsible, has a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 80%.Much of this debt has been accumulated over the long term, but the numbers have rocketed in recent years as governments have struggled to cope with the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent recessions that have ravaged almost all major economies. Banking bailouts, economic stimulus measures and falling tax revenues have all forced governments to borrow more.For example, in 2007, the UK's debt pile was just 44% of GDP compared with 88% last year. This reflects in part the country's large financial sector relative to its overall economy. The US's debt-to-GDP ratio in 2007 was 64%, the same as France and Germany.By contrast, the debt-to-GDP ratio in China and India, which have seen economic slowdowns but no recession, has not moved significantly over the past five years, nor is it set to deteriorate in the next five. Indeed in the case of China, it is set to fall significantly.The picture elsewhere is less encouraging. The IMF estimates that Germany aside, those countries with high levels of indebtedness will struggle to reduce debt levels in the coming years.The UK, where the government has made much of reducing debt levels, will actually see the debt ratio edge towards 100% of GDP.One reason for this is governments' inability to move from an annual deficit to a surplus. In other words, an inability to live within their means.The IMF estimates that only Australia and China of the world's 12 largest economies will move into surplus by 2018, while Germany will increase its surplus further. Russia, it thinks, will move from a surplus to a deficit.However, most major economies are expected to make good progress in reducing their deficits.</body>

      <title>Impact of a Royal Mail strike?</title>
      <description>Contingencies and opportunity during a postal strike</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24551650</url>
      <date>1381941928</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70524000/jpg/_70524338_70521370.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>A nationwide strike of Royal Mail workers is to go ahead, says the Communication Workers Union, after its members voted four-to-one in favour of industrial action.The last time national strikes by postal workers were seen in the UK was in 2009, when a series of walkouts led to widespread disruption.It was estimated that in the first wave of nationwide strikes in 2009, there was a backlog of 30-60 million pieces of post.In the second wave, the backlog was of more than 50 million.It was also reported that some businesses suffered heavy losses, orders were unfulfilled, staff were unpaid, and some were even laid off.So what will the impact be now, in 2013?The context of the postal service has changed. In the past four years competition has boomed, and while any disruption to the six-day-a-week universal service will be unwelcome to many, this time a lot of businesses have already made other plans.Federation of Small Businesses national chairman John Allan is urging his members to start preparing now to avoid a hit on their revenues."We would encourage businesses to look at contingency plans," he says."Ultimately, those firms reliant on using the postal service to deliver goods will be put at a disadvantage, with consequential negative impact on their bottom lines."A glance at the websites of online retail giants such as Asos will reveal statements reassuring customers that in the event of a strike, parcels will be directed to other service providers.Amazon, the Royal Mail's biggest single business customer, said in a statement on Wednesday: "If one of our carriers was unable to provide delivery services at any time, we would employ contingency plans which include routing orders through our other carriers."These other carriers have boomed in the past few years - from UK Mail to TNT, DX Exchange, and the likes of Hermes and Yodel.Some of Royal Mail's competitors were even established, says former postal regulator executive Stephen Gibson, of SLG Economics, because of previous industrial action."The difference really between the strikes of the recent past and now is that there is more competition now," he says."Previous strikes became a market opportunity for companies, and after winning that business, they've kept it."David Stubbs, a postal economist, agrees that a lot has changed in the world of deliveries since 2009.He says that competitors have proved themselves reliable, especially for businesses who were reliant on the Royal Mail, such as many eBay companies.However, he says, for smaller companies, strikes could cause real problems, especially given the timing."If there were to be more strikes, leading up to Christmas, there would be real issues," he says."Royal Mail processes almost double the volume in December over a normal month."For the big retailers, they will have already got other plans in place, and they will have contracts with competitor companies. However, it will be disruptive. Those competitors are already straining with deliveries."He adds that some services, such as TNT, may look to expand their network."There is a potential that alternative postal companies may expand their end-to-end delivery networks - TNT might try and deliver more to the home," he says."But there is some uncertainty around what Ofcom [which regulates the sector] would do in that situation - the regulator has threatened to impose universal service conditions on competing mail providers."Andrew Starkey, the head of e-logistics at IMRG, the body that represents the UK's online retailers says that more choice in service has also been matched by a surge in the volume of parcels delivered, so taking on more business contracts will be a problem."Royal Mail has been the default carrier of choice along with the post office network while the online shopping sector has developed, and though more competition has come into the market, there is also a lot more volume," he says.He says that by the end of 2013 there will be an estimated 1.24 billion online orders generated by UK retailers and eBay traders."There are tens of millions more orders this year than last from online retails and Royal Mail carries about 50% of them," he says. That figure rises to 90% for returns, Mr Starkey adds."If Royal Mail goes down everything creaks."Yet Mr Starkey says that the alternative network can cope with a one-day strike."If it's more frequent, or a week-long stoppage, then that's a problem," he says.However, he and postal economist David Stubbs agree that the increasing popularity of "click and collect", whereby online orders are collected by the customer at a local shop, will ease congestion for parcel deliveries.Mr Starkey adds: "This came into its own in the very bad snow of 2010. It caught on from that point, and for small retailers who don't have this in their own stores, their networks have grown."There are about 12,000 outlets now. That's about the same number as there are Post Offices anyway."</body>

      <body>A century ago, Duke Kahanamoku, a majestic Hawaiian board rider, helped to ignite modern Australia's passion for surfing.His showboating exhibition on the waves at Freshwater Beach in Sydney is widely seen as the catalyst for a national obsession.Picked from a curious crowd, a teenage girl was given what was almost certainly Australia's first official surfing lesson by the man known simply as the Duke.Today, the same swells that barrel in from the Pacific Ocean continue to thrill and they now sustain a range of small businesses that feed the popular surf tourism industry.At nearby Manly Beach, a class of beginners is about to take to the water for the very first time. It's a hot day in spring, and conditions are perfect for novices - the breeze is light, the waves gentle and the tuition patient."It's a tough sport. Surfing is very similar to golf - you never master it, there are always things you can learn," says Nick James, from Manly Surf School, which was founded in 1995 and has 20 full-time staff.It pays about 50,000 Australian dollars ($47,000; £29,600) per year to the local council for exclusive rights to operate on one of Sydney's most celebrated stretches of sand. A standard two-hour group lesson for an adult costs A$70, while children pay A$55.Mr James says that business is generally vibrant, but admits that, like the weather, things can be unpredictable."It's challenging. We've got to pay licences to run our surf schools on the beaches."It's a good business, but there are times when we're closed for a week due to the surf conditions."There are 35 licensed surf schools in New South Wales, the most populous state in Australia. The sport's regional governing body has estimated that surfing pumps more than A$500m into the state's economy."The sport is becoming increasingly more attractive," says Mark Windon, chief executive of Surfing New South Wales. "It is becoming more mainstream. It is just going to get more popular. In the next 10 years, you'll probably see triple the growth that you've seen in the last 10."At Manly, the latest converts tentatively paddle out for their initial encounter with the breakers. They have limited success - boards suddenly become airborne, dumping their breathless passengers into the drink. But back they come for more, and herein lies the secret to surfing's success.For many, its magnetic appeal is irresistible, and what's hearty for the soul is also good for the bottom line, according to Stacey Randell, executive officer of the Manly Chamber of Commerce."Our whole region is based on the water, and surfing is huge economically speaking, and the amount of visitors it brings in every year is vital to the businesses in this community. Everybody benefits from this culture," she says.Yet while wave riding in Australia has never been more popular, independent surfing shops are struggling to stay afloat in a highly competitive market."It is not particularly an easy living for most surf shop owners. You'll find most of them are pressed pretty hard by the big corporates to sell specific merchandise and conform to corporate dictates," says Doug Booth, the Australian-born dean of the School of Physical Education, Sport and Exercise Sciences at the University of Otago in New Zealand.A couple of streets back from Manly's sun-drenched waterfront, Tim Hanrahan, the owner of the Aloha surf shop, unloads another consignment of high-end boards. I ask if his head is financially above water? "Just," he says, laughing. "I make OK money.""It's difficult. It's not an easy job. The profit margins particularly on the boards are quite low. I've seen a lot of competitors come and go."There is a lot of tourism in Manly, but realistically you've got to have the locals behind you, too. That's what keeps you going through the quieter months."Surfing Australia estimates there are more than 2.5 million recreational board riders around the country. It is far beyond simply a sport, but a lifestyle and cultural phenomenon that tourists are keen to experience."I've always wanted to surf," says Ashton Williams, an investment software worker from Mississippi in the United States, as he wades out of the ocean at the end of his lesson at Manly."It's much tougher than I thought, but when you're finally gliding over the water it is one of the most peaceful things. It's pretty amazing."</body>

      <title>Are Indonesia's elderly changing course?</title>
      <description>Changing attitudes towards residential homes in Indonesia</description>

      <body>On any given Wednesday at the Yayasan Ria Pembangunan care home for the elderly, on the outskirts of Jakarta, you'll find 78-year-old Sisi Sihombing participating in a gentle exercise routine with her friends, in an attempt to keep her body fit and her mind active.Dozens of elderly residents take part in this keep-fit workout. It's an energetic way to ward off the loneliness that old age can sometimes bring.Most of them live in this charitable institution because they do not have families to look after them. Some pay a subsidised fee to live here, while others are accommodated thanks to the generosity of donations.Mrs Sihombing one of the few residents with close family living nearby - but this sprightly grandmother of seven made the unusual decision to move here voluntarily, after her husband died."I didn't want to be a burden to my children," she tells me in her small dorm, decorated with photographs of her grandchildren."They have families of their own and have to live their own lives - that's why I decided it was time to move here."But it was not an easy decision for her family to understand.Her daughter Yoko tells me that she was devastated when her mother decided to move."It was humiliating, and we didn't speak to Mama for six months," Yoko says, struggling to hold back her tears."We are from the Batak Indonesian culture, and it is our responsibility to look after our parents in their old age. Our neighbours thought it was our decision that Mama had moved out - that we had kicked her out."No-one understood that she wanted to do this out of her own free will," she adds.Though Mrs Sihombing is still in the minority - it appears to be becoming an increasingly attractive choice.Tjandra Kamandari, who runs the Yayasan Ria Pembangunan home, says she has seen the number of elderly residents who voluntarily choose to enrol - despite having families willing to look after them - rise considerably during the past few years."Increasingly these days the elderly are looking for places like this because they are looking for friends, and healthcare facilities that are available to them on site," she tells me."Also, what is life like at home in Jakarta these days? Your son will work, your daughter-in-law will work, your grandchildren go to school, and the domestic staff at home can't be bothered to look after you."It's better to be here and have some companionship and make friends."This is why Herman Kwik, the founder of Rukun Senior Living, decided to invest in this sector.The retirement complex covers 35 hectares outside Jakarta and aims to provide a luxury lifestyle complete with beautifully landscaped gardens, a swimming pool, a jogging track and even fishing facilities.It offers a number of services to residents, from regular health checks to gourmet lunches.Mr Kwik says it was visiting the US that led him to believe this concept could work in Indonesia."We've seen that Indonesia is a few years behind the US in everything - fast-food trends, fashion, cuisine," he says as we walk around the well-kept grounds."So I thought, 'why not this segment of the market?'. Senior care issues haven't been addressed very well by the government or the private sector."But accommodation at Rukun isn't cheap by Indonesian standards. A month here costs at least $1,000 (£600). And only five of the 60 rooms are occupied full time.Mr Kwik says the market is not yet mature enough to sustain his business."In these early days of trying to develop this market we have a lot of vacancies, so we are trying to utilise our space," he tells me."We have also accommodated non-senior types of functions - like banquets, parties and events. That's what we have to do in order to pay the bills while we're trying to develop our senior market."There is a term for filial piety in Indonesia - durhaka - it's almost like a guilty feeling, or that you've betrayed your parents if you don't care for them until they die," he says."We've had enquires from many elderly residents, but then they are prohibited from enrolling because of their children."Back at the Yayasan Ria Pembangunan, Yoko has finally accepted her mother's decision."It was very challenging to get over the fact that Mama decided to break ties with us and move here," Yoko says. "But I can see that she is genuinely happy now. What more can you ask for your parent?"I ask Mrs Sihombing if she ever gets lonely."Sometimes," she says, smiling. "But I keep busy and my children and grandchildren are only a phone call away. And here I'm in control of my own destiny. There's no feeling quite like it."</body>

      <title>Nepalese airline taking off</title>
      <description>How a first-time businessman set up a private airline in Nepal</description>

      <body>What makes an entrepreneur? The BBC's Surendra Phuyal hears from Birendra Bahadur Basnet, a private-airline owner in Nepal, about the risks he took starting his business, and how he believes success can be achieved.He does not come from a family of business people. His father is a retired judge, his ancestors were farmers in eastern Nepal. But Birendra Bahadur Basnet, 49, is amongst Nepal's most successful entrepreneurs. He has carved a niche in the country's not-so-impressive aviation sector in just a few years.When he registered his airline, Buddha Air, and started operations in 1996, the business graduate from a Kathmandu university had only one aircraft that was purchased with a loan: a US-made Beechcraft 1900D.Nearly two decades later, he is is the proud owner of nine aircraft - three Beechcraft 1900, three ATR 42-320 and three ATR 72-500 aircraft.Basnet's Buddha Air fleet is the largest in Nepal's domestic sector."When we obtained the loan of around NPR 70m (£442,000; $708,000) in 1996 to set up our business and purchase an aircraft, our friends and relatives and other people said we had gone mad," Basnet, says, smiling. "But we started doing good in aviation sector and we paid our loan after six years," he says, adding his airline business has grown almost ten-fold since then.When he started, he recalls Nepal's state-owned airline Royal Nepal Airlines was not particularly successful and the newly liberalised domestic aviation market was looking for stable players from the private sector."That's precisely where we saw the gap and we jumped in," he says. "The market was competitive, but safety, reliability and comfort being our mantra, we succeeded in winning the trust of our customers and we have been adding aircraft, one after another to our fleet."Basnet's road to success has not been easy though; the biggest blow came in September 2011 when one of his Beechcraft crashed on a hill near Kathmandu while returning from an aborted Mount Everest sightseeing flight, killing 19 people."We thought we were invincible, but that crash proved we were not," he said, tears welling up in his eyes. "We lost three of our great colleagues, several other people and the aircraft."That was a very sad experience that we had, but that also helped us grow."After the crash, he says, the airline did a review of its flight safety mechanisms and other related procedures to ensure that Buddha Air's safety standards remain impeccable."We thought people would choose other airlines after the crash, we were concerned," he says. "But that didn't affect our business. People - both Nepalis and foreigners - continued to love us."Every morning, Buddha Air attracts dozens of foreign tourists to Kathmandu airport for its early morning sightseeing flights to the Mount Everest region - it hosted former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan when he visited Nepal in 2001.Boasting Nepal's first private airline to have its own hangar within Kathmandu Airport premises, Buddha Air flies to major towns inside Nepal and connects the Indian city of Varanashi with Kathmandu."We are the first private airline to fly outside Nepal," says Basnet, adding that he plans to take Buddha Air to other major cities in the Asia Pacific region in future to better facilitate connectivity for passengers flying into and out of Nepal.Buddha Air currently employs more than 700 people, offering them salaries between 150 dollars and thousands of dollars per month."They are a mostly happy bunch of people," he says. "We are like a happy family, but still we need to make sure that everyone is looked after and content."His recipe for success remains this: "Don't multi-task, focus on your goal. Success is floating around, all you have to do is go and grab it. But again, you have to focus on what you want to do and what you want to achieve."</body>

      <title>Brazil not cheap for World Cup fans</title>
      <description>Brazilian price hikes may daunt England fans</description>

      <body>With England qualifying for the 2014 World Cup, many football fans in the UK will now start planning their trip to Brazil. However, as they look for flights and hotel deals, or research prices at local restaurants, they may have a rather unpleasant surprise.Not only has the cost of living skyrocketed in Brazil in recent years - placing Sao Paulo and Rio among the most expensive cities in the world - but prices are expected to rise further during the competition.The problem has been a major cause of concern for some Brazilian authorities involved in the preparations for the Cup, who fear high prices could damage the country's image.On Monday, for instance, after a media report pointed out that some domestic flights during the tournament were 10 times more expensive than flights outside the World Cup dates, the head of the country's tourism board, Embratur, proposed the adoption of price caps on plane tickets during Fifa's event.Flavio Dino, the head of Embratur, has called for foreign airline companies to be allowed to operate domestic flights in Brazil during the competition. Currently, foreign companies can own up 20% of airlines operating domestic flights.Both suggestions were ruled out by the country's Civil Aviation Minister, Wellington Moreira Franco, but he promised to ask companies to keep prices to "reasonable levels".According to the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo, those wishing to watch the tournament's opening ceremony, on 12 June, may have to pay US$1,095 (£680) for a 45-minute return flight from Sao Paulo to Rio - almost as much as a Sao Paulo-New York ticket or a London-Sao Paulo flight.In September, BBC Brasil found offers of airline tickets for the same route and dates costing a quarter of this.But it is not only plane tickets that are expected to become more expensive during the competition.Hotel stays have also seen a dramatic increase ahead of the World Cup and visitors may have to pay up to US$200 (£125) - or more - for a stay at a mid-range hotel in Rio.Two months ago, a study by Embratur pointed out that room rates on hotels accredited by Match - a Fifa appointed body for accommodation - would be up to five times higher during the tournaments.Restaurants, bars, car parks and all sorts of services in cities hosting the games are also expected to increase their prices."What will probably shock visitors from London and other European capitals is that they will pay the same for certain services as in their countries, but will receive poor value for money," says economist Samy Dana, a professor at Fundacao Getulio Vargas.Mr Dana explains that such expected high prices are partly a result of speculation and opportunism: "People see the World Cup as an opportunity to increase their profit margins for a while."On the other hand, visitors will also be experiencing the consequences of a local problem that has dramatically affected Brazilian families in the last years: the country's rising costs of living."Soaring prices were among of the major grievances of Brazilians who took to the streets in June, after a rise in bus fares sparked widespread protests across the country.According to Mercer's latest Cost of Living Survey, Sao Paulo is now the 19th most expensive city in the world, ahead of New York and just two positions below London.Inflation is currently at about 6%, but the prices of some items such as rents and private education have increased more than that.A recent study by Unctad, for instance, pointed out Brazil has some of the most expensive fixed and mobile broadband rates in the world. And some domestic appliances, electronic equipment and cars can cost double what they cost in Europe and the US.According to UBS Prices and Earnings Research, workers in Rio have to work an average of 160 hours to buy an iPhone - compared with 42.5 hours in London.So it is not a surprise that Brazilians have recently undertaken a buying spree abroad. Many middle-class couples rush to Miami or Europe to buy all sorts of house appliances as soon they get married - or baby products when the family starts to grow.Even with the recent weakening of the country's currency, the Real, spending by Brazilians travelling abroad reached US$16.8bn in the first eight months of this year - the highest value for the period ever registered by the country's Central Bank.Analysts and economists generally ascribe Brazil's high prices to an array of factors.First there is what locals call "Brazil Costs" - the elevated operational costs of doing business in Brazil due to the country's lack of infrastructure, complex bureaucracy and high taxes.The substantial increase in the value of the Real in the last decade has also made local goods and services more expensive in dollars.Additionally, even with the recent economic slowdown, the country's jobs market is still heated and unemployment rates have reached a record low - which has boosted domestic demand for all sorts of goods and services.Finally, some analysts believe prices are high because Brazilian companies have been over-shielded from international competition."The country's policies are over-protectionist and, as a result, inefficient companies are awarded large shares of the market even if they are not competitive by international standards," Mr Dana says.For the FGV economist, all these factors are key to understanding why prices in Brazil will probably shock foreign visitors."But at least tourists and foreign football fans are going to 'suffer' with such high prices just for one month. Brazilians will have to wait a long time before all these problems can be solved and we can get our prices right."</body>
