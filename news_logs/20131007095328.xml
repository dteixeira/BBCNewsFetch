      <title>Kerry defends US Libya capture</title>
      <description>US Secretary of State John Kerry defends the US seizure of a suspected al-Qaeda leader in Libya, who he said was a "legal and appropriate target".</description>

      <body>US Secretary of State John Kerry has defended the capture of an alleged al-Qaeda leader, Anas al-Liby, on Saturday as a "legal and appropriate target".He is a suspected mastermind of the 1998 US embassy attacks in Africa.His son, Abdullah al-Raghie, said his father had been seized by masked gunmen and that some of them were Libyans.Mr Kerry's comments come after Libya called on the US to explain the special forces raid on its territory, one of two by US commandos in Africa Saturday.Mr Kerry said Mr Liby would face justice in a court of law."With respect to Abu Anas al-Liby, he is a key al-Qaeda figure, and he is a legal and an appropriate target for the US military," Mr Kerry told reporters on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Indonesia.Libyan Prime minister Ali Zeidan's office said he had asked for clarification on the raid and stressed Libya was "keen on prosecuting any Libyan citizen inside Libya".Citing surveillance camera footage, Mr Liby's son, Abdullah al-Raghie, said his father was seized in Tripoli early on Saturday by masked gunmen armed with pistols, as he was parking outside his house.He said that those he could see taking his father looked Libyan and spoke a Libyan dialect.He claims the Libyan government was implicated in his father's disappearance - a claim Tripoli denies.On Saturday, US commandos also carried out a raid in southern Somalia, but failed to capture their target.The US Navy Seals' seaborne raid was believed to have focused on a leader of the al-Shabab militant group.Al-Shabab has said it carried out last month's attack on the Westgate shopping centre in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, leaving at least 67 people dead.Anas al-Liby, 49, is believed to have been one of the masterminds behind the 1998 US embassy attacks, which killed more than 220 people in Kenya and Tanzania.He has been indicted in a New York court in connection with the attacks.Liby - whose real name is Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai - has been on the FBI's most wanted list for more than a decade with a $5m (£3.1m) bounty on his head.His brother, Nabih, on Sunday told reporters his brother was innocent, describing the US operation as an "act of piracy".Mr Kerry said the operations in Libya and Somalia showed that the US would never stop "in its effort to hold those accountable who conduct acts of terror".</body>

      <body>Powerful Typhoon Fitow has rammed into eastern China after triggering the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people.With winds up to 151km/h (93mph), the storm landed in Fujian province early on Monday, bringing heavy rains and causing widespread power cuts.The authorities earlier issued the highest alert - red - for the area.At least two people have been killed by the typhoon, state-run news agency Xinhua reported.One victim was on his way to rescue a fisherman when he was blown off a hill by strong winds late on Sunday, Xinhua said.Some homes are said to have collapsed in neighbouring Zhejiang province and two port workers are missing.Typhoon Fitow - named after a flower - made landfall at 01:15 local time on Monday (17:15 GMT Sunday) in the city of Fuding, Chinese meteorologists said.The typhoon had affected over three million people in Zhejiang and caused economic damage of over 2bn yuan ($330m; £200m), Xinhua said, citing the provincial flood control office.Parts of China have been hit by up to 200mm (8 inches) of rain, AFP news agency reported.Over the weekend the authorities drafted in the army to help strengthen flood defences, the BBC's John Sudworth in Shanghai reports.China is used to dealing with extreme weather events but, nonetheless, the risk to life remains high, our correspondent adds.In Fujian, 177,000 people were evacuated before the storm hit the coast, Xinhua said, while in Zhejiang, some 574,000 people had to leave their homes.Some 35,000 boats in Zhejiang and 30,000 in Fujian were ordered to return to harbour for shelter.Coastal facilities such as seaside bathing centres were also closed, state media reported."We must not leave anybody in danger," Zhejiang Governor Li Qiang was quoted as saying.The typhoon also caused suspension of bullet trains and coach services in several cities in the area.Dozens of flights to and from Wenzhou airport in Zhejiang were cancelled.The storm is now moving north-west and is expected to weaken quickly.Typhoon Fitow is the 23rd typhoon to hit China this year, Xinhua reported.It comes just weeks after Typhoon Usagi killed at least 25 people in southern Guangdong province.</body>

      <body>Two people, one a police officer, have been killed by a bomb apparently targeting anti-polio campaigners in Pakistan, say police.The blast struck a van near a hospital in Budh Bher suburb of the north-western city of Peshawar.A death toll of six was earlier given but corrected by police.Pakistan is one of only three countries where polio remains endemic, due in part due to militant resistance to polio mass vaccination campaigns.Militants have attacked and killed health workers and banned immunisation teams from some areas, forcing hundreds of thousands of children to miss vaccinations.The two killed in Monday's attack comprised one police officer and a member of a local peace committee, riding in a van as part of an anti-polio campaign, said police officials.Several other people are reported to have been injured. Reports said many were police, but an injured young girl was also pictured in images from the scene.The team inside the van was supposed to be accompanying the health workers administering polio vaccines in order to protect them, reports said.One of them, Rasheed Khan, told Reuters news agency: "I was with the polio team."As soon as we reached the front of the hospital... there was a blast right in front of the gate.We were around 12 or 13 people."Police had earlier reported a higher toll but corrected this upon confirmation from medical sources.The explosive device was reported to have been detonated remotely.The Pakistani news website Dawn quoted police as saying another, bigger, bomb had been found in the vicinity of the first one and the Bomb Disposal Squad called in to defuse it.A fake hepatitis vaccination campaign, run covertly by the CIA, helped to locate al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in 2011. He was then killed in an operation by US Navy Seals.A rising tide of violence has hindered new Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's overtures to end the militant insurgency through peace talks with the Taliban.Peshawar has been particularly hard hit. In just over two weeks, it has suffered four attacks which between them left more than 150 people dead.</body>

      <title>Fresh clashes in Egypt 'kill 50'</title>
      <description>At least 50 people are killed and more than 240 hurt in Egypt in clashes between police and supporters of ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.</description>

      <body>At least 50 people have been killed and scores hurt in Egypt in clashes between police and supporters of the deposed Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.More than 200 members of the Muslim Brotherhood were arrested in Cairo, where most of the deaths were reported.Supporters of Mr Morsi marched in several cities, as the military-backed government marked the 40th anniversary of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.Morsi supporters say he was deposed in a military coup in July.Hundreds of people had gathered in Cairo's Tahrir Square to celebrate the anniversary.Jets and Apache helicopters flew overhead in formation, as part of a grand display of military hardware by the government.The crowd cheered the flypasts, a number of people carrying portraits of defence chief Gen Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Some want him to stand as Egypt's next president.But the BBC's Quentin Sommerville in Cairo says supporters of Mr Morsi also took to the streets in their thousands, trying to make their way to the square and calling Gen Sisi a murderer.Security forces used tear gas and fired into the air to stop them.In the upmarket Dokki district, a number of protesters were hit by live rounds, some by birdshot. In return they threw rocks at police and soldiers, our correspondent says.The street battles raged for hours, with small fires burning and black smoke rising in several parts of the capital.But the military succeeded in keeping the rival supporters apart, our correspondent says.The interior ministry earlier warned it would confront any "attempts that may disturb the 6 October celebrations", the Mena state news agency reported.In a televised address, Prime Minister Hazem Beblawi described it as a "critical time" for the country and urged Egyptians to "stand together, be optimistic about the future".The health ministry said that in addition to the Cairo deaths, one person was killed in Delga, about 300km (190 miles) south of Cairo, and another in Bani Suef, 80km south of the capital.There were also clashes in the Suez Canal city of Ismailiya.Hundreds of Islamist protesters have died in violence since the Egyptian military deposed Mr Morsi in July, 13 months after he was elected as president.He and other senior Brotherhood figures have been imprisoned and face trial.The authorities are moving to seize the movement's assets after its activities were banned as part of a crackdown.However, Brotherhood supporters have continued to take to the streets to protest - albeit in smaller numbers than before.Send your pictures and videos to yourpics@bbc.co.uk or text them to 61124 (UK) or +44 7624 800 100 (International).

      <title>US credits Syria over chemical arms</title>
      <description>Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government deserves credit for so far complying with a chemical weapons deal, the US secretary of state says.</description>

      <date>1381121197</date>
      <body>Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government deserves credit for so far complying with a chemical weapons deal, the US secretary of state has said.John Kerry was speaking after international monitors began the destruction of Syria's stockpile.The mission was established under a UN resolution, which was passed after a deal between Russia and the US.The initiative followed international outrage at a chemical weapons attack near Damascus in August."The process has begun in record time and we are appreciative for the Russian co-operation and obviously for the Syrian compliance," Mr Kerry said after talks with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Bali, Indonesia."I think it's extremely significant that yesterday, Sunday, within a week of the (UN) resolution being passed, some chemical weapons were being destroyed."I think it's a credit to the Assad regime, frankly. It's a good beginning and we welcome a good beginning."The destruction of Syria's chemical arsenal is being overseen by a team from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).An official on the joint OPCW-UN delegation said on Sunday: "The first day of destruction and disabling is over and missile warheads, aerial bombs, along with mobile and static mixing and filling units, were dealt with. Work continues tomorrow and in the next few days."The actual destruction of the stockpile, being carried out by the Syrians, is not expected to be straightforward, as some sites are in combat zones.It is the first time the OPCW - based in The Hague - has been asked to oversee the destruction of a chemical weapons armoury during a conflict.The Syrian government gave details of its chemical weapons arsenal last month to the OPCW under the Russia-US agreement which also provided for Damascus to join the Chemical Weapons Convention.That arsenal is thought to include more than 1,000 tonnes of sarin and the blister agent sulphur mustard among other banned chemicals.In an interim report earlier this year, UN chemical weapons inspectors confirmed that the nerve agent sarin had been used in the attack in Ghouta on the outskirts of Damascus on 21 August.It was estimated to have killed hundreds of people and was blamed by the United States and other Western powers on the regime of Bashar al-Assad. But he accuses Syrian rebels of being behind it.Under the terms of the US-Russia deal, Syria's chemical weapons capability should be removed by the middle of 2014.The speed with which the team has been able to reach the sites and start the process of destruction underlines the urgency of the mission, says the BBC's Anna Holligan in the Hague.It was hoped that the new climate of co-operation would help bring about a wider conference in Geneva on ending the Syrian conflict.UN-Arab League peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi was quoted on French media on Sunday as saying he was encouraging all parties to come to Geneva in the second half of November but that peace talks were not a certainty.More than 100,000 people have died since the uprising began in 2011 and millions more have fled Syria.</body>

      <title>Airbus in $9.5bn Japan Airlines deal</title>
      <description>Aircraft manufacturing giant Airbus announces a $9.5bn (£5.9bn) deal with Japan Airlines, its first with the carrier, to sell 31 of its A350 planes.</description>

      <date>1381128896</date>
      <body>Aircraft manufacturing giant Airbus has announced its first deal with Japanese carrier Japan Airlines (JAL).It has won an order from JAL for 31 of its A350 planes, in a deal worth nearly $9.5bn (£5.9bn) at list prices.The A350 is designed to be more fuel-efficient and is a direct competitor to US rival Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, which has been hit by safety and technical issues in recent months.The deal is a blow for Boeing, which has dominated Japan's aviation market."This is Airbus' largest order for the A350 so far this year and is the largest ever order we have received from a Japanese airline," said Fabrice Bregier, chief executive of Airbus."I must say that achieving this breakthrough order and entering a traditional competitor market was one of my personal goals."According to the deal, JAL also has an option to purchase an additional 25 planes.In recent years, the aviation industry has been hurt by a slowdown in demand and high volatility in global fuel prices.That has seen many leading carriers turn to more fuel-efficient aircraft in an attempt to cut down costs and maintain profitability.Both Airbus and Boeing have seen a surge in demand for such planes.Airbus, which says the A350 will use about 25% less fuel than previous generation wide-bodied aircraft, has had 725 orders for the plane prior to securing the JAL deal.The company hopes to start delivering the first A350s to customers by the end of 2014.Yoshiharu Ueki, president of Japan Airlines, said the new planes would offer "high level of operational efficiency and product competitiveness" and help the airline to cater to "new business opportunities after slots at airports in Tokyo are increased".Meanwhile, Boeing's 787 Dreamliner continues to remain popular despite this year's temporary worldwide grounding of the aircraft while safety regulators investigated the cause of fires. The firm has received orders for more than 950 Dreamliner jets so far.Japanese carriers, JAL and All Nippon Airways (ANA), are two of the biggest operators of the Dreamliner jets.</body>

      <title>Malala: We must talk to the Taliban</title>

      <body>A Pakistani teenager shot in the head by the Taliban for championing girls' rights to education has said talks with the militants are needed for peace.Malala Yousafzai was attacked by a gunman on a school bus near her former home in Pakistan in October 2012.The targeting of a schoolgirl who had spoken out for girls' rights to education caused outrage in Pakistan and around the world.The 16-year-old was treated in the UK and now lives in Birmingham.She spent months in hospital and required several operations to repair her skull.In her first in-depth interview since the attack, Malala told the BBC that discussions with the Taliban were needed to achieve peace."The best way to solve problems and to fight against war is through dialogue," she said."That's not an issue for me, that's the job of the government... and that's also the job of America."In July, plans for talks involving the Taliban, the US and the Afghan government were frustrated by a row over the status of the Taliban's newly opened office in Doha, Qatar.Malala said it was important that the Taliban discussed their demands."They must do what they want through dialogue," she said."Killing people, torturing people and flogging people… it's totally against Islam. They are misusing the name of Islam."Malala also described the day of the attack for the first time. She said the street her school bus was travelling on was unusually deserted before the vehicle was flagged down and the gunman opened fire."I could see that there was no-one [there] at that time."Usually there used to be so many people and boys and they used to be standing in front of shops. But today... it was vacant."The teenager, who gave a speech to the UN in July, also spoke of her desire to return to Pakistan and enter politics."I will be a politician in my future. I want to change the future of my country and I want to make education compulsory," she said."I hope that a day will come [when] the people of Pakistan will be free, they will have their rights, there will be peace and every girl and every boy will be going to school."Panorama: Shot For Going To School, BBC One, Monday, 7 October at 20:30 BST and then available in the UK on the BBC iPlayer.</body>

      <body>Hundreds of Brazilian security officers, backed by armoured vehicles and helicopters, have occupied 12 shanty towns in Rio de Janeiro.The major operation is part of an ongoing drive by authorities to push drug gangs away from poor areas.Two new police pacification units (UPP) will be set up in Lins de Vasconcellos, home to about 15,000 people.Since 2008, another 34 UPP have been set up across the state but there have also been reports of police brutality.Rio will host the 2016 Olympics and matches of next year's football World Cup.Hundreds of police officers backed by at least two armoured vehicles and three helicopters moved into the slums at dawn on Sunday.The gangs in the area offered no resistance, authorities said."This is another step towards peace," Rio state governor Sergio Cabral Filho told reporters.He said the government would now invest $225m (£140m) in public works to improve the living conditions in the area.At least one man was arrested, and guns and drugs were confiscated, police said.Governor Cabral Filho said the pacification programme would soon be extended to the Mare area - a series of interlinked shanty towns that are home to more than 130,000 people.The occupation of the Mare slums is seen as one of the most challenging by Rio authorities.Earlier this year, police occupied the shanty towns of Complexo do Caju and Barreira do Vasco without trouble.But 10 police officers of a UPP in one of Rio's largest slums, Rocinha, were accused of torturing and killing a resident.Bricklayer Amarildo de Souza disappeared in July and was never seen again. The officers reject the accusations.</body>

      <body>Russian President Vladimir Putin has taken part in a ceremony in Moscow to launch the torch relay for next year's Winter Olympics in Sochi.The torch will go on a 123-day journey covering some 65,000km (40,000 miles) before the Games start in the Black Sea resort on 7 February.The torch's journey will include a trip into space.But the relay got off to a rocky start when the flame briefly went out during the loop through the Kremlin.A security guard had to re-light it with a cigarette lighter.Mr Putin said the Games would show Russia's "respect for equality and diversity".The run-up to the Games has so far been marred by controversy over a new Russian law that restricts the spread of information about homosexuality, as well as allegations by rights groups that authorities have rounded up migrant workers who helped build the Games venues in Sochi.The Olympic flame had been flown in from Greece after being lit last Sunday at the birthplace of the ancient Games.Hoisting the flame in Moscow, Mr Putin declared in a ceremony shown live on television that "our shared dream is becoming reality".He said the Games would show "respect for equality and diversity - ideals that are so intertwined with the ideals of the Olympic movement itself".Mr Putin said the relay would show off Russia "the way that it is and the way we love it"."Today is a joyous and momentous day," he said. "The Olympic flame - the symbol of the planet's main sports event, the symbol of peace and friendship - has arrived in Russia, and in a few minutes it will be on its way around our huge country."On its journey the flame will:</body>

      <body>Rwanda has strongly rejected allegations that it is helping train child soldiers for rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo.Speaking to the BBC, Foreign Minister Louise Mushikiwabo described such claims as "ludicrous".The US has recently withdrawn military aid to Rwanda, saying it is backing the M23 rebels, believed to recruit minors.The M23 rebellion has forced tens of thousands from their homes in the eastern DR Congo."The idea that Rwanda is associated with child soldiers is just ludicrous," Ms Mushikiwabo told the BBC's Newsday programme."We have worked with a number of UN agencies... to basically make sure that children don't belong in the army".The US has had close military ties with Rwanda since President Paul Kagame's Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) came to power after the end of the 1994 genocide.Rwanda has been accused of backing the M23, which is led by ethnic Tutsis.Rwanda has twice invaded DR Congo, which says it wants to stop ethnic Hutu rebel groups based there from attacking its territory.President Kagame, a Tutsi, led the RPF when it ended the genocide in which some 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus died.</body>

      <description>Divers in Italy recover the bodies of dozens more African migrants who drowned after their boat sank off the island of Lampedusa.</description>

      <date>1381101608</date>
      <body>Divers in Italy have been recovering more bodies from the boat of African migrants that sank on Thursday.Eighty-three bodies were brought out on Sunday, bringing the official death toll to 194. About 200 people are still missing and 155 have survived the accident off Lampedusa island.The authorities have denied allegations that they were slow to mount a rescue.France has called for an urgent EU meeting after Italy requested help to deal with the influx of migrants.Tens of thousands of migrants attempt the perilous crossing from North Africa to Sicily and other Italian islands each year, and accidents are common - but this week's shipwreck was among the deadliest on record.Divers resumed their search on Sunday morning after a 48-hour delay due to bad weather.Many bodies are believed to be trapped in the wreck located in deep water, about 1km (half a mile) off Lampedusa.The survivors are to be placed under investigation for "clandestine immigration", as provided for by a controversial immigration law pushed through by right-wing parties in 2002.The offence carries a 5,000-euro (£4,230; $6,780) fine.Italy has said it will amend its immigration laws. Members of parliament have complained that some of its provisions discourage people from helping migrants in distress.The fisherman who arrived first at the site of the accident, Vito Fiorino, has accused the coastguard of wasting time by filming footage of rescue efforts."They refused to take on board some people we'd already saved because they said protocol forbade it," he was quoted as saying by Ansa news agency.A report in local newspaper La Sicilia said two boats belonging to Italy's Financial Guard, which carries out a range of police and rescue duties, had remained in port.The coastguard denied that there was any delay in its rescue effort."After we received the alarm by radio at 07:00, we immediately intervened with our boats, arriving at the site of the shipwreck at 07:20," it said in a statement.Judicial authorities said they had no evidence of delays. And two of the migrants have told the BBC that boats did rescue them, but it took a while."After swimming for a long time, probably around three hours, boats started to arrive to rescue us. Rescue boats, small boats, all the boats in the area came to save us, they dragged us out of the water," Futsum Mesfa, 20, from Eritrea said."I lost my cousin, who was on the boat with me, I also lost many friends," he added.The head of a fishermen's association, Toto Martello, denied in turn reports that three fishermen had sailed straight past the scene of the accident.The 20m (66ft) boat carrying more than 500 people - mostly from Eritrea and Somalia - was approaching Lampedusa early on Thursday when it began taking on water after its motor stopped working.Mr Mesfa told the BBC that the skipper set fire to a piece of material to try to attract the attention of passing ships, only to have the fire spread to the rest of the vessel.The boat - which set sail from the Libyan port of Misrata - is thought to have capsized when everyone moved to one side.</body>

      <title>Couple saved from borsch-eating bear</title>

      <body>Police in the Siberian region of Irkutsk have rescued a couple after a bear broke into their holiday home, attracted by the smell of fresh soup.A patrol turned up at their dacha near Ust-Ilimsk in the early hours after a neighbour raised the alarm.They found the couple hiding in their bath-house as the bear digested the hot beetroot soup in their garden.A warning shot was sufficient to scare off the intruder. No-one was hurt, although there was damage to the house.According to a police statement, the couple said they had left the soup to cool when they went to bed.Because of decorating work inside the dacha, they were sleeping out in the bath-house, when they woke to "loud banging".Peering out, they saw a bear breaking the windows of their glassed-in porch. It then hauled itself inside and devoured "all of the borsch, which was still hot".After receiving the alert at 01:00 (16:00 GMT Friday), police sent a patrol to the scene. Officers found the bear padding around the snowy garden and fired a shot into the air."Startled, the unwelcome guest bounded off into the forest," the police statement said.Bears, it noted, had been known to come looking for food around dachas in the area before but happily no attacks had been reported.While splashes of the bright red soup were found at the scene, it could not be immediately confirmed whether the bear had indeed not used a spoon.</body>

      <body>US Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker has warned that business is starting to suffer from the federal shutdown.Her comments at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) came as leaders gathering for the summit voiced worries about the US situation.Philippine President Benigno Aquino said that what happens in the US "affects us all".On Friday, the US defence contractor Lockheed Martin said it would put 3,000 workers on unpaid leave.The US government closed non-essential operations on Tuesday after Congress failed to agree a new budget.And President Barack Obama cancelled a scheduled trip to Asia because of the shutdown."The shutdown is not good for business. It's not good for the economy," Ms Pritzker said. One consequence of the shutdown had been her department's inability to collate vital economic data."We're a huge source of data for American business and that is a problem... It's affecting businesses and it's affecting their ability to get data," she said.From Monday, Lockheed will put 3,000 staff on leave, but the defence giant said this number would rise if the shutdown continued."I'm disappointed that we must take these actions and we continue to encourage our lawmakers to come together to pass a funding bill that will end this shutdown,'' Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed's chief executive and president, said in a statement."We hope that Congress and the Administration are able to resolve this situation as soon as possible," she added.The announcement followed United Technologies' decision to temporarily lay off 2,000 employees.The company, which makes Blackhawk helicopters, said some manufacturing had been halted because there were no government inspectors working to sign off products.Global impactThe widening impact of the shutdown sparked concern at Apec meeting in Bali on Sunday.Mr Aquino said: "The US economy is the number one economy in the world, what happens there affects all of us."The world economy obviously is not in a position to withstand too much shock at this time when we are just recovering as a global economy."Meanwhile, Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said the US had to confront its fiscal problems "in a better way than they are doing it now with shutting down the government".Mr Obama is refusing to negotiate with the Republicans over the budget issues until they pass a temporary bill to reopen the government.He also wants agreement to raise the $16.7 trillion US borrowing limit, to avoid the country defaulting on its debts.</body>

      <body>Four-time IndyCar champion Dario Franchitti has fractured his spine in a crash at the Houston Grand Prix.The 40-year-old Scot suffered multiple fractures including a broken ankle after crashing into the track wall.His car flipped into the air following a final lap collision with Takuma Sato and at least 13 spectators were injured as debris flew over safety fencing.Franchitti's team owner Chip Ganassi said: "His ankle and back are a little sore. He is going to be okay."Three-time Indianapolis 500 winner Franchitti hit the back of Sato's car and was propelled into the air and against the fence. His car exploded into several pieces but did not catch fire.Sato said: "On the last lap I caught the marbles (chunks of rubber that come off the tyres and lie on the track) and brushed the wall and lost momentum."A couple of cars passed me as I was offline and in turn five. I got very loose and Dario and I came together."Race promoters said 11 spectators were treated at the track while two more were transferred to hospital for evaluation.The Grand Prix was won by Will Power, while Franchitti's team-mate Scott Dixon, from New Zealand, leads the overall standings.</body>

      <body>At least eight people have been killed and dozens injured at a show in Mexico after a modified pick-up known as a monster truck crashed into spectators.At least one child was said to be among the dead in the northern city of Chihuahua on Saturday evening.The truck hit a stand that had no protective barrier.A mechanical failure may have been the main cause of the accident, officials say. However, the driver later tested positive for alcohol consumption.The monster truck with 1.5m-high (5ft) wheels was performing a demolition stunt during an annual air show in Chihuahua, which involved crushing two cars beneath its huge tyres.Eyewitness video showed the truck completing one pass, driving over the cars, then turning for a second attempt.It accelerated much more quickly this time and landed heavily over the second car before veering off to the right and into the stand.A spokesman for the Chihuahua state prosecutors' office, Carlos Gonzalez, put the number of injured at about 80.He said prosecutors were looking at the possibility that mechanical failure meant the driver was unable to disengage the accelerator.But some witnesses said the driver may have lost control after hitting his head on the interior of the truck.Daniel Dominguez told Associated Press he was watching the show with a group of relatives."The driver hit his head and his helmet flew off," Mr Dominguez said. "The truck came directly at where we were.''Another spectator, Jesus Manuel Ibarra, told the agency: "I fell over, and when I turned around I saw the tyre very close. It hit me and threw me to the other side."A call has gone out from local health services for blood donations.The BBC's Will Grant in Mexico says some people are now calling for an investigation into safety measures at events like this and are asking how the audience could be placed so close to trucks performing stunts with only limited barriers in place.</body>

      <body>Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has been ordered to take a month off work after bleeding was found on her brain.Ms Fernandez, 60, was undergoing medical checks for another condition when the bleeding - a subdural hematoma - was discovered.Vice-President Amado Boudou is flying back from France to take over her duties.Ms Fernandez has been campaigning ahead of congressional elections.The break from campaigning is considered awkward for the president as some opinion polls have suggested the government could lose control of Congress in the poll on 27 October.Her spokesman, Alfredo Scoccimarro, issued a statement saying her doctors had carried out a brain scan in August after a previously undisclosed trauma - thought to be caused by a fall.However, they found nothing untoward.On Saturday, she went to hospital for checks for an irregular heartbeat and also complained of headaches.A further scan revealed the subdural hematoma - bleeding between the brain and the skull.The condition is said to be "chronic" but not "acute" according to the presidential statement, and Ms Fernandez will not be staying in hospital.Her doctors are to monitor the bleeding using imaging technology.President Fernandez, a centre-left Peronist, was first elected in 2007 and then returned to power by a comfortable majority in 2011.There have been hints that she may seek a third term, though she has never confirmed this.This would also require a change to the constitution - only possible if her party keeps control of Congress.</body>

      <body>A South African union representing car workers has agreed a new pay deal, ending a month-long strike that has crippled the industry.The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa accepted a 10% pay rise this year and 8% in the next two years.The strike in the car components industry caused severe disruption, especially to exports.Last week BMW said it had stopped "all future plans" to expand in South Africa because of the industrial action.Under the deal, pay at small-to-medium-sized car parts firms will only rise wages by 9% in the first year, followed by 8% in the subsequent two years."The strike was very hard for us," Irvin Jim, the general secretary of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), told reporters.The car components' strike followed industrial action by workers at car manufacturers themselves, which hit production at BMW, Ford, Nissan and General Motors and cost an estimated $2bn (£1.24bn) in lost output.This year, the mining, construction and aviation sectors have also been hit by strikes, raising concerns about the impact on South Africa's economic growth.Last week, Bodo Donauer, managing director at BMW South Africa, said the company had been unable to produce 11,000 cars while its workers were striking."But more important than these 11,000 cars is the sustainable damage which this [the strike] has made," Mr Donauer said.On Sunday, Mr Jim said BMW's decision to stop future investment was "blackmail" which would be "rejected with the contempt it deserves".</body>

      <body>Gambian officials have confirmed that the country will not be competing in the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.Last week, the west African nation branded the 54-member grouping, which includes the UK and most of its former colonies, a "neo-colonial institution".At the time it was unclear whether it would still be competing in the Games.However, Games organisers have confirmed The Gambia's withdrawal and said alternative plans would be made for the baton relay.A spokesman for Glasgow 2014 said: "All Commonwealth nations and territories are entitled to compete in the Commonwealth Games."Glasgow 2014 has received confirmation from the Commonwealth Games Federation of the formal withdrawal of The Gambia from the Commonwealth."It is our understanding, therefore, that The Gambia does not intend to enter a team and compete in next year's Games."The spokesman said the Queen's Baton Relay, which visits all nations and territories of the Commonwealth, would no longer go to The Gambia."This planning is now under development in collaboration with the Commonwealth Games Federation and we will provide further information in the near future," he said.</body>

      <body>Power cuts have crippled life in parts of the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh after protests against the formation of the new state of Telangana.Thousands of power workers are on strike to protest against the decision.Telangana would comprise 10 districts of the southern state, including the city of Hyderabad.In recent years, there have been protests for and against the creation of India's 29th state.Backers of the new state say the area has been neglected by the government.Opponents are unhappy that Hyderabad, home to many major information technology and pharmaceutical companies, would become a shared state capital.Fresh protests began after India's cabinet approved the setting up of the new state at a meeting on Thursday evening.Soon after the announcement, those against the decision staged rallies, held protests and called a 48-hour strike in parts of the state that shut down schools, colleges, public transport and businesses.Four federal ministers belonging to the state also offered to resign in protest.Things worsened on Sunday when several thousand power workers in 13 districts, where a large number of people have protested against the decision, went on strike.Officials said two major thermal power stations in the region were affected by the strike.Power cuts closed cash machines, petrol pumps, cable TV services and led to the cancellation of several trains."Our intention is not to interrupt power supply, but we want to save our Andhra Pradesh. And this is the only way we have," a striking power worker opposed to the division of the state told the NDTV news channel.Violent protests have been reported from the town of Vizianagaram, where a curfew was imposed on Sunday.Telangana, with a population of 35 million, comprises 10 of Andhra Pradesh's 23 districts.The state capital and India's sixth biggest city, Hyderabad, will be included in the new state, although for the first 10 years it will serve as the joint capital of the two states.The final decision on a new state lies with the Indian parliament. The state assembly must also pass a resolution approving the creation of the new state.Correspondents say the timing of the announcement is linked to general elections due early next year. Recent opinion polls have shown that the Congress party is struggling in the state, which has 42 parliamentary seats.The move to create Telangana has sparked similar demands in the states of West Bengal and Assam.</body>

German officials say they are checking the reports.Yemen is struggling to control general lawlessness, an al-Qaeda insurgency, and divisions within the army.Initial reports suggested that the attack was a failed kidnapping attempt of Germany's ambassador."The ambassador escaped but her bodyguard was killed as he tried to resist the attackers who managed to flee," AFP news agency quoted an unnamed diplomatic source as saying.However, the agency later quoted a Yemeni foreign ministry spokesman as saying that Ms Mueller-Holtkemper was "currently outside the country".The German foreign ministry told the BBC it could not confirm any of the reports.Germany - along with several other Western countries - briefly closed its Yemen embassy in August, after the US warned of a potential major militant attack in the Middle East.</body>

      <title>Tory MP pushes for early EU vote</title>
      <description>A prominent Conservative backbench MP says he will try to force the government to hold an early referendum on whether the UK should leave the EU.</description>

      <date>1381073991</date>
      <body>Prominent Conservative backbencher Adam Afriyie has said he will try to force the government to hold an early vote on whether the UK should leave the EU.The prime minister has promised to hold an in/out referendum in 2017 if he wins the next general election, but Mr Afriyie said voters were "not convinced" that it would happen.He said he would push for a vote in October 2014 instead.But Home Secretary Theresa May warned that Mr Afriyie had "got it wrong".And a Downing Street spokesman said of Mr Afriyie's plan: "The PM will not let it stand."Mr Afriyie - who has denied newspaper claims he is being groomed to replace party leader David Cameron - said he would table an amendment to the European Union (Referendum) Bill on Monday.Mr Cameron has pledged to renegotiate the UK's relationship with the EU before an in/out referendum in 2017.But, speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics programme, Mr Afriyie said there would be "ample time" to conduct this renegotiation by as early as next year."By having a referendum in 2014, it gives us 12 months to renegotiate," he said. "But more than that, it kick-starts negotiations."EU member states would need to "accommodate" British demands for reforms "if they wish us to remain", he added.He argued: "I think it strengthens the prime minister's hand."The MP said 80% of people wanted a referendum, and more than 50% of people wanted a referendum this side of the election."British businesses need certainty," he said, adding he had struggled with his conscience over the matter."I don't want to cause any trouble over it, but I think it's absolutely essential that Parliament and MPs have the opportunity to search their souls and to give people a referendum this side of the election."In an article for the Mail on Sunday, he predicted that, without a referendum before 2015, "large numbers of people will continue to vote UKIP whatever happens, and if they do, there is a distinct danger that Labour will gain a majority and we will never see a referendum at all".UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he would be "absolutely delighted" if the nation could have a referendum before 2015, adding it would benefit British business.He told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme: "Adam Afriyie has put his finger on the real problem - and that's that four years ago, Mr Cameron gave us a cast-iron guarantee that there would be a referendum."This time last year, he was saying there would not be a referendum, and he is now saying there should be a referendum. People are not quite sure what to believe."But Mrs May told the BBC: "We need to be negotiating that settlement with the European Union and then put to the British people the Europe of the future - not the Europe of the past - and give them that opportunity to say in or out."What is crucial is that we have, at the next election, a Conservative party that will be offering people that renegotiation of a new settlement with Europe, looking to the future and then putting that to the British people in an in/out referendum."Backbench Conservative MP James Wharton is attempting to enshrine his party leadership's referendum pledge in law - without the support of coalition partners the Liberal Democrats - with his European Union (Referendum) Bill.As a private member's bill, it is vulnerable to being delayed by procedural tactics from MPs who oppose it, and will only become law if the government allocates enough parliamentary time for its proponents to overcome any such hurdles.Mrs May warned Mr Afriyie's amendment to the bill could "jeopardise" its prospects entirely.And Mr Wharton told BBC Radio 5 live the amendment could "kill" it."My concern is that any amendment, no matter how well-meaning it might be, is going to make the progress of the bill more difficult and it'll make it easier for those MPs who want to use procedural techniques to slow it down and stop it... that bit more possible."I don't want to see that. I'd like to see my bill go through and I think this harms the chances of that happening."Liberal Democrat deputy leader Simon Hughes, whose party opposes a referendum on the EU unless further powers are handed from Westminster to Brussels, said a 2014 referendum would be a "barmy" distraction from attempts to boost UK economic growth.Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said the Conservative leadership had scheduled a referendum in 2017 due to "internal party management as much as anything else".The PM's promise of a "grand, unilateral renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU" was "deeply flawed and bound to unravel", he added, in pre-released extracts of a speech to be delivered in London on Tuesday.Labour Party vice-chair, Michael Dugher MP, said "the Tories are back to obsessing about the European Union"."We need a prime minister and a government that will make dealing with the cost of living the number one priority. Instead David Cameron is too weak and out of touch to stop this latest outbreak of Tory infighting."The European Union (Referendum) Bill is due to return to the House of Commons for further debate on 8 November.</body>

      <body>Iran's foreign minister is urging world powers to come up with new proposals for talks on its nuclear programme, which are set to resume next week.Mohammed Javad Zarif said the terms offered before Hassan Rouhani was elected president were now "history" and that a "new approach" was needed.The existing proposals seek curbs on uranium enrichment in Iran.Mr Rouhani has vowed to bring a plan to substantive nuclear negotiations due to take place on 15 October.Just over a week ago, he spoke to President Barack Obama by phone in an effort to ease tension over Iran's nuclear ambitions - the first conversation between Iranian and US leaders in more than 30 years.Iran wants talks to result in a lifting of UN sanctions imposed over concerns that it aims to build nuclear weapons clandestinely - an allegation Tehran denies.In another development, a senior Iranian official said the authorities are holding four people believed to be involved in sabotage against Iranian nuclear facilities."The previous plan given to Iran belongs to history and they must enter talks with a new point of view," said Mr Zarif, who is both foreign minister and chief nuclear negotiator."The players must put away this illusion that they can impose anything on the Iranian people," he told Iranian state TV late on Saturday.The election of Mr Rouhani in June and appointment of Mr Zarif have raised hopes that Iran's standoff with the West over its nuclear programme can be resolved.Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei endorsed Mr Rouhani's overtures to the US on Saturday."We support the diplomatic initiative of the government and attach importance to its activities in this trip," he said on his website.Ayatollah Khamenei said that "some of what happened on the New York trip was not appropriate", without being specific."We are pessimistic towards the Americans and do not put any trust in them," he said."The American government is untrustworthy, supercilious and unreasonable, and breaks its promises."Key Iranian nuclear sites</body>

      <title>'Flying' care visits 'disgraceful'</title>
      <description>Short care visits mean disabled people must choose between staying thirsty or using the toilet, a charity warns, amid claims the practice is rising in England.</description>

      <date>1381128188</date>
      <body>Short care visits to elderly and disabled people are "disgraceful" and on the rise, a charity has claimed.In England, 60% of councils use 15-minute visits, which are not long enough to provide adequate care Leonard Cheshire Disability says.The charity says such visits can "force disabled people to choose whether to go thirsty or to go to the toilet".But care managers insisted some short visits could be "fully justified and fully adequate".Leonard Cheshire is pushing for a ban on what it calls the "scandal of flying 15-minute visits", lobbying the government to outlaw the practice in England.A report published by the charity said short visits "simply do not allow enough time to deliver good-quality care".It said data from 63 local authorities pointed to a 15% rise in such visits in the last five years, and said some in councils more than 75% of care visits were carried out in less than 15 minutes.Chief executive Clare Pelham said visits should be at least 30 minutes long."It is disgraceful to force disabled people to choose whether to go thirsty or to go to the toilet by providing care visits as short as 15 minutes long," she said.Ms Pelham said most people need 40 minutes to get up, washed, dressed and have breakfast."We are treating disabled and older people as if they are robots to be serviced, rather than real people who deserve to be treated with kindness and consideration," she added.But the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass), which represents care managers, argued it was "totally wrong" to suggest all caring tasks require more than 15 minutes.Sandie Keene, the association's president, said some short visits were "fully justified and fully adequate".It was "frankly naive to believe that simply by abolishing 15-minute slots a magic wand will have been waved, and improvements automatically achieved in our care services," she added."It doesn't work like that."Ms Keene said social workers and their managers had to make "horrendously difficult choices" every day to give the best possible care with limited resources.Leonard Cheshire wants peers to back a ban on short visits by amending the government's Care Bill when it is debated in the House of Lords on Wednesday.The Local Government Association (LGA), pointed to a "substantially underfunded" social care service which was putting councillors under increasing pressure."Significant cuts to council funding mean local authorities are struggling to meet the rising demand for home care visits," said Katie Hall, chairwoman of the LGA's community and wellbeing board.She said 15-minute visits "should never be the sole basis for care", but added: "In some circumstances such as administering medication they can be appropriate, but only as part of a wider comprehensive care plan involving longer one-to-one visits."Leonard Cheshire Disability said a survey of 2,025 people found 93% of those who expressed an opinion agreed 15 minutes was "not long enough to support a disabled or older person to do everyday things like wash, dress and get out of bed in the morning".</body>

      <title>Mentally ill crime victims 'ignored'</title>
      <description>Crime victims with mental illnesses are more likely to feel let down, dismissed or treated without respect by the police, new research suggests.</description>

      <date>1381104401</date>
      <body>Crime victims with mental illnesses are more likely to feel let down, dismissed or treated without respect by the police, new research suggests.Many of the 361 people questioned said they were often disbelieved when they sought help after a crime.This was despite the fact that those with severe mental illness were three times more likely to be crime victims.The findings come from a three-year study involving academics and the charities Victim Support and Mind.The report, co-authored by Kings College London, Kingston University and St George’s University of London - in collaboration with University College London - is the first British survey into crime victims which compared those with mental illness against the general population.The study said that almost half of people with some form of mental illness had experienced a crime in the last year.It said people with severe mental illness were five times more likely to experience assault, while severely mentally ill women were 10 times more likely to be assaulted.Six out of 10 women in this group reported being victims of sexual violence as adults, the study said.But interviewees said that when they sought help, they often found they were treated unfairly by the police and other agencies. Victims said they found it difficult to convince police to take their reports seriously.In the worst examples, victims said police left them with the impression that they themselves were to blame. Others refused to report crimes out of fear of being detained under mental health legislation.Victims whose cases went to court reported a range of problems which had an impact on their mental health. One interviewee reported meeting the offender while at court, an incident which triggered an episode of self-harming.The authors called for police and other agencies to be better trained to help mentally-ill victims of crime and said responses to incidents should be properly monitored and assessed.Javed Khan, chief executive of Victim Support, said: “It is nothing short of a national scandal that some of the most vulnerable people in our society become victims of crime so often and yet when they seek help they are met with disbelief or even blame.“It is unacceptable that the criminal justice system fails to meet the needs of people with mental health problems when this report shows all too clearly the terrible impact of crime on them.”And Paul Farmer, Mind’s chief executive, said: “Being a victim of crime is a horrible experience for anyone to cope with but when you have a mental health problem the impact on your life can be even worse.“People with mental health problems have an equal right to justice, yet this report reveals that this is not the reality for far too many of us.”Commander Christine Jones of the Association of Chief Police Officers said it had supported the research because senior officers recognised that the experiences of people with mental illnesses were not widely understood.“Anyone reporting a crime against them expects to be listened to, taken seriously and treated with respect,” she said.“Policing and mental health is high on the agenda for chief constables. We support the recommendations in this report, which will further that work.”The research team interviewed a random sample of 361 people in London who have severe mental illness and the results were compared with official data in the Crime Survey for England and Wales. Further in-depth interviews were conducted with 81 people with mental health problems who had been victims of crime during the last three years.</body>

      <body>Social networking company Twitter has said it plans to raise $1bn (£619m) in its stock market debut in documents filed with US regulators.In the filing, revealed on Thursday, the seven-year-old company said that it now has 218 million monthly users and that 500 million tweets are sent a day.It made a loss of $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m.It will be the largest Silicon Valley stock offering since Facebook's listing in 2012.Analysts said that the offering was likely to get a good response."Social media is red hot," said Internet analyst Lou Kerner. "Twitter is front and centre benefiting from market enthusiasm for all things social, and remarkably strong metrics."The filing also revealed Twitter's finances for the first time.While the company has never made a profit, its revenue has grown from just $28m in 2010 to $317m by the end of 2012.Around 85% of Twitter's revenue last year came from ad sales; the rest was from licensing its data.The company takes in a significant portion of its ad revenue from mobile devices, an important metric often tracked by analysts.As of 2013, over 65% of the company's advertising revenue was generated from mobile devices. More than 75% of Twitter users accessed the site from their mobile phone during that same time period.Some analysts said that the decision by the firm to raise capital indicated that it was keen on improving the way people enjoy content on its platform and how advertisers connect with its users."Users should be happy about this," said Zachary Reiss-Davis, an analyst with Forrester."It looks like Twitter is looking at how to enrich the experience and it understands that to build a successful service, they have to create something people like and want to come back to and spend time on."Peter Esho from Sydney-based Invast Financial Services, added that Twitter's ease to use had seen it increase its user base, making it an attractive option for advertisers."I think what Twitter has working in its favour is that it's very easy to use: it doesn't eat up too much bandwidth for the average user in places where broadband penetration is low," he said.The filing also revealed that two of the company's co-founders, Evan Williams and Jack Dorsey, own significant stakes in Twitter, and could stand to take in significant sums from the company's stock market listing.Mr Williams owns 12% of shares in the company, while Mr Dorsey owns 4.9%.Benchmark Capital's Peter Fenton, an early investor in the company, is the second-biggest shareholder, with 6.7% of shares.Twitter indicated three weeks earlier that it had filed for a public stock market offering.However, under a new law passed by Congress in 2012, it did not have to reveal its financial documents because it had revenue of less than $1bn.But by releasing the documents publicly, it gave an indication that it hopes to complete its stock sale soon.The company plans to list under the stock symbol TWTR, but it did not reveal which stock exchange, the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange, it had chosen.However, Mr Esho said that the listing was likely to be on the Nasdaq."I was to speculate, I think it would have to be Nasdaq," he said. "That really is the exchange that has seen so many tech names come to the market."Goldman Sachs is the lead bank taking the company public, a coveted position that is often fought for amongst the nation's biggest banks.The other banks helping with the offering are Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, BofA Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank Securities and CODE Advisors.</body>

      <title>Silk Road accused appears in court</title>
      <description>The alleged mastermind behind the online illegal drugs marketplace Silk Road is too dangerous to be bailed, prosecutors say.</description>

      <body>The alleged mastermind behind the online illegal drugs marketplace Silk Road is too dangerous to be bailed, US prosecutors have said.Ross Ulbricht, 29, was arrested this week and is charged with being the administrator of the site which has now been shut down.He is also accused of trying to arrange the killing of one of the site's users."We deny all charges and that is the end of the discussion at this point," Mr Ulbricht's lawyer said.Mr Ulbricht appeared in a San Francisco court on Friday wearing a green T-shirt under red jail clothes and had his ankles shackled.A request from his legal team for his bail hearing to be pushed back was granted - it will now take place on 9 October.Federal magistrate Joseph Spero asked Mr Ulbricht's lawyer Brandon LeBlanc whether seeing the criminal indictment that included a murder-for-hire charge had "changed his calculus" on whether he thought Mr Ulbricht would be granted bail.As part of its criminal complaint, the FBI alleged that Mr Ulbricht had sought to pay a Silk Road user to kill another user who had threatened to expose details of the site's users.Prosecutors opposed the delay, arguing that Mr Ulbricht represented a danger to the community, and that there was a high likelihood that he may attempt to flee.The Silk Road was a well-known destination on Tor, a so-called "dark web" service that anonymises users, making it much more difficult for authorities to track locations.The site sold a range of items, but was most famous for offering a host of illegal drugs, paid for using virtual currency Bitcoin.</body>

      <body>Switzerland's financial regulator is investigating possible manipulation of foreign exchange rates at several Swiss financial institutions.The regulator, FINMA, said several banks, including some from outside Switzerland, could be implicated.It is coordinating the investigation closely with authorities in other countries.It would give no further details on the investigations or the banks potentially involved.Swiss Banking, the group that represents the nation's banks, said it had no further information.The Swiss announcement follows reports in June that the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), was looking into whether traders manipulated benchmark foreign-exchange rates to increase profits.This followed an investigation by Bloomberg News that found that dealers shared information and used client orders to move the rates.The FCA, which does not announce its investigations, only its enforcement actions, said: "We are aware of the allegations and we have been speaking to relevant parties."London is by far the world's biggest market for foreign currency trading, with 41% of global turnover, according to the Bank for International Settlements.New York has a 19% share, followed by Singapore, Tokyo and Hong Kong.Switzerland accounts for 3.2% of foreign exchange trading.</body>

      <title>Morrison showing touches of 'genius'</title>
      <description>West Ham boss Sam Allardyce says he is starting to see the best of Ravel Morrison, describing his goal against Tottenham as "a bit of genius".</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24422999</url>
      <date>1381088613</date>
      <body>West Ham manager Sam Allardyce said Ravel Morrison has "sorted himself out", describing his goal in a 3-0 win at Tottenham as "a bit of genius".Morrison, 20, joined West Ham last year after off-field problems hindered his progress at Manchester United.Allardyce said: "Sir Alex Ferguson told me 'I hope you sort him out because you will have a top-class player'."I'm not sure I've sorted him out, he's sorted himself out. He's begun to enjoy his football which he loves so much."The manager added: "He enjoys being with the lads and listens to what the experienced players say, and can do something that nobody else can do in our side and you saw that today."Attacking midfielder Morrison was called into the England Under-21 squad for the first time earlier this week and he crowned his international selection with a fine solo goal, running from his own half to take on the Spurs defence and chip goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.It was his fourth goal in eight appearances this term, which Allardyce also thought was "goal of the season" so far, and it lifted his side out of the bottom three.The victory came after Allardyce decided not to name any recognised strikers in his side, with Morrison the furthest forward.Morrison joined Manchester United as a schoolboy but only made three first-team appearances before moving to the Hammers in January 2012, spending last season on loan at Birmingham.In 2011, he was fined £600 by a court for throwing his girlfriend's mobile phone through a window during an argument and in 2008 was cautioned for common assault.Ferguson said at the time of his move to the capital: "In the case of Ravel it's been quite well documented. I think he's better out of Manchester."He's got a great talent but it's how to deal with it that is important."West Ham skipper Kevin Nolan revealed that even after Morrison arrived at West Ham, there were still problems with his conduct away from the pitch.And after praising Allardyce's tactics, Nolan told BBC Sport that the loan spell at Birmingham had made Morrison mature.Nolan, 31, said: "Ravel has been fantastic since he came back [to West Ham]. Last year we had a lot of problems with his lifestyle off the pitch as well as on it, but he went to Birmingham [on loan] and worked really hard, and got back in the team at the end of last season and it was like he was a new man. He is one now. He needs to stand up."Me and Mark Noble speak to him and have had big long chats with him all last season, we try to protect him and take him under our wing and we will continue to do that. Obviously we are going to be excited by his talent, it's frightening and I think if you ask anyone at Manchester United they will tell you the same."But it's about nurturing him and making sure he does the right things on and off the field - you are now starting to see the player that Manchester United saw in him when he was younger."Allardyce added: "He's learnt so much in a short period of time. That's the beauty. The penny has dropped."</body>

      <body>The United States secured a fifth successive Presidents Cup win with an 18½-15½ victory over the Internationals at Muirfield Village.The hosts led 11½-6½ before Sunday's four foursome matches, held over because of storms, and 12 singles.The Internationals won six of the first nine singles matches completed in Ohio but Tiger Woods's one-up victory over Richard Sterne sealed the result.The US have now won eight of the 10 stagings of the event, with one draw.In addition, it was the third victory in a row for US captain Fred Couples.The US needed only four points from Sunday's singles to retain the Cup, having established a lead of 14-8 after the delayed final foursomes session.Australian Jason Day won the first point of the singles, crushing Brandt Snedeker 6and4, shortly before Hunter Mahan beat Japan's Hideki Matsuyama 3and2.US PGA champion Jason Dufner beat Zimbabwean Brendon de Jonge 4and3, while Canada's Graham DeLaet holed out from a greenside bunker for birdie at the 18th to edge Jordan Spieth one up.Zach Johnson wrapped up a comfortable 4and2 win over South African Branden Grace to put the US 17-10 ahead, before Masters champion Adam Scott scored another win for the Internationals with a 2and1 win over Bill Haas.South African Ernie Els scraped past Steve Stricker one up, Australian Marc Leishman sank a 14-footer from the fringe to par the last and beat Matt Kuchar by the same margin before former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel of South Africa beat Keegan Bradley 2and1.But world number one Woods, who won three matches out of four in partnership with Kuchar earlier in the week, shrugged off back pain to cinch overall victory with two matches to finish.Webb Simpson and South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen then tied their match before Argentina's Angel Cabrera beat Phil Mickelson one-up.Hunter Mahan bt Hideki Matsuyama 3and2Brandt Snedeker lost to Jason Day 6and4Jordan Spieth lost to Graham DeLaet one downSteve Stricker lost to Ernie Els one downJason Dufner beat Brendon de Jonge 4and3Bill Haas lost to Adam Scott 2and1Zach Johnson beat Branden Grace 4and2Matt Kuchar lost to Marc Leishman one downTiger Woods beat Richard Sterne one upKeegan Bradley lost to Charl Schwartzel 2and1Webb Simpson halved with Louis OosthuizenPhil Mickelson lost to Angel Cabrera one down</body>

      <title>FA do not have a clue - Redknapp</title>

      <date>1381133465</date>
      <body>Harry Redknapp says that Football Association senior officials do not have the knowledge required to choose the best England manager.The QPR boss was overlooked for the role when Roy Hodgson succeeded former coach Fabio Capello in May 2012."I wouldn't trust the FA to show me a good manager if their lives depended on it," he wrote in his autobiography, serialised in the Daily Mail. Redknapp, 66, says he holds no grudge against Hodgson after the decision.But he insists he was the leading choice with England fans and players, claiming senior players texted him to offer him their support."This isn't about them giving the England job to me or Roy Hodgson, but English football being run by people who really haven't got a clue - and they get to pick the England manager," he said."Everyone said I was the people's choice, the only choice. All the senior players seemed to be up for me to get the job."I got quite a few text messages at the time from players saying they would love me to manage England: Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand, John Terry."But the FA went for Roy Hodgson to be the England manager - a man who is more their cup of tea."Redknapp, who was manager of Tottenham when the decision was made, said he wanted Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers - then with Swansea City - to be his assistant."My thinking on Brendan was this: if he can do it with players from the lower leagues at Swansea what can he do with Rio and Terry or Rooney and Gerrard?" he added."So when Tottenham played Swansea on 1 April, 2012 I pulled Brendan after the game and said that if all the speculation about me and England was true would he consider coming to the European Championships in the summer as my part-time coach?"I told him I wanted England to play with as much technical ambition as Swansea. He was up for it."Some Tottenham fans might think I was distracted from my club job, but I can assure you the conversation took five minutes. And we beat Swansea 3-1 that day."Redknapp's side won just twice in 10 matches following Capello's resignation as Spurs failed to qualify for the Champions League.He was sacked in June 2012 before taking over at QPR the following November.</body>

      <body>Tickets for next year's Glastonbury Festival have sold out in record time, according to organisers.Michael and Emily Eavis issued a joint statement confirming all 120,000 remaining tickets had been sold in just one hour and 27 minutes.They said they were "blown away" by the numbers logging on and were "genuinely sorry" that so many had missed out.Ticketing website See Tickets had earlier apologised to customers on Twitter for "technical difficulties".The site, which had been managing the sale of tickets for Glastonbury, wrote that the issues had led to "a very difficult half an hour" before the site stabilised, later adding that it was selling 3,000 tickets a minute.Prices for the 2014 event had been increased by £10 to £210, plus a booking fee, but festival-goers could pay a deposit of £50 before settling their bill in April.For the first time, coach packages were available three days earlier, with all 15,000 tickets selling out in half an hour.A statement by the father and daughter Eavis team, Michael and Emily, was posted on the festival's own Twitter feed, saying: "We genuinely try to make the ticket system as fair as it can be, but when demand outstrips supply, it is an unfortunate inevitability that some people will be left disappointed."They went on to thank people for their "incredible support", adding: "We really don't take it for granted and we are exceedingly fortunate to have that loyalty."No acts have yet been confirmed to play at the festival at Worthy Farm between 26 and 29 June next year, but there is already speculation about who will headline.David Bowie is one of the bookies' favourites, with other rumours including Foo Fighters and Fleetwood Mac.This year saw Arctic Monkeys, Rolling Stones and Mumford and Sons top the bill on the festival's famous Pyramid Stage.</body>

      <date>1381082411</date>
      <body>US band Haim have denied Justin Timberlake his fourth UK number one album, after topping the chart with their debut, Days Are Gone.Timberlake's album, The 20/20 Experience 2 of 2, had led midweek sales by just 28 copies but was overtaken by Californian sisters, Haim.In the singles chart, OneRepublic's Counting Stars claimed victory from The Vamps' Can We Dance.The Official Charts Company said it was "the closest race of the year".Ryan Tedder's band OneRepublic secured its first UK number one after rising two places, with just 1,150 copies standing between the two tracks.The debut record from Haim, made up of sisters Este, Danielle and Alana, had been eagerly anticipated since the band won the BBC's Sound Of 2013 poll in January.Days Are Gone features their three hit singles Don't Save Me, Falling and The Wire, which the band dedicated to Prime Minister David Cameron when they both appeared on the Andrew Marr programme on BBC One last week.It finished the week 2,100 copies ahead of the second instalment of Timberlake's 20/20 Experience album series.The original album, which is still at number 33 in the chart, spent three weeks at Number 1 in March and was the star's third consecutive UK number one album.Last week's number one album - Mechanical Bull by Kings Of Leon - slipped down to three, with Arctic Monkeys' AM static at four and Drake's Nothing Was The Same down to five.Dizzee Rascal's The Fifth enterted the album chart at number ten, while his new single Something Really Bad took the same position in the single's chart.Jason Derulo's single Talk Dirty FT 2 Chainz dropped to number three with Katy Perry's Roar in fourth and Chase and Status in fifth with Count On Me FT Moko.This week's chart also saw Avicii's Wake Me Up become one of the UK's biggest-selling singles of all time, after it broke through the million copies sales barrier on Sunday.The Official Charts Company said the track is only the 140th single to achieve this milestone, and the third of 2013 behind Daft Punk's Get Lucky FT Pharrell Williams and Nile Rodgers, and Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines FT TI and Pharrell Williams.Wake Me Up, by 24-year-old Swedish DJ and Producer Avicii, spent three consecutive weeks at number one after debuting in that position in July, and denied One Direction their fourth UK chart topper with Best Song Ever.</body>

      <body>Photojournalist Bill Eppridge - who took images of the aftermath of Robert Kennedy's assassination - has died aged 75.Eppridge died in hospital in Connecticut from a blood infection caused by a fall.His image of Kennedy lying on the floor of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles is widely considered one of the greatest news photos of all time.He worked for Life Magazine at the time of the shooting in 1968.Friend and fellow photographer David Hume Kennerly said: "He extended a helping hand and a bushel of inspiration to me, and his kindness shaped the course of my career.Born in Buenos Aires, Eppridge moved to the US with his family as a young boy.Working as a staff photographer for Life Magazine from 1964, he covered a wide variety of stories from revolutions in Latin America to the Beatles' arrival in the US.Eppridge followed Kennedy from a campaign event at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles into the back kitchen where a 24-year-old Palestinian Christian, Sirhan Sirhan, shot and killed the 42-year-old presidential hopeful.Eppridge took several black and white images that night, but the most enduring and haunting depicted Kennedy lying on the floor, with a halo of light in the background, with a hotel worker at his side."You are not just a photojournalist, you're a historian," he once explained when asked how he could keep snapping pictures while someone was lying injured in front of him.Commenting on his unforgettable image of Kennedy, he said: "I never hung it on my wall."His 1965 photo essay about a drug-addicted New York couple inspired the Al Pacino film The Panic in Needle Park.After leaving Life in 1972, Eppridge worked for other magazines including Time and Sports Illustrated.Before his death, he and his wife, Adrienne Aurichio, had been putting the finishing touches to a book on the Beatles, to mark next year's 50th anniversary of their arrival to the US.</body>

      <title>An unusual thank you for WWII Spitfires</title>
      <description>The WWII gift that's now brought the Samaritans to Africa</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24399641</url>
      <date>1380906962</date>
      <body>To say thank you to the African countries that donated Spitfires during World War II, a former development worker from the UK is setting up branches of the Samaritans across the continent."Suicide is still a taboo here because it's seen as something like a curse," says Merab Mulindi, one of the founding members of Samaritans Kenya.Launched in 2003, it offers support to distressed citizens over the phone and in person from its office in Nairobi."People do not like to talk about it and the families face a lot of stigma, which only deepens the problem," she says.The project was initiated by John Hurst, who spent more than two decades working in Africa for the British government and another 10 years volunteering for the Samaritans in the UK. He aims to found similar organisations in all the African nations that donated money to the RAF during WWII.He highlights what he believes is a common pattern, in which poorer families struggle to send their eldest child to university."The hope of the family is that the child will take them out of poverty through their education," he says. "But the stresses of university, or worries over money, can trigger a suicide which decimates the whole family."The problem is compounded by the perception of the wider community and is often reflected in the way the bodies are treated after death, particularly in East Africa. Traditional burial services for victims of suicide are rare, says Hurst."There are no reading of the Bible. In some instances the families have even been locked in their houses while the body is taken into the bush and abandoned."It is difficult to know how many people commit suicide in the country each year, says Mulindi, who's convinced that many cases go unreported. "The statistics are minimal because people do not talk about it."Hurst thinks many of the lessons learned by the Samaritans - and similar organisations in the West - can be transferred to Africa. Problems securing employment and marital difficulties seem to be common factors across the globe."We know that the majority of people who commit suicide in the UK do so at night. That's the time of greatest stress and they usually want to speak to someone just before they do it."By providing a helpline, he is confident the service can save lives. So far about 70 people have been trained as volunteers and 20 are on duty on a regular basis. The group has no shortage of committed volunteers, but funding its phone bills has proved more difficult."We do not have a toll-free line so people have to have enough credit to be able to call us. Sometimes they expect us to call them back, which is not always possible," says Mulindi.The biggest problem has been getting people to engage with the issue. It took three years to gain approval as an official NGO. "Having the government finally register the charity was probably the greatest challenge," says Hurst.Hence his innovative way to explain his motivation. "When you say suicide, people switch off. The moment you say the word Spitfire, or talk about Spitfires, it engages people," he says. By talking about the Samaritans project as a way to say thank you to the countries involved, he has been able to gain more attention for its efforts."Kenya donated six Spitfires at a cost of £5,000 each," he explains, adding that his next focus is Lesotho, which helped purchase more than 20 of the iconic fighter planes for the war effort.In Kenya, awareness does seem to be building slowly, particularly after the finance minister's son took his own life last year. The issue received more media coverage on Kenya's annual suicide prevention day, held each September."In that sense there's some opening up of the possibility of people talking about it," says Mulindi.Video produced by Thomas Amter and John Galliver.

      <title>Row over Spain's proposed solar tax</title>
      <description>Row in Spain over proposed toll on solar panel owners</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24272061</url>
      <date>1381100409</date>
      <body>"We will be the only country in the world charging for the use of the sun," says Jaume Serrasolses."Strange things are happening in Spain. This is one of them."Mr Serrasolses, the secretary of an association promoting the use of solar energy, SEBA, is referring to the government's proposal for a tax solely on those who generate their own electricity.They would pay a backup toll for the power from their solar panels, in addition to the access toll paid by everyone who consumes electricity from the conventional grid.Although the tolls vary, if you pay an access toll of 0.053 euros per kWh, you could face a backup toll of 0.068 euros per kWh.The new tax would extend the average time it would take for solar panels to pay for themselves from eight to 25 years, according to the solar lobby.The government says that with increasing "self-consumption", the income for conventional energy systems will decrease, but grid maintenance will cost the same."If I produce my own energy, but am connected to the grid, having the backup in case my production fails, I have to contribute to the cost of the entire system," says Energy Secretary Alberto Nadal.The government is hoping the energy reform will settle a debt of 26bn euros (£22bn; $35bn), which has built up over years as a result of regulating energy costs and prices.This is just the latest in a series of setbacks for the renewable energy sector.The government has gradually lowered a feed-in tariff - a scheme that paid people to produce their own "green electricity" - first reducing the period over which it was paid, then limiting it to already existing installations and finally an energy reform in July opened up the possibility of withdrawing it retroactively.At the same time it has not endorsed net metering, a policy allowing solar panel owners to send surplus energy to the grid and use it later. The idea was part of a previous proposal but was not included in the latest reform proposal.But while the government may have been heavily promoting solar energy six years ago, those who followed that lead may now pay dearly for their investment."The majority are people like your or my parents who at one time had savings and wanted to make an investment with a better return," says Piet Holtrop, a Dutch lawyer who is defending over 1,000 of them."Many of these people are going to lose their houses (that they used as collateral to buy solar panels). They are unable to pay back at the bank. They can't sell the installations, because the government has made them toxic assets," Mr Holtrop says.Though many people believe the government has succumbed to pressure from the big five energy companies, Mr Nadal insists that "solar energy is much more expensive than that mass-produced by large utilities".He adds that Spain is now paying for being at the forefront of solar energy development: "If we hadn't rushed into constructing large quantities of photovoltaic installations, we could have had them much better for [a] much lower price. It would have been much better introducing them step by step."The backup toll, still to be approved, has already paralysed the photovoltaic sector. "Nobody is going to make significant investment if it takes over 20 years to pay it off," says Jaume Serrasolses.However, the proposal has also prompted defiance.Ricard Jornet has fitted his beachside restaurant with 36 solar panels. Alongside other efficiency measures, they have cut his electricity bill by 40%.To avoid the backup toll, he plans to split the restaurant so that it uses two independent electricity systems, with only 30% connected to the grid. The rest will be self-sufficient, thanks to insulation and batteries storing the produced energy."I will save more money, because for the little part of the restaurant I will pay smaller access toll. I will also prove to the government this is not the way to do things."Civil disobedience is another option, despite hefty fines of up to 30m euros.Oriol, a chicken farmer, is willing to take the risk of undeclared self-consumption. "I believe they will warn me first. Then... we will have to invent another way to save the situation."The fines were originally designed for electricity companies and have to be approved by a cabinet council."The more people disobey, the more difficult it will be to fine them," says Jaume Serrasolses.Spain's energy regulator has sided with the opponents of the toll. It has found the proposal discriminatory, concluding that it makes self-consumption economically unviable and sacrifices middle and long-term economic efficiency for short-term economic sustainability. However, the regulator's word is non-binding.There are hopes that the European Commission will help, as its objective is to achieve 20% of energy production from renewable sources by 2020. The body is currently probing one of several complaints against Spain's energy policies.However, the Commission might have a dilemma."They are anxious to not jeopardise the plans for Spain's economic recovery," says Piet Holtrop."We are afraid the Commission is willing to sacrifice the EU legal framework for policy objectives."Other countries are carefully watching developments in Spain. The governments in Latvia, the Czech Republic, Italy and Greece seem to be pondering similar cutbacks."We want to make the Commission aware of the spillover effect," says Mr Holtrop.The backup toll may not end up being introduced, but the proposal has put many people off installing solar panels in the meantime, which means they are still getting their energy from the five big suppliers."I think they (the government) know this proposal does not make sense. They just want to gain time," says Ricard Jornet."[And] during all these months the energy oligopoly is making thousands of millions of euros."</body>

      <title>US commando raids: What did they achieve?</title>
      <description>Frank Gardner on what the US commando raids achieved</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24423943</url>
      <date>1381088558</date>
      <body>The twin US commando raids to seize senior al-Qaeda operatives in two different African countries on 5 October show Washington's preference for highly targeted special operations where it believes its mission has a high probability of success.While the Obama administration has sought to avoid or extract itself from big, costly theatres of conflict like Iraq, Afghanistan or Syria, it has invested heavily in the joint counter-terrorism and special operations sphere, to go after what the US calls "high-value targets".But how effective in the long run are raids like the ones in Libya and Somalia over the weekend?In Libya, US Army Delta Force commandos achieved exactly what they set out to do.Deploying from a forward base in a Nato country, they apprehended a fugitive on the UN al-Qaeda watch-list with a $5m (£3.1m) bounty on his head.Washington suspects Abu Anas al-Liby of helping to mastermind al-Qaeda's simultaneous bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.Commenting on his capture, the US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said on Sunday: "These operations in Libya and Somalia send a strong message to the world that the United States will spare no effort to hold terrorists accountable, no matter where they hide or how long they evade justice."The Libyan government has publicly called on for an explanation from the US, while at the same time saying it hopes this will not upset their relations.Abu Anas al-Liby was no friend of Libya's government but to its citizens this US raid could be taken as a humiliating infringement of national sovereignty.The US insists that the detention of this long-sought suspect is "lawful" and the bringing to justice of such an allegedly dangerous man will be popular back home.But in North Africa this raid could well prompt more recruits to join anti-Western jihadist groups like al-Qaeda and its affiliates.In Somalia the raid by US Navy commandos from Seal Team Six failed and they returned empty-handed.This was a failure of intelligence on two counts. The al-Shabab leader, possibly Ahmed Godane himself, was not at home, and the beachside villa they hoped to find him in turned out to be well defended.When commandos swim ashore under cover of darkness they are inevitably limited in how much firepower they can carry and the option to withdraw was the pragmatic one.Yet when the most highly trained commandos from the most powerful military in the world attack a sandal-wearing militia and are forced to retreat, this will be seized on as a propaganda victory for al-Shabab.After the debacle of Blackhawk Down in Mogadishu in 1993, the Pentagon steered clear of Somalia for years.But more recently it has conducted a number of often unpublished raids into that country, with the blessing of the UN-backed government there.Sometimes they involve unmanned aerial drones, sometimes they involve US Navy Seals. A US Special Forces raid in 2009 on Barawe - the same town as this weekend's raid - located and killed its intended target, the al-Qaeda leader in Somalia, Ali Saleh Al-Nabhan.The US will undoubtedly be planning more such special operations raids, its plans given urgency by the scale and body count of al-Shabab's murderous attack in September on a Nairobi shopping mall.The message Washington clearly wants to convey to its enemies is: "We will find you and get you, however long it takes."But to many in the countries visited by such raids, there will be accusations of a global superpower throwing its military weight around and acting outside the law to serve its own interests.</body>

      <title>Tamil chief minister aims for peace</title>
      <description>New chief minister shares vision for Sri Lankan north</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24179990</url>
      <date>1381129933</date>
      <body>Former Supreme Court judge CV Wigneswaran has been sworn in as the new chief minister for Sri Lanka's north, after his Tamil National Alliance won a historic victory in elections last month. The BBC's Charles Haviland spoke to Justice Wigneswaran before the election to find out what coaxed him out of retirement and into politics.Asked what keeps him looking young for his age, the 74-year-old Canagasabapathy Viswalingam Wigneswaran says: "The secret of youthfulness may be that I was not involved in politics so far."Now the former Supreme Court judge - who retired in 2004 - is heavily involved, but insists he was "pulled into politics" by his community rather than entering it.We meet at a house set up for the party's activities in Jaffna where young activists dart around with cups of tea, and various journalists wait to see him and his 79-year-old party leader in the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), R Sampanthan.Born in Colombo and educated at its Royal College, Justice Wigneswaran trained partially in Britain and, once back in his native country, moved upwards through its courts system.Working as a judicial officer, he "never thought in terms of being Tamil or Sinhala, Burgher, English - there was no difference".But he had to confront the ethnic issue in 1983 when he was a magistrate in Jaffna and conducted inquests into many Tamils killed in a national wave of anti-Tamil violence.As a judge he presided in later cases involving suspected Tamil Tigers.He sees the country's ethnic problem in this way: "Unfortunately there's a Sinhalese attitude to Tamils whichever government comes in."Sinhalese people have this as their only country. They feel insecure that there might be some joining together of Tamil Nadu [in India] and north-eastern Sri Lanka."That insecurity, he says, has sometimes resulted in anti-Tamil brutality but his aim is to change minds on both sides."Make Sinhalese leaders understand our predicament and make Tamils feel sympathy to northern feelings," he says. "It might be possible to bring about peace in our country. I hope God will make it possible."Intense controversy was caused by his recent remarks in praise of the dead Tamil Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran.During the election campaign in Prabhakaran's home village, he called him "a great hero who fought for the freedom of the Tamil people".Justice Wigneswaran says he meant it."This is the perception with regard to Prabhakaran as far as the Tamil people here are concerned. He may have been brutal but so is the government, those who are now in for a war crime inquiry internationally."If the Sinhalese saw their war-time leaders as heroes, Tamils might conversely do the same.Both sides had used questionable weapons and methods of assault, which might be revealed in future inquiries, Justice Wigneswaran says. Meanwhile, he himself favours non-violence, he adds.The TNA's plans for self-determination in the north do not amount to a separatist agenda, the former judge insists.Instead, the party is trying to put pre-existing laws into effect."We do not hate anybody, we do not have problems with anyone, we are only asking for our rights to exist by ourselves [as Tamils] recognising our own individuality."A Colombo man who is now fully immersed in the concerns of the Tamils living in the north, C V Wigneswaran's own life, like that of many Sri Lankans, does not fit into a neat ethnic box.A widower, both his sons are married to Sinhalese - one to the daughter of a cabinet minister, Vasudeva Nanayakkara.He has two grand-daughters. With Mr Nanayakkara, who is a political leftist, "we pull along very well, we've no difficulties. He's a humanist, not a constricted human being."Since retirement his main pursuits have been in the sphere of religion, specifically Hinduism, he says."I'm not sure there will be much time for it now," he adds with a grin.</body>

      <title>Call to avert oil refinery strike</title>
      <description>Unions call for an emergency summit and parliamentary debate in a bid to avert strikes at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical site.</description>

      <body>Unions are calling for an emergency summit and parliamentary debate in a bid to avert strikes at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical site.Workers at the Ineos site have started an overtime ban and work to rule.The dispute centres on the treatment of a union convener.Ineos has warned that its Grangemouth site will close by 2017 if it does not find savings and fresh investment. It said the site had lost more than £150m over the past four years.A spokesman for the company has accused Unite of "fiddling while Rome burns".Finance Secretary John Swinney said the Scottish government would make all efforts to bring both sides together to help resolve the dispute, and get to a position of financial sustainability for the plant.Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme he said: "We have been talking to the company about how we might be able to invest to support the development of the plant."We can only make investment if there is a viable business proposition and that's where we need to have all parties working together to support a proposition that can deliver the employment and the opportunities that we want to see for the plant in Grangemouth, because of its very wider significance for the Scottish economy."Unite workers voted for the industrial action in support of Unite convener Stevie Deans.He was suspended, then reinstated, by the company over allegations linked to his involvement in the row over the selection of a Labour candidate in Falkirk, where he is chairman of the local constituency party.Mr Deans faces an investigation by Ineos over issues linked to the Falkirk row.Unite have accused Ineos of trying to "provoke" a strike, which it warned would be "hugely damaging" to the UK economy.A previous three-day stoppage at the site in 2008 was said to have cost hundreds of millions of pounds in lost production and other knock-on effects.Workers have voted heavily in favour of action up to and including a strike - and Unite officials said they had not ruled out calling for a walkout.Pat Rafferty, the union's Scottish regional secretary, said the company was using the Stevie Deans dispute as an excuse to introduce sweeping reforms, including pension changes, job losses, an end to collective bargaining and worse pay and conditions for new employees.Unite called for a summit with the company and politicians, and urged the Scottish government to hold an emergency debate to help prevent the dispute escalating."The company is holding Stevie Deans hostage, and playing Russian roulette with fuel supplies," Mr Rafferty said."The changes being proposed are completely unpalatable to us and we feel we are being pushed into taking strike action."We are trying to make the company see sense, but we are not ruling anything out at this stage."Unite said the work to rule and overtime ban would slow down maintenance work at Grangemouth, which is split into refinery and petrochemical operations.Ineos has put forward a survival plan and has asked the Scottish and UK governments for grants and loan guarantees totalling £150m.Chairman Calum MacLean has warned "there is no plan B".Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland, Tom Crotty, group director with Ineos, said: "We have got a survival plan. We haven't been sitting on our hands wailing about it, we are doing something about it."What we can do is invest in new terminal facilities that will allow us to bring gas in from the US to replace the gas from the North Sea."But to do that we will have to put another £300m into a site that is losing £10m a month, and we will not do that unless we can sort out this cost base."He added: "While this crucial issue is facing us, which will close the site before 2017 unless something is done, Unite are ignoring it and focusing on this issue about Steven Deans."It is frankly fiddling while Rome burns."On Sunday, the company announced that one of its key customers in Hull, which traditionally took up to 100,000 tonnes of product from Grangemouth, had been forced to close down.The Ineos Vinyl Acetate Monomer (Vam) facility at Saltend said that low cost imports into Europe had made closure inevitable.Mr MacLean said: "Unfortunately the closure of this world-scale Vam unit at the Hull site has a significant knock-on effect at Grangemouth as we lose a major customer for good."</body>

      <date>1381123038</date>
      <body>The mother of a man who was hit by an HGV then dragged underneath it for three miles has appealed for anyone with information about the incident to contact police.Robert Finlayson, 22, was found dead on the B7078 Carlisle Road in Blackwood, Lanarkshire, on Monday 23 September.It is thought he had been trying to hitchhike when he was struck.His mother Angela said his family could not move on until they knew exactly what had happened.Police believe Mr Finlayson - who was known as Robbie - was hit by an unmarked light-coloured Mercedes Actros tractor unit towing a tri-axel rigid step framed trailer.They said it was possible the driver was not aware the vehicle had struck him.Mrs Finlayson said she could not get her son's body back for burial until the police investigation into his death came to a conclusion.Describing how she had last seen him on the Saturday before he died, she said: "I said I would see him later that night because I was going to work, and that was the last time I saw him."I really just can't put it into words how much we'll miss him, every aspect of his life. How can you put into words how important one person is?"Some days it's just like he'll be through the door for his dinner, other days we realise that he won't be."We can't move on because we can't do anything, we can't put Robbie to rest therefore we are just sitting waiting as well."I think for his brothers and for all the rest of the family its important that we have this conclusion, that we all know what happened so that we can piece together Robbie's last movements and understand what happened to him."Mr Finlayson, from Hamilton, was seen on CCTV at about 04:10, standing on the north side of the over bridge of the M74 motorway Junction 10 and then heading north on the northbound carriageway of the B7078, where it appears he was attempting to hitchhike.The road was busier than normal because of a diversion from the nearby M74 motorway.More than 40 vehicles, many of them heavy goods vehicles delivering to large retail outlets, were diverted from the motorway onto the B7078 between 04:00 and 04:30.Several northbound vehicles were seen moving onto the opposing lane to pass Mr Finlayson safely, but police said he was then struck by a vehicle and carried underneath it for three miles to where his body was found.Mrs Finlayson said: "There's only one thing we can do for Robbie and that is to find out what happened and that everything is dealt with and then be able to bury him."We can't do that for him until we get this information that we need, and that comes from the drivers that were on that road that night."So that is what we need - for people to come forward and give what information they can about anything they saw."Even if they think it is quite trivial it could be important to the police just to pinpoint a time or narrow the timescale down when this accident happened".Insp Calum Maider, of Police Scotland, emphasised that, although all of the drivers on the road at the time were potential witnesses, he was not looking for an accused or a suspect at this point.He added: "Our focus at this present time is on a heavy goods vehicle, which I fully believe would have been unaware of striking Robbie."We have retrieved an item of front trim from the vehicle. That has been identified as coming from a Mercedes Actros tractor unit, so therefore we are looking for that particular type of vehicle."</body>

      <title>Future of local government examined</title>
      <description>A detailed inquiry is to be carried out into the future of councils and local services in Scotland, Cosla announces.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-24422868</url>
      <date>1381102425</date>
      <body>A detailed inquiry is to be carried out into the future of councils and local services in Scotland.Cosla has announced details of a commission which will examine how councils and local services might evolve.Its remit is to examine ways of strengthening local democracy across the country, regardless of the result of the independence referendum.Members will include councillors, academics and journalists.Cosla hopes it will result in a blueprint for how local government might evolve in the discussions about the future of Scotland after the referendum - whether that means the shaping of an independent country's constitution, devising a "devo max" settlement or simply improving existing arrangements.The local government organisation's president, David O'Neill, said: "The bottom line is that local matters and it is valued within our communities. Making Scotland a fairer, healthier and wealthier place will not be achieved from the top down - we know that trying to do so simply does not work."He added: "The reality is that empowering lives in our communities means empowering local democracy and letting local people decide on their priorities, their services and their spending."As well as Mr O'Neill, the commission has 20 other members. They include councillors from across Scotland, representatives of voluntary groups, STUC general secretary Graham Smith, the academic Prof Richard Kerley and the editor of the Daily Record newspaper Alan Rennie.Some in local government fear that since devolution in 1999 there has been a trend towards the "creep centralisation" of services in Scotland.They would argue that unrelated measures such as the terms of the council tax freeze and the creation of national police and fire services have, when taken together, weakened local accountability.Some councillors argue devolution did not just mean a transfer of power from Westminster to Holyrood but from town halls to the Scottish government.Mr O'Neill is keen to see a form of "constitutional protection" for local government in Scotland after the independence question is settled.He believes central government and local government should have guaranteed responsibilities - at the moment councils could, in theory at least, be abolished by Holyrood.Mr O'Neill describes the need for "spheres of influence - not tiers of influence". In other words, he would want a formal mechanism to ensure that central government recognised the responsibility of councils to make certain decisions or provide local services."He said: "Over the decades we have moved away from the local aspect of almost everything. More and more services are being run by distant bureaucracies and often these services are being done to people rather than delivered with them."Yet, across Europe the opposite is often true. That trend simply won't see us through for much longer because it is no coincidence that our European neighbours are often more successful at improving outcomes."One question might concern the details of local government finance. At present around 80p of every pound each council spends comes directly from the Scottish government.Most of the rest comes from the council tax but the terms of the council tax freeze - due to last until 2016 - make it difficult to raise extra money to a significant level.Because of this, many councils feel their hands are tied when it comes to money. Some would like to have more financial flexibility to minimise the need for continuing austerity and hard decisions on local spending. This could mean, for instance, greater flexibility over business rates.Another question might be whether all councils should have the same set of powers - or if they should vary depending on local circumstances.The three island authorities are currently arguing for additional powers while the councils responsible for Scotland's cities are examining the case for extra economic powers and responsibilities.The commission might also look at ways of "devolving" power from councils to local communities.But it is unlikely to make recommendations about redrawing the map of Scotland's 32 councils while decisions to share local services - either by pooling them with neighbouring authorities or other public services - are likely to be left to individual councils.The commission intends to try to gather evidence from all across Scotland.But one challenge might simply be engaging the broader public in the debate. Just 38% of voters took part in last year's council elections.Another might be the extent to which it is possible to devolve real power to communities. Community councils have no formal legal responsibilities but exist to feed into local authority decision making.Supporters say they can make a real difference to the people they serve but in many parts of the country, community councils are lying moribund through apparent lack of interest.The commission's report is expected in the spring.In the event of Scots rejecting independence, it would be largely be up to the Scottish government to decide whether to put any of the commission's recommendations into practice.However it is possible the commission may also urge some council control over the practicalities of welfare delivery and other services which Westminster is responsible for.In the event of a no vote, Cosla might hope to convince Westminster that any move to give Scotland more power did not automatically mean transferring more power to the Scottish Parliament.Were there to be a vote in favour of independence, the report might play a part in the debate over what an independent Scotland would actually be like.</body>

      <body>Four-time IndyCar champion Dario Franchitti has fractured his spine in a crash at the Houston Grand Prix.The 40-year-old Scot suffered multiple fractures including a broken ankle after crashing into the track wall.His car flipped into the air following a final lap collision with Takuma Sato and at least 13 spectators were injured as debris flew over safety fencing.Franchitti's team owner Chip Ganassi said: "His ankle and back are a little sore. He is going to be okay."Three-time Indianapolis 500 winner Franchitti hit the back of Sato's car and was propelled into the air and against the fence. His car exploded into several pieces but did not catch fire.Sato said: "On the last lap I caught the marbles (chunks of rubber that come off the tyres and lie on the track) and brushed the wall and lost momentum."A couple of cars passed me as I was offline and in turn five. I got very loose and Dario and I came together."Race promoters said 11 spectators were treated at the track while two more were transferred to hospital for evaluation.The Grand Prix was won by Will Power, while Franchitti's team-mate Scott Dixon, from New Zealand, leads the overall standings.</body>

      <body>A new body to tackle some of the UK's most serious crimes has been launched.Labelled the "British FBI", the National Crime Agency (NCA) will "relentlessly pursue" organised criminals, the home secretary said.Theresa May told the BBC it would focus on organised, economic and cyber crime, border policing and child protection.It will replace a number of existing bodies but will have significantly less funding. Labour has called the move a "rebranding exercise".It is the third time since 1998 that an organised crime body has been set up.The National Crime Squad was set up 15 years ago, only to be replaced eight years later by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) - which is now being scrapped.The NCA will work with each of the regional police forces in the UK and similar organisations abroad.The agency will have 4,500 officers and aims to adopt a more visible, joined-up approach than was previously the case.Its head, Keith Bristow, warned criminals to expect "continuous disruption", including the confiscation of their assets."We are going to make a difference the public will see," he told the BBC, adding the "British FBI" label was "reasonable shorthand" for the new body.However, unlike the FBI, the NCA does not have responsibility for combating terrorism. That remains the responsibility of Scotland Yard, where the Metropolitan Police oversees a number of regional teams comprising police and MI5 officers.Mrs May told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that the new agency was "designed to be a relentless crime-fighting body which will relentlessly pursue organised criminals".The home secretary said: "Crime is falling in this country, but we can't be complacent. And particularly on organised crime, I don't think the last government put enough emphasis on this."But shadow policing minister David Hanson said the NCA "doesn't match the government's hype"."Most of the NCA is just the rebranding of existing organisations such as the Serious Organised Crime Agency, but with a substantial 20% cut imposed by the Home Office on their overall budget," he said."The new organisation is not strong enough to deal with the exponential growth of economic and online crime."It would simply absorb the existing national cyber crime unit but with fewer resources, he said."It is right to have stronger national action on organised crime with the NCA, on child exploitation and on intelligence - but the government has to support this effort and not simply use this as a rebranding exercise to hide substantial policing cuts."However, Mrs May told the BBC she was satisfied that the NCA was "going to be well resourced".She said the government had already shown it was "possible to keep up that relentless fight against crime" with less money.Keith Vaz, the chairman of the influential Home Affairs Select Committee said: "The organisations going into the NCA have a combined budget of £812m, yet the new agency will only have £473.9m next year."The Home Office needs to account for where this money has gone."Each police force in the UK has territorial responsibility for its particular area. Crimes that are carried out across more than one county or area usually involve officers from both areas.The new body will have a strategic role in which it will attempt to look at the bigger picture of organised crime in the UK, how it operates and how it can be disrupted.The NCA will answer directly to the home secretary and will have significant powers to compel police forces in England, Scotland and Wales to provide assistance and carry out policing operations.The situation will be different in Northern Ireland, where the agency will carry out border and customs functions, but not other crime-fighting roles.Mr Hanson added that this would leave a "serious operational gap" compared with the Serious Organised Crime Agency that the NCA is replacing."It is extremely worrying that organised crime which crosses between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK will not be properly dealt with because the Home Secretary mishandled the legislation with the relevant parties in Northern Ireland," he said.</body>

      <body>A campaign has been launched to help make Scottish homes more energy efficient.The Scottish government has made £74m available for home improvements such as insulation, boilers or central heating.It is offering free impartial energy advice and support through a home energy hotline.The government said many people were not aware they might be eligible for cash back on home improvements which increase energy efficiency.The campaign to raise awareness of the hotline and the financial help that is available was launched by Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.She said: "Many people are losing money by not taking up initiatives yet anyone can apply for up to £1,200 towards home improvements that will make their home warmer, greener and more cost-effective."Many people will also qualify to get energy-saving home improvements such as insulation, boilers or central heating for free."The hotline's advisers are friendly and impartial, and one call is all it takes to see what you might be eligible for."Citizens Advice Scotland chief executive Margaret Lynch said: "We see many people who are worried about paying their gas and electricity bills. And we know that around one-third of Scottish households are in fuel poverty - an astonishingly high figure."The good news is that there are quite a number of schemes that help people who are struggling to pay their fuel bills."The bad news is that many consumers don't know about them, and so don't apply to them and instead suffer the cold, or debt, or both."We have called in the past for the government to find ways of setting this information out in a clear, straightforward and impartial way. This new helpline will hopefully do that."More than 800,000 people have received energy advice or help on heating bills since 2009 through the Home Energy Scotland hotline.A recent YouGov survey suggested that three-quarters of Scottish billpayers were concerned about the cost of their energy this winter while more than 70% said last winter's energy bills had a negative impact on their disposable income.</body>

      <body>Three different wind farm applications are being considered by planning councillors in the Scottish Borders.The first bid is for nine turbines at Shawpark in the region, close to the existing Long Park wind farm.Moves to construct an 11-turbine extension of the Crystal Rig wind farm on the Berwickshire-East Lothian border are also on the agenda.The council is also being consulted on plans for a 213-turbine offshore wind farm off the Angus coast.The closest turbine in that development is more than 30 miles from the Scottish Borders coastline.Council officers are recommending the authority rejects the Shawpark application mainly on landscape grounds.The other two bids will be decided by the Scottish government but councillors are being advised to make no objection to them.</body>

      <body>Gambian officials have confirmed that the country will not be competing in the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.Last week, the west African nation branded the 54-member grouping, which includes the UK and most of its former colonies, a "neo-colonial institution".At the time it was unclear whether it would still be competing in the Games.However, Games organisers have confirmed The Gambia's withdrawal and said alternative plans would be made for the baton relay.A spokesman for Glasgow 2014 said: "All Commonwealth nations and territories are entitled to compete in the Commonwealth Games."Glasgow 2014 has received confirmation from the Commonwealth Games Federation of the formal withdrawal of The Gambia from the Commonwealth."It is our understanding, therefore, that The Gambia does not intend to enter a team and compete in next year's Games."The spokesman said the Queen's Baton Relay, which visits all nations and territories of the Commonwealth, would no longer go to The Gambia."This planning is now under development in collaboration with the Commonwealth Games Federation and we will provide further information in the near future," he said.</body>

      <body>Some of the world's top athletes joined thousands of people taking part in the Great Scottish Run.About 23,000 club, fun and charity runners took part in the half-marathon and 10k events in Glasgow.Ethiopian former Olympic and World champion Haile Gebrselassie won the half marathon event with a new course record of 61 minutes and nine seconds.A number of roads were closed for the races, which started at George Square and finished at Glasgow Green.Three Scots finished in the first four of the women's half marathon, with Leeds-based Susan Partridge beating Freya Ross to the line. Kenya's Pauline Wanjiku third and Steph Twell fourth.Following his victory, Gebrselassie said: "After losing out in the last mile at the Bupa Great North Run I had to get clear today and decided to make my move when I did and it worked so well, I'm happy with this win."Scottish Finance Minister John Swinney was among those due to run the half marathon course.World champion swimmer Keri-Anne Payne, Celtic manager Neil Lennon and Emmerdale stars Chris Chittell and Eden Taylor Draper were due to run in the 10k.Olympian Katherine Grainger started runners off from George Square while paralympian Richard Whitehead was at the finish line.Both courses took runners past city landmarks including the Riverside Museum, Finnieston Crane, Clyde Arc and the new Hydro venue.The half-marathon route also included a loop through Bellahouston Park.Late running engineering work delayed some runners travelling to the event by train, but Scotrail later said the service was back to normal.Network Rail said signalling works on the main Edinburgh to Glasgow line had been going on overnight and had been due to finish at 07:45 but had overrun to 09:30.A spokeswoman apologised for any inconvenience.Separately, a number of ScotRail services were affected by industrial action by some train drivers.The Aslef members voted to take action after rejecting a pay offer of 6.4%.ScotRail said routes likely to be affected were Glasgow Central to East Kilbride, Larkhall, Gourock, Neilson, Newton, and Wemyss Bay, and also Helensburgh to Edinburgh via Bathgate.On Saturday about 3,000 children took part in Super Saturday events for families and juniors.The Great Scottish Run was first held in 1982 and has grown each year, with 24,089 people taking part in the 2012 events.</body>

      <body>An Inverness-shire man has been named the world's best porridge maker for the second time in three years.John Boa took the prize at the 20th Annual Golden Spurtle World Porridge Making Championships in Carrbridge, Inverness-shire.The trophy goes to the maker of the best traditional porridge using only oatmeal, salt and water.Mr Boa told BBC Scotland his win was "a little overwhelming".He said this was only the third time he had entered the competition. He also won in 2011."I'm very proud and privileged. And it does make it a little bit special that it's a landmark year for the competition," he added.Mr Boa, who formerly lived in Edinburgh but now lives on Skye, said the trick to producing a world-class porridge was to "keep stirring", using a spurtle - a rod-shaped tool, traditionally used to stir porridge.He also said adding the salt was "always a key moment"."You have to make sure you don't oversalt or undersalt," he said. "It has to be just right."This year the speciality award was won by London-based Nick Barnard for his recipe for fruity date porridge, which used dried apricots, dates, apples and cinnamon.Past recipes in the speciality section have included the use of curry powder, sausages and seafood.</body>

      <body>An Andy Warhol exhibition has opened at Holyrood - the first exhibition of the artist's work to take place in a parliamentary building.Andy Warhol: Pop, Power and Politics includes a number of iconic works that have never been shown in Scotland.The exhibition is a result of a collaboration between the Scottish Parliament, the Carnegie UK Trust and the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.It coincides with a week of events celebrating Andrew Carnegie's legacy.The Andrew Carnegie's International Legacy: Shaping the Future festival celebrates the Scottish philanthropist and the centenary of the formation of the Carnegie UK Trust.The Warhol exhibition features portraits of Carnegie, as well as Lenin, Chairman Mao and The Queen.Presiding Officer Tricia Marwick said: "It gives me real pleasure to open this exhibition of iconic images, depicting politicians and political events from across the globe."It is important to me that the Scottish Parliament hosts exhibitions that encourage people to discuss and explore political issues, and few artists can get people talking like Warhol does."In association with the exhibition, two portraits of Andy Warhol taken by Scottish photographer Harry Benson, will be on loan to the Parliament Art Collection and displayed in the UK for the first time.A number of works made by Warhol for political and environmental campaigns are also being loaned from Artist Rooms, jointly owned and managed by Tate and National Galleries of Scotland.Angus Hogg, chairman of the Carnegie UK Trust, said: "Andy Warhol holds a special place in our hearts at Carnegie, not only because the trust has a long history of promoting access to arts and culture, but also because Warhol received his first formal training in art through free classes offered by the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh."As many will already know, Andrew Carnegie envisioned a world of peace, well-being and opportunity, and this sentiment still rings true over 100 years on."This collaborative exhibition, which kicks off a celebration of Andrew Carnegie's legacy, provides a once-in-a-lifetime chance for the public to get an up-close look to some of society's most impactful pieces of art."Matt Wrbican, chief archivist at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, said: "The Warhol is thrilled to share many truly exceptional works from our collection with the Scottish Parliament and the Carnegie UK Trust."The items represent the full scope of Andy Warhol's life and art. This exhibition features Warhol paintings, sculptures, and prints from our permanent collection and allows visitors to the stunning parliament building to have the opportunity to see many top-rate original Warhols."In addition, we're pleased to once again unite Pittsburgh and Scotland through the very rare display of Warhol's Andrew Carnegie portrait."The Andy Warhol exhibition will run from 5 October to 3 November.</body>

      <body>Two members of staff suffered minor injuries in a disturbance lasting around seven hours at Scotland's newest jail.The nature of the incident at Low Moss Prison, East Dunbartonshire, is not known but it is believed a number of inmates barricaded themselves in cells.The injured staff were taken to hospital as a precaution and later returned to the prison in Bishopbriggs.The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) said it was "now a police matter".The incident started at around 12:30 BST.The number of inmates involved has not been revealed but an SPS spokeswoman said the officers "suffered only minor injuries".The incident comes less than 10 days after a report on Low Moss revealed a total of 165 assaults took place at the prison last year.Ten involved assaults on staff; there were 140 assaults by prisoners on fellow inmates while a further 15 were recorded as serious assaults involving prisoner-on-prisoner violence.But the report, by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons David Strang, said Low Moss had "appropriate staffing levels" to "ensure good order is maintained".The report though highlighted at least two areas of concern within the prison: an on-going dirty protest and the short amount of time allocated to prisoners receiving methadone.The prison received its first inmates in March of last year and at the time the SPS described the complex as "state-of-the-art".</body>

      <body>The new governor of the Punjab, Mohammad Sarwar, has told the family of an Inverclyde woman that he will do everything possible to have her killers brought to justice.Mumtaz Sattar, 38, from Port Glasgow, was murdered just hours after arriving in Pakistan last month.Her relatives have petitioned the High Court in Lahore, naming a suspect.Her brother Sarfraz Ali and family solicitor Aamer Anwar met Mr Sarwar in Glasgow on Saturday.Mr Sarwar, who became Britain's first Muslim MP in 1997 when he won the Glasgow Govan seat, renounced his British citizenship in August ahead of his inauguration as governor of Pakistan's most populous province.Speaking after the meeting, he told BBC Scotland he had been in contact with the Punjab police almost every day since Mrs Sattar's murder, and had told them he wanted the case investigated by senior officers.He added: "I want to assure the family and the people of Scotland that justice will be done."Senior police officials are doing the investigations on the case and I have confidence in our police force in Punjab and the legal system that they will do their best to make sure that the person who has committed this heinous crime is brought to justice."Mr Anwar said the meeting with Mr Sarwar had been "extremely valuable".He added: "Mr Sarwar arranged a conference call with senior police officers and formal requests have now been made for the police to co-operate with Police Scotland and with ourselves in order that this murder inquiry can be solved."He has been able to cut through the bureaucracy. He has also put the spotlight on this case and said that every pressure must be brought to bear in order to bring the killers of Mumtaz Sattar to justice."Mrs Sattar's husband Abdul, 40, is in police custody.He told officers he and his wife were drugged and attacked by two men during a taxi ride on the way from the airport to see his parents in Punjab on Saturday 21 September.He said they were thrown out of a moving car and that his wife died from the head injuries she suffered.Scottish Police are helping Pakistani authorities with their investigation.On Friday, Mr Anwar told BBC Scotland Mrs Sattar's relatives had serious concerns about the Pakistani police investigation into Mrs Sattar's death.He said: "A serious allegation has been made of bribery of police officers that are involved in the case."At each and every turn the family appears to have been obstructed, as a result of which advocates lodged a petition at the High Court in Lahore yesterday in which they name one murder suspect and ask for the authorities to bring the police officers concerned to the High Court to answer questions."</body>

The 18 residents will be moved to other accommodation while the work is done.Operator RDS Healthcare has not commented on the closure.The Care Inspectorate said it had "serious concerns" about the quality of care offered at Clachnaharry House.A spokesman said: "The health, safety and welfare of residents is the absolute priority because everyone is entitled to care that reflects their needs and promotes their rights."NHS Highland suspended its admissions to the home in November 2012.A spokesman said: "There are currently 18 residents in the home and it is our wish to have them moved to and settled in a new care environment as soon as possible."Five residents have been moved to hospital for a variety of clinical reasons."As a board our priority is the residents currently still in Clachnaharry and we have already started discussions with them, and their relatives, about the choices and opportunities that are available to them."In the meantime we will continue to work with the care home staff in providing advice and support to ensure this goes as smoothly as possible."</body>

      <body>A former punk musician is to exhibit his photographs documenting abandoned Western Isles croft houses.John Maher was the drummer in 1970s English band Buzzcocks, whose hits included Ever Fallen In Love.Maher is now a photographer based on Harris and usually takes night-time images of the isle and also of Lewis.The exhibition, Leaving Home, also features the photographic work of Fife-based vet Ian Paterson.The properties in the photographs were deserted during the second half of the 20th Century.Many of the images will be accompanied by text passages in Gaelic and English.The texts detail the memories of those who grew up in the houses, or who remember them when they were still homes.Leaving Home will be exhibited at An Lanntair arts centre in Stornoway, on Lewis, from 9 November to 6 December.Mr Maher and Mr Paterson hope to bring the exhibition to other parts of Scotland, including Glasgow.They have turned to crowd funding website Kickstarter to help finance their plans to take show on tour.In return for financial pledges of support, backers will receive signed fine art prints and the chance to spend time on location at one of the crofts with Mr Maher.He said: "Our aim is to create an exhibition that can be easily transported and put on show again at other locations, giving people in other parts of Scotland an opportunity to observe an as yet unrecorded aspect of Scotland's social history."Manchester-born Mr Maher was recruited to the Buzzcocks when he was a teenager. Five weeks after joining, the band was supporting the Sex Pistols.Mr Paterson, originally from Glasgow, became interested in photography while working abroad.He is a regular visitor to the Western Isles and began documenting abandoned croft houses last year.</body>

      <description>Nat Fraser loses his appeal against conviction for murdering his wife Arlene in 1998 - a ruling welcomed by her relatives.</description>

      <body>Nat Fraser has lost his appeal against his conviction for murdering his wife Arlene.Fraser, 54, has twice been convicted of hiring a hitman to murder his estranged wife, who vanished from her home in Elgin, Moray, in April 1998. She has never been found.Fraser was found guilty of murder in 2003 but started a lengthy appeal process which led to a retrial.He was found guilty of murder for a second time last year.Relatives of Mrs Fraser welcomed the appeal decision, and said their message to Fraser was: "He should do his time."Fraser was jailed for a minimum of 17 years but his defence team argued at the appeal that remarks made by a trial witness may have led jurors to carry out online "research" into the background to the case.They blamed a so-called "Google-factor".The appeal judges ruled: "The trial judge provided clear and repeated directions to the jury during the trial and again at its conclusion in the charge itself, shortly before the jury retired to consider their verdict."In the absence of material which would tend to demonstrate the contrary, the court must proceed on the basis that the directions were followed."In this case the appeal court considered that the trial judge took into account all the relevant factors before deciding upon the appropriate course of action. He reached a balanced and reasonable decision based upon these factors."In such circumstances the court was unable to find fault in his decision."Mrs Fraser's mother Isabelle Thompson said afterwards of the appeal: "Hopefully we can get on with our lives, it's been never-ending."Her father, Hector McInnes, said: "Obviously we are happy it's all finished."We have had to come here too often. He should do his time."</body>

      <title>Scots soldiers given bravery awards</title>
      <description>Several Scottish soldiers are honoured for acts of bravery carried out while they were serving in Afghanistan.</description>

      <date>1380841415</date>
      <body>Scottish soldiers have been honoured for acts of bravery while serving in Afghanistan.The awards included a George Medal for a bomb disposal expert who helped save the lives of Danish and Afghan troops.Also honoured was a soldier who took "decisive action" after a rogue member of the Afghan Army killed a Scottish officer during a football match.And a platoon leader was recognised for his "conspicuous bravery" under heavy fire.Warrant Officer Andy Peat, a high threat explosive ordnance disposal operator, received the George Medal for his role when he was attached to a task force of a Danish Special Forces unit with Afghan partners.The George Medal is awarded to civilians for acts of great bravery, but also to military personnel for acts of great bravery not in the presence of the enemy.WO Peat, 39, from Edinburgh, was on an operation to search a suspected homemade explosive factory when one of the Danish soldiers triggered a device on a compound roof.He was credited with saving the lives of several other Danish soldiers and members of the Afghan police.He cleared a route to the injured man while urging the other Afghan and Danish soldiers to stay still to avoid triggering other bombs.When he reached him he realised there was another wire underneath him - tracing it to another IED hidden under a nearby stone, he disarmed it and cleared a safe route.WO Peat, of 33 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiment Royal Engineers, said: "Working in the dark with night vision equipment does make it more difficult but we train for those situations."I was aware that there was a potential threat from insurgents and further devices. In those circumstances you remain focused, prioritise and work logically."It is hard to suppress your emotions, knowing someone has been gravely injured. Your first instinct is to run to them and do everything you can to help but if you do that, you could make things a lot worse."Oversergeant Rene Brink Jakobsen later died of his wounds, leaving behind a wife and three children.WO Peat's citation stated: "Although a Danish serviceman was fatally injured, the calm, determined actions and bravery demonstrated by Peat without doubt prevented further casualties and death to both Afghans and Danish alike."The Commander on the ground is adamant that Peat protected seven lives that night. At no time did Peat show regard to his own safety and his selfless actions are tribute to a truly professional soldier."In August, WO Peat became the first soldier outside Denmark to receive the Anders Lassen Award for his bravery.Pte Ryan Houston, of 1st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, was two-and-a-half months into his first tour of duty in Afghanistan when an Afghan soldier starting firing at troops as they played football in November last year.The 22-year-old, from Hamilton, was on duty as a Guardian Angel, patrolling the Forward Operating Base in Nad-e Ali to protect his fellow troops, when he heard gunfire.As Afghan and British troops scattered, he took on the rogue soldier who was firing at him, then followed him as he fled the pitch.The incident fatally wounded Capt Walter Barrie, 41, from Penicuik in Midlothian, who was playing in the match.His killer was stopped when Pte Houston, joined by another soldier, gave chase and opened fire.The 22-year-old was awarded a Mention in Despatches in the latest round of Operational Honours, announced at the Tower of London.Pte Houston's citation described how he and his colleague were exposed to more than 50 bullets which passed within centimetres of them.Once the Afghan soldier had been shot, they searched him, and Pte Houston was then said to have expressed "extraordinary humanity and control" by protecting fellow soldiers who were giving first aid to the man who had only minutes before been trying to kill them."Houston's valour, decisive action and his exhibition of the highest standards to which the British Army aspires, are out of all proportion to that expected of such a junior soldier," the citation added.Also mentioned in dispatches was Cpl Richard Cook, from Selkirk, who was recognised for his "repeated gallantry and inspirational leadership" while acting above his rank as a Platoon Sergeant in Afghanistan.Cpl Cook, also of 1st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, led his platoon on an operation to search a known insurgent command post and improvised explosive device factory in central Yakchal in February.As the Scots and members of the Afghan National Security Force Tiger Team approached the compound they came under "accurate and heavy small arms fire" with rounds striking the ground among his soldiers.He immediately took control, directing his men to what little cover there was and ordered return fire to enable an extraction of his men and the Tiger Team.The 26-year-old said: "We knew it was coming. Rounds started cracking around us. I ordered rapid fire. The machine gunner got a stoppage and just as he ducked behind a wall a bullet struck the top of it."With suppressive firing failing to quell the insurgent attack, he took a significant risk and moved out of cover to an exposed and vulnerable position to draw the insurgent fire and identify their position.Upon doing so, he fired a 66mm rocket, ending the contact successfully without sustaining any casualties.He said: "I knew I had to do something to stop them firing on us. At the time I didn't think about putting myself in the firing line. It was only afterwards I wondered what the hell I was doing".Over the course of the day, his platoon was engaged a further eight times by accurate small arms, grenades and rocket propelled grenades from multiple firing points.His citation read: "Throughout, he led from the front showing outstanding grit and determination which proved to be an inspiration to his young soldiers and the Afghan Tiger team."</body>

      <body>A senior Scottish Fire and Rescue Service officer has admitted its handling of moves to close a Dumfries control room could have been better.The centre is one of five being considered for closure.Assistant Chief Fire Officer Dave Boyle issued an apology directly to members of Dumfries and Galloway Council's police and fire committee.He said the service could have handled the issue much better and would learn from the mistake.However, he said there would be no rethink on the decision taken by the board."The SFRS, myself and the strategic leadership team and the board need to learn lessons from community engagement, from local authority engagement and all the rest of it," he said."We will be examining where we have gone through this process and what we could do better and, more importantly, how we change our actions for the future."He said there had been issues with the Dumfries control room for a number of years and it would have needed significant investment in order to continue."What the board have decided has actually just brought the final chapter down on that," he said."We will now start to invest money with the local stations to make sure that they are retained to be mobilised in the way they should be."Once the fire control centre in Dumfries is shut, all emergency call handling for the region will be transferred to Johnstone in Renfrewshire.Labour councillor Ronnie Ogilvie, who sits on the local authority's police and fire committee, said he remained deeply concerned about the impact of the closure - both operationally and in terms of employment.However, he said the fact the SFRS had recognised that it had made a major error in not consulting was at least something."To be fair to the fire board they have acknowledged that - and it is not just in Dumfries and Galloway," he said."Other people are jumping up and down as well."They have realised they have made a major mistake and they are going to address that - but it doesn't change the decision though."</body>

      <title>Council to offer extra nursery care</title>

      <date>1380841074</date>
      <body>Stirling Council is to increase the number of free nursery hours for pre-school children next year.The local authority said parents of three and four-year-olds in the area would be offered 600 hours a year free from April.The Scottish government intends to introduce the same measure across Scotland sometime in 2014.The council said the increase in the current provision of 475 hours would save parents up to £682 a year.It said it would be the first local authority in Scotland to introduce the increase, with the rollout due to begin in January when it will apply to looked-after two-year-olds in care.'Tough economic times'It will then be extended to all three and four-year-olds between April and August 2014.The council claimed its phased introduction would start "well in advance of the Scottish government timetable".The authority said that the hourly fee for care in a local council-run nursery was currently about £2.85 per child, while the rate for private providers was up to £5.46.Johanna Boyd, leader of the Labour-run council, said the move would benefit up to 2,000 children and their families.She added: "Our early introduction of 600 hours a year of free care will be a huge benefit for working parents."Scotland is facing tough economic times and this will help those in most need to save on childcare and to have the chance to earn the money they need to raise their families."Plans to implement the increase nationwide from 475 to 600 hours are set out in the Children and Young People's Bill, which is due to go before the Scottish Parliament's Education and Culture Committee next week.The Scottish government has yet to give a date when the measures will be adopted but has said it will be sometime next year, depending on the passage of the bill, which is currently going through parliament.</body>

      <title>'No NHS pay freeze' in Scotland</title>
      <description>Scottish Health Secretary Alex Neil pledges not to impose a pay freeze on NHS workers in Scotland.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-24419314</url>
      <date>1381054422</date>
      <body>The Scottish government has pledged not to impose a pay freeze on NHS workers in Scotland.It came after the Department of Health (DoH) at Westminster urged UK-wide pay review bodies to cancel a planned 1% pay rise next year.It said the rise was unaffordable and the money should instead be used to help maintain safe staffing levels.But Scottish Health Minister Alex Neil said he had "no intention" of withholding the rise in Scotland.He said the Scottish government had made its own proposals to the pay review bodies, proposing that the 1% rise is implemented in 2014/15 as well as giving further help to those on low wages by ensuring no one employed by the health service earns less than the Scottish Living Wage.Mr Neil accused Westminster counterpart Jeremy Hunt of "bad faith" and said withholding the pay rise would be a "betrayal of the NHS".He added: "To steal the pay rise back from workers' hands will destabilise the NHS across the UK and damage morale."The Scottish government has no intention of following Jeremy Hunt and we will use our independence over the health service to block this move."But with UK wide agreement to Agenda for Change - which established pay policy in the health service - this damaging right wing approach could hit Scottish services, and under the current funding settlement could drive down Scotland's budget in the future."My message to Hunt is unequivocal - Scotland rejects your politics, your attack on staff, and your desire to destroy the real NHS."The health secretary said he would be meeting with unions "to ensure this ludicrous proposal finds no foundation in Scotland."On Saturday it emerged the DoH had made a written submission to the NHS Pay Review Body in which it said the proposed 1% rise was unaffordable alongside the current system, which sees many staff automatically receive incremental annual rises.The move has been criticised by Labour and the unions.The DoH has stressed no decisions on changes to pay have been taken, and said independent bodies will make their recommendations in February or March next year.However, in its submission, the DoH pointed to a staff survey suggesting high levels of motivation and morale, and said there should only be basic pay increases if there is "strong evidence" recruitment, retention, morale or motivation issues require this.The submission said: "Employers cannot pay staff more, improve quality and productivity and protect jobs."Careful and prudent management of the NHS pay bill is critical if we are to maintain the right number of frontline staff with the right skills. We believe more affordable employment contracts can help deliver better care and improve job security."The NHS Pay Review Body makes recommendations on the remuneration of all staff paid under Agenda for Change and employed in the NHS.Its recommendations apply to about 1.5 million staff in NHS Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with the exception of doctors, dentists and very senior managers.It reports separately to the health ministers in each country of the UK, who can accept, reject or modify its recommendation.</body>

      <body>The Scottish Greens could play a key role in convincing Scots to vote for independence in next year's referendum, the party's conference has been told.Co-convener Patrick Harvie said "canny" voters would not be persuaded into voting Yes next September with "flags, bribes or fearmongering".He said Scots could be won over with a "radical vision" of what the country could be like after leaving the UK.Mr Harvie was speaking as the two-day conference opened in Inverness.The people of Scotland will be asked the straight yes/no question "Should Scotland be an independent country?" when they vote in the independence referendum on 18 September 2014.At last year's conference members voted to endorse the cross-party Yes Scotland campaign for independence.At the same time the party agreed to form its own pro-independence campaign, designed to promote its distinct policies.Mr Harvie, one of the Greens' two MSPs at Holyrood, said: "Many Scots remain undecided on independence and they have every right to take their time, as creating a new country is undoubtedly a radical step."These canny voters won't be persuaded by flags, bribes or fearmongering but I believe they will respond to a radical vision for a better Scotland and the Scottish Greens are crucial to outlining that vision."Taking responsibility and bringing power closer to the people is a core Green principle, and our conference is a chance for us to galvanise our party and amplify our message."He added: "This is a big decision about Scotland's long-term future."As Greens we're used to thinking big and it's in our DNA to think ahead, so let's seize the day."Mr Harvie argued that at this time the "Green vision for Scotland has never been more important", adding that his party offered "the vision of a renewed economy that works for the many rather than the few and a sustainable society that cares about future generations".He said: "The clock is ticking on the need to tackle climate change and a Green Scotland would be better placed to develop the low-carbon society we need."</body>

      <title>Procurement reform bill published</title>
      <description>Public sector bodies could be allowed to consider issues such as blacklisting when awarding work to firms, under proposed reforms.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-24398997</url>
      <date>1380900795</date>
      <body>Public sector bodies could be allowed to consider issues such as blacklisting and zero-hours contracts when awarding work to firms, according to planned reforms.The move is among changes to public procurement rules being proposed by the Scottish government.The Procurement Reform Bill aims to improve the way the public sector buys goods, works and services.Ministers said it would make it easier for small firms to bid for contracts.Guidance under the bill would allow public sector bosses to consider the inappropriateness of awarding contracts to companies using controversial zero-hours contracts, which allow employers to hire staff with no guarantee of work.Public sector bosses could also consider, when deciding on a contract award, whether firms use blacklisting.The issue of blacklisting has angered unions and politicians, following disclosures about a UK-wide database of names used by major construction firms to vet workers.Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the legislation promoted an approach that was "both business friendly and socially responsible".The proposed new rules could also lead to greater use of community benefit clauses.These clauses could require companies to provide training, apprenticeships or opportunities for disabled people as part of the contract."Changes to public procurement rules will ensure Scotland retains its place as a world leader in public procurement reform, promoting an approach that is both business friendly and socially responsible," Ms Sturgeon said.Responding to the bill, Scottish Trades Union Congress general secretary Grahame Smith said: "The STUC enthusiastically welcomes parts of this important bill, especially its provisions to disqualify firms engaging in tax avoidance and blacklisting from the public procurement process and the commitment to introduce further guidance on workforce matters."But Mr Smith described parts of the legislation as "very disappointing", adding: "It is difficult to believe that community benefits will be extended and improved by simply handing contracting authorities a duty to 'consider' whether to impose as part of the contract."The STUC is also sceptical that the significant additional requirements placed on local authorities and other contracting agencies will have 'no overall net impact on costs'."Scottish Building Federation managing director Vaughan Hart welcomed the publication of the bill.He said: "With a growing pipeline of publicly funded infrastructure projects planned over the years ahead, this bill offers the potential to transform the efficiency of public procurement - and to encourage many more particularly smaller building companies to bid for public sector contracts."We will look forward to scrutinising the detail in the months ahead."CBI Scotland said the bill contained "a number of encouraging measures", but added that ministers risked missing out on an opportunity to open up the delivery of public services to independent providers.Assistant director David Lonsdale added: "The bill should enshrine in legislation a 'right to bid' for private and third sector organisations, so that any provider who can demonstrate the capacity and wherewithal to deliver a public service more effectively, innovatively, and for better value is given the opportunity to do so."</body>

      <body>Newly-released scientific evidence shows mackerel stocks in the north east Atlantic are in "good health", Scottish fishing leaders have said.The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea has recommended an increase in quotas of more than 60% for 2014.The Scottish Pelagic Fishermen's Association (SPFA) welcomed the news.Scientists said analysis had been hampered by the wrangle with Iceland and the Faroe Islands over quotas.SPFA chief executive Ian Gatt said: "The scientific advice confirms what Scottish fishermen have repeatedly been saying, that the stock remains in good health and that consumers can continue to eat Scottish mackerel safe in the knowledge that the fish are abundant in the sea and being sustainably caught by our fishermen."He said he hoped a resolution with Iceland and the Faroes could be reached over disputed quota levels.Fisheries Secretary Richard Lochhead said: "The increase in quota advised for 2014 is tremendous news for the Scottish fishing industry."Mackerel is our most valuable stock, worth £131m to the Scottish economy last year."He added: "This scientific advice also provides a fresh opportunity to try and resolve the ongoing dispute with Iceland and the Faroes."Iceland's Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, said: "With our focus on sustainable fisheries, Iceland will continue to work hard for an agreement between the coastal states in order to secure sustainable management of the mackerel stock."</body>

      <body>Jamie Walker admits losing to St Mirren is "a massive defeat" for Hearts and that the pressure of the occasion was too much for some of his team-mates.Hearts missed a chance to move within six points of a side who started the day second bottom and with the future of manager Danny Lennon in doubt."The pressure maybe got to one or two of the boys," said winger Walker."We started the game well - it was probably the best we've started in a while - but we just fell away."With St Mirren moving 12 points clear of Hearts after their 2-0 victory, Kilmarnock become the Edinburgh side's first target in the relegation zone after the Ayrshire side's defeat away to Dundee United ."We can't let our heads go down and need to keep going," said 20-year-old Walker, who was Hearts' top performer at Tynecastle."We play Kilmarnock in two weeks and it's another big game and hopefully we can get a better result."Walker was booked for simulation after a challenge in the penalty box by Lee Mair before St Mirren opened the scoring.Hearts have felt that refereeing decisions have not gone their way in recent weeks, but the Scotland Under-21 international was not about to blame Craig Thomson for their run without a win being extended to seven games."I obviously felt there was a bit of contact, otherwise I would not have gone down, but you just have to take it on the chin," he said.Hearts manager Gary Locke put the defeat down to the inconsistencies you can expect from a young side rather than the pressure of the occasion."There is pressure on them every week, so I wouldn't use that as an excuse," he said."With the team being so young, you're always going to get one or two performances like that."Maybe on another day, we would have taken our chances, but we certainly didn't play as well as we have done."I was pleased with the start, but we made one or two little errors that give St Mirren a wee bit of belief."After that, we huffed and puffed without being as creative as we have been."Locke was not giving up on the possibility of Hearts overcoming the 15-point penalty with which they started the season as a result of being in administration."With having such a young team at the start of the season, it was going to be a big ask and, after that result, it's not going to be any different," he added."The boys are very down, but we can't feel sorry for ourselves. There's still a long way to go."</body>

      <title>Kelly immune to pressure on Lennon</title>

      <body>Sean Kelly has become an instant St Mirren hero but insists he is immune to the pressures that have been heaped on manager Danny Lennon.The left-back's introduction to the Buddies' starting line-up has coincided with two unbeaten games that have gone a long way to saving Lennon's job."We have not really talked about it at training," the 20-year-old said after the 2-0 win over Hearts."I've tried to stay away from it, not reading anything and just tuning out."St Mirren had travelled to Tynecastle with the prospect of Hearts, who started the season with a 15-point penalty for going into administration, reducing the gap at the bottom of the Premiership to six points.But the Paisley side headed back along the M8 with a first victory of the season."It is only one game and could easily reverse in two weeks' time after the international break, but it's hopefully a start," said Kelly, who had made his first start earlier in the week against Aberdeen.That draw ended a run of three straight defeats after Lennon changed three of his back four as well as his goalkeeper.The manager stayed loyal to that unit in Edinburgh, which meant that Kelly retained his place despite the availability of the experienced Danny Grainger after the summer signing's suspension."I wasn't too concerned as I thought I had shown on Monday night that I was capable of playing," said Kelly."I have been thrown in at the deep end, but I am enjoying it and it's better than sitting on the bench - I wouldn't have it any other way."Kelly insisted that there had been no panic in the dressing-room despite media speculation about Lennon's future."We had the belief in ourselves that we could turn it around," said the product of St Mirren's youth system."We just had to stay compact for a game, stay tight and keep a clean sheet."Kelly was not fazed by playing in front of 15,000, mainly hostile, fans in such a high-profile game."When you're young, you dream of playing at places like Tynecastle," he said."A couple of my mates are St Mirren fans, so it's a bit surreal."But it's just a game of football, at the end of the day, no matter how many fans are there."Kelly said that playing alongside fellow defenders Darren McGregor and Lee Mair, plus goalkeeper Chris Dilo, in the reserve side had made their introduction to the first-team en masse so much easier."I know it's a different level, but at least we aren't strangers," he said.Lennon suggested that that those players had been spared some of the pressure that had piled on the others."I needed to freshen things up in the starting 11 on Monday and I felt it ignited us and gave us a spark to start our season," said the manager."I am absolutely delighted for young Sean Kelly, coming through to handle this kind of environment and atmosphere in the manner that he did."It's pleasing that we now have two left-backs to compete for that position."</body>

      <title>One city's house price surge</title>
      <description>The Scottish city where property prices have doubled in a decade</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24348196</url>

      <body>Two cities in the UK - one is a centre of commerce, has runaway house prices, and welcomes a constant stream of overseas property buyers. The other is London.House prices in and around Aberdeen have more than doubled in the past 10 years, according to data from the Nationwide Building Society.That increase is only matched by the trendy north London borough of Islington, and by Westminster in the heart of the capital of the UK.Recent figures show that Scotland's third city is recording a fresh surge in property prices. One estate agent describes the area as a property force field."Everywhere outside is doom and gloom, but it is boom time here," says Brian Sutton, of James and George Collie solicitors and estate agents.Take a closer look at Aberdeen, and its picturesque, shimmering granite homes, and you can see the complexity of the UK property market.The city has demand from first-time buyers willing to pay above valuation levels, interest from workers moving to the area, investors keen to get in on the act, and a lack of homes for sale.All this pushes up prices. Yet, in Scotland as a whole, prices are only creeping up after years of stagnation.It shows that averages can be misleading and that local areas can have very different trends to neighbouring regions, for reasons ranging from the quality of local schools to employment levels.It also questions a widely held belief that the London property market is unique - that soaring prices in the south-east of England are unequalled in the rest of the country.At the mouth of Aberdeen Harbour, next to the fishermen's village of Footdee, is a landmark called the Roundhouse.The Shoremaster's accounts for 1797-98 show that more than £225 was spent on the new house and telescope on the site.Nowadays, first-time buyers in the city can expect to pay up to £140,000 for a one-bedroom flat, or up to £500,000 for a bigger property.Competition for homes means many buyers are paying 5% to 10% over valuation at the moment, says Bill Barclay, partner at Raeburns solicitors and estate agents.Often sales go to sealed bids, with first-timers stretching their savings to compete with buy-to-let investors.Spend a few minutes standing by the harbour and the reason for this active property market is clear - North Sea oil."It drives the local economy," says Mr Barclay. "Big companies are making long-term financial plans for the area, so we are not going to see much changing."The area was not immune to the financial crisis. Banks were not lending at the levels they had been before 2008, but Mr Barclay says Glasgow and Edinburgh suffered much more.Now, he says - using a phrase apt for an oil-producing region - the banks are "starting to open the taps" again to fund mortgages.Figures published by the University of Aberdeen show a 25% increase in the volume of sales in the second quarter of the year compared with the same three months in 2011. Prices were up by 5.5% in the city and its suburbs over the same period.Sales volumes of flats were up by 53% in that time, as buy-to-let investors find the finance and predict demand from tenants.All this is gloomy news for potential first-time buyers. One 32-year-old tells the BBC he has been renting on the south coast of England and then Aberdeen over the past 15 years and is unable to save anything close to what is needed as a deposit.You hardly see a sale sign erected within the city's sought-after areas, with supply low and competition picking up. But the market is far from overheating, as it was in 2007, according to estate agent Brian Sutton."We had people in their early 20s buying property, with 10 to 20 bidding for one property. Competition has come back, but it is three to four people bidding," he says."First-time buyers are in their early 30s, not their 20s, often with their parents helping."He predicts the housing market will continue to rise at a "sustainable rate", especially as the oil companies build headquarters in the area and continue to relocate staff to the region.Prices may grow by single figures year-on-year, he says, but nobody wants to return to the days of 20% a year increases.Much the same point was made by Business Secretary Vince Cable when he raised concerns about a property bubble potentially being inflated by government schemes to kick-start the market."In London and the south east, in the north-east of Scotland, in other areas, there are serious housing inflationary pressures," he said.Despite his warning, the second phase of the Help to Buy scheme has been brought forward by three months in England, and the Scottish government has announced the start of its own scheme.The UK and Scottish governments both argue that Help to Buy, which includes allowing buyers to apply for a shared equity loan for part of the property, are vital to give people the chance to secure a mortgage from risk-averse lenders.Buyers only qualify under the Scottish scheme if they are buying a newly built property.Critics might argue that they should encourage the developers to follow the example of the fishermen's cottages at Footdee - where the front doors face inwards to protect occupants from incoming storms.</body>

      <title>Feeding 5,000 highlights food waste</title>
      <description>Edinburgh chefs cook up meal to highlight food waste</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-24406749</url>
      <date>1380931482</date>
      <body>Feeding up to 5,000 people in a day is no easy task but a team of chefs and volunteers are hoping to do just that in Edinburgh on Saturday to highlight the issue of food waste.They will be creating free meals using ingredients which might otherwise not have been used.Scottish households throw away 566,000 tonnes of food waste every year, according to Zero Waste Scotland.In the small kitchen of an Edinburgh restaurant preparations are under way for lunchtime service. Freshly baked sourdough bread comes out of the oven, meanwhile the chef is examining lobsters, mussels and potatoes from their allotment."I dug these up on Sunday," says Neil Forbes, chef director at Café St Honore."These are a variety called pink fir apple potatoes, which are just sensational, look how nutty and knobbly they look. Incredible."He is passionate about kitchen traditions, but on Saturday he will be swapping his own kitchen for a marquee as he oversees the cooking by a team of other chefs of up to 5,000 meals. He believes the issue of food waste is crucial."You have to put your business hat on sometimes and think well if I could sell that and there's nothing wrong with it, why would I throw that away if it's perfectly edible and good to eat."It may not be attractive to look at, it may be a wonky carrot or a misshapen courgette but there's nothing wrong with it taste-wise, so by the time you've cut it up or made it into a pot of soup or a stew, then surely it's just madness to throw it away."The most wasted foods are fresh fruit and vegetables, salads, bread and cakes, with the average Scottish household throwing out something like £430 worth of food a year"In Scotland we throw away 566,000 tonnes of food waste every year from our homes, that's the equivalent of 38,000 double-decker buses," says Ylva Haglund of Zero Waste Scotland."Three quarters of this could have been avoided if we managed our food a little bit better, for example using it up in time or not over-cooking and ending up throwing out food afterwards."But is that message getting through?"I'm pretty good at using what I buy," says one woman shopper in the centre of Edinburgh.Another woman, hurrying along with bags under her arms, admits she is rather less efficient: "Vegetables that I haven't got through, stuff that's in the fridge, after a week, you just clear it all out."I should really watch what I buy."The vegetables being used to cook up Saturday's meals are mainly ones which might not meet the specifications for retail in supermarkets and could go to other parts of the food chain or even cattle feed.The Scottish Retail Consortium says the major grocery retailers "have been at the forefront of ensuring that EU fruit and vegetable marketing regulations were relaxed so that the strict marketing conditions on 26 types of fruit and vegetables were loosened so that more 'wonky' fruit and vegetables could be sold in dedicated value ranges."They are also working with farmers to make more of the crop by, for example, using 'wonkier' fruit and vegetables in basic lines or using it in processed products."It also says it is working to reach targets "agreed with the Scottish government to reduce food waste in the supply chain and help consumers reduce household waste."Saturday's event, organised by the group, Edible Edinburgh is also trying to touch on wider issues of food sustainability in the city and the public will be asked for their views on developing a strategy to advance that."The amount of food that we waste in the north, the developed world is more than the amount of food people eat in sub-Saharan Africa," says Pete Ritchie, director of the group Nourish Scotland. He is also a member of the Edible Edinburgh project."It's pretty poor, it shows how disconnected we've become from the value of food."One of the dishes on offer on Saturday will be a vegetable curry, cooked with a glut of coriander and tomato puree nearing its use by date."I'm hoping we will have created discussion and debate," says Charlie Cornelius, the chef-proprietor at Iglu restaurant in Edinburgh. He will be in charge of that curry kitchen which could turn out about 830 meals."That people will have had fun coming out, coming together through food, creating community through food. There's nothing more important than that."</body>

      <description>New flavours catapult porridge to a healthy breakfast staple</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/0/24082660</url>
      <date>1380900821</date>
      <body>Porridge's exact origins have "been lost in the mists of time", but new flavours, different grains and its nutritional benefits have catapulted it into a modern healthy breakfast staple.The simplicity of porridge is also its beauty.There are few foods that can be made as easily as a bowl of water mixed with oats, perhaps with a sprinkle of salt (the traditionally Scottish way) or sugar.Or that can be transformed with the addition of berries or fruit, spices, nuts, honey, syrups, milk, cream or even booze.Couple this with its healthy appeal, and sales of oats and ready-made porridge in the UK are skyrocketing.However aficionado John Boa's attempts at blending flavours in the annual World Porridge Championships in Carrbridge, in the Scottish Highlands have not always been successful."Keeping it simple is my philosophy when it comes to the speciality section," he says."The first year [I added] beer and nuts and called it my all day porridge. It didn't go down at all well."With wooden stirring tools known as spurtles at the ready, enthusiastic cooks from as far afield as Sweden and America must prepare their porridge using oatmeal, water and salt, with the option to add flavours in a speciality section.John Boa, is a previous winner of the coveted golden spurtle prize, and in 2012 his honeyed hazelnut porridge swirl won the people's choice award.This year he is entering his recipe for a toffee sauce and nut version at the 20th annual competition.The interest in porridge is not confined to a few die-hard enthusiasts in the Highlands.In fact 49% of people in the UK eat porridge, according to market research firm Mintel, with 23% of people eating it daily.It says sales of hot cereals - largely made up of porridge - have almost doubled since 2008, hitting £241m in 2013, and volume sales rising by 25% to 81 million kg.Cafe chain Pret A Manger's sales of hot pots have doubled since it began selling them in 2010, and it now sells more than 60,000 each week.Why the increase in popularity? It could be put down to successive cold winters or a growing awareness of porridge's nutritional value.Heidi Lanschuetzer, food and drinks analyst at Mintel says: "While porridge has found a way to tap into the out of home breakfast occasion, the segment has also benefited from oats' inherent health benefits, notably the fact that they can lower cholesterol, as well as their widely held associations with satiety - a factor which is of particular importance when it comes to buying breakfast cereals."Oats, which form the basis of traditional porridge are often called a "superfood" because of the many nutrients they contain.Oats are a wholegrain product, rather than a refined one says Dr Frank Thies of the Rowett Institute of Nutrition and Health."If you compare that with white bread, wholemeal bread contains lots of good vital chemicals, nutrients and vitamins that are removed from the grain when you process the flour to make white bread."Like any other wholegrain product, oats are very good for you."Oats contain protein, magnesium, potassium, iron, calcium, Vitamin E, and Vitamin B, and have no sodium or cholesterol.In addition, they contain large amounts of soluble fibre including beta-glucan, which is known to lower cholesterol.Professor Derek Stewart, from the James Hutton Institute, says in Britain's Favourite Supermarket Foods porridge is "outstanding"."Beta-glucan is soluble dietary fibre - beta-glucan dissolves the water and forms a gloopy thick mass," he says.This can help the stomach feel fuller, for longer - but does it actually suppress appetite and prevent snacking?Dr Thies advises that studies are still ongoing."We don't know if it's due to the effects of food or just because you have a [full] feeling in your stomach due to the viscosity of the material."More research is needed, but it might be the case that oats affect the signal telling your body that it should stop eating," says Dr Thies.Dr Izhat Khan, a consultant with NHS Scotland is competing in the World Porridge Championships for the first time.He regularly extols its benefits to diabetic patients who must control levels of glucose in their blood (glycaemia)."Oatmeal offers very good glycaemic control," says Dr Khan. "If you have a bowl of porridge in the morning then you do not have the craving for elevenses and you avoid the snacks that can be quite unhealthy."There are no big insulin surges and you have satiety that lasts until lunchtime."For those on a gluten-free diet a daily bowl of oat porridge may not be an option, though some gluten-free brands are on sale.Pure oatmeal does not contain gluten, but can often be contaminated with wheat or barley during factory production.However "pseudo-cereals", plants that produce grains such as amaranth or buckwheat, can be substituted for oats in a dish of porridge.Oats form the basis of what we think of as traditional porridge in Britain but many other countries can also lay claim to the name, albeit with variations."[Claiming porridge as their own] is a pretty clever trick that the Scots have pulled off," says Guthrie Hutton, author of A Bowl of Porridge."They have managed to get oatmeal porridge recognised as the one true porridge and to have it identified with Scotland. [But] people make porridge using different grains in different countries around the world."Varieties of porridge made with ingredients other than oats have been eaten around the globe for thousands of years.Quinoa has been used in porridge for more than 3,000 years while in China, according to legend, rice porridge or congee has been eaten since 2500BC.According to Mr Hutton, oats have been a staple of the Scottish diet for so long their origins are "lost in the mists of time"."The oat crop was brought into Scotland possibly even [as far back as] Roman times, nobody really quite knows when."It was derived from natural grasses that probably originated somewhere like the Middle East but found in the cold, wet climate of Scotland a fairly ideal habitat."The important role of porridge in history was recently highlighted by academic Alistair Moffat, who claimed the invention of porridge changed the world.He suggested that feeding youngsters porridge allowed mothers to stop breastfeeding earlier, freeing them to bear more children, in turn increasing the world's population.Meanwhile some think that its health benefits could be exploited even more.Heidi Lanschuetzer, from Mintel says: "Given that the usage of porridge stands at half of all Brits, the hot cereals segment still offers strong potential for future growth in areas such as vitamin or mineral fortification or flavour innovation."At the World Porridge Championships, innovation is celebrated - and Dr Khan plans to introduce Eastern flavours."I'll be using cinnamon, cardamom seeds, ground, skinned almonds and pistachio for garnish," he says. "I'll be using French honey for the flavour."Author Guthrie Hutton is more of a traditionalist, preferring his to be served with water and salt.But he also recommends one other daily traditional taste of Scotland: "My recipe for long life is a bowl of porridge in the morning and a tot of whisky at night."Follow BBC Food on Pinterest and on twitter: @BBCFood</body>

      <title>'Digital baby' screen for sperm donors</title>
      <description>A service that digitally weaves together the DNA of prospective parents to check for potential disease in thousands of "virtual babies" is set to launch in the US by December.</description>

      <body>A service that digitally weaves together the DNA of prospective parents to check for potential disease in thousands of "virtual babies" is set to launch in the US by December.New York start-up Genepeeks will initially focus on donor sperm, simulating before pregnancy how the genetic sequence of a female client might combine with those of different males.Donors that more often produce "digital children" with a higher risk of inherited disorders will be filtered out, leaving those who are better genetic matches.Everything happens in a computer, but experts have raised ethical questions."We are just in the business right now of giving prospective mothers, who are using donor sperm to conceive, a filtered catalogue of donors based on their own underlying genetic profile," Genepeeks co-founder Anne Morriss told BBC News."We are filtering out the donor matches with an elevated risk of rare recessive paediatric conditions."Ms Morriss, an entrepreneur, gave a presentation on the company at the Consumer Genetics Conference in Boston last week.She was motivated in part by her own experience of starting a family. Her son was conceived with a sperm donor who happened to share with Morriss the gene for an inherited disorder called MCADD.MCADD (medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency) prevents those affected from converting fats to sugar. It can be fatal if it is not diagnosed early. Luckily, in Ms Morriss's case, the condition was picked up in newborn screening tests."My son has a pretty normal life," Ms Morriss said, "but about 30% of children with rare genetic diseases don't make it past the age of five."Genepeeks has formalised a partnership with a sperm bank - the Manhattan Cryobank - and has a patent pending on the DNA screening technology.The start-up benefits from the rapid pace of change in genetic technology.Indeed, six months ago, Genepeeks' founders decided it was able to use a superior system for DNA analysis (called "targeted exon sequencing") than the one originally envisaged - a result, says Anne Morriss, of falling costs and increased flexibility.For couples planning babies, other companies already screen one or both partners for genes that could cause disease if combined with a similar variant - so-called "carrier screening".One academic who studies the use of genetic technology commented: "This is like that, but ramped up 100,000 times."Ms Morriss's business partner, Prof Lee Silver, a geneticist and expert on bioethics at Princeton University, New Jersey, told BBC News: "We get the DNA sequence from two prospective parents. We simulate the process of reproduction, forming virtual sperm and virtual eggs. We put them together to form a hypothetical child genome."Then we can look at that hypothetical genome and - with all the tools of modern genetics - determine the risk that the genome will result in a child with disease. We're looking directly for disease and not carrier status. For each pair of people that we're going to analyse, we make 10,000 hypothetical children."The process will be run for the client and each potential donor one by one, scanning for some 600 known single-gene recessive conditions. In this way, the highest-risk pairings can be filtered out.Anne Morriss added: "At this stage our clients won't be receiving any genetic information back. We're very much focused on the practical utility of helping prospective parents who want to protect their future kids, giving them the option of additional analysis to what is currently being offered in the industry."But the company's founders have plans to expand the screening beyond single-gene recessive disorders to more complex conditions in which multiple genes play a part.Indeed, going to the trouble of simulating thousands of digital children deliberately lays the ground for this: "[It's] impossible to get towards an accurate risk calculation in any other way," said Anne Morriss.And in a video produced by the company, Prof Silver says: "My hope for the future is that any people who want to have a baby can use this technology to greatly reduce the risk of disease being expressed in their child."To some, such a prospect might appear like a step towards designer babies - until now the preserve of science fiction literature and films such as Gattaca, which envisaged a future of genetic "haves" and "have-nots".Bio-ethicists approached by the BBC said Genepeeks was a logical outcome of the increasing demand for more information when making reproductive decisions.However, some raised potential concerns about risk communication and the expansion of screening beyond rare single-gene disorders. But they suggested there were few, if any, regulatory barriers.One ethicist told BBC News: "The biggest question for me, just from the outset, is the understanding of uncertainty. Even people who have been doing genomics for years still have a hard time figuring out exactly what a risk for a particular genetic predisposition really means for a family."Gene-environment interactions can lead to people either having disease or not having disease."Dr Ewan Birney, associate director of the European Bioinformatics Institute in Hinxton, UK, echoed the point: "It's good that they're focusing on the carrier status of these rare Mendelian disorders where it's potentially more clear-cut. That said, these things are more complex than they first seem," he said."I'm sure the scientists appreciate that complexity. But when transmitting that complexity to everyday people, these things can sound more absolute than they really are."He added: "The thing I would want to stress here is just how complex this is. It's great that people are thinking of using this technology in lots of different ways, but our knowledge gap is very large."Risk communication to clients was, said Anne Morriss, "absolutely critical to anyone in this industry"."We have to be crystal clear about what we're testing for, what risks we're helping to reduce; that there's no guarantee you won't give birth to a sick child," she said.Prof Mildred Cho, associate director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics in California, raised questions over whether the sperm donor should also receive information about their genome gleaned from the screening process."Unlike hair colour, occupation or family history - those are things, presumably, the donor already knows - the thing that's different about this that I see is it could create information that the donor doesn't already have. It also has implications for the donor's other biological family members," Prof Cho told BBC News.This week it also emerged that California-based consumer genetics company 23andMe had submitted the patent on a DNA analysis tool for planning a child.Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter</body>

      <title>New shape-shifting metals discovered</title>
      <description>Scientists develop a new family of smart materials that could be used in applications ranging from space vehicles to electronics to jet engines.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24400101</url>
      <date>1380888037</date>
      <body>A new shape-changing metal crystal is reported in the journal Nature, by scientists at University of Minnesota.It is the prototype of a new family of smart materials that could be used in applications ranging from space vehicles to electronics to jet engines.Called a "martensite", the crystal has two different arrangements of atoms, switching seamlessly between them.It can change shape tens of thousands of times when heated and cooled without degrading, unlike existing technology.Currently, martensite metals are made of an alloyed mixture of nickel and titanium.They have the remarkable ability to "remember" their shape and even after being bent will return to their original form. For this, they are called "shape memory" metals.They have been used in spectacle frames and brassiere wires, but also in surgery as frameworks for shaping healing bones, and as "stents" for holding heart arteries open.Martensite metals change shape when heated or cooled through a certain temperature, when the atoms that make up their structure rearrange themselves in a sudden transformation.Some call this a "military transformation" because the rows of atoms that make up the metal crystal click into their new shape in an orderly manner.The transformation means that martensite can be used in smart mechanisms that respond to temperature change.Examples include automatic windows-openers in glasshouses, a means for automatically guiding solar panels to point at the Sun on the Hubble Space Telescope, and, very recently, in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to morph the trailing edge of the engine cowling, making it quieter when it runs hot on take-off.The pitfall of current martensites is that after repeated shape changes, they build up stresses inside that degrade them and eventually break them apart. The new alloy, made of a mixture of zinc, gold and copper, changes back and forth almost indefinitely with little internal damage, opening up a new range of applications for these types of "active materials".The aim is now to apply the lessons learned from the new metal to make a family of ceramic solids that can also be shape-switched back and forth."The real advance is to make the transformations reversible that could be applied in many situations" explains Prof Richard James, one of the authors of the study."You could make devices that convert heat to electricity directly. They could use the waste heat from computers and cell phones to recharge the battery and make them more efficient."As the material cycles through its different atomic arrangements, crystals can be seen at its surface in ever-changing patterns, looking like microscopic rivers.The structures fit together without any stress layers between them, and this seems to be the key to their longevity and potential.The new materials could also be used in improved and efficient microelectromechanical systems - energy harvesting devices, in which small vibrations can be converted directly into power.These sorts of gizmos are already used in tyre pressure-monitoring systems in cars to power the electronics in the sensors.</body>

      <title>Omani owl could be new species</title>
      <description>A team working on a bird call recording project in Oman says it has discovered a new species of owl in the region.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/24374313</url>
      <date>1380868987</date>
      <body>Ornithologists working in Oman say an owl discovered in a remote, mountainous region could be a new species.Wildlife sound-recordist Magnus Robb told BBC News that he heard the bird's call whilst trying to record the call of another type of owl.After repeated trips to the remote site, he and a colleague - naturalist and photographer Arnoud van den Berg - captured photographs of the bird.They have published their observations in the journal Dutch Birding.Mr Robb's first recordings of the bird's unfamiliar hoot were a serendipitous discovery in March of this year."I was listening through my headphones, when I suddenly heard something completely different [to the owl species I was there to record]," he told BBC News."I know the other Arabian owl sounds quite well, and this was clearly something that didn't fit."The bird call expert said he had a "good inkling straight away that this could be something new"."I even phoned a colleague a few minutes later and said, 'I think I've just discovered a new species of owl."Mr Robb, who is involved in an international project called the Sound Approach, which aims to catalogue and understand bird sound, analysed the owls' call in detail.This revealed that the bird was most likely to belong to a genus, or group of species, known as Strix.Dr Wesley Hochachka from Cornell University's lab of ornithology commented that, in the last few decades, it had become "more accepted by ornithologists, particularly in tropical areas, that new species are being discovered based on distinctively different vocalisations".The team plans to gather DNA evidence from the owl's feathers in order to confirm their find genetically.But Prof Ian Newton, a bird expert from the UK's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said he found the evidence that the team had already provided convincing."Based on the recordings of songs and calls and on the good-quality photographs, I was also convinced that it should be placed within the genus Strix, which also contains the Tawny Owl of Britain and Europe," he told BBC News.Mr Robb said he hoped eventually to name the new species the Omani owl, in honour of the Omani people."One of the reasons we've gone through this process of describing and confirming this as a new species so quickly is to get conservation for this owl as soon as possible," he explained to BBC News."Conservation can only start when this species is accepted and given some official status."He hopes to return to Oman later this year in to learn more about the owl, its habitat and its behaviour.So far, he and and his colleagues have found only seven of the birds in a single wadi in the remote, mountainous area of Oman."This suggests that it's a very rare creature indeed," he told BBC News.</body>

      <title>Pollution 'hampers bees' foraging'</title>
      <description>Honeybees' ability to find flowers could be hampered by a chemical in diesel exhaust, say scientists.</description>

      <body>Honeybees' ability to find flowers could be hampered by a chemical in diesel exhaust, say scientists.Tests showed that exhaust degraded some floral scent chemicals the bees "home in on" when they are foraging.The study, published in Scientific Reports, also revealed that a specific group of chemicals found in diesel exhaust, known as NOx, diminished the insects' response to floral scents.They say the results are evidence that air quality should be improved."We got into this, because we were aware of the impacts of airborne pollutants on human health, so it didn't seem so wild that there may be impacts that extended beyond human health," said University of Southampton neuroscientist Dr Tracey Newman, who was involved in the work.To drill down to the chemical effects of pollution on the pollinators, the researchers made a mixture of the volatile, or smelly, chemicals that make up the scent of oilseed rape.They then used a diesel-powered generator to create a mixture of air and exhaust that closely matched levels of exhaust found on a busy road, and mixed this lab-made air pollution with the floral scent mix."We saw that there was loss of two of the components [of the floral odour mixture]," Dr Newman said.The two odour chemicals that were "lost" had chemically reacted with a component of the diesel exhaust, mono-nitrogen oxide, known as NOx.Having worked out how the pollution affected the chemistry of floral scents, the team set out to discover if the bees were affected by this change."Bees need to decipher the chemical messages they're getting [from flowers] to be able to home in on the flowers they know will give the best yield [of nectar]," said Dr Newman.The pollinators, she said, learned to recognise the scents of nectar-rich flowers and this enabled them to forage more efficiently.The team carried out a test that involved teaching bees to associate the smell of a particular chemical with being given a drop of sugary liquid.Bees respond to the taste of the sugar by sticking out their tongues - just as they do when drinking nectar from a flower. So after a few trials where the scent of the odour is followed closely by a sweet drop of liquid, the bees stick out their tongues as soon as they detect the scent."Having trained a bunch of bees, we then tested to see if they would respond in the same way to the mixture that was depleted by exposure to NOx [the reactive chemical in diesel exhaust]," said Dr Newman.When these odour chemicals were degraded by NOx, the bees were much less responsive to their smell and would not stick out their tongues.Biologist and lead researcher Dr Guy Poppy added that the airborne pollution appeared to be interfering with "the complex relationship" that had evolved between plants and animals."Flowers have evolved to produce chemical mixtures that attract pollinators," he told BBC News.Dr Newman added that the study highlighted the need to reduce pollution and improve air quality, in order to protect pollinating insects as well as improve human health.The value to food production of so-called "pollination services" is estimated to be hundreds of millions of pounds per year in the UK alone.Prof James Nieh, who studies honeybee health and behaviour at the University of California San Diego, said that the research posed a "largely unexplored question"."Most research on such contaminants has focused on pesticides," he told BBC News."But bees are subject to a much wider variety of pollutants and contaminants. The influence and potential synergy of these pollutants with pesticides should be studied."</body>

      <title>Uncertainty hampering food security</title>
      <description>More than 600 scientists from around the world have gathered in the Netherlands for a food security conference, described as the first of its kind.</description>

      <body>More than 600 scientists gathered in the Netherlands for a global food security conference, described as the first of its kind.Organisers said science could help end uncertainty surrounding efforts to meet the food needs of future generations.They added that, until now, there were many policy debates on food security but there was no scientific forum for researchers to share knowledge.The next food security conference will be held in the US in 2015."A really key message from the conference for us is that we have got lots of estimates about needs of population growth etc, but at the moment we are so uncertain of the exact numbers - the uncertainty is really very high," said conference co-chairman Ken Giller, professor of plant production systems at Wageningen University."We talk about the current population being seven billion, moving to 9.2 billion in 2050 and the estimate is that we need to increase production 70% or more."But there are many different ways of addressing that. If we don't know what the problem is then we can't get started in addressing them."Appetite for changeProf Giller said there was "unprecedented interest" among the scientific community when details of the conference was first announced."We did anticipate about 250-300 people , but we actually ended up with more than 900 abstracts being submitted," he told BBC News."The conference was basically sold out - we had 600 people and that was all we could accommodate."He explained that the conference was designed to create a forum where representatives from the different branches of science could come together and discuss and debate the issues of global food security."We pulled together a science committee with the real aim to make the conference broad and to include all the main disciplines," he said."We had people on the science committee from economics, nutrition and we had people dealing with food waste, which is a very important topical issue."Prof Giller said that current estimates suggested that 30-40% of the food produced was wasted and not eaten.Other themes that were discussed at the conference included:The organisers hope that the outcomes from the four-day event in Noordwijkerhout, South Holland, will help focus the scientific world's contribution to the UN global policy system.One of the UN's eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) was to "eradicate extreme poverty and hunger" by 2015, which included the target of halving - between 1990 and 2015 - the proportion of people suffering from hunger.Assessments suggest the target is "within reach". However, a 2013 report on the progress of the MDGs warned that one in eight people remained chronically undernourished.UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has announced that he wants to build on the MDGs, replacing them with a suite of Sustainable Development Goals that will run from 2015-2030.He said one of his priorities was to "adopt globally agreed goals for food and nutrition security, mobilise all key stakeholders to provide support to smallholder farmers and food processors and bolster the resilience of communities and nations experiencing periodic food crises".Prof Giller said this presented a "wonderful opportunity for science to get directly engaged in policies and help advise governments".</body>

      <title>Worker error causes Fukushima leak</title>
      <description>Japan's crippled Fukushima nuclear plant has a new leak of radioactive water after workers overfilled a storage tank, its operator says.</description>

      <body>Japan's crippled Fukushima nuclear plant has a new leak of radioactive water after workers overfilled a storage tank, its operator says.The workers miscalculated the tank's capacity as it was tilted on unlevel ground, plant operator Tepco said.It said around 430 litres (100 gallons) of water may have leaked from the tank, and could have flowed into the sea.The plant has experienced several leaks since being crippled by an earthquake and tsunami in 2011.One of the largest leaks took place in August, when Tepco discovered a leak of at least 300 tonnes of highly radioactive water at a different part of the plant.The latest leak was discovered by workers late on Wednesday.Tepco official Masayuki Ono said: "We would like to apologise that we have to announce that we've had another leak in our tanks today.""This is partly because we've had to fill our tanks to the brim in order to deal with the difficult management of rain water overflow following [a typhoon]," he added.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said that Tepco had failed to deal with the leaks successfully."It's actually leaking so of course we can't say that [Tepco] have been properly dealing with the issue. It should not be leaking at all," he said.The 2011 disaster knocked out cooling systems to the nuclear plant's reactors, three of which melted down.Water is now being pumped in to cool the reactors, but storing the resultant large quantities of radioactive water has proved a challenge for Tepco.In September, the government said it would invest hundreds of millions of dollars into building a frozen wall around the plant to stop the leaks.</body>

      <body>The felling of diseased trees across an area the size of around 300 football pitches is taking place at Wales' largest ancient woodland.Larch trees at Wentwood Forest, near Newport, have become infected with the fungal disease Phytophthora ramorum.The infection can kill trees and has spread across the UK after being found in south west England four years ago.The Woodland Trust, which owns most of the forest, said the felling of the trees was essential."This is the most serious and devastating action we've had to take on our estate," said the trust's head of woodland management, Andrew Sharkey."It again highlights both the need to tackle tree disease and the importance of restoring as much of our damaged ancient woodland to make it more resilient in decades to come."Felling the infected conifers across an area of 200 hectares (500 acres) will leave the Woodland Trust with a £35,000 bill for replanting in the forest.It also hits restoration work that has been taking place since the trust bought 352 hectares (869 acres) of Wentwood in 2006."Our aim was to prevent clear felling at Wentwood from happening. However, there is no alternative," explained Rory Francis, also from the trust."We are hoping that the action will slow down the spread of the infection or perhaps halt it."Wentwood Forest is the remains of the ancient tree cover that stretched from the River Wye to the River Usk.Conifers were first introduced to the wood in 1880, and much of the forest cleared to provide timber for trenches in World War I.When it was replanted in the 1950s and 1960s, the once abundant broadleaf trees were replaced with imported conifers, ultimately damaging the forest floor and its natural formation.The forest is spread out over 400 hectares (1,000 acres) and is home to 75 species of birds, including turtle doves, nightjars and spotted flycatchers, and is a habitat for dormice, otters, and pipistrelle bats.It is also a home to wild bluebells, wood sorrel and wild daffodils."Every time you have to clear-fell, the risk is that the shock of the sudden change in conditions stresses some of the native species and they could be lost," said Mr Francis."So in the short term, it will have a negative impact. We don't want to do it but it is a legal requirement."Natural Resources Wales (NRW), which manages most of the remaining forest, said it had already invested £500,000 across Wales to halt the spread of the infection, and was setting aside another £2m to tackle the problem.The disease has recently been discovered at Bwlch Nant-yr-Arian near Aberystwyth and at Cwmcarn Forest Drive in Caerphilly county borough.The infection has also spread to parts of north Wales, at Coed Maentwrog near Porthmadog, and at Coed Cymerau near Blaenau Ffestiniog.It has also affected larches across south west England, Northern Ireland and the west of Scotland."The felling in Wentwood Forest is very sad but this prompt action by the Woodland Trust is essential to try to slow the spread of this devastating disease," said John Browne, from NRW."Our ultimate aim is to make our forests more resilient to pests and diseases and we are heartened that the Woodland Trust is to seize this opportunity to undertake change of structure and species within Wentwood Forest by planting native broadleaves."The felled larch trees will be replaced with a mix of oak and cherry trees, and other broadleaf native trees."In some ways it will actually accelerate the work to plant native trees, but it is not in the circumstances we would have preferred," added the trust's Mr Francis.</body>

      <title>Top five physics discoveries chosen</title>
      <description>Quantum computers and science that could enable mobile phone shoe chargers are among the top physics spin-offs chosen by a leading magazine.</description>

      <body>Five physics discoveries with the potential to transform the world have been selected by a leading science magazine for its 25th birthday issue.Quantum computing and science that could enable shoes to charge a mobile phone are among the list compiled by Physics World.A potential new tumour treatment called hadron therapy and the "wonder-material" graphene also feature.The magazine also picked its top five breakthroughs of the last 25 years.In all, the publication compiled five lists of five to examine different aspects of physics.Graphene has been one of the most talked-about discoveries in the last decade.Its strength, flexibility and conductivity make it a potentially ideal material for bendable smartphones and superior prosthetic limbs.But graphene has another, less-heralded property which could help it transform the everyday lives of people around the world.Despite being just one atom thick, it is impervious to almost all liquids and gases.Generating holes in sheets of graphene could therefore create a selective membrane - "the ultimate water purifier" - which might someday create drinking water from the sea."Predicting the future is a mug's game. Of course, we expect to get a few of them wrong," Hamish Johnston, editor of physicsworld.com told BBC News."Grandiose, utopian predictions that never materialise always look faintly ridiculous in years to come - have you seen anyone recently flying to work on a nuclear-powered jet-pack?"Physics World is the monthly magazine of the Institute of Physics and was first published in October 1988.Selecting the five most important breakthroughs of its lifetime was "harder than choosing Nobel laureates", according to reporter Tushna Commissariat."There have been so many eye-popping findings that our final choice is, inevitably, open to debate," she wrote."Yet for us, these five discoveries stand out above all others as having done the most to transform our understanding of the world."They are, in chronological order:The magazine's 25th anniversary issue also highlights five images that have allowed us to "see" a physical phenomenon or effect.They range from the microscopic - electrons on a copper crystal - to the enormous - the Cat's Eye Nebula, as photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope.The list of five "biggest unanswered questions" features some eternal riddles - "is life on Earth unique?" Another is: "what exactly is time?"The final top five is a set of "fiendish physics-themed puzzles" devised by the British signals intelligence agency GCHQ.The first has already appeared online - a jumbled set of letters on a page which need to be deciphered before arriving at a physics-themed answer.A similar puzzle was recently used by GCHQ to attract potential employees.It will be followed by another four problems, one per week throughout October, which will become progressively more challenging."We think the puzzles are going to really stretch even the brightest minds," says Matin Durrani, editor of Physics World."You won't need any physics to solve them, but they are certainly going to make you think and they're a fun way to celebrate our 25th anniversary."I also hope our top fives in the birthday issue will remind everyone just how vital, enjoyable and interesting physics can be."</body>

      <title>Health of oceans 'declining fast'</title>
      <description>The health of the world’s oceans is deteriorating even faster than scientists previously thought, a report says.</description>

      <date>1380777580</date>
      <body>The health of the world’s oceans is deteriorating even faster than had previously been thought, a report says.A review from the International Programme on the State of the Ocean (IPSO), warns that the oceans are facing multiple threats.They are being heated by climate change, turned slowly less alkaline by absorbing CO2, and suffering from overfishing and pollution.The report warns that dead zones formed by fertiliser run-off are a problem.It says conditions are ripe for the sort of mass extinction event that has afflicted the oceans in the past.It says: “We have been taking the ocean for granted. It has been shielding us from the worst effects of accelerating climate change by absorbing excess CO2 from the atmosphere.“Whilst terrestrial temperature increases may be experiencing a pause, the ocean continues to warm regardless. For the most part, however, the public and policymakers are failing to recognise - or choosing to ignore - the severity of the situation.”It says the cocktail of threats facing the ocean is more powerful than the individual problems themselves.Coral reefs, for instance, are suffering from the higher temperatures and the effects of acidification whilst also being weakened by bad fishing practices, pollution, siltation and toxic algal blooms.IPSO, funded by charitable foundations, is publishing a set of five papers based on workshops in 2011 and 2012 in partnership with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN’s) World Commission on Protected Areas.The reports call for world governments to halt CO2 increase at 450ppm. Any higher, they say, will cause massive acidification later in the century as the CO2 is absorbed into the sea.It urges much more focused fisheries management, and a priority list for tackling the key groups of chemicals that cause most harm.It wants the governments to negotiate a new agreement for the sustainable fishing in the high oceans to be policed by a new global high seas enforcement agency.The IUCN’s Prof Dan Laffoley said: "What these latest reports make absolutely clear is that deferring action will increase costs in the future and lead to even greater, perhaps irreversible, losses."The UN climate report confirmed that the ocean is bearing the brunt of human-induced changes to our planet. These findings give us more cause for alarm – but also a roadmap for action. We must use it."The co-coordinator, Prof Alex Rogers from Oxford University has been asked to advise the UN's own oceans assessment but he told BBC News he had led the IPSO initiative because: "It’s important to have something which is completely independent in any way from state influence and to say things which experts in the field felt was really needed to be said."He said concern had grown over the past year thanks to papers signalling that past extinctions had involved warming seas, acidification and low oxygen levels. All are on the rise today.He agreed there was debate on whether fisheries are recovering by better management following examples in the US and Europe, but said it seemed clear that globally they were not.He also admitted a debate about whether overall climate change would increase the amount of fish produced in the sea. Melting sea ice would increase fisheries near the poles whilst stratification of warmer waters in the tropics would reduce mixing of nutrients and lead to lower production, he said.He said dead zones globally appeared to be increasing although this may reflect increased reporting."On ocean acidification, we are seeing effects that no-one predicted like the inability of fish to detect their environments properly. It’s clear that it will affect many species. We really do have to get a grip on what’s going on in the oceans," he said.Follow Roger on Twitter</body>

      <title>UK nuclear plant deal 'within weeks'</title>
      <description>A contract to build the UK's first nuclear plant in a generation is "within weeks" of completion, Energy Minister Michael Fallon tells the Financial Times.</description>

      <body>A contract to build the UK's first nuclear plant in a generation is said to be "within weeks" of completion.Energy Minister Michael Fallon told the Financial Times he was "working intensely" to seal a deal for the £14bn Hinkley Point C reactor in Somerset.Long negotiations have taken place with France's EDF over the price it could charge for the electricity generated.Government approval to build the first in a planned set of new nuclear sites in the UK was granted in March."We're not quite there yet, but I hope we will be in the next few weeks," Mr Fallon told the FT.Talks between EDF and the government to agree on a contract stalled earlier this year over the guaranteed price at which the electricity could be sold.China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group has a co-operation agreement with EDF and could claim a stake of up to 49% in the project, the FT reports.The government's plan to meet its emissions reduction and renewable energy targets were outlined in last year's Energy Bill.It hopes the UK can become more self-sufficient in its energy by increasing the use of both nuclear and wind power, as well as other forms of clean sources such as biomass.He suggested the deal with EDF, which has not commented on the reports, would pave the way for further negotiations on new nuclear plants planned by Japan's Hitachi in Anglesey and Oldbury, in Gloucestershire.There is also said to be interest in further investment in the UK's nuclear sector from companies in South Korea, China and Japan.Mr Fallon said: "There's intense interest there because people can see that finally we're getting our civil nuclear programme moving again after the long, dead Labour years."However, environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth have raised concerns over the potentially high price for electricity the government will agree to in order to get the new plants built, and the issue of nuclear waste.Hinkley Point C will be the third nuclear plant at the Somerset site and will have the potential to provide power for five million homes.Hinkley A, which is now being decommissioned, began generating in 1965 and was closed down in 1999. Hinkley B, which started generating in 1976, is due to be turned off in 2023.The last nuclear plant built in the UK was Sizewell B in Suffolk, completed in 1995.</body>

      <title>Roman skulls washed down lost river</title>
      <description>Archaeologists working with London's Crossrail project uncover 20 skulls believed to be from the Roman period.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24351460</url>
      <date>1380677812</date>
      <body>Archaeologists working with London's Crossrail project have uncovered 20 skulls believed to be from the Roman period.It is likely the bones were washed from a nearby burial site along one of London's "lost" rivers - the Walbrook.In the last year archaeologists in London have also found about 10,000 Roman items at a nearby site.These latest finds could give new insights into the lives of Roman people.Near-intact pottery artefacts were also found which probably travelled along the same route as the skulls. Other bone fragments would not have been washed as easily down the river.Paved over in the 15th Century, the Walbrook river divided the western and eastern parts of the city, its moist muddy walls providing exceptionally good conditions for artefacts to be preserved.The discoveries were found about 3m below ground and underneath the the Bedlam cemetery, a burial ground where hundreds of skeletons have been unearthed.Though they have yet to be forensically dated, Nicholas Elsden from the Museum of London Archaeology said they were likely to be from the 3rd to 4th Centuries AD, as that was when Romans buried their citizens as opposed to cremating them."It's relatively unusual to find so many concentrated [in one area] when you're not in a graveyard. We're 100 yards outside the Roman city walls."Roman law required burial outside the city, explained Mr Elsden, which meant there were burial sites circled around the town."What we're looking at here is how the Romans viewed their dead. You wouldn't imagine modern burial grounds being allowed to wash out into a river," he told BBC News.Don Walker, an osteologist also from the Museum of London Archaeology, said the skulls were probably buried in different environments, shown by their shades of brown and grey."Forensic studies show that when the body disintegrates near a watercourse, the skull travels furthest, either because it floats or it can roll along the base of the river."They were possibly buried in an area where there wasn't much land available. At the moment it looks as though they've collected together through natural processes."From initial observations, Mr Walker said there was no evidence of any "foul play", but details about their sex and age would only emerge through further investigations.He added that chemical markers on the teeth could reveal where these people came from and what sorts of food they ate.Archaeologists believe that the Crossrail Project will lead to further discoveries hidden beneath the streets of London and say it could transform our understanding of Roman London.Other recent findings include several bodies believed to date from the time of the Black Death and wood thought to be evidence of a 3,500-year-old Bronze Age transport route through London.Crossrail currently operates over 40 worksites and archaeological investigations are carried out at each site ahead of main construction works to build the central stations.The project will connect 37 stations from Heathrow Airport and Maidenhead in the west, through central London and out to Abbey Wood and Shenfield in the east and is due to be completed in 2018.</body>

      <title>Body clock 'reset button' found</title>
      <description>The prospect of drugs to rapidly reset the body clock to avoid jet lag and the pains of shift work has moved a step close after research in Japan.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24387491</url>
      <date>1380823371</date>
      <body>Drugs that rapidly tweak the body clock in order to avoid jet lag and the pains of shift work have moved a step closer after research in Japan.The team at Kyoto University has found the clock's 'reset button' inside the brain.Their study, published in the journal Science, showed the button could be used to switch the clock to a new time zone in a single day.Experts said the team was "close to the money" in the hunt for a jet lag cure.There are clocks throughout the body and a "master clock" in the brain, keeping the body in sync with the world around it to make people sleepy at night.Anyone who has ever done shift work or a long-haul flight has experienced the disrupted sleep and hunger patterns of a body clock which is out of tune with the rising and setting of the sun.The clock uses light to help keep track of time, but it is naturally stubborn and adjusts slowly.The rough rule is that for every time zone crossed it takes a full day for the body to catch up. Fly from London to Beijing and it would take a week for the body clock to fully adapt.The team in Japan have come up with a way to get the master clock to be a bit more flexible.It is a group of 10,000 brain cells - about the same size as a grain of rice - which constantly talk to each other to keep a strict control over the time.The scientists found that interfering with the vasopressin receptors, essentially a brain cell's ears that allow it to keep in touch with its neighbours, let the clock shift rapidly.Genetically modified mice which had no vasopressin receptors were able to adjust to the clocks being put back eight hours within a single day, while normal mice took six days.When the clocks were put forward eight hours then it took normal mice eight days to adapt, but those without vasopressin receptors adjusted in two.Similar results were then achieved in normal mice using a drug.The study's authors concluded: "Studies have shown that chronic jet lag and rotating shift work can increase an individual's risk of developing hypertension, obesity, and other metabolic disorders."Our results identify vasopressin signalling as a possible therapeutic target for the management of circadian rhythm [body clock] misalignment."Dr Michael Hastings, a Medical Research Council body clock researcher, told the BBC's Science in Action programme: "It's a remarkable study, it really is very exciting for our field."There's been many false dawns when it comes to a cure for jet lag, but I think this time they're close to the money."However, he cautioned that vasopressin receptors were also heavily involved in kidney function so any drug developed would need to be designed carefully to target the body clock without disrupting the kidneys.Dr Hastings added that with an increasingly 24-7 society a drug which can adjust the body clock could, in theory, improve the health of shift workers."The issue here in terms of public health is rotational shift work, the epidemiological evidence that we have now shows that if a worker has spent a working life doing rotational shift work they're at higher risk of contracting certain forms of cancer, cardiovascular disease or metabolic syndrome like diabetes."</body>

      <title>Supervolcanoes ripped up early Mars</title>
      <description>Early Mars may have been wracked by giant explosive volcanoes that spewed billions upon billions of tonnes of rock and ash into the sky.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24348673</url>
      <date>1380733767</date>
      <body>Mars may have had giant explosive volcanoes in its ancient past that spewed billions upon billions of tonnes of rock and ash into the sky.Vast areas of collapsed ground in a region of the planet called Arabia Terra are their likely remains, believe Joe Michalski and Jacob Bleacher.The two scientists report their findings in this week's Nature journal.They say such supervolcanoes would have had a profound impact on the early evolution of Mars.Their gases would have influenced the make-up of the atmosphere and perturbed the climate. And the ashfall would have covered the landscape across great swathes of the planet. It is quite likely some of the deposits the rovers are now encountering on Mars have their origin in colossal blasts."Scientists know the planet must have been more active in its deep past, in its first billion years. But we've always struggled to find evidence for these early volcanoes. The supervolcanoes we report in Nature may solve this puzzle," said Dr Michalski, who is affiliated to the Natural History Museum in London, and the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona.Supervolcano is an informal term to describe an immense eruptive event that expels in excess of a 1,000 cu km of rock and ash.Earth has experienced this type of cataclysm numerous times, although not for many thousands of years. The US Yellowstone National Park, for example, sits on top of a past supervolcano.But these behemoths are not so straightforward to identify.Unlike, familiar volcanoes - such as Etna or St Helens on Earth, or indeed Olympus Mons on Mars - supervolcanoes do not build mountains out of layers of lava. Rather, their great scale means that, when they erupt, the whole landscape lets go with multiple vents and fissures. And after the eruption, the ground will fall back into the void left by all the ejected material, producing a large bowl or caldera.Michalski and Bleacher, from Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center, have identified a number of potential supervolcanoes in an area of Mars's northern hemisphere known as Arabia Terra. It is assumed to be one of the oldest terrains on the planet.The researchers say their calderas are unlikely to be old meteorite impacts sites because they are irregular in shape, and lack the raised rim and central peak often found at impact craters. Neither do they have an apron of ejected material, another classic impact trait."Our best example is Eden Patera," Dr Michalski told the BBC's Science In Action programme."Thousands of cubic kilometres of material would have been erupted, and that's a minimum. In terms of size, it would be very similar to Yellowstone - about 70km across. So, imagine driving for an hour; it would take you most of that time to get across this hole in the ground."The supervolcanoes' gases would certainly have influenced the composition of the early atmosphere and the evolution of the climate thereafter. But they may also have had an impact on Mars' potential for habitability, by pulling up substantial quantities of water and the essential elements needed for life from deep inside the planet.These are ideas that can be tested by Nasa's Curiosity rover, which is heading for a large mountain in the middle of Gale Crater on Mars' equator.No-one knows how this mountain formed, but some fraction of its layers may well be ashfall, possibly from the Arabia Terra supervolcanoes; and if not these particular volcanoes then perhaps other giants that have yet to be identified in satellite images."If future work shows that supervolcanoes were present more widely on ancient Mars, it would completely change estimates of how the atmosphere formed from volcanic gases, how sediments formed from volcanic ash and how habitable the surface might have been," emphasised Dr Michalski.Commenting on the research, Mars expert Dr Peter Grindrod, from Birkbeck, University of London, said: "Understanding ancient terrains on Earth is extremely difficult because of subsequent processes hiding or removing the evidence - attempting to understand the earliest periods of Mars' history is even more challenging, as in addition we are limited to data returned from spacecraft."However, this study is a fascinating example of just what can be achieved with data from recent missions. This study is important because, if correct, it not only tells us something about Mars' early geological history, but can also help explain the source of later sedimentary deposits, many of which are important in studies of habitability on Mars."And planetary geologist Dr Dave Rothery, from the Open University, proffered: "It is entirely plausible that the few, slightly anomalous, large craters that Michalski and Bleacher have highlighted are volcanic rather than impact craters. If so, then their size would suggest that they could well have erupted in the style of supervolcanoes on Earth."We know that such eruptions have had profound but short-lived effects on the Earth's climate."Were such an event to happen on Mars, it could either cool the globe (because of a global ash and aerosol cloud) or warm it (because of erupted greenhouse gases). The latter could lead to episodes of surface water flow, responsible for carving some of the medium-size valley systems on Mars."Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos</body>

      <title>Plastic ingredient spied on Titan</title>

      <body>The Cassini probe has detected propene, or propylene, on Saturn's moon Titan.On Earth, this molecule, which comprises three carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms, is a constituent of many plastics.It is the first definitive detection of the plastic ingredient on any moon or planet, other than our home world, says the US space agency (Nasa).The discovery, made by Cassini's infrared spectrometer, is reported in Astrophysical Journal Letters."This chemical is all around us in everyday life, strung together in long chains to form a plastic called polypropylene," said Conor Nixon, a Nasa planetary scientist from the agency's Goddard Space Flight Center. A classic example would be the plastic boxes used to store food in kitchens worldwide.Titan is dominated by hydrocarbons - principally methane, which after nitrogen is the most common component of the atmosphere.Sunlight drives reactions that break apart the methane, allowing the fragments to join up and form even bigger molecules.Other common species seen at the moon as a result are propane, which on Earth is used in portable cooking equipment, and ethane, which is the raw material for another ubiquitous plastic - polyethylene.But the likes of methane, propene, propane and ethane are dwarfed by some truly colossal hydrocarbons that have been detected in Titan's atmosphere.When the effects of ultraviolet light are combined with the bombardment from particles driven in Saturn's magnetic field, it becomes possible to cook up some very exotic chemistry.Cassini's plasma spectrometer has seen evidence for hydrocarbons with an atomic mass thousands of times heavier than a single hydrogen atom.</body>

      <title>Cygnus freighter reaches station</title>
      <description>The new Cygnus cargo ship arrives at the International Space Station carrying about 700kg of food and other supplies for the platform's astronauts.</description>

      <body>The new Cygnus freighter has arrived at the International Space Station (ISS) carrying about 700kg (1,500lb) of food and other supplies.Astronauts on the platform reached out with a robotic arm and grabbed the vessel at 11:00 GMT.Cygnus is on a demonstration mission to prove its technology.It is one of two commercial ventures seeded by Nasa to pick up America's ISS re-supply requirements following the retirement of the space shuttles.The new vehicle, developed by the Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC), made its approach using a mix of GPS, inertial navigation and lidar.It parked itself a little over 10m under the station, within reach of the Canadarm2.Operated by astronauts Italian Luca Parmitano and American Karen Nyberg, the robotic limb then grappled the freighter, pulling it into the ISS's Harmony module.Capture - the securing of bolts mating Cygnus to Harmony - occurred at 1244 GMT, when the ISS was moving over the Indian Ocean.Cygnus has arrived at the station a week later than planned after an initial attempt last Sunday encountered software problems.This left the freighter unable to establish the correct communications and navigation links with the space station.Cygnus was commanded to loiter more than 2,000km from the ISS while engineers developed, tested and uploaded a patch. The arrival mid-week of a new crew at the station then pushed the second berthing attempt back even further.Astronauts will wait a day before entering the freighter to start removing its stores.The current schedule calls for Cygnus to stay at the platform for about a month, after which it will be sent into a destructive dive into the atmosphere.Nasa is attempting to hand over routine human spaceflight operations in low-Earth orbit to commercial industry, in a way similar to how some large organisations contract out their IT or payroll.The carriage of freight is the first service to be bought in from external suppliers; the transport of astronauts to and from the station will be the second, later this decade.The US space agency hopes these arrangements will save it money that can then be invested in exploration missions far beyond Earth, to destinations such as asteroids and Mars.To this end, it offered Orbital a series of incentive payments to help it develop a cargo-delivery system, with the carrot of a bumper, eight-flight, $1.9bn (£1.2bn) operational contract once it was up and working.Nasa has also seeded California's SpaceX company in the development of its Dragon capsule. This vehicle has already completed two missions in a 12-flight, $1.6bn contract.Cygnus has significant European involvement. The pressurised vessel that holds the cargo is produced in Turin, Italy, by Thales Alenia Space (TAS).Its design is based on the logistics modules that TAS produced for the space shuttles when the orbiters ran cargo deliveries to the station.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos</body>

      <title>Distant planet's clouds are mapped</title>
      <description>Astronomers have created the first map of the clouds on a planet outside our Solar System.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24348024</url>
      <date>1380624354</date>
      <body>Astronomers have created the first map of the clouds on a planet outside our Solar System.The planet in question is Kepler-7b, a large gaseous world like Jupiter, roughly 1,000 light-years away.The researchers used data from Nasa's Spitzer and Kepler space telescopes to study the exoplanet, which orbits close to its parent star.Their results suggest the hot giant is marked by high clouds in the west and clear skies in the east.The findings have been accepted for publication in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters."By observing this planet with Spitzer and Kepler for more than three years, we were able to produce a very low-resolution 'map' of this giant, gaseous planet," said co-author Brice-Olivier Demory of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, US."We wouldn't expect to see oceans or continents on this type of world, but we detected a clear, reflective signature that we interpreted as clouds."Astronomers have previously been able to make temperature maps of planets orbiting other stars, but this is the first look at cloud structures on a distant world. Kepler-7b is something of an oddity - bigger than Jupiter, but lower in mass - with a density about the same as polystyrene.The Kepler telescope's visible-light observations of this distant world's moon-like phases led to a rough map of the planet that showed a bright spot on its western hemisphere. But these data were not enough on their own to decipher whether the bright spot was coming from clouds or heat.So the team used Spitzer to gather further clues about the planet's atmosphere. They determined that light from the planet's star was bouncing off cloud tops located on the west side of Kepler-7b."Kepler-7b reflects much more light than most giant planets we've found, which we attribute to clouds in the upper atmosphere," said Thomas Barclay from Nasa's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, US, who works on the Kepler telescope team."Unlike those on Earth, the cloud patterns on this planet do not seem to change much over time - it has a remarkably stable climate."Nasa says the findings are an early step towards using similar techniques to study the atmospheres of exoplanets that are more like Earth in composition and size.Paul Hertz, director of Nasa's astrophysics division in Washington DC commented: "We're at a point now in exoplanet science where we are moving beyond just detecting [them], and into the exciting science of understanding them."The Kepler mission has now ended because of problems with the spacecraft's reaction wheels - the spinning components that aid fine-pointing of the satellite. But astronomers are still studying the data it gathered; the mission has so far discovered more than 150 bona fide exoplanets and thousands of other candidate worlds.</body>

      <title>Turbines 'threaten' Dark Sky Park</title>
      <description>Astronomers and land charities warn that Britain's only Dark Sky Park is being threatened by applications for wind turbines.</description>

      <date>1380501539</date>
      <body>Astronomers and land charities have warned that Britain's only Dark Sky Park is being threatened by applications for wind turbines.Galloway Forest Dark Sky Park secured its status in 2009.But the Astronomer Royal for Scotland, the John Muir Trust and the Scottish Wild Land Group have written to the Scottish government, asking it to rule out wind farms in the vicinity.There have been nine proposals for turbines near the park's observatory.These include plans from energy companies such as E.ON and RWE npower renewables, among others.Mark Gibson, chairman of the board of trustees of the Scottish Dark Sky Observatory, said that while some applications had been rejected, having one approved could open the door for further development.Ministry of Defence and Aviation Authority safety requirements mean that wind turbines must be illuminated by infra-red light and, in some areas used regularly for training or search and rescue, visible light illumination may also be needed.Turbines near the park could fall into the latter category, and the campaigners said it would affect both the ability of astronomers to use sensitive equipment, and the visibility of stars, galaxies, comets and northern lights.The group has called for the park to be given protection similar to that afforded to areas of wild land, and has called on the Scottish government to update planning policy to rule out the construction of wind farms around the park.The facility is the only Dark Sky Park in Britain - although both Exmoor and the Brecon Beacons national parks have been awarded Dark Sky Reserve status - and is home to the world's only publicly accessible, research-grade observatory within a Gold Tier Dark Sky Park.The observatory was officially opened by First Minister Alex Salmond last year.Prof John Brown, Astronomer Royal for Scotland, said: "Installing any large structures that require illumination (whether visible or infra-red) would be akin to putting a factory in Glen Coe or electricity pylons along the Cuillin Ridge."Our first minister was instrumental in helping to secure funding for the observatory and he opened it with much passion and aplomb in October last, praising Scotland for leading the world with this fine public and educational facility."But Mr Salmond is also an ardent advocate of wind farms and so faces a dilemma."I, for one, would call upon him now to prove his sincere interest in our wild lands and skies by ensuring wind farms and other dark sky contaminants are excluded from the entire Galloway Forest Dark Sky Park."This would lay down a benchmark for future decisions on all similar wild land sites where wind farms are wholly inappropriate."However, Jeremy Sainsbury of the renewable energy consultancy, Natural Power, said studies had shown that the type of beacons used did not contribute in any significant way to light pollution."This is low level background infra-red - visible to pilots but it does not penetrate the upper atmosphere," he said."It only stays within the clutter of the lower atmosphere so is very, very localised to wind turbines."He said wind farm and studies had confirmed this to be the case.A Scottish government spokesman said: "The Scottish government consulted on the draft Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) earlier this year."It included proposals to guide local authorities in the preparation of spatial frameworks for wind energy development."We received a large number of responses to the consultation, including many views on onshore wind, and will take these responses into account when we publish the finalised SPP next year."</body>

      <title>Mystery eruption traced to Indonesia</title>
      <description>Scientists think they have found the volcano responsible for a huge eruption in the 13th Century that perturbed the climate worldwide.</description>

      <date>1380571177</date>
      <body>Scientists think they have found the volcano responsible for a huge eruption that occurred in the 13th Century.The mystery event in 1257 was so large its chemical signature is recorded in the ice of both the Arctic and the Antarctic.European medieval texts talk of a sudden cooling of the climate, and of failed harvests.In the PNAS journal, an international team points the finger at the Samalas Volcano on Lombok Island, Indonesia.Little remains of the original mountain structure - just a huge crater lake.The team has tied sulphur and dust traces in the polar ice to a swathe of data gathered in the Lombok region itself, including radiocarbon dates, the type and spread of ejected rock and ash, tree-rings, and even local chronicles that recall the fall of the Lombok Kingdom sometime in the 13th Century."The evidence is very strong and compelling," Prof Clive Oppenheimer, from Cambridge University, UK, told the BBC's Science In Action programme.Co-worker Prof Franck Lavigne, from the Pantheon-Sorbonne University, France, added: "We conducted something similar to a criminal investigation."We didn't know the culprit at first, but we had the time of the murder and the fingerprints in the form of the geochemistry in the ice cores, and that allowed us to track down the volcano responsible."The 1257 eruption has been variously linked with volcanoes in Mexico, Ecuador and New Zealand.But these candidates fail on their dating or geochemistry, the researchers say. Only Samalas can "tick all the boxes".The team's studies on Lombok indicate that as much 40 cubic kilometres (10 cubic miles) of rock and ash could have been hurled from the volcano, and that the finest material in the eruption plume would likely have climbed 40km (25 miles) or more into the sky.It would have had to be this big in order for material to be carried across the entire globe in the quantities seen in the Greenland and Antarctic ice layers.The impact on the climate would have been significant.Medieval texts describe atrocious weather the following summer in 1258. It was cold, and the rain was unrelenting, leading to flooding.Archaeologists recently put a date of 1258 on the skeletons of thousands of people who were buried in mass graves in London."We cannot say for sure these two events are linked but the populations would definitely have been stressed," Prof Lavigne told BBC News.In comparison with recent catastrophic blasts, Samalas was at least as big as Krakatoa (1883) and Tambora (1815), the researchers believe.The ice cores do hold clues to yet another colossal event in about 1809, but, like Samalas before it, finding the source volcano has been difficult.Prof Oppenheimer said: "It's outstanding that we haven't come across evidence for it. Where in the world could you bury such bad news?"Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos</body>

      <title>Baby born after ovaries 'reawakened'</title>
      <description>Doctors say they have made a breakthrough in helping women who had a very early menopause to have children, with one baby born and another expected.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24332772</url>
      <date>1380569780</date>
      <body>A baby has been born through a new technique to "reawaken" the ovaries of women who had a very early menopause.Doctors in the US and Japan developed the technique to remove the ovaries, activate them in the laboratory and re-implant fragments of ovarian tissue.The technique, reported in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, has resulted in one baby being born, with another expected.The findings were described as early, but a "potential game-changer".The 27 women involved in the study became infertile around the age of 30 due to "primary ovarian insufficiency". The condition affects one in 100 women who essentially run out of eggs too young, leading to an early menopause.Women have a fixed number of eggs at birth and those with the condition tend to use them up too quickly or are born with far fewer eggs in the first place.Eggs in the ovaries are not fully formed; rather, they stay as follicles and some mature each month.The teams at Stanford University, US, and St Marianna University School of Medicine, Japan, were trying to activate the last few remaining follicles, which may be present.They removed the ovaries from the women and used a combination of two techniques to wake up the sleeping follicles. First they cut the ovaries into fragments, which has been used in the past as a fertility treatment. Then a chemical to "take the brakes off" egg development was applied.The fragments were put back at the top of the fallopian tubes and the women were given hormone therapy.Following the treatment, residual follicles started to develop in eight women. Eggs were taken for normal IVF and so far one couple has had a baby and another woman is pregnant.Prof Aaron Hsueh, from Stanford, told the BBC: "It has to be improved to figure out the best way to do it, but we estimate it could help 25 to 30% of the women."We think it could help in two other forms of infertility. Cancer survivors after chemotherapy or radiotherapy; if there's any follicles left there's a chance this will help."And also women aged 40 to 45 with an irregular menstrual cycle."The implications for women with early menopause are still unclear as the technique will require further testing and refinement before it could be used in clinics.Prof Charles Kingsland, from Liverpool Women's Hospital and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: "It's really clever, but will it work for everyone? We don't know."It's potentially really, really, interesting, but we need a lot more investigation to confirm this is not another false dawn."I will see primary ovarian insufficiency on a regular basis in my clinic so if it's effective in the long term, it's something we'd be interested in."Prof Nick Macklon, from the University of Southampton, told the BBC: "Finding a new way to get new eggs by waking up sleeping follicles is very promising. It's potentially a game-changer."It's a very important and very exciting piece of science, but it is not ready for the clinic. It still needs good randomised control trial data."He added that performing the technique outside of a research study would be unfeasible, but a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of egg development could lead to new medications.</body>

      <title>Earlier origin for flowering plants</title>
      <description>Flowering plants may have originated more than 100 million years earlier than previously thought, scientists suggest.</description>

      <body>Flowering plants may have originated more than 100 million years earlier than previously thought, according to scientists in Switzerland and Germany.The previously oldest known flowering plant-like pollen dates from the Early Cretaceous period.But the team described six types of fossil pollen grains from older Middle Triassic core samples that closely resemble these earliest examples.The research is published in the journal Frontiers in Plant Science.Flowering plants - also known as angiosperms - are the most numerous and diverse group of seed-producing plants on land.All seed-producing plants make pollen, with each grain enclosing the developing male cell used in sexual reproduction."That's why plants developed a very tough and resistant wall of organic matter to protect them," explained Professor Peter Hochuli from the University of Zurich, Switzerland."In the fossil record we find only this protective wall of the pollen grains."Based on the increase in abundance and diversity of flowering plants during the Early Cretaceous - approximately 140 million years ago - it has been assumed that they originated in this period.In the older Triassic samples, Prof Hochuli and his team used confocal laser scanning microscopy to obtain high resolution, three-dimensional images and identified six distinct types of fossilised flowering plant-like pollen based on size, patterning and structure."With a few differences...the pollen from the Middle Triassic look exactly the same as the angiosperm pollen from the Early Cretaceous," explained Prof Hochuli.Taken with previous reports of pollen in Triassic sediment from the Barents Sea with similar features to these suggests that flowering plants originated over a 100 million years earlier in the Middle Triassic period - circa 243 million years ago."The number of species found in Switzerland and the from the Barents Sea suggest a rather high diversity and that the group might originate from the Early Triassic or the Late Palaeozoic era," he said.However, this does leave a period of 100 million years for which there are no records of flowering plant-like pollen."I think part of it is a gap in the observation, one finds what is already known. Without my experience from the Barents Sea, I think I would have missed the few tiny grains," Prof Hochuli told BBC Nature.As the described pollen grains were rare, making up less than 1% of the pollen count, they cannot tell us much about the period's climate.But according to Prof Hochuli: "The accompanying pollen assemblages tell us that during the Middle Triassic the climate was warm/hot and arid in Central Europe/Switzerland and still warm, but more humid in the Barents Sea area."In the future they could go on to describe these pollen types as new species. But Prof Hochuli is more interested in finding evidence from other places and from even older sediments, such as the Early Triassic, "that's our next step".</body>

      <body>Bangladesh has begun building the first of two new nuclear power plants north of the capital, Dhaka.The plants - each with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts - are being constructed with Russian help as Bangladesh looks to close a yawning power deficit.Inaugurating the project, PM Sheikh Hasina said that "utmost priority" would be given to nuclear safety".The $2bn project is funded by $500m of Russian credit and is expected to be fully completed by 2022.Prime Minister Hasina said the plant would be constructed so that natural disasters could not damage or destroy it."Regarding the design of the plant, we are following the guidelines of the International Atomic Energy Agency," she said.The plants will implement new safety features following the nuclear accident in Fukushima in Japan, officials say.Under the terms of the construction deal, Russia's state-run Rosatom nuclear energy corporation will build, operate and provide fuel for the plant in addition to processing its spent fuel in Russia.Correspondents say that the project is part of an export drive backed by Russian President Vladimir Putin that includes Rosatom building plants in Iran and Turkey.The reactors at Rooppur in Pabna district, 120km (75 miles) north of Dhaka, are expected to operate for 60 years with options to extend by another 20 years.Bangladesh currently relies on dilapidated gas-fired plants for its power supplies and experiences daily electricity shortfalls.Erratic electricity supplies have been blamed for hampering industrial production and economic growth.</body>

      <body>Attacks by hornets in northern China have killed 41 people since July, state-run media report.More than 1,600 people have also been injured by stings in Shaanxi province, according to China News Agency.It says 206 people are still being treated in hospital, with 37 patients remaining in a critical condition.Local officials have been quoted as saying that drier and warmer weather this year may have contributed to a rise in hornet numbers in the area.Environmental activists have also blamed rapid urbanisation for worsening the problem as more rural land is swallowed up for urban development, intruding into habitats where hornets hunt and build their nests.The cities of Angkang, Hanzhong and Shangluo have been worst affected by the spate of attacks over the past three months.The provincial government has dispatched pest control experts to help deal with the situation.China News Agency says local police and fire-fighters have been given equipment and protective clothes to help remove and destroy hornet nests.Hornet attacks are a recurring problem in Shaanxi province in particular, but the authorities have released no casualty figures for previous years.Zhao Fang, a city government official in Ankong, told the China Daily newspaper that hornet attacks had increased in recent years as the "local ecological environment improved".Winters have been getting milder and summers hotter and more humid in Shaanxi, which may have helped caused hornet numbers there to rise.The Chinese term for hornets is "hu feng" - those behind the deadly attacks this summer appear to be the Asian giant hornet, or Vespa mandarinia.They can grow up to 5cm long with a 6mm sting.The area is also home to the smaller Asian hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax.</body>

      <title>Award for UK food security pioneer</title>
      <description>British geographer John Anthony Allan is one of three scientists to be awarded a Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation Award.</description>

      <body>British geographer Prof John Anthony Allan has received an award from the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation for his work on water security.He introduced the idea of "virtual" water, whereby the amount of water used in food production can be traded when that food is imported or exported.The awards were presented a ceremony in Monaco on Monday evening.The two other winners were US environmental scientist Jane Lubchenco and Spanish geologist Jeronimo Lopez.Dr Lubchenco is the most recent chief of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Prof Lopez is president of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (Scar).The purpose of a virtual water market is to account for all of the water embodied in the production of food.As Prof Allan explained during his acceptance speech, "it takes 1,000 tonnes of water to raise a tonne of wheat, and it takes 16,000 to raise a tonne of beef".The ultimate aim of a global market for virtual water, he said, would be to "trade our way into food security" as water-intensive commodities are traded from places where they are economically viable to produce, to more water-scarce places where they are not.At the awards ceremony, Prince Albert said that Prof Allan had "opened up new perspectives in the management of water stocks and their trade, in particular in regions suffering from [water] shortage, such as the Middle East.Prof Allan, who is based at King's College London, said: "Accountants could save the world if we enable them to put accounting rules into and reporting rules into this food supply chain, which looks as if it's a market, but it has no accounting rules or reporting rules for water".This was the sixth annual Prince Albert II Foundation awards.The three awards represent each of the research areas the prince has named as priorities for his foundation: climate change, biodiversity and water.Dr Lubchenco, who received the climate change award for her work on ocean acidification, told BBC News that she hoped the award would help draw attention to the fact that climate change was "happening now and in our own back yards"."The recent IPCC (UN climate panel) report provides very compelling evidence that that is the case, but that evidence has not yet translated to sufficient action to reduce carbon emissions, and we need that if we are to transition to a better place."</body>

      <title>Russia charges Greenpeace 'pirates'</title>
      <description>Russia charges 14 Greenpeace activists, including a British videographer, with piracy over a protest on an Arctic oil rig.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24362817</url>
      <date>1380722852</date>
      <body>Fourteen Greenpeace activists, including at least four from the UK, have been charged with piracy by the Russian authorities.They were among a 30-strong crew on a Greenpeace ship that was protesting against oil drilling in the Arctic.The group was arrested last month after two of the protesters tried to board an oil platform owned by the Russian state-controlled firm Gazprom.Greenpeace has called the charges "irrational, absurd and an outrage".The 14 activists were taken from jail to the Murmansk office of the Investigative Committee, the Russian equivalent of the FBI, the BBC's Daniel Sandford reports from Moscow.There they were formally charged with "piracy of an organised group", an offence that carries a 15-year prison sentence.Those charged include Kieron Bryan, a freelance video producer from London; Anthony Perrett from Newport in Wales; Alexandra Harris, originally from Devon, and Philip Ball from Chipping Norton.Greenpeace said more activists are expected to be formally charged on Thursday.The group's international executive director, Kumi Naidoo, said the charges were "extreme and disproportionate"."A charge of piracy is being laid against men and women whose only crime is to be possessed of a conscience. This is an outrage and represents nothing less than an assault on the very principle of peaceful protest," Reuters news agency quoted Mr Naidoo as saying.Mr Naidoo said the way Russian officials had treated the protesters represented "the most serious threat to Greenpeace's peaceful environmental activism" since the bombing of the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior in New Zealand in 1985, when the group was campaigning against French nuclear testing in the Pacific.Russian President Vladimir Putin had previously said the activists were "not pirates", but may have broken international law.The Investigative Committee said earlier this week that peaceful aims would not justify what it has described as an "attack" that posed a threat to the rig and its personnel.Last month the Greenpeace ship approached the Prirazlomnaya platform, Russia's first offshore oil rig which is scheduled to start operating by the end of the year.Two activists tried to climb up onto the platform and tie themselves onto it, in an attempt to draw attention to the issue of the expansion of oil and gas exploration in the Arctic Ocean.They were detained after a short skirmish in inflatable dinghies in which armed Russian FSB officers in balaclavas fired warning shots into the water.Greenpeace has released cameraphone images it says show the moment Russian security forces boarded the Arctic Sunrise ship.The ship, with its crew comprising 18 nationalities, was then towed to Murmansk.Mr Bryan's parents, Andy and Ann, from Devon, said they were very worried."Our son is a very kind, caring individual and environmental issues have always been very close to his heart," they said.Andy Bryan had spoken of his shock at the actions the Russians had taken against what he said was a peaceful organisation.</body>

      <body>Hidden cameras have captured the moment London Zoo's first tiger cub for 17 years was born.Five-year-old Sumatran tiger Melati gave birth to the cub on 22 September after a six-minute labour.The pregnancy, which lasted about 15 weeks, was kept secret by zookeepers who are "over the moon" about the cub.It was born six months after the opening of the "tiger territory", designed to encourage the endangered sub-species of tiger to breed.BBC correspondent Emma North said the cub was the product of a "whirlwind romance".Senior zookeeper Paul Kybett explained: "They came from opposite ends of the globe. Melati joined us from Perth at the end of September last year."Jae Jae came from Ohio. When they first saw each other they made the lovely sneezy purr kind of noise that they make."When we introduced them for the first time he trotted up to her and gave her a big head rub so we knew we were going to be getting something quite special."He added: "When it came to her due date, we were all watching our monitors with bated breath."The actual birth happened very quickly and Melati's maternal instincts kicked in immediately."We couldn't have asked for a smoother birth."It's still very early days, so we're leaving Melati to take care of her adorable baby, and our cameras allow us to watch them both from a distance."So far she's proving to be a doting mum."Malcolm Fitzpatrick, curator of mammals at the zoo, said the birth was very important for the global zoo tiger population.He said: "This tiger's one of the most important births in Europe this year."Zookeepers do not yet know the sex of the cub, which is in the exhibit's cubbing den with its mother and will remain away from the public for several weeks.The cub is the grandchild of the zoo's last tiger cub, Hari, the father of Melati.</body>

It can also cause a lot of internal injuries if ingested."The RSPCA said the birds were being washed in Taunton and kept on pools so staff could check that their feathers were waterproof and there were no long-term effects from the oil.Peter Venn, RSPCA centre manager, said: "So far they all seem to be doing well which is good news."He said the oil was coming off easily with washing up liquid and the ducks seemed relatively strong."Fingers crossed we can get as many of them as possible fighting fit and ready for release," he added.People with information about the oil spill can contact the RSPCA in confidence on 0300 123 8018.</body>

      <title>Mammals threatened by fragmentation</title>
      <description>Small mammals affected by rainforest fragmentation are likely to be wiped out more quickly than previously thought, scientists warn.</description>

      <date>1380224144</date>
      <body>Species affected by rainforest fragmentation are likely to be wiped out more quickly than previously thought, scientists have warned.A study found that some small mammal species on forest islands, created by a hydroelectric reservoir, in Thailand became extinct in just five years.It also showed that populations in the fragmented habitats were also at risk from another threat - invasive species.The findings have been published in the journal Science.Results showed that almost all small mammals disappeared from patches of fragmented forest smaller than 10 hectares (25 acres) within just five years, and larger plots - measuring up to 56ha - recorded the loss of small animals within 25 years.Co-author Luke Gibson from the National University of Singapore said the team was very surprised by the findings, describing it "like an ecological Armageddon"."None of us expected such a dramatic change from 20 years ago," he told the BBC's Science in Action programme."Our study focused on small mammals but what we did not report was a similar near-complete extinction of medium to large-sized mammals, such as elephants, tigers and tapirs, which are now completely absent from these islands in the reservoir."All of these animals were all in the forest landscape before the creation of the reservoir."'Natural laboratory'The researchers carried out their studies at the Chiew Lan (or Larn) Reservoir in southern Thailand. About 160 sq km of the Khao Sok National Park was flooded in the mid-1980s to create the reservoir.The rising water also created in excess of 100 islands of tropical forest, which the team called a "natural laboratory".The researchers carried out a survey of small mammals found on 16 of the islands, which ranged in size from 0.3ha to 56.3ha, five to seven years after the reservoir was created. They then repeated the survey 25-26 years after the islands were formed.Co-author Prof William Laurance, one of the world's leading ecologists on habitat fragmentation, said there were probably two factors that drove the rapid demise of small mammals on the isolated habitats."Native mammals suffered the harmful effects of population isolation, and they also had to deal with a devastating invader - the Malayan field rat," he said.The team found the population of the invading rat species became so abundant in just a few years that it displaced the native small mammals.The field rat is known to invade disturbed habitats, such as fragmented forests.Habitat fragmentation is widely recognised as one of the main global threats to biodiversity. Although it can occur naturally as a result of natural disasters, the main threat today comes via human activities, such as urbanisation and pressure for agricultural land.Mr Gibson said he expected the trend of fragmentation in tropical landscapes to become increasingly common in the coming decades."One example [of a] highly fragmented forest region is in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil where more than 80% of fragments are smaller than 50ha in area," he observed."The bottom line is that we must conserve large, intact habitats for nature. That is the only way we can ensure biodiversity will survive."</body>

      <title>Himalayas still uphill for climate report</title>
      <description>Data on Himalayan glaciers remains poor</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24396330</url>
      <date>1380882233</date>
      <body>Although the latest global update on climate change says the vast majority of glaciers worldwide have continued to shrink, scientists have admitted that the Himalayas remain an area where they still have very limited information.Glaciologists involved in the cryosphere chapter of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) first phase report, launched last week, said there was no good sample of Himalayan glaciers that could help them forecast their future behaviour."The Himalayas are one of the areas we really are data-poor," said Prof David Vaughan from Cambridge University, UK, and one of the two lead coordinating authors of the ice chapter in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)."We really need good samples of lots of glaciers and their measurements; we would like to have a larger number of benchmark glaciers," he told BBC News.The Himalayas received scant coverage in past IPCC reports.Until its Third Assessment Report in late 2001, the supreme authority on climate science called the Himalayan region a "white spot" because of the lack of information.Its Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 courted huge controversy when it mistakenly said that most of the Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035.After the IPCC put its hand up on this error, there was an expectation that AR5 would contain something more, particularly from the ground.But scientists involved in the latest IPCC report said there had been very little ground-truthing of the satellite imagery obtained for the Himalayas."Ground measurements are still very few, and, in addition, these few are usually limited to very small and not very representative glaciers," said Prof Georg Kaser, a University of Innsbruck, Austria, glaciologist and a lead author on AR5's cryosphere chapter."Field work on these glaciers is extremely difficult and also dangerous on an unacceptable scale. There is no way to overcome this, and this fact is also one of the reasons why we knew so little about these glaciers - giving thus also good reasons for [exaggerated] guesses."The Himalayas cover about one million square km, and there are more than 15,000 glaciers in the region according to several studies.The first-phase instalment of AR5 has significant detail on the Arctic, Greenland and the Antarctic.On the Greenland ice sheet, for instance, it said: "There is very high confidence that the Greenland ice sheet has lost ice during the last two decades."Combinations of satellite and airborne remote sensing together with field data indicate with high confidence that the ice loss has occurred in several sectors, and that large rates of mass loss have spread to wider regions than reported in AR4."But there is nothing like this on the Himalayas - the largest body of ice outside the northern and southern polar regions - and scientists say the main reason is the lack of studies on the ground.Even countries in the region have not been able to expand upon the few field studies they have initiated in limited pockets.India's Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology has been monitoring less than half-a-dozen glaciers within the Indian Himalayas."There are also strategic reasons behind the lack of ground work," says WIHG director Prof Anil Gupta, who was also a review editor on AR5's paleoclimate chapter."For instance, China and India share borders in the Himalayas and so because of the sensitivities on both the sides, it becomes difficult to reach these areas."WIHG has found that one of the reasons behind the recent catastrophic floods in Uttarakhand State of northern India was a breach of a glacial lake."The heavy precipitation led to the melting of the soft snow and even old ice in the Chorabari and companion glaciers that fed to the Chorabari Lake, which got breached due to excessive water intake from the glaciers," Prof Gupta explained."The mixing of glacial moraine, or debris, with glacial melt water mainly impacted the town of Shri Kedarnath and downstream towns of Gauriganga, Ramban, etc in the Kedarnath Valley."Prof Vaughan said that updates on the state of nearby glaciers were crucial for people living in such valleys in the Himalayas."If you live in a valley below one glacier, you really don't care what the global average [of glacial retreat] is; you just want to know what's happening to that particular glacier that's affecting your water security.According to the United Nations Environment Programme, there have been at least 35 events of glacial lake outbursts in Nepal, Pakistan, Bhutan and China during the last century.To minimise future risks, Prof Vaughan said scientists urgently needed more data on Himalayan glaciers."If they are going to start retreating then some of them will leave these kinds of glacial lakes that can then be quite dangerous if they burst out."We could actually predict which glaciers are likely to have that kind of behaviour in the future if only we can get on the ground and get some details."</body>

      <title>Hydrogen: The car fuel of the future?</title>
      <description>Could hydrogen power the cars of tomorrow?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24381812</url>
      <date>1380843391</date>
      <body>A small British firm is looking forward to a day in which we will take our cars to the garage and fill them with hydrogen.Acal Energy, based in Runcorn in Cheshire, says it has developed a chemistry that could make hydrogen fuel cells much cheaper and longer-lasting than current technologies.It wants to license its chemistry to the world's car-makers, opening the way for hydrogen vehicles to sell in large volumes in 10 or 20 years' time."We believe this is one of the breakthrough technologies," says Brendan Bilton, the company's chief commercial officer."We're pretty confident and excited... that this will start unlocking the barriers," he continues, "Allowing fuel cells to be in products for mass market applications."It is a bold dream but not a crazy one.The automotive industry is already far advanced with plans for a first generation of hydrogen cars.Hyundai, the South Korean manufacturer, has said it will soon start selling a hydrogen-powered version of its ix35 model.Meanwhile, the Japanese giant Toyota is expected to unveil its first nearly-production-ready foray into the territory at next month's Tokyo motor show.Other big names - including Daimler and Volkswagen - are thought to be on track to get hydrogen vehicles into showrooms by 2017.But few expect these first-generation hydrogen cars to sell in very large numbers.Acal Energy is pitching its technology as the enabler for a second generation of less costly, more durable vehicles which could - if all goes to plan - pose a serious challenge to the long domination of the internal combustion engine from about 2020 onwards.To begin with, consumers may take a bit of persuading.Hydrogen is widely seen as a dangerous fuel - an image underpinned by that grainy newsreel footage of the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg airship bursting into flames in the 1930s.But actually, experts do not seem daunted by this particular technical challenge.They point out that hydrogen is already used and managed on a routine basis in industrial processes.The main reason anyone bothers with it as a fuel for the future is because it is emission-free at the point of use.The hydrogen is combined with oxygen in a bit of kit called a fuel cell. This process generates electricity to power the engine in the vehicle.The waste products are heat and harmless water.Water is benign, unlike the global warming-inducing, carbon dioxide emissions that spew from even the most efficient petrol and diesel vehicles.The car industry has been developing fuel cells that use costly platinum as the catalyst for generating power from hydrogen for many years.Acal Energy claims the problem with this current technology is that it results in fuel cells that are either prohibitively expensive because of the high platinum content, or prone to degrade quickly.To get round these issues, the company has developed what Mr Bilton describes as a "liquid catalyst" composed of "a dissolved solution of metal salts".As well as being a lot cheaper than a platinum catalyst, the liquid doubles up as a coolant and a cleaning agent that extends the life of the fuel cell by taking away damaging by-products as it circulates through a "regenerator"."We have a solution that both increases durability and reduces cost," says Mr Bilton.The company has its offices in a science park that until a few years ago was the research and development centre for the British chemicals giant ICI, now shrunken in size and foreign-owned.Intriguingly, the ideas behind Acal Energy's patented "FlowCath" technology derive from techniques developed to clean clothes more efficiently.The founder of the company, Dr Andrew Creeth, now its chief technology officer, spent much of his career working as a scientist for the washing powder giant Unilever.Development of the product is taking place in an environment not unlike a gigantic school chemistry lab - full of bubbling chemicals, complicated equipment and clever looking people in white coats.The company has already raised £15m ($24m) to finance its work from a mixture of private investors and government sources.It is currently hoping to raise another £15m or so from a new funding round, with the outcome due to be announced soon.Eventually, Acal Energy aims to earn profits from the business model pioneered by the successful British micro-chip designer Arm Holdings.Arm's technology is embedded in most of the chips used in the world's smartphones and tablet computers.It receives a small royalty payment every time anyone upgrades their mobile device.Acal Energy dreams of equal success from licensing its technology to car manufacturers in decades to come.The big questions, though, are does the technology work and will it be the breakthrough that the company claims?Prof Nigel Brandon of Imperial College in London, a leading academic in hydrogen energy, is well qualified to comment."The core technology looks very exciting," he says."There are some components in their system they need to improve. I don't see any reason why they can't do that but they've still got to do it," Prof Brandon adds.It is guarded optimism that could equally be applied to the whole field of hydrogen fuel cell energy.The big advantages over battery-powered electric vehicles are hydrogen cars can be refuelled in a just a few minutes, they can run for 300 or 400 miles between refuelling and they have the environmental benefits of battery driven cars with the same range and convenience as those with petrol or diesel engines.But there are also significant snags.Among them is the need to create a hugely expensive new infrastructure of hydrogen filling stations to replace garages.Hydrogen enthusiasts often quote the example of the internet.Once the demand was proven, a global network of optical fibre cables to carry data traffic was rapidly built despite the cost.Major players in the car industry are betting - but not yet on a truly large scale - that hydrogen energy will follow the same pattern.</body>

      <title>Can a drug make you tell the truth?</title>
      <description>Can 'truth serum' really stop you telling lies?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24371140</url>
      <date>1380759219</date>
      <body>In movies and TV dramas, sodium thiopental is shown as a sinister truth serum used to get information out of captured people. Michael Mosley tried it out.One of the great challenges of living in our society is knowing when people are telling the truth or not. We lie all the time and are remarkably bad at detecting when other people are deliberately deceiving us.There are lots of urban myths about lie detecting, such as the claim that liars tend to look away, twitch their feet or touch their noses when lying (the so-called Pinocchio effect).In study after study, it has been shown that professionals such as policemen are no more reliable at detecting liars than the rest of us. So it's not surprising that for many years scientists have been working to develop "truth drugs" - drugs that will make you open up and tell all you know to an interrogator.One of the oldest and best known of these truth drugs is sodium thiopental. Although it was first developed in the 1930s, it is still used today in a range of settings, including, in some countries, by the police and the military.I was intrigued but also extremely sceptical about the claims that sodium thiopental, originally developed as an anaesthetic, could make people speak the truth if they chose not to. So I decided, as part of a series I've been making on the extraordinary history of pharmaceuticals, to try it out.Sodium thiopental is part of a group of drugs called barbiturates, drugs widely used in the 1950s and 60s to help people sleep better. They are no longer used for that purpose because they are extremely addictive and potentially lethal - Marilyn Monroe famously died from a barbiturate overdose.I decided to take a low dose of sodium thiopental under proper medical supervision, with anaesthetist Dr Austin Leach monitoring my vital signs throughout. Barbiturates work by slowing down the rate at which messages travel through the brain and spinal column. The more barbiturates there are, the harder it is for chemical messages to cross the gaps between one neuron and the next.Your whole thinking process slows down until you fall asleep. With thiopental, that happens very quickly indeed.Although it was originally developed as an anaesthetic, it was soon noticed that when patients were in that twilight zone halfway between consciousness and unconsciousness, they became more chatty and disinhibited. After the drug had worn off, the patients forgot what they had been talking about.It was decided that sodium thiopental might form the basis for a truth drug, an interrogation tool. But does it really work?I decided that I would have a go at trying to maintain the fiction that rather than being Michael Mosley, science journalist, I would be Michael Mosley, famous heart surgeon. We started with a very low dose. Immediately I felt extremely light-headed, intoxicated. But would this make me more inclined to speak the truth?There is an expression, "in vino veritas" (in wine there is truth). Alcohol is an anaesthetic and it depresses some of our higher centres, areas like the cerebral cortex where a lot of thought processing occurs. It reduces inhibitions but also slows thought processes, making it difficult to think clearly. The Roman historian Tacitus claimed that Germanic tribes held their important councils while drunk, as they thought it made effective lying harder.One theory about sodium thiopental is that it works in much the same way. Because lying is generally more difficult and complicated than telling the truth, if you suppress higher cortical functions you are more likely to speak the truth, simply because it's easier.I'm not sure if I lied effectively while under the influence of low dose thiopental, but I found that I could still lie."I am a cardiac - ha ha ha! - cardiac surgeon, a world famous cardiac surgeon," I shouted out when Dr Leach asked me what I did for a living."Would you like to tell me what the last operation you carried out was?" he enquired, politely."It was a heart bypass," I improvised. "They survived, yeah, I was awesome."Not convincing, but I had just about managed to stick to my fictional story. But what would happen when the dose was upped?At this point I felt some trepidation. There was a risk that I might say something that I really didn't want the world to know, but, confident in my ability to keep on lying, I told Dr Leach to go ahead.I was given another slightly larger dose of sodium thiopental and this time I actually felt more sober, more in control. So what happened next was a complete surprise.Again Dr Leech asked me my name and my profession. This time there was no hesitation."I'm a television producer. Well, executive producer, well, presenter, some, mix of the three of them.""So you don't have any history of performing cardiac surgery?" he asked gently."None whatsoever. None whatsoever"I'm still confused about what happened because one effect of the drug is to distort short-term memory. But I think the reason that I spoke the truth on this occasion is because the thought of lying never occurred to me.So does it work? Well my conclusion after trying it out and speaking to experts is that it will certainly make you more inclined to talk, but that when you are under the influence you are also in an extremely suggestible state. The reason you become more suggestible is probably because the drug is interfering with your higher centres, like your cortex, where a lot of decision making goes on. There is a serious risk you will say what your interrogator wants to hear rather than the truth.The truth is we don't have a reliable truth drug yet. Or if there is one out there, nobody's telling.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>10 heat secrets caught on camera</title>
      <description>Tech provides unique perspective on nature</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/24269057</url>

      <body>Have you ever seen a foraging badger being followed by a bat? A nightjar clapping for attention? Or a cloud of bats feeding over a lake?These are just some of the fascinating insights filmmakers captured for BBC One series The Great British Year thanks to state of the art thermal imaging equipment.The military might have led the development of this technology but since cameras have become commercially available, researchers have started exploring the unique perspective on the natural world they can provide.Using infra-red radiation to visualise differences in temperature has delivered some surprising sights, here are 10 of the most remarkable revelations.Figuring out whether a giant panda is pregnant is one of the biggest challenges in animal medicine but staff at San Diego Zoo have successfully used thermal imaging to give them a new perspective."Thermal imaging is a useful tool for detecting activity in the giant panda uterus prior to the time a foetus can be visualised with ultrasound," says Dr Barbara Durrant who has led the technology's use at the zoo.By monitoring a panda's abdomen, the team were able to visualise heat changes as early indicators of the animals preparing for pregnancy.Dr Durrant explains that the advantage of thermal imaging is that the animals can be monitored without restraints or anaesthetic for a broad, non-invasive view before more specific methods are administered.Wildlife vets have also embraced thermal imaging as a tool to monitor animals without getting too close.High temperatures in specific body parts can indicate inflammation and such information has proven useful in the diagnosis of conditions from arthritis in elephants to rabies in raccoons.Interestingly, while higher nose temperatures sound alarm bells in racoons, a cooler face has been identified as an indicator of rabies in big brown bats.A team of French and Scottish scientists investigating emperor penguins in Antarctica discovered that the animals can actually have a colder surface temperature than the surrounding air.Via thermal images of the penguin colonies, researchers identified that the outer layer of feathers was 4 to 6 C colder than the air.Dr Dominic McCafferty from the University of Glasgow explained that this was due to "extreme radiative cooling" whereby the penguins lose heat to the clear sky where heat escapes rapidly from our atmosphere.The specialised structure of their feathers acts as an insulator however to keep these dangerously low temperatures away from the penguins' skin.Thermal technology was used to study Asian elephants living at Busch Gardens zoological park, US.African elephants are known to keep cool using their large ears where huge volumes of blood are circulated close to the skin's surface so heat can dissipate.Asian elephants however have much smaller ears and are known to cool off overnight so they start the day at a lower temperature.Rather than losing heat through their ears, thermal images showed that overnight heat loss is greatest from Asian elephants' trunks.The titan arum (Amorphophallus titanum) is the stinking giant of the plant world. It has the world's largest flowering head growing up to 3 metres tall and smells like a rotting corpse.Researchers discovered that the plant emits puffs of this odour to attract carrion eating insect pollinators from across its Sumatran jungle home.Thermal imaging revealed that the puffs are achieved by a build up of heat in the plant's stem resulting in regular releases of steam which carry the odour through the canopy to attract insects.Bees are known for their stings but Japanese honeybees have another form of defence against predatory giant Asian hornets.If they find an intruder in the nest, the bees swarm around it to form a bee ball - the inside of which reaches 46 C.Thermal cameras indicate that the temperature inside the bee ball is maintained by the bees at the optimal level so that they can defeat their nemesis without overheating themselves.Biologists are tracking the movements of whales without even dipping a toe in the water.Instead they survey the seas for "spouts" of warmer water released by the whales as they take a breath.The technology provides valuable data on grey whales as they pass California on their annual migrations, particularly their previously unseen night-time movements.Last year, researchers reported the first use of thermal imaging in an automated system that aims to protect whales from underwater noise by alerting when their spouts are sighted near mining or naval activities.A further bizarre discovery about Madagascar's mysterious lemur the aye-aye was made using thermal imaging cameras.The animals are known for their unusual extra-long finger which they use to tap trees when foraging for grubs.Scientists discovered that the aye-aye's super sensitive digit is kept cool when not in use but heats up by 6 C when in action.The finger is packed with nerve endings and experts suggest the ability to "switch" its temperature on and off saves the lemur essential energy.In the past, bats have proven difficult to study because most of their activity takes place after dark but thermal imaging has revealed a wealth of information about their behaviour.When researchers found high numbers of dead bats below wind turbines in both the US and Europe, they turned to thermal imaging for an explanation.US researchers recorded footage that identified bats actively investigating and foraging around the turbines.Scientists suggest insects are attracted to the structures with a knock on effect for the bats and birds that feed on them.Experts studied common seals off the coast of Scotland to understand more about their habits during the annual moult.Through thermal imaging they found that the seals' skin heats up to help them shed and regrow their hair.With increased blood flow to their skin to aid the moult, the seals choose to stay out of the water to avoid a chill and save energy.The Great British Year begins on Wednesday 2 October 2013 at 2100 on BBC One.Join BBC Nature on Facebook and Twitter @BBCNature.</body>

      <description>The battle to save Africa's elephants from cyanide slaughter</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24352104</url>
      <date>1380761882</date>
      <body>In our series of letters from African journalists, filmmaker and columnist Farai Sevenzo considers the plight of the African elephant.Our world has become a more dangerous one for man and beast alike, with murder and murderers dominating recent news.I was struck these past few days by the callous murder of some 80 elephants in Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park.Poachers, it has been reported, poured cyanide into the drinking and salting wells frequented by some of Zimbabwe's 80,000 elephants with the sole aim of killing them and removing their ivory tusks for sale to buyers in Asia.The National Parks say a thorough search of the surrounding villages has already yielded 19 tusks together with cyanide poison and the authorities have made arrests.Across the continent, poachers have been killing elephants in greater and larger numbers - a family of 11 was slain in Kenya's Tsavo East National Park back in January, and, according to The International Fund for Animal Welfare, some 400 elephants were slaughtered in the first three months of 2012 in Cameroon's Bouba Ndjida National Park.While over in Gabon, a country whose green credentials are the envy of many, 11,000 forest elephants are said to have been killed by poachers from 2004 to 2013 because they were after the pink-tinged ivory of Gabon's forest elephants which is said to fetch high prizes and much in demand by jewellers and their customers in Asia.A pattern seems to be emerging here where Africa's close encounter with new economic giants like China has meant all resources are on the negotiating table; but ivory, long protected by international law, can only be obtained by the illegal poaching of Africa's most majestic beasts.It is difficult to know where the blame begins for this sudden elephant murder spree.African detective novelists might lead their protagonists from the urban hotels where an encounter with a Chinese businessman will tempt a poor worker to head to his village and inform his relatives that a little hunting will benefit the whole family.But in reality it will impoverish these African nations as a whole and the sight of elephant carcasses strewn across the savannah with their tusks removed confirm the suspicion that people are the worst guardians of this planet and should not be trusted to hand it over to future generations without unbelievable damage.And so it was heartening to hear Zimbabwe's Environment Minister Saviour Kasukuwere talking of changing the law so that poachers may be punished more severely for their outrageous disregard for the nation's heritage."We are responding with all our might because our wildlife, including the elephants they are killing, are part of the national resources… that we want to benefit the people of Zimbabwe," the minister said.This particular cyanide slaughter will have affected not just the elephants - birds, lions, leopards, giraffes and many other beasts that used the same watering holes will have perished and the body count will rise as hyenas, jackals and vultures feasting on the remains will ingest the cyanide poison which human hands laid in the water for a few miserable dollars.Ironically, since the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) banned ivory sales in 1989, loxondanta Africana - African elephants - have had a tough time holding on to their tusks and their lives.Before such a ban, China even gifted the United Nations, in 1974, a magnificent sculpture of exquisite craftsmanship depicting the Chengdu-Kunming Railway.But today we would recognise that that piece was made out of eight enormous elephant tusks, four elephant lives and dozens of repercussions for their grieved offspring.The minister of environment in Zimbabwe is at pains to call this a global problem and he is right.The green concerns of the modern day are alive to the possibility that there may be none of these awesome beasts left should poaching and the markets for ivory be allowed to go unchecked.Rather than turn Zimbabwe's Victoria Falls into a tacky Disney World theme park in an effort to attract tourism, the government would be better off pulling in the elephants' friends to their beautiful parks.For elephants are not short of sympathisers and half a million people in 15 cities across the globe will be marching to draw attention to the plight of the African elephant this October.The cyanide slaughter awoke the social media generation from teenagers to vegetarians to international footballers.The Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey - whose current form has delighted fans in north London and Africa's massive Arsenal following - tweeted a few days ago: "Just read about elephants being poisoned for their ivory in Zimbabwe. Absolutely shocking."The minister was aware of this famous tweet and told the BBC that Mr Ramsey would be welcome to see for himself the efforts under way to save his tusked friends.But if Minister Kasukuwere is to be the saviour of the elephants, he must punish the buyers too, and not flinch at the possibility of poisoning the poachers themselves - the life of a poacher who cannot think of the future beyond a few hundred dollars surely deserves poison too?For the lives of 80 elephants lost so brutally would have replenished the national coffers with their enormous weight in gold 80 fold through resurgent tourism.In the end, the government threw the law book at the poachers - 15 years in jail and a fine of $800,000 (£493,000).But someone bought that cyanide, someone funded the brutal operation and someone somewhere has more of those tusks missing from those elephant carcasses.There is more to be done.If you would like to comment on Farai Sevenzo's column, please do so below.</body>

      <body>Since moving to Japan in 2012, I have reported on the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear disaster - speaking to experts, visiting the site and watching the clean-up. For the Editors, a programme which sets out to ask challenging questions, I consider what I have learned.Firstly, Fukushima was not an unavoidable natural disaster. For many outside Japan it is easy to draw the conclusion that Fukushima is unique, as very few places experience such huge earthquakes and tsunamis as Japan. So, the logic goes, there are no real lessons to be learned for other countries.Much the same was said after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine in 1986. Chernobyl was a bad design, a similar accident could not happen in Japan, which has Western-designed reactors. But it did.Prof Kiyoshi Kurokawa chaired the Japanese parliamentary inquiry in to the Fukushima disaster and his conclusions are devastating. It was, he told me: "Man-made, and made in Japan."Tatsujiro Suzuki, the deputy head of Japan's Atomic Energy Commission, has also been damning."There were studies which showed a one-in-1,000-year probability of the Fukushima coast being hit by a 10m tsunami," he said. "Unfortunately, those studies were dismissed. The nuclear industry didn't think it would happen, so they didn't prepare for it," he said.For me, this is the most revealing and shocking part of the Fukushima story. When the earthquake and tsunami hit on 11 March 2011 there was no plan for how to deal with such a large and complex disaster. How was this allowed to happen?Prof Kurokawa blames what he calls "regulatory capture", a process by which the nuclear power industry "captured" the bureaucracy that was supposed to regulate it.Put crudely, the "poachers" and the "gamekeepers" were far too close. Many senior bureaucrats from Japan's Nuclear Industry Safety Agency would take lucrative jobs in the nuclear industry after leaving government.The result was a nuclear industry imbued with a culture of arrogance, secrecy and complacency. Lessons learned after Chernobyl and Three Mile Island in the US were not implemented here. When disaster struck, Japan was woefully ill-prepared.An investigation by Japan's NHK broadcaster last year found that simple equipment, things like mobile generators and battery packs that could have helped prevent the meltdowns, were sitting at a depot just 25 miles (40km) from the Fukushima plant.After the tsunami knocked out the plant's electrical system there was still time to bring in the back-up equipment. Army helicopters were on standby. But there was no plan. Chaos ensued.A senior company official in charge of logistics was asked by the NHK team why he had not dispatched the equipment. "We had a very long list of things they needed. We had no way to prioritise which should go first," he said.And so the back-up equipment stayed in the depot, and the reactor cores melted down.Nor was there any evacuation plan. In the little town of Namie, five miles (8km) north of the plant, Hirohisa Suzuki was clearing up debris from the quake when the order came to leave."People were just told to head north west," he told me, "but that was exactly the same direction the radiation cloud was moving. Some people were evacuated to an area where the radiation was even higher than here."In retrospect, Mr Suzuki agrees the whole town was far too trusting. They were told the plant was safe, so no-one had ever asked whether there was a disaster plan.Two and a half years later, Mr Suzuki and the 26,000 people who lived in Namie are still nuclear refugees as radiation in parts of the town is still too high for residents to return. His family's 150-year-old miso and soy sauce business may never reopen.This is the other thing I have learned: cleaning up a nuclear disaster is extremely difficult. That may sound obvious, but just how complex only becomes apparent when you see how it is done.In the large town of Minamisoma, 19 miles (30km) north of the plant, they are cleaning virtually every house. I watch a team of men using high-power sprayers to clean the roof of a farmhouse, surrounded by plastic sheets to catch the waste water, which is then pumped into a nearby tanker.Another team of men is removing topsoil from the garden and putting it in huge plastic bags. The garden is then covered in a 2in (5cm) layer of fresh sand. Behind the house, shrubs and bamboo are being cut down and bagged. It will take a team of 20 men two days to finish this one house.But much of Fukushima prefecture is covered in densely-forested mountains. How do you clean forest? The answer is you cannot. So large areas may have to be declared out of bounds for decades.Finally, there is the waste. Already the clean-up is generating huge quantities. I was taken to a "temporary" dump deep in the mountains near the little town of Kawauchi. This single dump contains 50,000 cubic metres of waste. Kawauchi alone already has four dumps this size, and it is building a fifth.Just how temporary these dumps really are is another question Japan's government is unable to answer. The radiation in the dumps will gradually fall. In 30 years it will be half the level it is today. But the Caesium 137 and Strontium 90 will not be gone completely for 300 years.Finally let me end by quoting again Tatsujiro Suzuki, the deputy head of Japan's Atomic Energy Commission. I asked him why, if the nuclear industry knows there is a possibility of a disaster, does it continue to tell the public nuclear power is safe?"We need to be prepared for the worst case. We need to tell the public this is the worst case. But if we tell the worst case, the public says ,'Don't build the reactor near here.' So that was the dilemma. And if you want to continue building nuclear power plants you have to keep telling people the reactors should be safe. But now that myth is gone."BBC News: The Editors features the BBC's on-air specialists asking questions which reveal deeper truths about their areas of expertise.

      <title>Why does the human brain create false memories?</title>
      <description>Why does the brain create false memories?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24286258</url>

      <body>Human memory constantly adapts and moulds itself to fit the world. Now an art project hopes to highlight just how fallible our recollections are.All of us generate false memories and artist AR Hopwood has been "collecting" them.For the past year he has asked the public to submit anecdotes of fake recollections which he turns into artistic representations.They have ranged from the belief of eating a live mouse to a memory of being able to fly as a child.One man who wrote in wrongly believed his girlfriend had a sister who died while at the dentist. So strong was his conviction that he kept all his dentist visits secret.He wrote: "Over dinner one day she said she was going to the dentist the next week. It all went quiet at the table and my mum said it must be hard for her to visit the dentist after what had happened."This is hardly a rare case. Neuroscientists say that many of our daily memories are falsely reconstructed because our view of the world is constantly changing.Subtle cues can easily steer our memories in the wrong direction.A famous experiment carried out by Elizabeth Loftus in 1994 revealed that she was able to convince a quarter of her participants they were once lost in a shopping centre as a child.Another similar experiment in 2002 found that half of the participants were tricked into believing they had taken a hot air balloon ride as a child, simply by showing them doctored photographic "evidence".This work was carried out by Kimberley Wade at the University of Warwick, UK. For the current project she was asked by Mr Hopwood to take part in a real hot air balloon ride, video and images of which are now exhibited in his show. She says she was very excited to take part."I've been studying memory for more than a decade, and I still find it incredible that our imagination can trick us into thinking we've done something we've never really done and lead us to create such compelling, illusory memories," she says.The reason our memories are so malleable, Kimberley Wade explains, is because there is simply too much information to take in."Our perceptual systems aren't built to notice absolutely everything in our environment. We take in information through all our senses but there are gaps," she adds."So when we remember an event, what our memory ultimately does is fills in those gaps by thinking about what we know about the world."For the most part false memories are about everyday situations with no real consequences except the occasional disagreement with a friend or partner about trivial things like who lost the keys, again.But sometimes, false memories can have more serious ramifications. For example, if an eyewitness testimony in court contributes to a false conviction.Forensic technology has now led to many such convictions being overturned. The Innocence Project in the US campaigns to overturn eyewitness misidentification and lists all the people who have subsequently been acquitted.The project reports that there have been 311 post-conviction DNA exonerations in the US, which includes 18 people who were sentenced to death before DNA evidence was able to prove their innocence.Christopher French of Goldsmiths University in London says there is still a lack of awareness of how unreliable human memory is, especially in the legal system."Although this is common knowledge within psychology and widely accepted by anybody who has studied the literature, it's not widely known about in society more generally," he says."There are still people who believe memory works like a video camera as well as people who accept the Freudian notion of repression - that when something terrible happens the memory is shoved down into the subconscious."But the evidence of repressed memories, he adds, is "very thin on the ground".Prof French was also involved in the memory project. He hopes it will create more awareness of the malleability of human memory.So too does AR Hopwood. He says he was fascinated to learn that people could strongly believe in an entirely imagined event."What's interesting is that the submissions become mini-portraits of the person (albeit anonymously) yet the only thing you are finding out about this person is something that didn't actually happen. So there's a lovely paradox there which I'm very drawn to as an artist," he says.According to another researcher, the errors the human brain makes can sometimes serve a useful purpose.Sergio Della Sala, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Edinburgh, UK, says it can be thought of in the following way. Imagine you are in the jungle and you see some grass moving. Humans are likely to panic and run away, with the belief that there could be a tiger lurking.A computer, however, might deduce that 99% of the time, it is simply the wind. If we behaved like the computer, we would be eaten the one time a tiger was present."The brain is prepared to make 99 errors to save us from the tiger. That's because the brain is not a computer. It works with irrational assumptions. It's prone to errors and it needs shortcuts," says Prof Della Sala.False memories are the sign of a healthy brain, he adds. "They are a by-product of a memory system that works well. You can make inferences very fast."The False Memory Archive, supported by the Wellcome Trust, opened at The Exchange in Penzance on Saturday 28 September</body>

      <body>He was one of the most intrepid explorers of the 19th Century, leading five expeditions to the Arctic and surviving for 10 months after his ship was crushed between two ice floes. But 100 years after his death, Benjamin Leigh Smith is now largely forgotten.Somewhere in the Arctic Ocean, about halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole, there's an archipelago where Benjamin Leigh Smith's name marks its easternmost point.The likes of Captain Robert Falcon Scott, Sir Ernest Shackleton and Sir Henry Morton Stanley were superstar explorers, men who earned great renown and who had sought great renown.On the other hand, Leigh Smith was a modest man. The cape and adjacent glacier bearing his name (Kapp Leigh Smith and Leighbreen) are some of the few lasting tokens of his historic expeditions.Unlike so many of his contemporaries, even unlike today's explorers, he never sought fame for discovering new places. He didn't publish any detailed account of his explorations and he shunned public appearances, often sending someone else in his place.Born in 1828, the Briton was one of the first explorers to take ships to the high Arctic, where extensive sea ice - the thin frozen surface of the ocean, a few metres in thickness - made conditions very hostile."He saw and mapped areas and islands that were being observed for the first time," says Prof Julian Dowdeswell, director of the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge University."The high Arctic had much more sea ice a century ago than it does now, which made navigating through it difficult."He received the Patron Gold Medal - one of the two highest awards the Royal Geographical Society gives - for his achievements, so was hugely eminent," he says.As well as his advances in scientific exploration, Leigh Smith was at the centre of a survival feat that is arguably a match for the later exploits of the much more famous Shackleton.In 1881, Leigh Smith's purpose-built research vessel Eira was crushed between two ice floes and sank off another Arctic archipelago, Russian Franz Josef Land, north of Siberia.The crew survived for 10 months in makeshift huts, living off provisions salvaged from the ship and hunting walrus and polar bear. Leigh Smith then led a voyage of escape in boats with sails made from table cloths, before they were ultimately rescued.Every single man survived."This remarkable Arctic journey was executed with as much grace as that of Shackleton 40 years later," says Peter Capelotti, author of Shipwreck at Cape Flora: The Expeditions of Benjamin Leigh Smith, England's Forgotten Arctic Explorer."His leadership was so successful that the veteran Arctic whaling captain David Gray was moved to call him the very model of 'quiet, cool, thoroughbred English pluck'," he says.When it came to accepting medals for his achievements, however, Capelotti says Leigh Smith "always begged off"."Explorers as a rule are self-obsessed people who love to talk about themselves, but not this one. He once told his brother-in-law that if Queen Victoria herself asked to see his Arctic photographs, he would send his expedition photographer around to the palace with them."Capelotti puts part of Leigh Smith's low profile down to his family background. While he came from a wealthy family, his father, who was an MP, never married his mother, an unusual and potentially scandalous situation.And although he studied law at Jesus College, Cambridge, he couldn't get a degree immediately because it was difficult for anyone but practising members of the Church of England to gain degrees at the time."He was always at odds with upper society," says Capelotti. "He didn't fit in."Leigh Smith's great-great-great niece Charlotte Moore, who lives in Sussex, agrees."He was both establishment but also separate because he was illegitimate and from a dissenting family, so he never received a knighthood or got that kind of honour, which is probably a factor in why his story is not better known," she says.In fact, it was only after Leigh Smith's father died, and another man left him money, that he embarked on his first expedition to the Arctic, according to Moore."The first one was a sporting cruise really. All polar expeditions were from the Royal Navy, but Ben wanted to do a private non-naval expedition, so he hired a ship."Then he realised he was interested in the scientific side of Arctic exploration and brought back specimens for the British Museum and Kew. He even brought back live polar bears for London Zoo," she says.By his fourth expedition, Leigh Smith's enthusiasm for Arctic exploration was so advanced that he had his own vessel - Eira - specially built. He also named a lot of the places he mapped after friends and family."Mabel Island is named after a niece, Amabel. And the hut the 25 shipwrecked crew made out of driftwood, rocks and masts of ships on his last expedition was named Flora Cottage after his cousin Florence Nightingale," says Moore.With the famous nursing pioneer for a first cousin and a father active in the campaign against the slave trade, Leigh Smith came from an outspoken family.He was also overshadowed by his sister Barbara, a leading feminist and activist for women's rights, which may be part of the reason why he didn't like to talk about his accomplishments, according to Capelotti.But Moore says although Leigh Smith was a private man of few words when it came to his expeditions, with his log books a "bare record - simple, factual and unemotional", he was seen as a forceful character in the family home."In my family he's seen as both a hero and a villain. His Arctic stuff is heroic, but he tried to prevent the marriage of one of his nieces and laid down rules over that."They did marry after they were 21, but the same forceful character that led people to safety at sea could apparently be uncomfortable within the family and the feud with Ben went on for many years. At the same time, people were in awe of him."You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>'Flying' care visits 'disgraceful'</title>
      <description>Short care visits mean disabled people must choose between staying thirsty or using the toilet, a charity warns, amid claims the practice is rising in England.</description>

      <date>1381128188</date>
      <body>Short care visits to elderly and disabled people are "disgraceful" and on the rise, a charity has claimed.In England, 60% of councils use 15-minute visits, which are not long enough to provide adequate care Leonard Cheshire Disability says.The charity says such visits can "force disabled people to choose whether to go thirsty or to go to the toilet".But care managers insisted some short visits could be "fully justified and fully adequate".Leonard Cheshire is pushing for a ban on what it calls the "scandal of flying 15-minute visits", lobbying the government to outlaw the practice in England.A report published by the charity said short visits "simply do not allow enough time to deliver good-quality care".It said data from 63 local authorities pointed to a 15% rise in such visits in the last five years, and said some in councils more than 75% of care visits were carried out in less than 15 minutes.Chief executive Clare Pelham said visits should be at least 30 minutes long."It is disgraceful to force disabled people to choose whether to go thirsty or to go to the toilet by providing care visits as short as 15 minutes long," she said.Ms Pelham said most people need 40 minutes to get up, washed, dressed and have breakfast."We are treating disabled and older people as if they are robots to be serviced, rather than real people who deserve to be treated with kindness and consideration," she added.But the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass), which represents care managers, argued it was "totally wrong" to suggest all caring tasks require more than 15 minutes.Sandie Keene, the association's president, said some short visits were "fully justified and fully adequate".It was "frankly naive to believe that simply by abolishing 15-minute slots a magic wand will have been waved, and improvements automatically achieved in our care services," she added."It doesn't work like that."Ms Keene said social workers and their managers had to make "horrendously difficult choices" every day to give the best possible care with limited resources.Leonard Cheshire wants peers to back a ban on short visits by amending the government's Care Bill when it is debated in the House of Lords on Wednesday.The Local Government Association (LGA), pointed to a "substantially underfunded" social care service which was putting councillors under increasing pressure."Significant cuts to council funding mean local authorities are struggling to meet the rising demand for home care visits," said Katie Hall, chairwoman of the LGA's community and wellbeing board.She said 15-minute visits "should never be the sole basis for care", but added: "In some circumstances such as administering medication they can be appropriate, but only as part of a wider comprehensive care plan involving longer one-to-one visits."Leonard Cheshire Disability said a survey of 2,025 people found 93% of those who expressed an opinion agreed 15 minutes was "not long enough to support a disabled or older person to do everyday things like wash, dress and get out of bed in the morning".</body>

      <title>Kerry defends US Libya capture</title>
      <description>US Secretary of State John Kerry defends the US seizure of a suspected al-Qaeda leader in Libya, who he said was a "legal and appropriate target".</description>

      <date>1381133202</date>
      <body>US Secretary of State John Kerry has defended the capture of an alleged al-Qaeda leader, Anas al-Liby, on Saturday as a "legal and appropriate target".He is a suspected mastermind of the 1998 US embassy attacks in Africa.His son, Abdullah al-Raghie, said his father had been seized by masked gunmen and that some of them were Libyans.Mr Kerry's comments come after Libya called on the US to explain the special forces raid on its territory, one of two by US commandos in Africa Saturday.Mr Kerry said Mr Liby would face justice in a court of law."With respect to Abu Anas al-Liby, he is a key al-Qaeda figure, and he is a legal and an appropriate target for the US military," Mr Kerry told reporters on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Indonesia.Libyan Prime minister Ali Zeidan's office said he had asked for clarification on the raid and stressed Libya was "keen on prosecuting any Libyan citizen inside Libya".Citing surveillance camera footage, Mr Liby's son, Abdullah al-Raghie, said his father was seized in Tripoli early on Saturday by masked gunmen armed with pistols, as he was parking outside his house.He said that those he could see taking his father looked Libyan and spoke a Libyan dialect.He claims the Libyan government was implicated in his father's disappearance - a claim Tripoli denies.On Saturday, US commandos also carried out a raid in southern Somalia, but failed to capture their target.The US Navy Seals' seaborne raid was believed to have focused on a leader of the al-Shabab militant group.Al-Shabab has said it carried out last month's attack on the Westgate shopping centre in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, leaving at least 67 people dead.Anas al-Liby, 49, is believed to have been one of the masterminds behind the 1998 US embassy attacks, which killed more than 220 people in Kenya and Tanzania.He has been indicted in a New York court in connection with the attacks.Liby - whose real name is Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai - has been on the FBI's most wanted list for more than a decade with a $5m (£3.1m) bounty on his head.His brother, Nabih, on Sunday told reporters his brother was innocent, describing the US operation as an "act of piracy".Mr Kerry said the operations in Libya and Somalia showed that the US would never stop "in its effort to hold those accountable who conduct acts of terror".</body>

      <title>'British FBI' crime agency launched</title>
      <description>A new national crime agency labelled the "British FBI" comes into force to tackle and pursue organised criminal gangs.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24418847</url>
      <date>1381126467</date>
      <body>A new body to tackle some of the UK's most serious crimes has been launched.Labelled the "British FBI", the National Crime Agency (NCA) will "relentlessly pursue" organised criminals, the home secretary said.Theresa May told the BBC it would focus on organised, economic and cyber crime, border policing and child protection.It will replace a number of existing bodies but will have significantly less funding. Labour has called the move a "rebranding exercise".It is the third time since 1998 that an organised crime body has been set up.The National Crime Squad was set up 15 years ago, only to be replaced eight years later by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) - which is now being scrapped.The NCA will work with each of the regional police forces in the UK and similar organisations abroad.The agency will have 4,500 officers and aims to adopt a more visible, joined-up approach than was previously the case.Its head, Keith Bristow, warned criminals to expect "continuous disruption", including the confiscation of their assets."We are going to make a difference the public will see," he told the BBC, adding the "British FBI" label was "reasonable shorthand" for the new body.However, unlike the FBI, the NCA does not have responsibility for combating terrorism. That remains the responsibility of Scotland Yard, where the Metropolitan Police oversees a number of regional teams comprising police and MI5 officers.Mrs May told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that the new agency was "designed to be a relentless crime-fighting body which will relentlessly pursue organised criminals".The home secretary said: "Crime is falling in this country, but we can't be complacent. And particularly on organised crime, I don't think the last government put enough emphasis on this."But shadow policing minister David Hanson said the NCA "doesn't match the government's hype"."Most of the NCA is just the rebranding of existing organisations such as the Serious Organised Crime Agency, but with a substantial 20% cut imposed by the Home Office on their overall budget," he said."The new organisation is not strong enough to deal with the exponential growth of economic and online crime."It would simply absorb the existing national cyber crime unit but with fewer resources, he said."It is right to have stronger national action on organised crime with the NCA, on child exploitation and on intelligence - but the government has to support this effort and not simply use this as a rebranding exercise to hide substantial policing cuts."However, Mrs May told the BBC she was satisfied that the NCA was "going to be well resourced".She said the government had already shown it was "possible to keep up that relentless fight against crime" with less money.Keith Vaz, the chairman of the influential Home Affairs Select Committee said: "The organisations going into the NCA have a combined budget of £812m, yet the new agency will only have £473.9m next year."The Home Office needs to account for where this money has gone."Each police force in the UK has territorial responsibility for its particular area. Crimes that are carried out across more than one county or area usually involve officers from both areas.The new body will have a strategic role in which it will attempt to look at the bigger picture of organised crime in the UK, how it operates and how it can be disrupted.The NCA will answer directly to the home secretary and will have significant powers to compel police forces in England, Scotland and Wales to provide assistance and carry out policing operations.The situation will be different in Northern Ireland, where the agency will carry out border and customs functions, but not other crime-fighting roles.Mr Hanson added that this would leave a "serious operational gap" compared with the Serious Organised Crime Agency that the NCA is replacing."It is extremely worrying that organised crime which crosses between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK will not be properly dealt with because the Home Secretary mishandled the legislation with the relevant parties in Northern Ireland," he said.</body>

      <body>Two people, one a police officer, have been killed by a bomb apparently targeting anti-polio campaigners in Pakistan, say police.The blast struck a van near a hospital in Budh Bher suburb of the north-western city of Peshawar.A death toll of six was earlier given but corrected by police.Pakistan is one of only three countries where polio remains endemic, due in part due to militant resistance to polio mass vaccination campaigns.Militants have attacked and killed health workers and banned immunisation teams from some areas, forcing hundreds of thousands of children to miss vaccinations.The two killed in Monday's attack comprised one police officer and a member of a local peace committee, riding in a van as part of an anti-polio campaign, said police officials.Several other people are reported to have been injured. Reports said many were police, but an injured young girl was also pictured in images from the scene.The team inside the van was supposed to be accompanying the health workers administering polio vaccines in order to protect them, reports said.One of them, Rasheed Khan, told Reuters news agency: "I was with the polio team."As soon as we reached the front of the hospital... there was a blast right in front of the gate.We were around 12 or 13 people."Police had earlier reported a higher toll but corrected this upon confirmation from medical sources.The explosive device was reported to have been detonated remotely.The Pakistani news website Dawn quoted police as saying another, bigger, bomb had been found in the vicinity of the first one and the Bomb Disposal Squad called in to defuse it.A fake hepatitis vaccination campaign, run covertly by the CIA, helped to locate al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in 2011. He was then killed in an operation by US Navy Seals.A rising tide of violence has hindered new Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's overtures to end the militant insurgency through peace talks with the Taliban.Peshawar has been particularly hard hit. In just over two weeks, it has suffered four attacks which between them left more than 150 people dead.</body>

      <body>Crime victims with mental illnesses are more likely to feel let down, dismissed or treated without respect by the police, new research suggests.Many of the 361 people questioned said they were often disbelieved when they sought help after a crime.This was despite the fact that those with severe mental illness were three times more likely to be crime victims.The findings come from a three-year study involving academics and the charities Victim Support and Mind.The report, co-authored by Kings College London, Kingston University and St George’s University of London - in collaboration with University College London - is the first British survey into crime victims which compared those with mental illness against the general population.The study said that almost half of people with some form of mental illness had experienced a crime in the last year.It said people with severe mental illness were five times more likely to experience assault, while severely mentally ill women were 10 times more likely to be assaulted.Six out of 10 women in this group reported being victims of sexual violence as adults, the study said.But interviewees said that when they sought help, they often found they were treated unfairly by the police and other agencies. Victims said they found it difficult to convince police to take their reports seriously.In the worst examples, victims said police left them with the impression that they themselves were to blame. Others refused to report crimes out of fear of being detained under mental health legislation.Victims whose cases went to court reported a range of problems which had an impact on their mental health. One interviewee reported meeting the offender while at court, an incident which triggered an episode of self-harming.The authors called for police and other agencies to be better trained to help mentally-ill victims of crime and said responses to incidents should be properly monitored and assessed.Javed Khan, chief executive of Victim Support, said: “It is nothing short of a national scandal that some of the most vulnerable people in our society become victims of crime so often and yet when they seek help they are met with disbelief or even blame.“It is unacceptable that the criminal justice system fails to meet the needs of people with mental health problems when this report shows all too clearly the terrible impact of crime on them.”And Paul Farmer, Mind’s chief executive, said: “Being a victim of crime is a horrible experience for anyone to cope with but when you have a mental health problem the impact on your life can be even worse.“People with mental health problems have an equal right to justice, yet this report reveals that this is not the reality for far too many of us.”Commander Christine Jones of the Association of Chief Police Officers said it had supported the research because senior officers recognised that the experiences of people with mental illnesses were not widely understood.“Anyone reporting a crime against them expects to be listened to, taken seriously and treated with respect,” she said.“Policing and mental health is high on the agenda for chief constables. We support the recommendations in this report, which will further that work.”The research team interviewed a random sample of 361 people in London who have severe mental illness and the results were compared with official data in the Crime Survey for England and Wales. Further in-depth interviews were conducted with 81 people with mental health problems who had been victims of crime during the last three years.</body>

      <title>Two Tories quit government posts</title>
      <description>Deputy Chief Whip John Randall and Cabinet Office Minister Chloe Smith resign from the government amid speculation of an imminent reshuffle.</description>

      <body>Two Conservative members of the government have quit amid speculation of an imminent ministerial reshuffle.Deputy Chief Whip John Randall and Cabinet Office Minister Chloe Smith stepped down late on Sunday.Mr Randall, 58, has been Conservative MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip since 1997, while Chloe Smith has represented Norwich North since 2009.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said a government reshuffle could take place as soon as Monday.He said it was likely to focus on "mid-ranking ministers below Cabinet level".As deputy chief whip, Mr Randall was partly responsible for ensuring party discipline among fellow Tory MPs.He offered to quit at the end of last year, his resignation letter said.Ms Smith, 31, served in the Treasury before being moved to the Cabinet Office last September.Stepping down, she wrote to the prime minister pointing out she had been "only 27" when she became an MP and said she now wanted to "develop other ways of giving public service".She was thrust into the limelight last summer when she appeared on BBC Two's Newsnight to defend the government's fuel duty policy.The widely-viewed interview with Jeremy Paxman prompted one Tory MP to label Chancellor George Osborne a "coward" for putting her forward in his place.Mr Randall had worked in the whips' office, either in government or opposition, for 13 years.In his resignation letter he paid tribute to David Cameron said it had been "a great privilege and honour" to serve the party.The departures come after Transport Minister Simon Burns quit his post on Friday to launch a bid to become a deputy commons speaker.Our political editor said: "The prime minister is known to be keen to promote women and those representing northern constituencies ahead of the general election and a wider Cabinet reshuffle which may take place next spring."BBC political correspondent Vicky Young says the Tories have a lot of talented women in junior roles who could be candidates for promotion.It is thought that Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will also make changes to the Liberal Democrat ministerial line-up and Labour leader Ed Miliband is expected to reshuffle his shadow ministerial team.</body>

      <body>Powerful Typhoon Fitow has rammed into eastern China after triggering the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people.With winds up to 151km/h (93mph), the storm landed in Fujian province early on Monday, bringing heavy rains and causing widespread power cuts.The authorities earlier issued the highest alert - red - for the area.At least two people have been killed by the typhoon, state-run news agency Xinhua reported.One victim was on his way to rescue a fisherman when he was blown off a hill by strong winds late on Sunday, Xinhua said.Some homes are said to have collapsed in neighbouring Zhejiang province and two port workers are missing.Typhoon Fitow - named after a flower - made landfall at 01:15 local time on Monday (17:15 GMT Sunday) in the city of Fuding, Chinese meteorologists said.The typhoon had affected over three million people in Zhejiang and caused economic damage of over 2bn yuan ($330m; £200m), Xinhua said, citing the provincial flood control office.Parts of China have been hit by up to 200mm (8 inches) of rain, AFP news agency reported.Over the weekend the authorities drafted in the army to help strengthen flood defences, the BBC's John Sudworth in Shanghai reports.China is used to dealing with extreme weather events but, nonetheless, the risk to life remains high, our correspondent adds.In Fujian, 177,000 people were evacuated before the storm hit the coast, Xinhua said, while in Zhejiang, some 574,000 people had to leave their homes.Some 35,000 boats in Zhejiang and 30,000 in Fujian were ordered to return to harbour for shelter.Coastal facilities such as seaside bathing centres were also closed, state media reported."We must not leave anybody in danger," Zhejiang Governor Li Qiang was quoted as saying.The typhoon also caused suspension of bullet trains and coach services in several cities in the area.Dozens of flights to and from Wenzhou airport in Zhejiang were cancelled.The storm is now moving north-west and is expected to weaken quickly.Typhoon Fitow is the 23rd typhoon to hit China this year, Xinhua reported.It comes just weeks after Typhoon Usagi killed at least 25 people in southern Guangdong province.</body>

      <body>At least 50 people have been killed and scores hurt in Egypt in clashes between police and supporters of the deposed Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.More than 200 members of the Muslim Brotherhood were arrested in Cairo, where most of the deaths were reported.Supporters of Mr Morsi marched in several cities, as the military-backed government marked the 40th anniversary of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.Morsi supporters say he was deposed in a military coup in July.Hundreds of people had gathered in Cairo's Tahrir Square to celebrate the anniversary.Jets and Apache helicopters flew overhead in formation, as part of a grand display of military hardware by the government.The crowd cheered the flypasts, a number of people carrying portraits of defence chief Gen Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Some want him to stand as Egypt's next president.But the BBC's Quentin Sommerville in Cairo says supporters of Mr Morsi also took to the streets in their thousands, trying to make their way to the square and calling Gen Sisi a murderer.Security forces used tear gas and fired into the air to stop them.In the upmarket Dokki district, a number of protesters were hit by live rounds, some by birdshot. In return they threw rocks at police and soldiers, our correspondent says.The street battles raged for hours, with small fires burning and black smoke rising in several parts of the capital.But the military succeeded in keeping the rival supporters apart, our correspondent says.The interior ministry earlier warned it would confront any "attempts that may disturb the 6 October celebrations", the Mena state news agency reported.In a televised address, Prime Minister Hazem Beblawi described it as a "critical time" for the country and urged Egyptians to "stand together, be optimistic about the future".The health ministry said that in addition to the Cairo deaths, one person was killed in Delga, about 300km (190 miles) south of Cairo, and another in Bani Suef, 80km south of the capital.There were also clashes in the Suez Canal city of Ismailiya.Hundreds of Islamist protesters have died in violence since the Egyptian military deposed Mr Morsi in July, 13 months after he was elected as president.He and other senior Brotherhood figures have been imprisoned and face trial.The authorities are moving to seize the movement's assets after its activities were banned as part of a crackdown.However, Brotherhood supporters have continued to take to the streets to protest - albeit in smaller numbers than before.Send your pictures and videos to yourpics@bbc.co.uk or text them to 61124 (UK) or +44 7624 800 100 (International).

      <title>Royal Mail undervalued, says Labour</title>
      <description>The shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, says the government's privatisation of Royal Mail has "undervalued" the firm by as much as £1bn.</description>

      <date>1381133307</date>
      <body>The privatisation of Royal Mail undervalues the company by as much as a £1bn, with City investors and hedge funds being the biggest beneficiaries of the share offering, says shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Umunna said that the sale is "short changing" taxpayers.The government said it was following "normal commercial practice".Members of the public can apply for the shares online until 8 October.Shares will begin trading in full on 15 October.62% of the business will be sold, with the rest remaining state-owned.Under the terms of the share sale, a 10% stake in the business has been reserved for Royal Mail employees.There is a £750 minimum amount for members of the public wishing to purchase Royal Mail shares, with the threshold falling to £500 for Royal Mail employees.Mr Umunna said that the £750 minimum application was too high."That is a lot of money for most people - it is out of reach for many. Most of the people benefiting from this will be the speculators and the hedge funds".The government may also sell an additional 15% of its stake in what is called an "over-allotment" option, if the demand for shares was very high.Labour has already said that it would not renationalise Royal Mail after it is privatised.In response to Mr Umunna's comments, the Department for Business said: "This is a commercial transaction and government is following normal commercial practice in setting and publicising the share price and delivering value for the taxpayer. The value of Royal Mail will depend on a number of factors, notably the company's on-going financial performance, its future prospects and the level of investor interest."On Friday it was reported that demand for shares is outstripping supply, and they are to be sold at the top end of the government's suggested range.Initially the government priced the shares at 260-330p, however, they are to be sold between 300-330p. Shares will begin trading in full on the London Stock Exchange on 15 October.BBC business editor Robert Peston said applications for the shares are a "few times" the value of those on offer.Members of the Communication Workers Union are currently being balloted on a potential strike over the planned privatisation, and other pay issues.The strike vote closes on 16 October, and the earliest a strike could be held is seven days after that.</body>

      <title>Walking more 'would save thousands'</title>
      <description>Thousands of lives could be saved each year in the UK if people walked more, according to a report from two charities.</description>

      <body>Tens of thousands of lives could be saved each year in the UK if people got off the sofa and stretched their legs more, say charities.The "Walking Works" report by the Ramblers and Macmillan Cancer Support said walking was a free activity which could transform people's health.Being physically active decreases the odds of heart problems and stroke.But it also makes a difference in other conditions such as type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and many cancers.Last week a British Medical Journal study showed that exercise was as good a medicine as pills for some conditions including heart diseases and another study showed walking at least an hour a day significantly cut the risk of breast cancer.The latest report said that if everyone, in England alone, did the recommended 150 minutes of moderate physical exercise every week it would:The two charities run the Walking for Health programme in an attempt to get more people up on their feet.Benedict Southworth, chief executive of the Ramblers, said: "We're facing a serious crisis of inactivity, but there is a simple solution,"We need to see greater investment in initiatives which support and promote walking as the most accessible and affordable way for people to get active."Ciarán Devane, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: "For cancer patients, being active can help manage some of the debilitating consequences of treatment and can even help reduce the chance of some cancers returning."Inactivity is a nationwide epidemic that must be tackled now before it is too late."Public Health England said inactivity had "life threatening consequences".Its director of health and wellbeing Prof Kevin Fenton said: "Inactivity increases the risk of serious illnesses like type 2 diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers."It makes it more likely that people will be overweight or obese. Supporting people to get active through walking can be a major part of the solution."</body>

      <title>Buckingham Palace to host football</title>
      <description>Buckingham Palace is hosting its first official football match later, to mark the Football Association's 150th anniversary.</description>

      <body>Buckingham Palace is to host its first official football match later, to mark the Football Association's 150th anniversary.The competitive fixture involving two amateur sides was the idea of the Duke of Cambridge, President of the FA.London sides Civil Service FC, the sole survivor of the 11 teams that formed the FA on 26 October 1863, will take on Polytechnic FC, set up in 1875.Prince William will host the event and also present medals to 150 volunteers.The Queen gave permission for the Southern Amateur League fixture to take place.Wembley groundsman Tony Stones worked with royal household gardeners to create the 110 yards x 65 yards (100m x 60m) pitch in the 39-acre (16 hectares) garden.The lawn was seeded in parts to repair wear and tear following a busy summer which saw the grounds host garden parties and the Coronation Festival.The pitch started to be marked out last month.Since then the royal gardeners have been mowing the ground three times a week and creating a criss-cross pattern in the turf to mirror the Wembley stadium pitch.But the turf - made up of rye, bents and fescues - is a mixture of finer grasses than Wembley. And unlike any top flight ground, it also contains patches of camomile, a plant found on the site of Buckingham Palace for centuries.Premier League referee Howard Webb, who officiated at the 2010 World Cup final match in South Africa, will be in charge of the fixture.Civil Service FC were selected to take part in the game and suggested that Polytechnic, who are also based in Chiswick, west London, would be fitting opponents.Polytechnic FC manager Geoff Brown said: "We first played 120 years ago - so there's a fair bit of history between the two of us."He added: "The organisation up to the day has been absolutely manic. It's only now we're getting the chance to soak it all up and get ready for the experience."It's only been this week that I was able to confirm that everybody in the first and second squads will be able to get to the game as well."So there's been a little bit of trepidation, with people not really knowing if they're going to be involved or not - but since Thursday everybody is really buzzing about it now."They all know they are going to be part of something very special."The match forms the centrepiece of the FA's Grassroots Heroes Day, celebrating the work of volunteers including the founders of local clubs, coaches, referees and other officials.</body>

      <title>Haim beat Justin to top album chart</title>

      <body>US band Haim have denied Justin Timberlake his fourth UK number one album, after topping the chart with their debut, Days Are Gone.Timberlake's album, The 20/20 Experience 2 of 2, had led midweek sales by just 28 copies but was overtaken by Californian sisters, Haim.In the singles chart, OneRepublic's Counting Stars claimed victory from The Vamps' Can We Dance.The Official Charts Company said it was "the closest race of the year".Ryan Tedder's band OneRepublic secured its first UK number one after rising two places, with just 1,150 copies standing between the two tracks.The debut record from Haim, made up of sisters Este, Danielle and Alana, had been eagerly anticipated since the band won the BBC's Sound Of 2013 poll in January.Days Are Gone features their three hit singles Don't Save Me, Falling and The Wire, which the band dedicated to Prime Minister David Cameron when they both appeared on the Andrew Marr programme on BBC One last week.It finished the week 2,100 copies ahead of the second instalment of Timberlake's 20/20 Experience album series.The original album, which is still at number 33 in the chart, spent three weeks at Number 1 in March and was the star's third consecutive UK number one album.Last week's number one album - Mechanical Bull by Kings Of Leon - slipped down to three, with Arctic Monkeys' AM static at four and Drake's Nothing Was The Same down to five.Dizzee Rascal's The Fifth enterted the album chart at number ten, while his new single Something Really Bad took the same position in the single's chart.Jason Derulo's single Talk Dirty FT 2 Chainz dropped to number three with Katy Perry's Roar in fourth and Chase and Status in fifth with Count On Me FT Moko.This week's chart also saw Avicii's Wake Me Up become one of the UK's biggest-selling singles of all time, after it broke through the million copies sales barrier on Sunday.The Official Charts Company said the track is only the 140th single to achieve this milestone, and the third of 2013 behind Daft Punk's Get Lucky FT Pharrell Williams and Nile Rodgers, and Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines FT TI and Pharrell Williams.Wake Me Up, by 24-year-old Swedish DJ and Producer Avicii, spent three consecutive weeks at number one after debuting in that position in July, and denied One Direction their fourth UK chart topper with Best Song Ever.</body>

      <body>Sebastian Vettel said he is "trying not to think about" the fact he can win his fourth world title in Japan next week.The Red Bull driver will be champion if he wins at Suzuka and rival Fernando Alonso of Ferrari is lower than eighth.Vettel said: "To be honest, I don't really care. I look forward to Japan because it's one of the nicest tracks."There are a lot of points to get, even though it looks very good for us. There's still a chance for Fernando, so we have to stay on top of our game."After his dominant victory in Korea on Sunday, Vettel is 77 points ahead of Alonso - who finished sixth in Korea - with a maximum of 125 available from the remaining five races.It is more likely Vettel will win the title in either India or Abu Dhabi, the two races after Japan, as Alonso has finished as low as eighth only once this season when he has made it to the end of a race, and that was when his car had a reliability problem in Bahrain.Alonso said: "The championship is a low priority at the moment. It doesn't look so good, not only because of points but more the performance gap that is stopping us thinking about the championship. We will not give up, [but] second in the constructors' championship is more realistic."Japan's Suzuka is Vettel's favourite track, but he said he did not mind at which track he won the title."To be honest, I don't think it really matters," he said. "I think it's an exceptional situation anyway. Even though it looks very good, it's still not over so we shouldn't feel too comfortable."Which track? It's not really important. Sure, there are a couple of tracks that probably mean a little bit more to the drivers than others. I think generally there's no track on the calendar that I dislike but there are a couple of highlights."I think I mentioned on the podium next week, Japan, is one of the highlights in the year, but regarding the championship I think our target is to win the championship and not to win it in one place in particular."He added: "We're just having a good time. We enjoy the fact that the team is working very well. The car is working... it's on the edge to be honest, more so than you would probably think from the outside but it's obviously nice when you get the results like Singapore or this weekend."Red Bull team boss Christian Horner admitted Red Bull would have to "try quite hard to screw it up", but insisted the team were "not focusing" on the fact they were on the verge of a fourth drivers' and constructors' double.</body>

      <title>Morrison showing touches of 'genius'</title>
      <description>West Ham boss Sam Allardyce says he is starting to see the best of Ravel Morrison, describing his goal against Tottenham as "a bit of genius".</description>

      <date>1381088613</date>
      <body>West Ham manager Sam Allardyce said Ravel Morrison has "sorted himself out", describing his goal in a 3-0 win at Tottenham as "a bit of genius".Morrison, 20, joined West Ham last year after off-field problems hindered his progress at Manchester United.Allardyce said: "Sir Alex Ferguson told me 'I hope you sort him out because you will have a top-class player'."I'm not sure I've sorted him out, he's sorted himself out. He's begun to enjoy his football which he loves so much."The manager added: "He enjoys being with the lads and listens to what the experienced players say, and can do something that nobody else can do in our side and you saw that today."Attacking midfielder Morrison was called into the England Under-21 squad for the first time earlier this week and he crowned his international selection with a fine solo goal, running from his own half to take on the Spurs defence and chip goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.It was his fourth goal in eight appearances this term, which Allardyce also thought was "goal of the season" so far, and it lifted his side out of the bottom three.The victory came after Allardyce decided not to name any recognised strikers in his side, with Morrison the furthest forward.Morrison joined Manchester United as a schoolboy but only made three first-team appearances before moving to the Hammers in January 2012, spending last season on loan at Birmingham.In 2011, he was fined £600 by a court for throwing his girlfriend's mobile phone through a window during an argument and in 2008 was cautioned for common assault.Ferguson said at the time of his move to the capital: "In the case of Ravel it's been quite well documented. I think he's better out of Manchester."He's got a great talent but it's how to deal with it that is important."West Ham skipper Kevin Nolan revealed that even after Morrison arrived at West Ham, there were still problems with his conduct away from the pitch.And after praising Allardyce's tactics, Nolan told BBC Sport that the loan spell at Birmingham had made Morrison mature.Nolan, 31, said: "Ravel has been fantastic since he came back [to West Ham]. Last year we had a lot of problems with his lifestyle off the pitch as well as on it, but he went to Birmingham [on loan] and worked really hard, and got back in the team at the end of last season and it was like he was a new man. He is one now. He needs to stand up."Me and Mark Noble speak to him and have had big long chats with him all last season, we try to protect him and take him under our wing and we will continue to do that. Obviously we are going to be excited by his talent, it's frightening and I think if you ask anyone at Manchester United they will tell you the same."But it's about nurturing him and making sure he does the right things on and off the field - you are now starting to see the player that Manchester United saw in him when he was younger."Allardyce added: "He's learnt so much in a short period of time. That's the beauty. The penny has dropped."</body>

      <body>Four-time IndyCar champion Dario Franchitti has fractured his spine in a crash at the Houston Grand Prix.The 40-year-old Scot suffered multiple fractures including a broken ankle after crashing into the track wall.His car flipped into the air following a final lap collision with Takuma Sato and at least 13 spectators were injured as debris flew over safety fencing.Franchitti's team owner Chip Ganassi said: "His ankle and back are a little sore.

      <title>Arsenal have steel and a plan B - Savage</title>
      <description>Robbie Savage identifies solidity, confidence and flexibility as the reasons why Arsenal are the Premier League pace-setters</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24422234</url>
      <date>1381099093</date>
      <body>In his regular BBC Sport column on football tactics, Robbie Savage watches Arsenal return to the top of the Premier League with a hard-fought draw against another in-form team, West Brom.This was not a free-flowing display from the Gunners, but the way they played was a demonstration of why they are the pacesetters going into the international break - and genuine title contenders again.Against the Baggies, Mathieu Flamini underlined his importance to Arsene Wenger's side as a shield in front of the centre-backs.In front of Flamini, Arsenal's more creative players did not have their most productive day because of how solid West Brom were in midfield.But the different attacking options available to Wenger when he has a fully fit squad will give him a lot of encouragement.Flamini could turn out to be Arsenal's most important player this season.I was surprised when they brought him back to the club but, the fact is, he gives Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny so much more confidence when they are behind him.He protects his defenders and organises the players around him too.Wenger will have some decisions to make about who else fits into his midfield when the likes of Theo Walcott and Santi Cazorla return from injury.But, when he has a fully fit squad, he will have the ability to pick a team best suited to breaking down the opposition.That did not happen against West Brom because, with fast and naturally wide players like Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Lukas Podolski unavailable, many of the Gunners' attacks were very narrow.Jack Wilshere, Mesut Ozil and Aaron Ramsey, the three attacking midfielders in their 4-2-3-1 formation, were up against the middle of a Baggies defence that was screened effectively by Youssouf Mulumbu and Claudio Yacob.The lack of space in the centre of the pitch meant Ozil was forced deeper than he has been playing with great effect in previous games - such as his debut against Sunderland last month or in the Champions League against Napoli in midweek - although he still had a hand in his side's equaliser.And, with Walcott absent and Wilshere struggling to get into the game on the left side of that midfield trio, Arsenal had to look to their full-backs to offer the sort of threat through pace and width that we are used to seeing from Wenger's side on the counter-attack.Kieran Gibbs and Carl Jenkinson both got forward well down the flanks but, for the most part, West Brom dealt with them comfortably.In the second half we saw an example of how Wenger can switch things around when he brought on Tomas Rosicky to play on the left and moved Wilshere inside, just before he scored the equaliser.Once Walcott and Cazorla are fit again, I think we will see an even more flexible Gunners line-up. And I think Wenger will enjoy having the problem of who to leave out.I think Cazorla has to play as part of that attacking midfield trio alongside Ozil and Ramsey.And I see Wilshere dropping back to play as a more defensive-minded midfielder alongside Flamini, meaning Mikel Arteta would be the unlucky man to miss out.Walcott, in theory, could come into any of the attacking positions - including replacing Olivier Giroud as their main striker.He might start more games than he likes on the bench, but he can make a difference from there too.We saw against Napoli in midweek, when Ozil pulled the strings, that Arsenal's system can work without the sort of out-and-out pace Walcott offers.Against West Brom, it didn't work so well. But, when that happens again, Walcott - or Podolski or Oxlade-Chamberlain for that matter - could offer Wenger something he has not had for a while: a plan B.If you study the stats, not a lot has changed with the current Arsenal side from the team that finished fourth in the Premier League last year.The only real difference comes in terms of possession. Arsenal still see more of the ball than most other teams in the league but, at 53.28%, their average possession this season is the lowest it has been in any of the last 10 campaigns.But the biggest change in this Arsenal team is their confidence. They look like title contenders again, and they know it.The reason for that belief is primarily the signing of Ozil, who has lifted the whole club, but also down to the fact they have carried on their form from the end of last season to the start of this one.Part of that consistency comes down to the fact they did not lose any significant players from last season either.Wilshere apart, they did not have any stand-out stars that other big clubs wanted to sign, but it gives them the most settled look of all the title contenders.This is Arsenal's best chance of winning the title since their last triumph in 2003-04. For me, it is a race between them, Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool. The best I see Manchester United or Tottenham managing is fourth.Robbie Savage was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.</body>

      <title>Airbus in $9.5bn Japan Airlines deal</title>
      <description>Aircraft manufacturing giant Airbus announces a $9.5bn (£5.9bn) deal with Japan Airlines, its first with the carrier, to sell 31 of its A350 planes.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24424873</url>
      <date>1381128896</date>
      <body>Aircraft manufacturing giant Airbus has announced its first deal with Japanese carrier Japan Airlines (JAL).It has won an order from JAL for 31 of its A350 planes, in a deal worth nearly $9.5bn (£5.9bn) at list prices.The A350 is designed to be more fuel-efficient and is a direct competitor to US rival Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, which has been hit by safety and technical issues in recent months.The deal is a blow for Boeing, which has dominated Japan's aviation market."This is Airbus' largest order for the A350 so far this year and is the largest ever order we have received from a Japanese airline," said Fabrice Bregier, chief executive of Airbus."I must say that achieving this breakthrough order and entering a traditional competitor market was one of my personal goals."According to the deal, JAL also has an option to purchase an additional 25 planes.In recent years, the aviation industry has been hurt by a slowdown in demand and high volatility in global fuel prices.That has seen many leading carriers turn to more fuel-efficient aircraft in an attempt to cut down costs and maintain profitability.Both Airbus and Boeing have seen a surge in demand for such planes.Airbus, which says the A350 will use about 25% less fuel than previous generation wide-bodied aircraft, has had 725 orders for the plane prior to securing the JAL deal.The company hopes to start delivering the first A350s to customers by the end of 2014.Yoshiharu Ueki, president of Japan Airlines, said the new planes would offer "high level of operational efficiency and product competitiveness" and help the airline to cater to "new business opportunities after slots at airports in Tokyo are increased".Meanwhile, Boeing's 787 Dreamliner continues to remain popular despite this year's temporary worldwide grounding of the aircraft while safety regulators investigated the cause of fires. The firm has received orders for more than 950 Dreamliner jets so far.Japanese carriers, JAL and All Nippon Airways (ANA), are two of the biggest operators of the Dreamliner jets.</body>

      <title>'Over half of schools failing in RE'</title>
      <description>More than half of schools in England are failing pupils on religious education, says watchdog Ofsted.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24399813</url>
      <date>1381051158</date>
      <body>More than half of England's schools are failing pupils on religious education, the schools watchdog Ofsted has said.Its report accuses schools and the government of failing to focus effectively on the subject.It adds that six in 10 schools are not "realising the subject's full potential" in an increasingly globalised and multicultural century.The Religious Education Council for England and Wales called the findings disappointing but not surprising.The report highlights low standards, weak teaching, weak examination provision and confusion about the purpose of RE.In particular, it says the recent introduction of the English Baccalaureate measure for pupils who achieve grade C or above in English, mathematics, science, a language and either history or geography, ignores RE and has further marginalised the subject.The report echoes comments by the Education Secretary Michael Gove. In July he told religious leaders RE had "suffered" because of government changes.He said he had thought that because schools have a statutory duty to provide RE lessons the subject was protected.Ofsted's report, Religious Education: realising the potential, says the subject "plays a key role in promoting social cohesion and the virtues of respect and empathy, which are important in our diverse society" but it finds "many pupils leave school with scant subject knowledge and understanding".It adds: "Moreover RE teaching often fails to challenge and extend pupils' ability to explore fundamental questions about human life, religion and belief."Inspectors visited a sample of 185 schools, both primary and secondary, between September 2009 and July 2012.They found achievement and teaching in RE was less than good in six out of 10 primary schools, and in fewer than half of secondary schools and that not enough had been done to improve provision since a previous report in 2010.Teaching in primary schools was "not good enough because of weaknesses in teachers understanding of the subject", they found.Standards were higher for GCSE and sixth form students but even at GCSE level teaching often "failed to secure the core aim of the examination specifications, that is to enable pupils to adopt an enquiring, critical and reflective approach to the study of religion."The authors urge the Department for Education (DfE) to consider whether the quality and quantity of statutory RE provision should be decided locally by schools and local authorities - or specified by central government.They want the DfE to work with professional RE teaching associations to "clarify the aims and purposes of RE" and to improve teacher training.Schools should ensure that teaching deepens "pupils' understanding of the nature, diversity and impact of religion and belief in the contemporary world," they urge.John Keast, chairman of the Religious Education Council for England and Wales said they had been warning "for some time about the poor state of religious education in many schools".He said they would publish their own report and RE curriculum later in October."It is now vital that the DfE works with the Religious Education Council on putting things right. We can do better than this."Stephen Evans of the National Secular Society said the recommendations did not go far enough."With the freedom to determine their own syllabus for RE, many schools with a religious character abuse the subject and use it for missionising."Young people would be better served by a new national curriculum subject for all pupils that covers a variety of religious, non-religious and secular philosophies and world views."Meanwhile, Gail Larkin from the National Association of Head Teachers said consecutive governments were responsible for schools placing less emphasis on the subject.She said: "Some of the major policy changes that we've had, the impact has been to convey the message that RE is of less value than other subjects."So, as a head teacher... we are concentrating more - as we've been told to do by consecutive governments - on core subjects and subjects that can be measured.""Unfortunately", she added, "I think RE has fallen off the radar".</body>

      <body>The alleged mastermind behind the online illegal drugs marketplace Silk Road is too dangerous to be bailed, US prosecutors have said.Ross Ulbricht, 29, was arrested this week and is charged with being the administrator of the site which has now been shut down.He is also accused of trying to arrange the killing of one of the site's users."We deny all charges and that is the end of the discussion at this point," Mr Ulbricht's lawyer said.Mr Ulbricht appeared in a San Francisco court on Friday wearing a green T-shirt under red jail clothes and had his ankles shackled.A request from his legal team for his bail hearing to be pushed back was granted - it will now take place on 9 October.Federal magistrate Joseph Spero asked Mr Ulbricht's lawyer Brandon LeBlanc whether seeing the criminal indictment that included a murder-for-hire charge had "changed his calculus" on whether he thought Mr Ulbricht would be granted bail.As part of its criminal complaint, the FBI alleged that Mr Ulbricht had sought to pay a Silk Road user to kill another user who had threatened to expose details of the site's users.Prosecutors opposed the delay, arguing that Mr Ulbricht represented a danger to the community, and that there was a high likelihood that he may attempt to flee.The Silk Road was a well-known destination on Tor, a so-called "dark web" service that anonymises users, making it much more difficult for authorities to track locations.The site sold a range of items, but was most famous for offering a host of illegal drugs, paid for using virtual currency Bitcoin.</body>

      <title>'Digital baby' screen for sperm donors</title>
      <description>A service that digitally weaves together the DNA of prospective parents to check for potential disease in thousands of "virtual babies" is set to launch in the US by December.</description>

      <body>A service that digitally weaves together the DNA of prospective parents to check for potential disease in thousands of "virtual babies" is set to launch in the US by December.New York start-up Genepeeks will initially focus on donor sperm, simulating before pregnancy how the genetic sequence of a female client might combine with those of different males.Donors that more often produce "digital children" with a higher risk of inherited disorders will be filtered out, leaving those who are better genetic matches.Everything happens in a computer, but experts have raised ethical questions."We are just in the business right now of giving prospective mothers, who are using donor sperm to conceive, a filtered catalogue of donors based on their own underlying genetic profile," Genepeeks co-founder Anne Morriss told BBC News."We are filtering out the donor matches with an elevated risk of rare recessive paediatric conditions."Ms Morriss, an entrepreneur, gave a presentation on the company at the Consumer Genetics Conference in Boston last week.She was motivated in part by her own experience of starting a family. Her son was conceived with a sperm donor who happened to share with Morriss the gene for an inherited disorder called MCADD.MCADD (medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency) prevents those affected from converting fats to sugar. It can be fatal if it is not diagnosed early. Luckily, in Ms Morriss's case, the condition was picked up in newborn screening tests."My son has a pretty normal life," Ms Morriss said, "but about 30% of children with rare genetic diseases don't make it past the age of five."Genepeeks has formalised a partnership with a sperm bank - the Manhattan Cryobank - and has a patent pending on the DNA screening technology.The start-up benefits from the rapid pace of change in genetic technology.Indeed, six months ago, Genepeeks' founders decided it was able to use a superior system for DNA analysis (called "targeted exon sequencing") than the one originally envisaged - a result, says Anne Morriss, of falling costs and increased flexibility.For couples planning babies, other companies already screen one or both partners for genes that could cause disease if combined with a similar variant - so-called "carrier screening".One academic who studies the use of genetic technology commented: "This is like that, but ramped up 100,000 times."Ms Morriss's business partner, Prof Lee Silver, a geneticist and expert on bioethics at Princeton University, New Jersey, told BBC News: "We get the DNA sequence from two prospective parents. We simulate the process of reproduction, forming virtual sperm and virtual eggs. We put them together to form a hypothetical child genome."Then we can look at that hypothetical genome and - with all the tools of modern genetics - determine the risk that the genome will result in a child with disease. We're looking directly for disease and not carrier status. For each pair of people that we're going to analyse, we make 10,000 hypothetical children."The process will be run for the client and each potential donor one by one, scanning for some 600 known single-gene recessive conditions. In this way, the highest-risk pairings can be filtered out.Anne Morriss added: "At this stage our clients won't be receiving any genetic information back. We're very much focused on the practical utility of helping prospective parents who want to protect their future kids, giving them the option of additional analysis to what is currently being offered in the industry."But the company's founders have plans to expand the screening beyond single-gene recessive disorders to more complex conditions in which multiple genes play a part.Indeed, going to the trouble of simulating thousands of digital children deliberately lays the ground for this: "[It's] impossible to get towards an accurate risk calculation in any other way," said Anne Morriss.And in a video produced by the company, Prof Silver says: "My hope for the future is that any people who want to have a baby can use this technology to greatly reduce the risk of disease being expressed in their child."To some, such a prospect might appear like a step towards designer babies - until now the preserve of science fiction literature and films such as Gattaca, which envisaged a future of genetic "haves" and "have-nots".Bio-ethicists approached by the BBC said Genepeeks was a logical outcome of the increasing demand for more information when making reproductive decisions.However, some raised potential concerns about risk communication and the expansion of screening beyond rare single-gene disorders. But they suggested there were few, if any, regulatory barriers.One ethicist told BBC News: "The biggest question for me, just from the outset, is the understanding of uncertainty. Even people who have been doing genomics for years still have a hard time figuring out exactly what a risk for a particular genetic predisposition really means for a family."Gene-environment interactions can lead to people either having disease or not having disease."Dr Ewan Birney, associate director of the European Bioinformatics Institute in Hinxton, UK, echoed the point: "It's good that they're focusing on the carrier status of these rare Mendelian disorders where it's potentially more clear-cut. That said, these things are more complex than they first seem," he said."I'm sure the scientists appreciate that complexity. But when transmitting that complexity to everyday people, these things can sound more absolute than they really are."He added: "The thing I would want to stress here is just how complex this is. It's great that people are thinking of using this technology in lots of different ways, but our knowledge gap is very large."Risk communication to clients was, said Anne Morriss, "absolutely critical to anyone in this industry"."We have to be crystal clear about what we're testing for, what risks we're helping to reduce; that there's no guarantee you won't give birth to a sick child," she said.Prof Mildred Cho, associate director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics in California, raised questions over whether the sperm donor should also receive information about their genome gleaned from the screening process."Unlike hair colour, occupation or family history - those are things, presumably, the donor already knows - the thing that's different about this that I see is it could create information that the donor doesn't already have. It also has implications for the donor's other biological family members," Prof Cho told BBC News.This week it also emerged that California-based consumer genetics company 23andMe had submitted the patent on a DNA analysis tool for planning a child.Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter</body>

      <body>Tickets for next year's Glastonbury Festival have sold out in record time, according to organisers.Michael and Emily Eavis issued a joint statement confirming all 120,000 remaining tickets had been sold in just one hour and 27 minutes.They said they were "blown away" by the numbers logging on and were "genuinely sorry" that so many had missed out.Ticketing website See Tickets had earlier apologised to customers on Twitter for "technical difficulties".The site, which had been managing the sale of tickets for Glastonbury, wrote that the issues had led to "a very difficult half an hour" before the site stabilised, later adding that it was selling 3,000 tickets a minute.Prices for the 2014 event had been increased by £10 to £210, plus a booking fee, but festival-goers could pay a deposit of £50 before settling their bill in April.For the first time, coach packages were available three days earlier, with all 15,000 tickets selling out in half an hour.A statement by the father and daughter Eavis team, Michael and Emily, was posted on the festival's own Twitter feed, saying: "We genuinely try to make the ticket system as fair as it can be, but when demand outstrips supply, it is an unfortunate inevitability that some people will be left disappointed."They went on to thank people for their "incredible support", adding: "We really don't take it for granted and we are exceedingly fortunate to have that loyalty."No acts have yet been confirmed to play at the festival at Worthy Farm between 26 and 29 June next year, but there is already speculation about who will headline.David Bowie is one of the bookies' favourites, with other rumours including Foo Fighters and Fleetwood Mac.This year saw Arctic Monkeys, Rolling Stones and Mumford and Sons top the bill on the festival's famous Pyramid Stage.</body>

      <title>The heat-seeking snake that locks on to headlamps</title>
      <description>It's easy to campaign to save endangered species like pandas and woolly spider monkeys because they're fluffy and cute - it's much harder to stick up for venomous snakes.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24396013</url>
      <date>1381018749</date>
      <body>It's easy to campaign to save endangered species like pandas and woolly spider monkeys because they're fluffy and cute. But what about venomous snakes? These are crucial predators in Brazil's Atlantic rainforest ecosystem, and a local doctor has made it his life's work to save one of the most dangerous.Carnival was in full swing in the small Brazilian coastal town of Itacare when a giant snake measuring 6m long slithered down the streets, sending hundreds of revellers screaming into roadside bars. Until recently the snake would have been killed. The police were standing by with shotguns. But instead the local doctor was summoned.Dr Rodrigo Souza moved to the north-eastern state of Bahia 12 years ago and developed a fascination with the rainforest and its wildlife. Now whenever a strange creature ventures into a built-up area, the doctor is called. He was even asked to rescue a group of confused penguins that had been swept up from the Falkland Islands by the mighty South Atlantic current.Souza identifies the carnival incident as a turning point in his battle to save endangered species in this dwindling patch of Atlantic rainforest in which he has made his home.When he first moved to Bahia it was common to see people illegally selling birds, snakes and monkeys at the side of the road. That rarely happens now. The authorities have clamped down and the local people have become more aware of the importance of saving their unique ecosystem. On the day I drove to visit him, someone stopped the traffic in the middle of the road to allow a snake to cross.But Souza's real passion is the Atlantic bushmaster, one of the most poisonous snakes in the western hemisphere. Thick-bodied and up to 3m long, these majestic creatures have distinctive orange and black markings and heat-seeking sensors under the eyes that allow them to lock on to warm-blooded mammals. A human can die within an hour of being bitten unless they receive the right anti-venom injection.There are 35 bushmasters living in Souza's private snake sanctuary, which has a "No Entry" sign on the door bearing a large skull and crossbones.He's been compared by the Brazilian media to Grizzly Man, the American environmentalist who lived among the grizzly bears of Alaska until one of them killed him. Grizzly Man's life and death was the subject of a documentary by the German film-maker Werner Herzog. But Souza resents the comparisons: "I'm under no illusions about my snakes," he says. "They have no idea who I am and I know they would not hesitate to kill me."I admit to feeling absolutely terrified when he invites me into the sanctuary to watch him casually lifting up a 2m-long snake with an instrument resembling a giant metal tuning fork. Before handling them he zips into an insulated bodysuit that stops him from giving off too much heat. Meanwhile I'm standing a safe distance away - trembling with fear - in shorts and a T-shirt.The bushmaster has an almost mythological status amongst the indigenous people of the rainforest. Because of its attraction to heat they called it the "fire extinguisher" and have warned Souza never to sit near an open fire in bushmaster territory - because the snakes can leap a distance of several metres towards a heat source and at very high speed. He was once called to a road traffic accident where a bushmaster snake had attacked the headlamp of a passing motorbike.Rodrigo Souza is the first and probably only person ever to successfully breed the Atlantic bushmaster in captivity. He milks his snakes for venom which he then uses to make an antidote for snake-bite victims. The Bushmaster venom also contains unique medical properties of interest to cancer researchers.However this majestic serpent is now under threat of extinction as its habitat disappears.Along with lion tamarins, cougars and woolly spider monkeys, bushmaster snakes are one of many endangered species unique to Brazil's Atlantic Rainforest. Not to be confused with the mighty Amazon, the Atlantic rainforest once covered the entire coastal region from the north-east to the Argentine border in the south. But now only 6% of it remains, a few tiny islands of green, most in the state of Bahia - and even these are under threat.There are now plans by ENRC, a British-Kazakh mining company, to build a railway right through one of the few remaining areas of virgin Atlantic rainforest.ENRC's aim is to transport iron ore from a mine in the interior to the port of Iheus, despite the region being named by Unesco as a priority region for conservation.It would of course bring jobs. But for Souza, who has been battling for years to preserve this unique ecosystem, it's a slap in the face. For him the railway would be an ecological disaster for the rainforest and his beloved bushmasters.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>The man who dreamed of the atom bomb</title>
      <description>Lisa Jardine tells the story of Leo Szilard, physicist and key pioneer in the development of the atomic bomb.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24395740</url>
      <date>1380905125</date>
      <body>Leo Szilard was the man who first realised that nuclear power could be used to build a bomb of terrifying proportions. Lisa Jardine considers what his story has to say about the responsibilities of science.The figure of Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard loomed large in our house when I was a child. He was held up to me as an exemplary figure in science - a man who had made fundamental breakthroughs in nuclear physics, but whose acute sense of moral probity led him in the end to denounce the very advances he had helped make. Only later did I learn an alternative version of his story.Almost exactly 80 years ago, in early October 1933, Szilard was in London, in transit from Nazi Germany, when an idea came to him that would lead directly to the ultimate weapon of war - the atomic bomb.An article in the Times two weeks earlier had reported a lecture at the British Association by Lord Rutherford - the Nobel prize-winning British physicist and head of the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. Rutherford had described splitting the atom by bombarding it with protons, but had gone on to say that any suggestion that the energy released might be harnessed as a source of power was "talking moonshine".The report caught Szilard's attention. He pondered it obsessively. Surely Rutherford was wrong? Then, early on a dismal, grey morning, as he waited on foot at a traffic light to cross busy Southampton Row near his hotel, the answer came to him in a flash.If a neutron, fired at an atom, produces the release of (say) two neutrons, each of which hits another atom, which both in turn release two more neutrons, which each go on to collide with two further atoms, a nuclear chain reaction would take place, releasing unimaginable amounts of energy.Szilard tells this story twice, with slightly differing details. But the tale itself is consistent and delightfully vivid. The challenge of Rutherford's remark, the heavy cold that had prevented Szilard's attending the lecture, the days spent thinking about it and the flash of inspiration just as the traffic light changed.Szilard immediately recognised the importance of his idea. To ensure its security he patented it in the name of the British Admiralty. The patent included a clear description of "neutron induced chain reactions to create explosions".In August 1939, by which time Szilard had moved on to America, he wrote to President Franklin Roosevelt to inform him that "a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium" was undoubtedly possible, and could lead to the construction of "extremely powerful bombs of a new type". Germany, he warned, might even now be developing such a weapon. "A single bomb of this type," he wrote, "carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory."The letter was signed by Szilard and Albert Einstein. By the time it reached Roosevelt, Germany had invaded Poland. With war now a certainty, the urgency was not lost on the US president. A committee was set up to pursue the nuclear initiative, out of which emerged what came to be known as the Manhattan Project - the hugely ambitious and massively funded programme to develop a functioning atomic bomb in the shortest possible time.But less than six years later in 1945, Szilard campaigned with equal passion to persuade the American government not to use the atomic bomb against a civilian population. He understood better than anyone the enormity of the devastation such a weapon could cause. But his petition, although signed by a large number of nuclear physicists, never reached the president.So devastated was Szilard at his failure to avert the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (the story I was brought up on concluded) that he refused to do any further work in nuclear physics. Instead he moved research areas entirely, to molecular biology - a field concerned with the origins of life rather than its destruction. To my father this audacious step captured the essence of scientific moral responsibility. And I carried Szilard's story with me as I grew up.Today, however, I know that inspiring as it is, there are problems with this tale. As often happens with history, we have to treat with caution a narrative that fits so neatly the interests and preoccupations of the age in which it is written.At the time I was being told this story, Britain was in the depths of the Cold War. In the post-war years it turned out that Szilard (and indeed my own father) found it impossible to obtain work on any scientific project that involved nuclear physics. Though they were barely aware of the stigma themselves, the communist sympathies of their youth barred them from getting the necessary security clearance.So Szilard did not leave physics of his own accord. At the end of the war he was abruptly dismissed from the Manhattan Project by its military head, Gen Leslie Groves. Groves had always suspected him of having Russian sympathies, and now deemed him too high a security risk. Forced to change field, Szilard was indeed prescient in choosing molecular biology, which less than a decade later would uncover "the secret of life" in the form of the structure of DNA.My father's exemplary tale unravels further when we consider the way it presents the progress towards a functioning atomic bomb. It narrates a smooth development from Rutherford's lecture in London, through Szilard's (and his fellow-emigres') journey from Nazi Germany via London to the United States, and Szilard's single-minded preoccupation with the potential threat of nuclear weapons, to the Manhattan Project, and finally to its very American triumphant - or tragic - outcome.But actually Szilard the Hungarian had carried out the crucial early research with the Italian emigre Enrico Fermi, continuing it with him in the early years of the Manhattan Project, where the two of them succeeded in creating a controlled chain reaction - a prerequisite for a functioning bomb. Meanwhile, independently in Britain considerable progress was being made towards a nuclear weapon (a project code-named "Tube Alloys") with the direct encouragement of the prime minister Winston Churchill (who as Graham Farmelo tells us in a recent book, was surprisingly up-to-date himself in nuclear physics). In September 1940 the so-called Tizard mission delivered the top secret work of Tube Alloys to the Americans, to be developed with the greater manpower and financial resources available in the US. The British work made its own vital contribution to the project.Here is a much more fragmented, syncopated and international story, in which it is entirely unclear whether any one nation ultimately takes the credit or blame for the science and engineering behind the atomic bomb. Nor does it carry the clear didactic message of my original.There is one final twist to what started out as a simple story. Some of you will have noticed that I gave the date of Szilard's eureka moment at that traffic light on Southampton Row as October 1933. You may have had a date in September in your mind. The truth is, Szilard tells the story twice, as I mentioned. In one version he records reading the Times report and immediately having the idea of a chain reaction (on 12 September). In the other he recalls fretting over the problem for weeks in his hotel room and pacing the streets of London deep in thought, until the idea eventually came to him (in early October).So although the beginning of the story comes from the mouth of the man himself, we cannot be certain which version is correct. As a historian I have chosen the second as the more plausible, particularly in view of that heavy cold which Szilard tells us prevented his attending Rutherford's lecture on 11 September. But that remains surmise.Historical narratives are never without their agendas. My father's generation lived under the shadow of Hiroshima and Nagasaki - he had been sent to do reconnaissance there only a few months after the bombs were dropped and had seen the consequences all too close up. He told me a story which redeemed the scientist from the enormity of events brought about by fundamental research in physics. It was a story that held the scientist responsible for lethal applications of "pure" research, and proposed Szilard as an iconic figure, for recognising and taking that responsibility upon himself.My father's story of Leo Szilard may not have been the truth. But it taught me, as a child, a lasting, salutary lesson about science and human values.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Badger cull thought to have ended</title>
      <description>A six-week pilot cull of thousands of badgers in west Somerset is believed to have ended.</description>

      <date>1381132471</date>
      <body>A six-week cull of badgers in west Somerset is believed to have ended.The controversial pilot, which has been heavily fought by campaigners, was overseen by Defra in an attempt to stop the spread of TB in cattle.A similar pilot in west Gloucestershire is thought to still be under way. Marksman in both counties are aiming to kill a total of 5,000 badgers.Defra has refused to comment on the success of the cull and neither it nor the NFU could confirm it has ended.Jay Tiernan, spokesman for Stop the Cull, said protesters had "totally destroyed" the pilot.Every night for six weeks, volunteers held patrols of both cull zones to monitor badger setts and worked to disrupt the marksman from shooting.Avon and Somerset Police said just three arrests had been made during the six-week period. In Gloucestershire, 18 people were arrested.Mr Tiernan highlighted the campaigners' two main problems with the cull."The methodology isn't sound, he said."There's a group of badgers, you start shooting them and they disperse. Secondly the shooters can't get at the badgers to shoot them because we're there."The government licensed the shooting to test whether culling can be carried out in a safe, humane and effective way.It will analyse the results from both pilots to decide whether to extend the culling of badgers to other parts of the country.Supporters say it is the only way to eradicate the spread of TB to livestock.James Small, the Somerset chairman of the National Farmers' Union, said: "These are only two pilots and just represent a small step in trying to combat this disease, but I think there is a sense, at least, that a step has been taken."No details on the total number of badgers shot have yet been released despite requests from the BBC for details.</body>

      <description>Unions call for an emergency summit and parliamentary debate in a bid to avert strikes at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical site.</description>

      <date>1381132319</date>
      <body>Unions are calling for an emergency summit and parliamentary debate in a bid to avert strikes at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical site.Workers at the Ineos site have started an overtime ban and work to rule.The dispute centres on the treatment of a union convener.Ineos has warned that its Grangemouth site will close by 2017 if it does not find savings and fresh investment. It said the site had lost more than £150m over the past four years.A spokesman for the company has accused Unite of "fiddling while Rome burns".Finance Secretary John Swinney said the Scottish government would make all efforts to bring both sides together to help resolve the dispute, and get to a position of financial sustainability for the plant.Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme he said: "We have been talking to the company about how we might be able to invest to support the development of the plant."We can only make investment if there is a viable business proposition and that's where we need to have all parties working together to support a proposition that can deliver the employment and the opportunities that we want to see for the plant in Grangemouth, because of its very wider significance for the Scottish economy."Unite workers voted for the industrial action in support of Unite convener Stevie Deans.He was suspended, then reinstated, by the company over allegations linked to his involvement in the row over the selection of a Labour candidate in Falkirk, where he is chairman of the local constituency party.Mr Deans faces an investigation by Ineos over issues linked to the Falkirk row.Unite have accused Ineos of trying to "provoke" a strike, which it warned would be "hugely damaging" to the UK economy.A previous three-day stoppage at the site in 2008 was said to have cost hundreds of millions of pounds in lost production and other knock-on effects.Workers have voted heavily in favour of action up to and including a strike - and Unite officials said they had not ruled out calling for a walkout.Pat Rafferty, the union's Scottish regional secretary, said the company was using the Stevie Deans dispute as an excuse to introduce sweeping reforms, including pension changes, job losses, an end to collective bargaining and worse pay and conditions for new employees.Unite called for a summit with the company and politicians, and urged the Scottish government to hold an emergency debate to help prevent the dispute escalating."The company is holding Stevie Deans hostage, and playing Russian roulette with fuel supplies," Mr Rafferty said."The changes being proposed are completely unpalatable to us and we feel we are being pushed into taking strike action."We are trying to make the company see sense, but we are not ruling anything out at this stage."Unite said the work to rule and overtime ban would slow down maintenance work at Grangemouth, which is split into refinery and petrochemical operations.Ineos has put forward a survival plan and has asked the Scottish and UK governments for grants and loan guarantees totalling £150m.Chairman Calum MacLean has warned "there is no plan B".Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland, Tom Crotty, group director with Ineos, said: "We have got a survival plan. We haven't been sitting on our hands wailing about it, we are doing something about it."What we can do is invest in new terminal facilities that will allow us to bring gas in from the US to replace the gas from the North Sea."But to do that we will have to put another £300m into a site that is losing £10m a month, and we will not do that unless we can sort out this cost base."He added: "While this crucial issue is facing us, which will close the site before 2017 unless something is done, Unite are ignoring it and focusing on this issue about Steven Deans."It is frankly fiddling while Rome burns."On Sunday, the company announced that one of its key customers in Hull, which traditionally took up to 100,000 tonnes of product from Grangemouth, had been forced to close down.The Ineos Vinyl Acetate Monomer (Vam) facility at Saltend said that low cost imports into Europe had made closure inevitable.Mr MacLean said: "Unfortunately the closure of this world-scale Vam unit at the Hull site has a significant knock-on effect at Grangemouth as we lose a major customer for good."</body>

      <body>The fact a new UK-wide policing agency has only limited powers in Northern Ireland, places an extra burden on the PSNI, the justice minister has said.The National Crime Agency (NCA), which comes into operation on Monday, will not operate in Northern Ireland in the same way as the rest of the UK.Sinn Féin and the SDLP blocked a move to give it powers to carry out police operations and recruit agents.Justice Minister David Ford said blocking the legislation was a mistake."I haven't lost hope that we will get full political agreement, that we will be able to see the NCA operational and discussions are ongoing to see if we can get that political agreement," Mr Ford said."In the meantime, the key problem is that in certain issues like child exploitation, like human trafficking, like serious organised crime which is operating in the devolved area, there will be no powers for the NCA and this will place an additional burden on the PSNI."Mr Ford said the PSNI was already facing pressure with the threat from dissident republicans and loyalist street violence."In the face of that the police do not need extra burdens placed on them when there's a fully equipped national agency able to carry out those duties," he said."I visited the Serious Organised Crime Agency last week and I know that some of their staff have already been diverted in support of operations in England and Wales because in effect there's less for them to do because the PSNI is having to take over issues here."Phil Gormley, deputy director of the National Crime Agency, said it was a disappointment that it would not have the same powers in Northern Ireland as in the rest of the UK."We're determined to do all that we can within the limitations placed upon us to better protect the people of Northern Ireland and cut serious and organised crime," he said."It is a disappointment on a professional level that we don't have the powers of constable and can't operate in quite the same way that we can in the rest of the UK."The principal difference is that the NCA officers won't have the powers of the constable and through that will have limited ability to deploy asset recovery powers. We will still have the ability to cover reserved and accepted matters including customs, immigration and national security."SDLP justice spokesman Alban Maginness said they were working to find a way where the NCA's operations would come under the jurisdiction of the PSNI chief constable."We fought long and hard to create the PSNI and we should not undermine its authority or that of the chief constable," he said."Given our history - the meddling and malign interference of British intelligence agencies in the past, particularly in relation to the RUC - it is little wonder that we have grave reservations."The NCA would want to run their own agents in Northern Ireland and conduct their own covert surveillance operations - we do not want that to happen."The NCA will target crime gangs across local, national and international borders.Its head is Keith Bristow.He will be directly accountable to Home Secretary Theresa May for the agency's actions - not to the chief constable of the PSNI, the Policing Board or the Police Ombudsman.Many of the policing powers being given to the NCA have been devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly; therefore it has to agree to give Westminster authority to exercise those powers.These include NCA officers being given:- the powers of a police constable in Northern Ireland;- the authority to carry out searches and make arrests;- the ability to conduct surveillance operations;- the ability to recruit and run informers and agents.The agency would also be responsible for recovering assets from criminals.However, Sinn Féin and the SDLP have refused to support the move - which means the powers will not be extended to Northern Ireland.The police are understood to share the justice minister's concerns about the potential implications of the decision.The PSNI has repeatedly warned that Northern Ireland is increasingly being targeted by international crime gangs operating on a global scale. They believe that cooperation with the NCA is essential.</body>

      <title>School maths results 'disappointing'</title>
      <description>"Disappointing" standards in maths among 14 to 16-year-olds in Wales must be tackled, says an education watchdog.</description>

      <date>1381129541</date>
      <body>"Disappointing" standards in maths among 14 to 16-year-olds in Wales must be tackled, says an education watchdog.Estyn's report said maths was the lowest performing core subject at key stage four - when pupils work towards GCSEs - and the lowest in the UK.Last year the proportion of students in Wales achieving C grade and above at GCSE lagged well behind England.The Welsh government said the report had highlighted both successes and areas that could be improved.Estyn said schools must work hard to raise standards. It is due to publish its report on its website on Monday.Chief inspector Ann Keane said some employers were having to invest in numeracy skills training for school and college leavers."Many Welsh employers are concerned at the lack of mathematical skills demonstrated by employees," she said.The Estyn report by inspectors said there was a lack of support for the professional development of mathematics teachers.The findings and recommendations were drawn from visits to 18 secondary schools around Wales.The report recommended more support, advice and professional development opportunities should be provided for schools.It highlighted best practice at some schools such as Bishop Gore Comprehensive School in Swansea where it said 20% of pupils gained A* or A grades in GCSE maths in 2012.But the report found there was an 11 percentage point gap between England and Wales in the number of students getting a C grade and above last year.Its author Rob Davies told BBC Radio Wales: "Inspectors are noting that schools are setting their sights too low and and focusing too much on just doing enough to reach grade C and not stretching pupils enough."He pointed to various factors affecting results in Wales."I think there are question marks over whether key stage three [age 11-14] is preparing pupils suitably in Wales," he said."The inspectors have noted that pupils lack confidence in key aspects such as number work and algebra skills."They are the foundations of mathematics and they give pupils the skills to solve problems."Mr Davies said the weaker results were a combination of low expectations, poor teaching in some cases and the current set up of the GCSE, which allows schools not to enter pupils for higher grade material which Mr Davies said too many schools in Wales were doing.He also said too many weaker students were being entered early for the exam, and that there needed to be more consistency across Wales about networking between schools and sharing good practice.Last year the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) published a survey saying there was a "disconnect" between what employers needed and the basic skills of young job seekers.In July, the Welsh government revealed plans to introduce at least four new GCSE exams from September 2015, including two in numeracy and mathematics.It followed a qualifications review in Wales for pupils aged between 14 and 19 also affecting English language and Welsh exams.A Welsh government spokesperson said: "This report shows where we have been successful in developing mathematics in our schools at key stage four, and where we need to sharpen our performance."We welcome its findings and want to congratulate the schools highlighted in the report for their diligence and commitment to improving standards."We have clear evidence that, at an operational level, the best results in mathematics teaching at key stage four are achieved where schools and regional consortia work together, and where teachers have opportunities to share best practice and benefit from appropriate professional development and regular network opportunities."</body>

      <body>The NHS should not be there to "pick up the pieces" after people fall ill because of their lifestyle choices, said the Welsh health minister.Mark Drakeford said people needed to understand the consequences of becoming obese or drinking too much.He backed one Welsh health board's policy of making overweight people attend health courses before being put on treatment waiting lists.A BBC Wales poll found 82% people thought the policy should be extended.The survey of 502 people marks the start of a new season of BBC Wales programmes called Live Longer Wales about people's lifestyles.In one programme, Mr Drakeford denied claims of a "nanny state" claiming that "what the state does when it helps people to understand the consequences of their action is not nannying at all, it is acting as one responsible adult would to another".In July, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board launched its weight management programme saying improving weight before an operation gives a better outcome.Under the new policy, anyone who wants elective surgery with a body-mass index (BMI) above 40 must have been "offered, accepted and completed weight management support" before being added to the waiting list.The National Obesity Forum, an independent group looking at the treatment and management of obesity issues, has criticised the weight management programme warning the drop-out rate could be high.But Mr Drakeford said overweight people were less likely to benefit clinically from some operations.He added: "If you don't put yourself in a position where that treatment will be effective then that treatment won't be available to you."He said he was "not in favour of penalising people", adding it is "more than education - it is about motivation"."And it is about persuading people that if they want to live longer and they want to live healthily then that means eating better, moving more and drinking less," he said.Live Longer Wales is a new season of programmes from BBC Wales throughout October.</body>

      <description>Divers in Italy recover the bodies of dozens more African migrants who drowned after their boat sank off the island of Lampedusa.</description>

      <date>1381101608</date>
      <body>Divers in Italy have been recovering more bodies from the boat of African migrants that sank on Thursday.Eighty-three bodies were brought out on Sunday, bringing the official death toll to 194. About 200 people are still missing and 155 have survived the accident off Lampedusa island.The authorities have denied allegations that they were slow to mount a rescue.France has called for an urgent EU meeting after Italy requested help to deal with the influx of migrants.Tens of thousands of migrants attempt the perilous crossing from North Africa to Sicily and other Italian islands each year, and accidents are common - but this week's shipwreck was among the deadliest on record.Divers resumed their search on Sunday morning after a 48-hour delay due to bad weather.Many bodies are believed to be trapped in the wreck located in deep water, about 1km (half a mile) off Lampedusa.The survivors are to be placed under investigation for "clandestine immigration", as provided for by a controversial immigration law pushed through by right-wing parties in 2002.The offence carries a 5,000-euro (£4,230; $6,780) fine.Italy has said it will amend its immigration laws. Members of parliament have complained that some of its provisions discourage people from helping migrants in distress.The fisherman who arrived first at the site of the accident, Vito Fiorino, has accused the coastguard of wasting time by filming footage of rescue efforts."They refused to take on board some people we'd already saved because they said protocol forbade it," he was quoted as saying by Ansa news agency.A report in local newspaper La Sicilia said two boats belonging to Italy's Financial Guard, which carries out a range of police and rescue duties, had remained in port.The coastguard denied that there was any delay in its rescue effort."After we received the alarm by radio at 07:00, we immediately intervened with our boats, arriving at the site of the shipwreck at 07:20," it said in a statement.Judicial authorities said they had no evidence of delays. And two of the migrants have told the BBC that boats did rescue them, but it took a while."After swimming for a long time, probably around three hours, boats started to arrive to rescue us. Rescue boats, small boats, all the boats in the area came to save us, they dragged us out of the water," Futsum Mesfa, 20, from Eritrea said."I lost my cousin, who was on the boat with me, I also lost many friends," he added.The head of a fishermen's association, Toto Martello, denied in turn reports that three fishermen had sailed straight past the scene of the accident.The 20m (66ft) boat carrying more than 500 people - mostly from Eritrea and Somalia - was approaching Lampedusa early on Thursday when it began taking on water after its motor stopped working.Mr Mesfa told the BBC that the skipper set fire to a piece of material to try to attract the attention of passing ships, only to have the fire spread to the rest of the vessel.The boat - which set sail from the Libyan port of Misrata - is thought to have capsized when everyone moved to one side.</body>

      <body>Rwanda has strongly rejected allegations that it is helping train child soldiers for rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo.Speaking to the BBC, Foreign Minister Louise Mushikiwabo described such claims as "ludicrous".The US has recently withdrawn military aid to Rwanda, saying it is backing the M23 rebels, believed to recruit minors.The M23 rebellion has forced tens of thousands from their homes in the eastern DR Congo."The idea that Rwanda is associated with child soldiers is just ludicrous," Ms Mushikiwabo told the BBC's Newsday programme."We have worked with a number of UN agencies... to basically make sure that children don't belong in the army".The US has had close military ties with Rwanda since President Paul Kagame's Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) came to power after the end of the 1994 genocide.Rwanda has been accused of backing the M23, which is led by ethnic Tutsis.Rwanda has twice invaded DR Congo, which says it wants to stop ethnic Hutu rebel groups based there from attacking its territory.President Kagame, a Tutsi, led the RPF when it ended the genocide in which some 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus died.</body>

      <title>Malala: We must talk to the Taliban</title>

      <body>A Pakistani teenager shot in the head by the Taliban for championing girls' rights to education has said talks with the militants are needed for peace.Malala Yousafzai was attacked by a gunman on a school bus near her former home in Pakistan in October 2012.The targeting of a schoolgirl who had spoken out for girls' rights to education caused outrage in Pakistan and around the world.The 16-year-old was treated in the UK and now lives in Birmingham.She spent months in hospital and required several operations to repair her skull.In her first in-depth interview since the attack, Malala told the BBC that discussions with the Taliban were needed to achieve peace."The best way to solve problems and to fight against war is through dialogue," she said."That's not an issue for me, that's the job of the government... and that's also the job of America."In July, plans for talks involving the Taliban, the US and the Afghan government were frustrated by a row over the status of the Taliban's newly opened office in Doha, Qatar.Malala said it was important that the Taliban discussed their demands."They must do what they want through dialogue," she said."Killing people, torturing people and flogging people… it's totally against Islam. They are misusing the name of Islam."Malala also described the day of the attack for the first time. She said the street her school bus was travelling on was unusually deserted before the vehicle was flagged down and the gunman opened fire."I could see that there was no-one [there] at that time."Usually there used to be so many people and boys and they used to be standing in front of shops. But today... it was vacant."The teenager, who gave a speech to the UN in July, also spoke of her desire to return to Pakistan and enter politics."I will be a politician in my future. I want to change the future of my country and I want to make education compulsory," she said."I hope that a day will come [when] the people of Pakistan will be free, they will have their rights, there will be peace and every girl and every boy will be going to school."Panorama: Shot For Going To School, BBC One, Monday, 7 October at 20:30 BST and then available in the UK on the BBC iPlayer.</body>

      <title>Power cuts amid India state protests</title>
      <description>Power cuts cripple life in parts of the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh after protests against the formation of the new Telangana state.</description>

      <body>Power cuts have crippled life in parts of the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh after protests against the formation of the new state of Telangana.Thousands of power workers are on strike to protest against the decision.Telangana would comprise 10 districts of the southern state, including the city of Hyderabad.In recent years, there have been protests for and against the creation of India's 29th state.Backers of the new state say the area has been neglected by the government.Opponents are unhappy that Hyderabad, home to many major information technology and pharmaceutical companies, would become a shared state capital.Fresh protests began after India's cabinet approved the setting up of the new state at a meeting on Thursday evening.Soon after the announcement, those against the decision staged rallies, held protests and called a 48-hour strike in parts of the state that shut down schools, colleges, public transport and businesses.Four federal ministers belonging to the state also offered to resign in protest.Things worsened on Sunday when several thousand power workers in 13 districts, where a large number of people have protested against the decision, went on strike.Officials said two major thermal power stations in the region were affected by the strike.Power cuts closed cash machines, petrol pumps, cable TV services and led to the cancellation of several trains."Our intention is not to interrupt power supply, but we want to save our Andhra Pradesh. And this is the only way we have," a striking power worker opposed to the division of the state told the NDTV news channel.Violent protests have been reported from the town of Vizianagaram, where a curfew was imposed on Sunday.Telangana, with a population of 35 million, comprises 10 of Andhra Pradesh's 23 districts.The state capital and India's sixth biggest city, Hyderabad, will be included in the new state, although for the first 10 years it will serve as the joint capital of the two states.The final decision on a new state lies with the Indian parliament. The state assembly must also pass a resolution approving the creation of the new state.Correspondents say the timing of the announcement is linked to general elections due early next year. Recent opinion polls have shown that the Congress party is struggling in the state, which has 42 parliamentary seats.The move to create Telangana has sparked similar demands in the states of West Bengal and Assam.</body>

      <body>A German embassy employee in Yemen has been shot dead, reports say.The attack took place outside a supermarket in the capital's Hadda district, where the German and other foreign embassies are located.The victim - reported to be a bodyguard of Ambassador Carola Mueller-Holtkemper - has not been named. German officials say they are checking the reports.Yemen is struggling to control general lawlessness, an al-Qaeda insurgency, and divisions within the army.Initial reports suggested that the attack was a failed kidnapping attempt of Germany's ambassador."The ambassador escaped but her bodyguard was killed as he tried to resist the attackers who managed to flee," AFP news agency quoted an unnamed diplomatic source as saying.However, the agency later quoted a Yemeni foreign ministry spokesman as saying that Ms Mueller-Holtkemper was "currently outside the country".The German foreign ministry told the BBC it could not confirm any of the reports.Germany - along with several other Western countries - briefly closed its Yemen embassy in August, after the US warned of a potential major militant attack in the Middle East.</body>

      <body>Russian President Vladimir Putin has taken part in a ceremony in Moscow to launch the torch relay for next year's Winter Olympics in Sochi.The torch will go on a 123-day journey covering some 65,000km (40,000 miles) before the Games start in the Black Sea resort on 7 February.The torch's journey will include a trip into space.But the relay got off to a rocky start when the flame briefly went out during the loop through the Kremlin.A security guard had to re-light it with a cigarette lighter.Mr Putin said the Games would show Russia's "respect for equality and diversity".The run-up to the Games has so far been marred by controversy over a new Russian law that restricts the spread of information about homosexuality, as well as allegations by rights groups that authorities have rounded up migrant workers who helped build the Games venues in Sochi.The Olympic flame had been flown in from Greece after being lit last Sunday at the birthplace of the ancient Games.Hoisting the flame in Moscow, Mr Putin declared in a ceremony shown live on television that "our shared dream is becoming reality".He said the Games would show "respect for equality and diversity - ideals that are so intertwined with the ideals of the Olympic movement itself".Mr Putin said the relay would show off Russia "the way that it is and the way we love it"."Today is a joyous and momentous day," he said. "The Olympic flame - the symbol of the planet's main sports event, the symbol of peace and friendship - has arrived in Russia, and in a few minutes it will be on its way around our huge country."On its journey the flame will:</body>

      <body>Hundreds of Brazilian security officers, backed by armoured vehicles and helicopters, have occupied 12 shanty towns in Rio de Janeiro.The major operation is part of an ongoing drive by authorities to push drug gangs away from poor areas.Two new police pacification units (UPP) will be set up in Lins de Vasconcellos, home to about 15,000 people.Since 2008, another 34 UPP have been set up across the state but there have also been reports of police brutality.Rio will host the 2016 Olympics and matches of next year's football World Cup.Hundreds of police officers backed by at least two armoured vehicles and three helicopters moved into the slums at dawn on Sunday.The gangs in the area offered no resistance, authorities said."This is another step towards peace," Rio state governor Sergio Cabral Filho told reporters.He said the government would now invest $225m (£140m) in public works to improve the living conditions in the area.At least one man was arrested, and guns and drugs were confiscated, police said.Governor Cabral Filho said the pacification programme would soon be extended to the Mare area - a series of interlinked shanty towns that are home to more than 130,000 people.The occupation of the Mare slums is seen as one of the most challenging by Rio authorities.Earlier this year, police occupied the shanty towns of Complexo do Caju and Barreira do Vasco without trouble.But 10 police officers of a UPP in one of Rio's largest slums, Rocinha, were accused of torturing and killing a resident.Bricklayer Amarildo de Souza disappeared in July and was never seen again.

      <date>1381112895</date>
      <body>At least eight people have been killed and dozens injured at a show in Mexico after a modified pick-up known as a monster truck crashed into spectators.At least one child was said to be among the dead in the northern city of Chihuahua on Saturday evening.The truck hit a stand that had no protective barrier.A mechanical failure may have been the main cause of the accident, officials say. However, the driver later tested positive for alcohol consumption.The monster truck with 1.5m-high (5ft) wheels was performing a demolition stunt during an annual air show in Chihuahua, which involved crushing two cars beneath its huge tyres.Eyewitness video showed the truck completing one pass, driving over the cars, then turning for a second attempt.It accelerated much more quickly this time and landed heavily over the second car before veering off to the right and into the stand.A spokesman for the Chihuahua state prosecutors' office, Carlos Gonzalez, put the number of injured at about 80.He said prosecutors were looking at the possibility that mechanical failure meant the driver was unable to disengage the accelerator.But some witnesses said the driver may have lost control after hitting his head on the interior of the truck.Daniel Dominguez told Associated Press he was watching the show with a group of relatives."The driver hit his head and his helmet flew off," Mr Dominguez said. "The truck came directly at where we were.''Another spectator, Jesus Manuel Ibarra, told the agency: "I fell over, and when I turned around I saw the tyre very close. It hit me and threw me to the other side."A call has gone out from local health services for blood donations.The BBC's Will Grant in Mexico says some people are now calling for an investigation into safety measures at events like this and are asking how the audience could be placed so close to trucks performing stunts with only limited barriers in place.</body>

      <title>US credits Syria over chemical arms</title>
      <description>Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government deserves credit for so far complying with a chemical weapons deal, the US secretary of state says.</description>

      <date>1381121197</date>
      <body>Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government deserves credit for so far complying with a chemical weapons deal, the US secretary of state has said.John Kerry was speaking after international monitors began the destruction of Syria's stockpile.The mission was established under a UN resolution, which was passed after a deal between Russia and the US.The initiative followed international outrage at a chemical weapons attack near Damascus in August."The process has begun in record time and we are appreciative for the Russian co-operation and obviously for the Syrian compliance," Mr Kerry said after talks with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Bali, Indonesia."I think it's extremely significant that yesterday, Sunday, within a week of the (UN) resolution being passed, some chemical weapons were being destroyed."I think it's a credit to the Assad regime, frankly. It's a good beginning and we welcome a good beginning."The destruction of Syria's chemical arsenal is being overseen by a team from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).An official on the joint OPCW-UN delegation said on Sunday: "The first day of destruction and disabling is over and missile warheads, aerial bombs, along with mobile and static mixing and filling units, were dealt with. Work continues tomorrow and in the next few days."The actual destruction of the stockpile, being carried out by the Syrians, is not expected to be straightforward, as some sites are in combat zones.It is the first time the OPCW - based in The Hague - has been asked to oversee the destruction of a chemical weapons armoury during a conflict.The Syrian government gave details of its chemical weapons arsenal last month to the OPCW under the Russia-US agreement which also provided for Damascus to join the Chemical Weapons Convention.That arsenal is thought to include more than 1,000 tonnes of sarin and the blister agent sulphur mustard among other banned chemicals.In an interim report earlier this year, UN chemical weapons inspectors confirmed that the nerve agent sarin had been used in the attack in Ghouta on the outskirts of Damascus on 21 August.It was estimated to have killed hundreds of people and was blamed by the United States and other Western powers on the regime of Bashar al-Assad. But he accuses Syrian rebels of being behind it.Under the terms of the US-Russia deal, Syria's chemical weapons capability should be removed by the middle of 2014.The speed with which the team has been able to reach the sites and start the process of destruction underlines the urgency of the mission, says the BBC's Anna Holligan in the Hague.It was hoped that the new climate of co-operation would help bring about a wider conference in Geneva on ending the Syrian conflict.UN-Arab League peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi was quoted on French media on Sunday as saying he was encouraging all parties to come to Geneva in the second half of November but that peace talks were not a certainty.More than 100,000 people have died since the uprising began in 2011 and millions more have fled Syria.</body>

      <title>Iran seeks new tack in nuclear talks</title>

      <body>Iran's foreign minister is urging world powers to come up with new proposals for talks on its nuclear programme, which are set to resume next week.Mohammed Javad Zarif said the terms offered before Hassan Rouhani was elected president were now "history" and that a "new approach" was needed.The existing proposals seek curbs on uranium enrichment in Iran.Mr Rouhani has vowed to bring a plan to substantive nuclear negotiations due to take place on 15 October.Just over a week ago, he spoke to President Barack Obama by phone in an effort to ease tension over Iran's nuclear ambitions - the first conversation between Iranian and US leaders in more than 30 years.Iran wants talks to result in a lifting of UN sanctions imposed over concerns that it aims to build nuclear weapons clandestinely - an allegation Tehran denies.In another development, a senior Iranian official said the authorities are holding four people believed to be involved in sabotage against Iranian nuclear facilities."The previous plan given to Iran belongs to history and they must enter talks with a new point of view," said Mr Zarif, who is both foreign minister and chief nuclear negotiator."The players must put away this illusion that they can impose anything on the Iranian people," he told Iranian state TV late on Saturday.The election of Mr Rouhani in June and appointment of Mr Zarif have raised hopes that Iran's standoff with the West over its nuclear programme can be resolved.Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei endorsed Mr Rouhani's overtures to the US on Saturday."We support the diplomatic initiative of the government and attach importance to its activities in this trip," he said on his website.Ayatollah Khamenei said that "some of what happened on the New York trip was not appropriate", without being specific."We are pessimistic towards the Americans and do not put any trust in them," he said."The American government is untrustworthy, supercilious and unreasonable, and breaks its promises."Key Iranian nuclear sites</body>

      <title>US shutdown starts hitting business</title>
      <description>US Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker warns that business is starting to suffer from the federal shutdown.</description>

      <date>1381060028</date>
      <body>US Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker has warned that business is starting to suffer from the federal shutdown.Her comments at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) came as leaders gathering for the summit voiced worries about the US situation.Philippine President Benigno Aquino said that what happens in the US "affects us all".On Friday, the US defence contractor Lockheed Martin said it would put 3,000 workers on unpaid leave.The US government closed non-essential operations on Tuesday after Congress failed to agree a new budget.And President Barack Obama cancelled a scheduled trip to Asia because of the shutdown."The shutdown is not good for business. It's not good for the economy," Ms Pritzker said. One consequence of the shutdown had been her department's inability to collate vital economic data."We're a huge source of data for American business and that is a problem... It's affecting businesses and it's affecting their ability to get data," she said.From Monday, Lockheed will put 3,000 staff on leave, but the defence giant said this number would rise if the shutdown continued."I'm disappointed that we must take these actions and we continue to encourage our lawmakers to come together to pass a funding bill that will end this shutdown,'' Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed's chief executive and president, said in a statement."We hope that Congress and the Administration are able to resolve this situation as soon as possible," she added.The announcement followed United Technologies' decision to temporarily lay off 2,000 employees.The company, which makes Blackhawk helicopters, said some manufacturing had been halted because there were no government inspectors working to sign off products.Global impactThe widening impact of the shutdown sparked concern at Apec meeting in Bali on Sunday.Mr Aquino said: "The US economy is the number one economy in the world, what happens there affects all of us."The world economy obviously is not in a position to withstand too much shock at this time when we are just recovering as a global economy."Meanwhile, Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said the US had to confront its fiscal problems "in a better way than they are doing it now with shutting down the government".Mr Obama is refusing to negotiate with the Republicans over the budget issues until they pass a temporary bill to reopen the government.He also wants agreement to raise the $16.7 trillion US borrowing limit, to avoid the country defaulting on its debts.</body>

      <title>Ace cafe with quite a nice ancient monument attached?</title>
      <description>Have historic sites become all about the cafe and gift shop?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24335517</url>
      <date>1381130932</date>
      <body>English Heritage has announced that it is building a £27m visitor centre at Stonehenge, with what looks like a very large eating area. Is the cafe and gift shop almost as important as the attraction itself these days?Almost 50% of the shiny new visitor centre at Stonehenge will be taken up with a new "bright and spacious" cafe for up to 260 people and a bigger shop.It almost harks back to a memorable ad campaign by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. In 1988, the museum commissioned a poster with the slogan: "Where else do they give you £100,000,000 worth of objets d'art free with every egg salad?"The poster was one of six, all describing the VandA as: "An ace caff, with quite a nice museum attached."It's a premise that won't surprise anyone who has visited a stately home or garden run by the National Trust recently. Some 19.2 million people made a trip last year. Many of those will have dutifully queued for a flapjack and a cup of tea. Or even a substantial meal.Food writer Giles Coren recalls visiting London Zoo as a child and caring more about the gift shop than the animals: "Thousands of school children, coachloads of them have to visit these places, and all they care about is the shop."He associates past visits to stately homes with rock-hard scones but thinks for many people it's increasingly all about the food. "It's like the Colosseum in Rome, people go all that way to see it only to discover it's a lot of boring old stones, but at least you can get an excellent pizza."Visitors now demand a nice place to eat, having put up with poor facilities for far too long, Coren suggests. "Everything in Britain has been rubbish for years and people won't put up with it anymore."There is scepticism among some about the new generation of visitor centres.TripAdvisor is full of reviews from people who are unimpressed. One reviewer was very upset when changes were made at a cathedral in East Anglia. "I love this cathedral, have been taking visitors to it for over 20 years… but it was so much nicer when you could walk in at the front. Now you have to go through a new visitors' centre, which adds nothing to your experience of visiting the cathedral, but does direct you past a desk for collecting your 'optional' entrance fee."Another visitor to a major modern art museum in London recalled: "We ordered their vegetable soup - a small bowl with watery soup containing some vegetables and a small hard roll (and we had to ask for some butter!) - 6.50 each! For us that's a rip-off and we were not impressed."But generally the trend is for the cafes in museums, galleries and castles to get better and better. And those in the heritage business see them as a happy synergy."A good shop and cafe greatly enhance the overall experience," says Matthew Tanner, chairman of the Association of Independent Museums. "No visit is complete without an interesting shop, a fine cup of tea, and not forgetting a good loo too."The argument for spending money on an extensive cafe is twofold - visitors have come to expect them, and the revenue raised helps subsidise the attraction.One place where this takes place is RHS Wisley in Surrey where the gift shop and cafe are the gatekeepers to the gardens people come to see. Nigel Eaton manages the shop and says it is part of the whole experience."We've got three kinds of customers - we have the RHS members who visit on a regular basis, the gardeners who come just for the plants and then we've got what we call the payers, who come on coaches for a nice day out. Every penny that is spent in the shop goes back into the RHS, so the shop is very important to us."Some 1.1 million people visit Wisley every year. The results of a customer survey revealed that 22% of those visitors came just for the "retail experience". Last year the shop - including one of the world's biggest gardening bookshops - made £3.8m and they expect to make an even bigger profit this year.As a Lonely Planet author, David Else has visited a lot of tourist attractions and has no problem with visitor centres. In fact he rather likes them."In the case of Stonehenge, a good visitor centre is going to tell you so much more about the history of what is essentially a group of old stones. I've got no problem with cafes, either - I like a good cup of tea after a visit and don't mind if they want to make a few bob to help preserve the site."In the heritage and art business it's all about making attractions "sustainable".Getting the shop and cafe right at an attraction is a win-win situation, says Jane Temperley from the Association for Cultural Enterprises. "Sure it is about generating income - everyone is looking at how to make their sites more sustainable. But research says visitors enjoy cafes and shops, happy visitors spend more and tend to become repeat visitors or members, which generates more income."About 80% of visitors to Wisley are RHS members so they come back to visit time and time again. Thirty-two staff work in the Wisley Shop and 60 staff work in the cafes and restaurants - that's over 25% of the total site staff of 350.And the staff at attraction are at pains to point out that the food has got better and better. Laurent Trenga is the chef responsible for the planning of menus at Wisley. He points out that a burger and chips at Wisley is no ordinary burger and chips. "Our burger is made from locally sourced quality pork and apples grown in our own orchards, even the bun is made fresh on site."The plants are rather nice too.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>One city's house price surge</title>
      <description>House prices double in a decade - but this is not London</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24348196</url>
      <date>1381100429</date>
      <body>Two cities in the UK - one is a centre of commerce, has runaway house prices, and welcomes a constant stream of overseas property buyers. The other is London.House prices in and around Aberdeen have more than doubled in the past 10 years, according to data from the Nationwide Building Society.That increase is only matched by the trendy north London borough of Islington, and by Westminster in the heart of the capital of the UK.Recent figures show that Scotland's third city is recording a fresh surge in property prices. One estate agent describes the area as a property force field."Everywhere outside is doom and gloom, but it is boom time here," says Brian Sutton, of James and George Collie solicitors and estate agents.Take a closer look at Aberdeen, and its picturesque, shimmering granite homes, and you can see the complexity of the UK property market.The city has demand from first-time buyers willing to pay above valuation levels, interest from workers moving to the area, investors keen to get in on the act, and a lack of homes for sale.All this pushes up prices. Yet, in Scotland as a whole, prices are only creeping up after years of stagnation.It shows that averages can be misleading and that local areas can have very different trends to neighbouring regions, for reasons ranging from the quality of local schools to employment levels.It also questions a widely held belief that the London property market is unique - that soaring prices in the south-east of England are unequalled in the rest of the country.At the mouth of Aberdeen Harbour, next to the fishermen's village of Footdee, is a landmark called the Roundhouse.The Shoremaster's accounts for 1797-98 show that more than £225 was spent on the new house and telescope on the site.Nowadays, first-time buyers in the city can expect to pay up to £140,000 for a one-bedroom flat, or up to £500,000 for a bigger property.Competition for homes means many buyers are paying 5% to 10% over valuation at the moment, says Bill Barclay, partner at Raeburns solicitors and estate agents.Often sales go to sealed bids, with first-timers stretching their savings to compete with buy-to-let investors.Spend a few minutes standing by the harbour and the reason for this active property market is clear - North Sea oil."It drives the local economy," says Mr Barclay. "Big companies are making long-term financial plans for the area, so we are not going to see much changing."The area was not immune to the financial crisis. Banks were not lending at the levels they had been before 2008, but Mr Barclay says Glasgow and Edinburgh suffered much more.Now, he says - using a phrase apt for an oil-producing region - the banks are "starting to open the taps" again to fund mortgages.Figures published by the University of Aberdeen show a 25% increase in the volume of sales in the second quarter of the year compared with the same three months in 2011. Prices were up by 5.5% in the city and its suburbs over the same period.Sales volumes of flats were up by 53% in that time, as buy-to-let investors find the finance and predict demand from tenants.All this is gloomy news for potential first-time buyers. One 32-year-old tells the BBC he has been renting on the south coast of England and then Aberdeen over the past 15 years and is unable to save anything close to what is needed as a deposit.You hardly see a sale sign erected within the city's sought-after areas, with supply low and competition picking up. But the market is far from overheating, as it was in 2007, according to estate agent Brian Sutton."We had people in their early 20s buying property, with 10 to 20 bidding for one property. Competition has come back, but it is three to four people bidding," he says."First-time buyers are in their early 30s, not their 20s, often with their parents helping."He predicts the housing market will continue to rise at a "sustainable rate", especially as the oil companies build headquarters in the area and continue to relocate staff to the region.Prices may grow by single figures year-on-year, he says, but nobody wants to return to the days of 20% a year increases.Much the same point was made by Business Secretary Vince Cable when he raised concerns about a property bubble potentially being inflated by government schemes to kick-start the market."In London and the south east, in the north-east of Scotland, in other areas, there are serious housing inflationary pressures," he said.Despite his warning, the second phase of the Help to Buy scheme has been brought forward by three months in England, and the Scottish government has announced the start of its own scheme.The UK and Scottish governments both argue that Help to Buy, which includes allowing buyers to apply for a shared equity loan for part of the property, are vital to give people the chance to secure a mortgage from risk-averse lenders.Buyers only qualify under the Scottish scheme if they are buying a newly built property.Critics might argue that they should encourage the developers to follow the example of the fishermen's cottages at Footdee - where the front doors face inwards to protect occupants from incoming storms.</body>

      <title>Is 'addiction' an excuse to overeat?</title>
      <description>Is it helpful to label 'food addiction' an illness?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24402163</url>
      <date>1381109365</date>
      <body>"Food addiction" is becoming a popular term to explain overeating. But in this Scrubbing Up, Professor John Blundell from the Institute of Psychological Sciences at the University of Leeds warns the term is being used far too freely.Some have likened food addiction to drug addiction, and then used this term to associate it with overeating, and as a clinical explanation for the obesity epidemic, implicating millions of people.The use of the term food addiction is a step towards medicalisation and implies that normal human social behaviour is pathological.Forms of eating therefore become an illness. This attitude is not helpful and has huge implications for the way in which people view their own behaviour and their lives.The concept of food addiction comes from a combination of experimental data, anecdotal observations, scientific claims, personal opinions, deductions and beliefs.It is an over-simplification of a very complex set of behaviours.The existing evidence fails to define the precise characteristics of the actual foods concerned or the eating environment that underlies the assumed addiction risk.This is in contrast to drug addiction, where the molecule is identified and its pharmacological effect on the brain is characterised.Animal studies have shown changes to specific the brain in those given a sugary diet - and human brain scans show activation of reward systems in the same part of the brain when sweet tastes are consumed.Therefore, it is not surprising that reward centres are activated when sweet foods are consumed, as we know that the reward circuits in the brain have been established through evolution as signalling systems that control our appetite.Many stimuli influence these areas of the brain and, in addition, there is an intrinsic drive to consume carbohydrate-rich foods to satisfy a basic metabolic need of the brain.Sweetness is a major signal for such foods but the science has not yet assessed this fully and much more work is needed before we could say that food is addictive.Attributing food addiction as the single cause underlying the development of obesity, despite the existence of numerous other very plausible explanations, is unhelpful, particularly for those trying to live more healthy lives.I am concerned that many people may potentially latch on to the concept of food addiction as an excuse to explain their overeating - the premise that it's "not my fault" and therefore, "I can't help it".This removes the personal responsibility they should feel and could act on - and they infer that their eating is a form of disease.Food addiction may offer an appealing explanation for some people but the concept could seriously hinder an individual's capacity for personal control.Binge eating disorder does exist - but it is a rare clinical condition affecting fewer than 3% of obese people.Sufferers have a strong compulsion to eat, which persists alongside the sense of a loss of control.Addiction-like food behaviour may be a component of the severe and compulsive form of binge eating disorder.But this condition does not explain the huge rise in obesity we have seen across the population.Binge eating is not a key cause of obesity and, therefore, in the context of mass public health, is not a major concern.What we need is a calm and composed analysis of what the words food addiction really mean so that people can make informed deductions about the causes of their own behaviour.</body>

      <title>Turning around the world's oldest travel firm</title>
      <description>The boss trying to return travel firm Thomas Cook to its former glory</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24328944</url>
      <date>1381100422</date>
      <body>It is safe to say that Harriet Green, the boss of Thomas Cook, is not lacking in confidence - or the desire to take on a big challenge.Ms Green was appointed chief executive of the UK-based travel company in July 2012, after she cold-called the chairman and told him she was the right person to lead the troubled group's recovery.At that time Thomas Cook, the world's oldest travel business, was struggling with losses caused by a general fall in tourism numbers as a result of the global recession, and unrest in the Middle East hitting its package holidays to Egypt and Tunisia. The company was also saddled with debts of more than £1bn.Ms Green, 51, was convincing enough to be given the job, despite having no previous experience of working in a travel company.She says her strength of purpose can be traced back to coping with the death of her father when she was 14."You know I lost a parent in my early teens, and for a child that is the worst that can happen," she says. "And if you can cope with that, pretty much everything else - except a very similar situation of loss - is unlikely to derail you."Staff engagementMs Green, who was previously boss of electronic components distributor Premier Farnell for six years, says her first job at Thomas Cook was to boost staff confidence, and get them on side."You need to be really working on the psychology of the business, building belief, beginning to rebuild a culture, giving people a self, a sense of renewed self-esteem," she says.Ms Green emailed all 35,000 employees, asking them to share with her "everything you think and feel about what we need to do in this company".More than 8,000 workers replied, sharing "chapter and verse" with her.And while Ms Green continued to formulate her detailed plan for the turnaround, she says she was aware that she had to calm her own go-getting, no-nonsense attitude."Thomas Cook was quite unwell and so... I moderated my style and approach," she says."I was much less edgy, much less aggressive. I was still very focused on time and the issues, but [at the same time] creating this environment where people could believe."However, Ms Green did show early steel when she replaced most of the previous Thomas Cook board.Ms Green said the core turnaround focus was then very simple - "managing our cash better and reducing cost".In March of this year, she unveiled her strategy. The company intends to save £350m by 2015, largely through cutting the number of its physical stores, and focusing instead on internet sales. At the same time, non-core parts of the business will be sold.More than 2,500 jobs are going, and 199 shops out of 1,069 in the UK are shutting.Transport union TSSA, which represents many Thomas Cook staff, was angry at the job losses, but says they were the result of "the over expansion and bad decisions" of Thomas Cook's previous regime.In May the company completed a £1.6bn capital refinancing, which helped to halve its net debt. Then in August it announced that its nine-month losses had fallen to £470m from £667m a year earlier.The markets have so far welcomed Ms Green's efforts, and Thomas Cook's share price has soared. In May of last year, before she joined, the shares were trading at 21 pence each. They finished last month at 153.13p.TSSA is also hopeful that the company is now moving in the right direction.Manuel Cortes, its general secretary, says: "We believe that Thomas Cook staff are its biggest asset and that the company is now back on track. We are confident that it can once again be a successful company and a great British brand."Ms Green herself says she should be judged after five years in the job.As Ms Green continues her work at Thomas Cook, she says successful chief executives have a wide range of skills, which she terms "a rich DNA toolkit".While she highlights traits such as resilience, agility, and ability to lead speedy change, she says the most important factor is the need to be good with people, something she sees in herself.Ms Green says: "It is my experience that [chief executives] that really enjoy people - either love to develop them, or coach them or support them, or engage with their work - are much more successful than those who really are great on strategy, love the numbers, but don't really love the people aspect."I think there is an authenticity that comes through, and if you don't love the people that you work with, that begins to show. So I think it's hard to be a successful [chief executive] if you don't really like working, developing [and] supporting other people."Ms Green adds that the DNA needed to make a good chief executive is "not gender specific". However, she does agree that more needs to be done to see more female bosses of large companies."There are gender issues associated with why there are so few of us female [chief executives], but I think that's a different issue about role-modelling, education, the media that we can all help with," she says.Regarding the future of Thomas Cook, which traces its history back to 1841, Ms Green has eyes on East Asia."Thomas Cook is not yet in the East, which I think is an amazing opportunity," she says. "Helping Chinese and Korean customers to explore Europe would be amazing."Yet despite the big plans for Thomas Cook's future, Ms Green says she won't stay forever."I generally think [chief executives] spend far too long in the same business," she says. "I think you should... make the business great, stay around a little while to enjoy that, and then probably move on to the next thing."</body>

      <title>How to get broadband to rural UK</title>
      <description>How to get broadband to rural Britain</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24366190</url>
      <date>1381100451</date>
      <body>Over the summer there was a lot of digging going on in the Lancashire countryside.Nothing unusual there you may think until you realise that these trenches are being built to house a fibre optic network with speeds to rival those that Google is installing in Kansas City.The community-led Broadband 4 Rural North (B4RN) scheme offers speeds of up to 1Gbps (gigabit per second) to communities along its route.And as it expands its network, more villages are asking if they can be connected too, proving that if you build it, they will come.The project has hit problems - some minor, like a delay over the summer caused by some nesting lapwings, but some bigger, for example when Network Rail refused permission for the ducts to run over a bridge, forcing it to reroute in a river.However its biggest problem is money. Despite raising £300,000 worth of local investment, the team behind the project estimate that the total cost will be £1.86m.It applied for a government grant but is still waiting to hear whether it will qualify while it is also finding it tricky to get a loan.It illustrates the difficulty of getting even a small-scale broadband network up and running and also begs the questions - why would farmers digging the trenches even want to take on such a project?The reality is that they and other local residents are fed up with slow or non-existent broadband.Commercial broadband providers like BT see no profit in rolling out complicated networks to a handful of houses in the middle of nowhere.And that is rather galling for the people living in such communities who need broadband just as much, in some cases more, than their urban counterparts.Broadband is now widely acknowledged as the fourth utility, and the government is all too aware that it needs to close the digital divide between town and country.But its solution - to offer £530m to councils to subsidise rural broadband roll-outs - has been widely criticised, most recently in a report from a group of MPs who make up the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).The process has been painfully slow. Initially the Department of Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) planned to complete the roll-outs by 2015.Now that has been put back to 2017, with the caveat that up to 10% of the country will still not be covered.When it became clear that former telecoms monopoly BT had won every single council contract, there were some angry reactions.The PAC report accused the DCMS of ripping off taxpayers by simply handing public money to BT.This week as BT puts the final dots on those contracts, the big question is where does it leave the community schemes like B4RN?While the current subsidy is now gone, the PAC report recommended the government make every effort to ensure that the next round of public funding - the £250m earmarked for the final 10% not covered in current plans - is spent more wisely."It can't simply be put into a pot marked BT. There has to be more competition. This is a good opportunity to make government funding go a lot further," said Malcolm Corbett, who heads up the independent networks co-operative association (Inca).He estimates that the local community broadband schemes supported by his organisation can offer a much faster service to remote communities and require far less state aid than that demanded by BT, largely because they rely on co-investments with the local people.It is a view that the government does not seem to share. A separate £20m provided by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to specifically fund innovative rural broadband schemes, including Lancashire's B4RN project, looks like it could be going the same way as the money provided by the DCMS."Our information indicates that almost all of the money will go to BT," said Mr Corbett."I'm on the point of giving up. Whatever we do and despite an extraordinarily critical government report, we still can't get these schemes out there. BT is just so powerful," he said.BT's managing director of Next Generation Access, Bill Murphy, is not surprised that community schemes are struggling to gain headway."Our payback on rural broadband is 15 years. This is not for the faint-hearted. If people want to go build, then go build but, as I tell them, broadband networks aren't just for Christmas,"And he is dubious that community schemes can roll out networks cheaper than BT."I spend a lot of time sitting in village halls hearing about how they want to build their own thing but none of them have ever built anything before. I admire their passion and commitment but I'm not going to be preached at by people who don't have the experience. Don't tell me that you can build a network cheaper than me," he said.One of the biggest criticisms in the PAC report was that BT and local authorities are failing to provide detailed information about how far their roll-outs would extend.Without such information it will be hard for rivals to offer projects to compete with BT.Gigaclear is one such rival. It is offering a 1Gbps fibre to the home service to homes in Oxfordshire and Rutland and hopes to extend its footprint to Hampshire and Kent.But lack of certainty about where BT may build networks is hampering its efforts."Under the current contracts drawn up with BT, councils can't say what areas will be upgraded until three months beforehand," said their marketing director Joe Frost."It means that whole areas will not be told anything for two years. That is a problem for them and for us," he said.The issue has led the Countryside Alliance to demand change."BT and the local authorities aren't being transparent about where the roll-out will cover. We need to see a map with postcode trackers showing what communities will be left out," said their head of policy Sarah Lee.For its part, BT said that it is up to local authorities to provide this information and that increasingly they are doing so.Anyone wanting to know whether their community will be covered by the current roll-out has simply to phone their council, added Mr Murphy.One of the most interesting things about the alternative community schemes is that they tend to favour faster fibre to the home technology (FTTH) over BT's preferred fibre to the street cabinet (FTTC), even though it is far more expensive to lay.Retired engineer Walter Wilcox has campaigned for years to get better broadband in the village of Ewhurst in Surrey and when it finally did come, he was unhappy with it."There are 76 houses that can't get the service, two properties where the fibre service is worse than the one they had before and we estimate 226 properties out of about 942 are unable to achieve the lower limit of 24 Mbps," he said.The upgrade was done by BT using FTTC.BT admits that the upgrade in Ewhurst took "longer than it should" and that 'there is still work to do"."There are about 5% of people in the village who can't get the service but we are working on solutions to fix this." said Mr Murphy.But what has happened in Ewhurst could be replicated around the country because, with a few exceptions, it is the technology that will form the backbone of BT's rollout.Many worry that FTTC is already an outdated technology, ill-suited to rural communities because the speed you get is in relation to how close you live to a street cabinet.In contrast the FTTH technology favoured by B4RN and other community schemes offers the same speed to everyone - and with a top speed of 1Gbps it is not going to be past its sell by date any time soon.As Chris Conder who sits on B4RN's management team puts it: "Fibre to the cabinet is like giving people a cold water tap whereas with fibre to the home they can have a hot power shower."B4RN already has plenty of satisfied customers on its network but whether it and others like it are really equipped for a nationwide fibre battle with BT remains distinctly uncertain.But there are plenty of people living in some of Britain's remotest places rooting for them.</body>

      <title>An unusual thank you for WWII Spitfires</title>
      <description>The WWII gift that's now brought the Samaritans to Africa</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24399641</url>
      <date>1380906962</date>
      <body>To say thank you to the African countries that donated Spitfires during World War II, a former development worker from the UK is setting up branches of the Samaritans across the continent."Suicide is still a taboo here because it's seen as something like a curse," says Merab Mulindi, one of the founding members of Samaritans Kenya.Launched in 2003, it offers support to distressed citizens over the phone and in person from its office in Nairobi."People do not like to talk about it and the families face a lot of stigma, which only deepens the problem," she says.The project was initiated by John Hurst, who spent more than two decades working in Africa for the British government and another 10 years volunteering for the Samaritans in the UK. He aims to found similar organisations in all the African nations that donated money to the RAF during WWII.He highlights what he believes is a common pattern, in which poorer families struggle to send their eldest child to university."The hope of the family is that the child will take them out of poverty through their education," he says. "But the stresses of university, or worries over money, can trigger a suicide which decimates the whole family."The problem is compounded by the perception of the wider community and is often reflected in the way the bodies are treated after death, particularly in East Africa. Traditional burial services for victims of suicide are rare, says Hurst."There are no reading of the Bible. In some instances the families have even been locked in their houses while the body is taken into the bush and abandoned."It is difficult to know how many people commit suicide in the country each year, says Mulindi, who's convinced that many cases go unreported. "The statistics are minimal because people do not talk about it."Hurst thinks many of the lessons learned by the Samaritans - and similar organisations in the West - can be transferred to Africa. Problems securing employment and marital difficulties seem to be common factors across the globe."We know that the majority of people who commit suicide in the UK do so at night. That's the time of greatest stress and they usually want to speak to someone just before they do it."By providing a helpline, he is confident the service can save lives. So far about 70 people have been trained as volunteers and 20 are on duty on a regular basis. The group has no shortage of committed volunteers, but funding its phone bills has proved more difficult."We do not have a toll-free line so people have to have enough credit to be able to call us. Sometimes they expect us to call them back, which is not always possible," says Mulindi.The biggest problem has been getting people to engage with the issue. It took three years to gain approval as an official NGO. "Having the government finally register the charity was probably the greatest challenge," says Hurst.Hence his innovative way to explain his motivation. "When you say suicide, people switch off. The moment you say the word Spitfire, or talk about Spitfires, it engages people," he says. By talking about the Samaritans project as a way to say thank you to the countries involved, he has been able to gain more attention for its efforts."Kenya donated six Spitfires at a cost of £5,000 each," he explains, adding that his next focus is Lesotho, which helped purchase more than 20 of the iconic fighter planes for the war effort.In Kenya, awareness does seem to be building slowly, particularly after the finance minister's son took his own life last year. The issue received more media coverage on Kenya's annual suicide prevention day, held each September."In that sense there's some opening up of the possibility of people talking about it," says Mulindi.Video produced by Thomas Amter and John Galliver.

      <body>US special forces' mixed fortunes in Libya and Somalia dominate Monday's papers.Commandos captured Anas al-Liby, a leading al-Qaeda suspect in Libya, but failed to track down a senior al-Shabab militant in southern Somalia.The Daily Telegraph describes how MPs plan to question Home Secretary Theresa May over why al-Liby was given political asylum in Britain in the 1990s and was allowed to live here.The Times believes the mission in Somalia ultimately failed because it was planned in just a week and a half.But the Guardian takes a different perspective, warning that the US raids could invite further retaliation and escalation.Another story dominating the papers is what the Times calls the cruel short visits which deprive the elderly of dignity and care.The Daily Mail and Express describe how in many cases, time is so tight during visits by carers that some of the most vulnerable people are forced to choose between having a cup of tea or being helped to the lavatory.The Independent argues it will be be hard to resolve the crisis without more money.Several papers have delved into the private papers of former Prime Minister Lady Thatcher.And they have all picked up on her plan to anoint Cecil, now Lord, Parkinson as her successor.The plot was only scuppered when he informed her his secretary was pregnant with his love child.According to the Financial Times the archives also show the Iron Lady was capable not just of intimidating colleagues and opponents, but could leave male admirers looking like love-struck teenagers.One such man, it seems, was Sir John Nott who, on his resignation said in a letter to the PM: "I actually admire you as a woman - your good looks, charm and bearing have always attracted me."As the Daily Mail points out, Sir John never received a reply.There's good news and bad news for people hoping to buy a stake in Royal Mail when it's partially sold-off by the government this week.The Telegraph says that with the sale heavily oversubscribed, investors are predicted to enjoy an instant profit of up to 40%.But the Mail warns that thousands of small investors risk losing out to the "City Big Boys" in what the paper calls a "shares gold rush".Housing remains popular topic for a number of today's titles.The Guardian reports on banks and building societies that are "braced for a stampede" as thousands of potential home-owners try to take advantage of the latest phase of the government-backed Help to Buy mortgage scheme.However, the Times says there are doubts about the affordability of the programme with buyers possibly having to pay rates of up to 6%.The Telegraph says the housing problem needs addressing but asks whether the government is undermining its own ambitions by creating a new bubble.Meanwhile, the Daily Mirror claims police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann are poised to make arrests amid hopes that the "net is closing in on her kidnappers".The Sun says it has investigated Britain's mental health system and reports that 1,200 people have been killed by high-risk patients in ten years - a "catastrophe" it says in an editorial.</body>

      <title>US commando raids: What did they achieve?</title>

      <body>The twin US commando raids to seize senior al-Qaeda operatives in two different African countries on 5 October show Washington's preference for highly targeted special operations where it believes its mission has a high probability of success.While the Obama administration has sought to avoid or extract itself from big, costly theatres of conflict like Iraq, Afghanistan or Syria, it has invested heavily in the joint counter-terrorism and special operations sphere, to go after what the US calls "high-value targets".But how effective in the long run are raids like the ones in Libya and Somalia over the weekend?In Libya, US Army Delta Force commandos achieved exactly what they set out to do.Deploying from a forward base in a Nato country, they apprehended a fugitive on the UN al-Qaeda watch-list with a $5m (£3.1m) bounty on his head.Washington suspects Abu Anas al-Liby of helping to mastermind al-Qaeda's simultaneous bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.Commenting on his capture, the US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said on Sunday: "These operations in Libya and Somalia send a strong message to the world that the United States will spare no effort to hold terrorists accountable, no matter where they hide or how long they evade justice."The Libyan government has publicly called on for an explanation from the US, while at the same time saying it hopes this will not upset their relations.Abu Anas al-Liby was no friend of Libya's government but to its citizens this US raid could be taken as a humiliating infringement of national sovereignty.The US insists that the detention of this long-sought suspect is "lawful" and the bringing to justice of such an allegedly dangerous man will be popular back home.But in North Africa this raid could well prompt more recruits to join anti-Western jihadist groups like al-Qaeda and its affiliates.In Somalia the raid by US Navy commandos from Seal Team Six failed and they returned empty-handed.This was a failure of intelligence on two counts. The al-Shabab leader, possibly Ahmed Godane himself, was not at home, and the beachside villa they hoped to find him in turned out to be well defended.When commandos swim ashore under cover of darkness they are inevitably limited in how much firepower they can carry and the option to withdraw was the pragmatic one.Yet when the most highly trained commandos from the most powerful military in the world attack a sandal-wearing militia and are forced to retreat, this will be seized on as a propaganda victory for al-Shabab.After the debacle of Blackhawk Down in Mogadishu in 1993, the Pentagon steered clear of Somalia for years.But more recently it has conducted a number of often unpublished raids into that country, with the blessing of the UN-backed government there.Sometimes they involve unmanned aerial drones, sometimes they involve US Navy Seals. A US Special Forces raid in 2009 on Barawe - the same town as this weekend's raid - located and killed its intended target, the al-Qaeda leader in Somalia, Ali Saleh Al-Nabhan.The US will undoubtedly be planning more such special operations raids, its plans given urgency by the scale and body count of al-Shabab's murderous attack in September on a Nairobi shopping mall.The message Washington clearly wants to convey to its enemies is: "We will find you and get you, however long it takes."But to many in the countries visited by such raids, there will be accusations of a global superpower throwing its military weight around and acting outside the law to serve its own interests.</body>

      <title>Airbus in $9.5bn Japan Airlines deal</title>
      <description>Aircraft manufacturing giant Airbus announces a $9.5bn (£5.9bn) deal with Japan Airlines, its first with the carrier, to sell 31 of its A350 planes.</description>

      <body>Aircraft manufacturing giant Airbus has announced its first deal with Japanese carrier Japan Airlines (JAL).It has won an order from JAL for 31 of its A350 planes, in a deal worth nearly $9.5bn (£5.9bn) at list prices.The A350 is designed to be more fuel-efficient and is a direct competitor to US rival Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, which has been hit by safety and technical issues in recent months.The deal is a blow for Boeing, which has dominated Japan's aviation market."This is Airbus' largest order for the A350 so far this year and is the largest ever order we have received from a Japanese airline," said Fabrice Bregier, chief executive of Airbus."I must say that achieving this breakthrough order and entering a traditional competitor market was one of my personal goals."According to the deal, JAL also has an option to purchase an additional 25 planes.In recent years, the aviation industry has been hurt by a slowdown in demand and high volatility in global fuel prices.That has seen many leading carriers turn to more fuel-efficient aircraft in an attempt to cut down costs and maintain profitability.Both Airbus and Boeing have seen a surge in demand for such planes.Airbus, which says the A350 will use about 25% less fuel than previous generation wide-bodied aircraft, has had 725 orders for the plane prior to securing the JAL deal.The company hopes to start delivering the first A350s to customers by the end of 2014.Yoshiharu Ueki, president of Japan Airlines, said the new planes would offer "high level of operational efficiency and product competitiveness" and help the airline to cater to "new business opportunities after slots at airports in Tokyo are increased".Meanwhile, Boeing's 787 Dreamliner continues to remain popular despite this year's temporary worldwide grounding of the aircraft while safety regulators investigated the cause of fires. The firm has received orders for more than 950 Dreamliner jets so far.Japanese carriers, JAL and All Nippon Airways (ANA), are two of the biggest operators of the Dreamliner jets.</body>

      <title>Royal Mail undervalued, says Labour</title>
      <description>The shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, says the government's privatisation of Royal Mail has "undervalued" the firm by as much as £1bn.</description>

      <date>1381133307</date>
      <body>The privatisation of Royal Mail undervalues the company by as much as a £1bn, with City investors and hedge funds being the biggest beneficiaries of the share offering, says shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Umunna said that the sale is "short changing" taxpayers.The government said it was following "normal commercial practice".Members of the public can apply for the shares online until 8 October.Shares will begin trading in full on 15 October.62% of the business will be sold, with the rest remaining state-owned.Under the terms of the share sale, a 10% stake in the business has been reserved for Royal Mail employees.There is a £750 minimum amount for members of the public wishing to purchase Royal Mail shares, with the threshold falling to £500 for Royal Mail employees.Mr Umunna said that the £750 minimum application was too high."That is a lot of money for most people - it is out of reach for many. Most of the people benefiting from this will be the speculators and the hedge funds".The government may also sell an additional 15% of its stake in what is called an "over-allotment" option, if the demand for shares was very high.Labour has already said that it would not renationalise Royal Mail after it is privatised.In response to Mr Umunna's comments, the Department for Business said: "This is a commercial transaction and government is following normal commercial practice in setting and publicising the share price and delivering value for the taxpayer. The value of Royal Mail will depend on a number of factors, notably the company's on-going financial performance, its future prospects and the level of investor interest."On Friday it was reported that demand for shares is outstripping supply, and they are to be sold at the top end of the government's suggested range.Initially the government priced the shares at 260-330p, however, they are to be sold between 300-330p. Shares will begin trading in full on the London Stock Exchange on 15 October.BBC business editor Robert Peston said applications for the shares are a "few times" the value of those on offer.Members of the Communication Workers Union are currently being balloted on a potential strike over the planned privatisation, and other pay issues.The strike vote closes on 16 October, and the earliest a strike could be held is seven days after that.</body>

      <title>US shutdown starts hitting business</title>
      <description>US Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker warns that business is starting to suffer from the federal shutdown.</description>

      <date>1381060028</date>
      <body>US Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker has warned that business is starting to suffer from the federal shutdown.Her comments at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) came as leaders gathering for the summit voiced worries about the US situation.Philippine President Benigno Aquino said that what happens in the US "affects us all".On Friday, the US defence contractor Lockheed Martin said it would put 3,000 workers on unpaid leave.The US government closed non-essential operations on Tuesday after Congress failed to agree a new budget.And President Barack Obama cancelled a scheduled trip to Asia because of the shutdown."The shutdown is not good for business. It's not good for the economy," Ms Pritzker said. One consequence of the shutdown had been her department's inability to collate vital economic data."We're a huge source of data for American business and that is a problem... It's affecting businesses and it's affecting their ability to get data," she said.From Monday, Lockheed will put 3,000 staff on leave, but the defence giant said this number would rise if the shutdown continued."I'm disappointed that we must take these actions and we continue to encourage our lawmakers to come together to pass a funding bill that will end this shutdown,'' Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed's chief executive and president, said in a statement."We hope that Congress and the Administration are able to resolve this situation as soon as possible," she added.The announcement followed United Technologies' decision to temporarily lay off 2,000 employees.The company, which makes Blackhawk helicopters, said some manufacturing had been halted because there were no government inspectors working to sign off products.Global impactThe widening impact of the shutdown sparked concern at Apec meeting in Bali on Sunday.Mr Aquino said: "The US economy is the number one economy in the world, what happens there affects all of us."The world economy obviously is not in a position to withstand too much shock at this time when we are just recovering as a global economy."Meanwhile, Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said the US had to confront its fiscal problems "in a better way than they are doing it now with shutting down the government".Mr Obama is refusing to negotiate with the Republicans over the budget issues until they pass a temporary bill to reopen the government.He also wants agreement to raise the $16.7 trillion US borrowing limit, to avoid the country defaulting on its debts.</body>

      <body>Optimism among UK banks and financial firms is at its highest for almost 17 years, a survey from the CBI business lobby group has suggested.Its quarterly survey, carried out with PricewaterhouseCoopers, found 59% of firms said they felt more optimistic, against 6% who were less optimistic.The balance, of 53%, is the highest since December 1996.The survey also found 24% of firms in the sector had increased staff numbers, the biggest rise in six years.The CBI/PwC survey of 99 companies covered the three months to the start of SeptemberThe study estimates that 10,000 jobs were added in the period studied, with another 2,000 expected to be created in the current quarter, taking total employment in the sector to 1.14 million.The one negative point came from business volumes, which the survey indicated had fallen in the latest quarter. Some 22% of firms reported a rise in business volumes, but 32% said they had fallen.Kevin Burrowes, from PwC's UK financial services division, said: "Banks' optimism is increasingly buoyant despite seeing a slight seasonal blip in commercial and industrial volumes."Activity and profitability are expected to grow as the economy recovers, and investment in new products and infrastructure is increasing."</body>

      <title>Call to avert oil refinery strike</title>
      <description>Unions call for an emergency summit and parliamentary debate in a bid to avert strikes at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical site.</description>

      <body>Unions are calling for an emergency summit and parliamentary debate in a bid to avert strikes at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical site.Workers at the Ineos site have started an overtime ban and work to rule.The dispute centres on the treatment of a union convener.Ineos has warned that its Grangemouth site will close by 2017 if it does not find savings and fresh investment. It said the site had lost more than £150m over the past four years.A spokesman for the company has accused Unite of "fiddling while Rome burns".Finance Secretary John Swinney said the Scottish government would make all efforts to bring both sides together to help resolve the dispute, and get to a position of financial sustainability for the plant.Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme he said: "We have been talking to the company about how we might be able to invest to support the development of the plant."We can only make investment if there is a viable business proposition and that's where we need to have all parties working together to support a proposition that can deliver the employment and the opportunities that we want to see for the plant in Grangemouth, because of its very wider significance for the Scottish economy."Unite workers voted for the industrial action in support of Unite convener Stevie Deans.He was suspended, then reinstated, by the company over allegations linked to his involvement in the row over the selection of a Labour candidate in Falkirk, where he is chairman of the local constituency party.Mr Deans faces an investigation by Ineos over issues linked to the Falkirk row.Unite have accused Ineos of trying to "provoke" a strike, which it warned would be "hugely damaging" to the UK economy.A previous three-day stoppage at the site in 2008 was said to have cost hundreds of millions of pounds in lost production and other knock-on effects.Workers have voted heavily in favour of action up to and including a strike - and Unite officials said they had not ruled out calling for a walkout.Pat Rafferty, the union's Scottish regional secretary, said the company was using the Stevie Deans dispute as an excuse to introduce sweeping reforms, including pension changes, job losses, an end to collective bargaining and worse pay and conditions for new employees.Unite called for a summit with the company and politicians, and urged the Scottish government to hold an emergency debate to help prevent the dispute escalating."The company is holding Stevie Deans hostage, and playing Russian roulette with fuel supplies," Mr Rafferty said."The changes being proposed are completely unpalatable to us and we feel we are being pushed into taking strike action."We are trying to make the company see sense, but we are not ruling anything out at this stage."Unite said the work to rule and overtime ban would slow down maintenance work at Grangemouth, which is split into refinery and petrochemical operations.Ineos has put forward a survival plan and has asked the Scottish and UK governments for grants and loan guarantees totalling £150m.Chairman Calum MacLean has warned "there is no plan B".Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland, Tom Crotty, group director with Ineos, said: "We have got a survival plan. We haven't been sitting on our hands wailing about it, we are doing something about it."What we can do is invest in new terminal facilities that will allow us to bring gas in from the US to replace the gas from the North Sea."But to do that we will have to put another £300m into a site that is losing £10m a month, and we will not do that unless we can sort out this cost base."He added: "While this crucial issue is facing us, which will close the site before 2017 unless something is done, Unite are ignoring it and focusing on this issue about Steven Deans."It is frankly fiddling while Rome burns."On Sunday, the company announced that one of its key customers in Hull, which traditionally took up to 100,000 tonnes of product from Grangemouth, had been forced to close down.The Ineos Vinyl Acetate Monomer (Vam) facility at Saltend said that low cost imports into Europe had made closure inevitable.Mr MacLean said: "Unfortunately the closure of this world-scale Vam unit at the Hull site has a significant knock-on effect at Grangemouth as we lose a major customer for good."</body>

      <body>A South African union representing car workers has agreed a new pay deal, ending a month-long strike that has crippled the industry.The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa accepted a 10% pay rise this year and 8% in the next two years.The strike in the car components industry caused severe disruption, especially to exports.Last week BMW said it had stopped "all future plans" to expand in South Africa because of the industrial action.Under the deal, pay at small-to-medium-sized car parts firms will only rise wages by 9% in the first year, followed by 8% in the subsequent two years."The strike was very hard for us," Irvin Jim, the general secretary of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), told reporters.The car components' strike followed industrial action by workers at car manufacturers themselves, which hit production at BMW, Ford, Nissan and General Motors and cost an estimated $2bn (£1.24bn) in lost output.This year, the mining, construction and aviation sectors have also been hit by strikes, raising concerns about the impact on South Africa's economic growth.Last week, Bodo Donauer, managing director at BMW South Africa, said the company had been unable to produce 11,000 cars while its workers were striking."But more important than these 11,000 cars is the sustainable damage which this [the strike] has made," Mr Donauer said.On Sunday, Mr Jim said BMW's decision to stop future investment was "blackmail" which would be "rejected with the contempt it deserves".</body>

      <title>'Nuclear implications' of power loss</title>
      <description>A loss of power for more than 90 minutes at Devonport Dockyard had potential nuclear implications, a Ministry of Defence report says.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-24421402</url>
      <date>1381079044</date>
      <body>A loss of power at a city dockyard had "potential nuclear implications", a Ministry of Defence (MoD) report said.The 90-minute power-loss, at Devonport in Plymouth, could have been "catastrophic", a nuclear analyst said.Caused by a central nuclear switchboard fault at the yard, it was the most potentially dangerous of 50 "events" recorded in 2012.The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) has now issued an improvement notice on the dockyard.Power is essential at the dockyard to ensure reactors on the nuclear submarines are kept cool.The incident, in July 2012, was regarded as code-B on the sliding scale of "severity" - code A being the most severe.John Large, an engineer and independent nuclear analyst, said: "The loss of power was a catastrophic event, which is what happened before the Fukushima meltdown."According to the improvement notice the dockyard, which is operated by Babcock Marine, has until 31 March 2014 to meet its own operating rules and instructions.No-one from the operating firm has been available for comment.However, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said it took all safety concerns "extremely seriously" and was aware of the ONR improvement notice.In a statement issued to BBC News, the MoD said it understood Babcock Marine had agreed an improvement programme with the ONR to "enable the identified issues to be addressed in a timely manner"."We will continue to work with Babcock Marine and safety regulators to ensure that safety is managed effectively across the wider Devonport site," a spokesperson said.The ONR said Devonport Royal Dockyard Limited had taken action to remedy some of the problems identified and it was satisfied there was "no immediate impact on safety", but it believed the improvement notice was "necessary".In the "site event" report for HM Naval Base Devonport, the MoD said 50 events in 2012 was higher number than the two previous years, but "broadly similar" to the number recorded in 2008 and 2009.The report said it was "reasonable" to expect a rise in the number of events as there had been a corresponding increase in the number of "submarine" days in specially-designed nuclear dockyard berths."With more routine and non-routine nuclear activity, it is reasonable to expect an associated increase in the number of events," the report said.The report said previously unidentified faults in standby diesel generators meant the secondary power source was unable to re-supply power for more than 90 minutes."Through a combination of factors and additional unidentified defects, this defect was revealed, and resulted in an event with potential nuclear implications," the report said.An earthquake and tsunami off the coast of Japan in March 2011 knocked out cooling systems to reactors at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, three of which melted down.Devonport resident Ian Avent, who is also the organiser of the Campaign Against Nuclear Storage and Radiation, described the loss of power as "scary".Oliver Colvile, the Conservative MP for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, said he was very concerned about the situation and intended to speak to Babcock Marine about the actions it was taking.He said he expected the "highest levels of safety" to be maintained at the dockyard.</body>

      <title>Tory MP pushes for early EU vote</title>
      <description>A prominent Conservative backbench MP says he will try to force the government to hold an early referendum on whether the UK should leave the EU.</description>

      <date>1381073991</date>
      <body>Prominent Conservative backbencher Adam Afriyie has said he will try to force the government to hold an early vote on whether the UK should leave the EU.The prime minister has promised to hold an in/out referendum in 2017 if he wins the next general election, but Mr Afriyie said voters were "not convinced" that it would happen.He said he would push for a vote in October 2014 instead.But Home Secretary Theresa May warned that Mr Afriyie had "got it wrong".And a Downing Street spokesman said of Mr Afriyie's plan: "The PM will not let it stand."Mr Afriyie - who has denied newspaper claims he is being groomed to replace party leader David Cameron - said he would table an amendment to the European Union (Referendum) Bill on Monday.Mr Cameron has pledged to renegotiate the UK's relationship with the EU before an in/out referendum in 2017.But, speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics programme, Mr Afriyie said there would be "ample time" to conduct this renegotiation by as early as next year."By having a referendum in 2014, it gives us 12 months to renegotiate," he said. "But more than that, it kick-starts negotiations."EU member states would need to "accommodate" British demands for reforms "if they wish us to remain", he added.He argued: "I think it strengthens the prime minister's hand."The MP said 80% of people wanted a referendum, and more than 50% of people wanted a referendum this side of the election."British businesses need certainty," he said, adding he had struggled with his conscience over the matter."I don't want to cause any trouble over it, but I think it's absolutely essential that Parliament and MPs have the opportunity to search their souls and to give people a referendum this side of the election."In an article for the Mail on Sunday, he predicted that, without a referendum before 2015, "large numbers of people will continue to vote UKIP whatever happens, and if they do, there is a distinct danger that Labour will gain a majority and we will never see a referendum at all".UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he would be "absolutely delighted" if the nation could have a referendum before 2015, adding it would benefit British business.He told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme: "Adam Afriyie has put his finger on the real problem - and that's that four years ago, Mr Cameron gave us a cast-iron guarantee that there would be a referendum."This time last year, he was saying there would not be a referendum, and he is now saying there should be a referendum. People are not quite sure what to believe."But Mrs May told the BBC: "We need to be negotiating that settlement with the European Union and then put to the British people the Europe of the future - not the Europe of the past - and give them that opportunity to say in or out."What is crucial is that we have, at the next election, a Conservative party that will be offering people that renegotiation of a new settlement with Europe, looking to the future and then putting that to the British people in an in/out referendum."Backbench Conservative MP James Wharton is attempting to enshrine his party leadership's referendum pledge in law - without the support of coalition partners the Liberal Democrats - with his European Union (Referendum) Bill.As a private member's bill, it is vulnerable to being delayed by procedural tactics from MPs who oppose it, and will only become law if the government allocates enough parliamentary time for its proponents to overcome any such hurdles.Mrs May warned Mr Afriyie's amendment to the bill could "jeopardise" its prospects entirely.And Mr Wharton told BBC Radio 5 live the amendment could "kill" it."My concern is that any amendment, no matter how well-meaning it might be, is going to make the progress of the bill more difficult and it'll make it easier for those MPs who want to use procedural techniques to slow it down and stop it... that bit more possible."I don't want to see that. I'd like to see my bill go through and I think this harms the chances of that happening."Liberal Democrat deputy leader Simon Hughes, whose party opposes a referendum on the EU unless further powers are handed from Westminster to Brussels, said a 2014 referendum would be a "barmy" distraction from attempts to boost UK economic growth.Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said the Conservative leadership had scheduled a referendum in 2017 due to "internal party management as much as anything else".The PM's promise of a "grand, unilateral renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU" was "deeply flawed and bound to unravel", he added, in pre-released extracts of a speech to be delivered in London on Tuesday.Labour Party vice-chair, Michael Dugher MP, said "the Tories are back to obsessing about the European Union"."We need a prime minister and a government that will make dealing with the cost of living the number one priority. Instead David Cameron is too weak and out of touch to stop this latest outbreak of Tory infighting."The European Union (Referendum) Bill is due to return to the House of Commons for further debate on 8 November.</body>

      <title>Card fraudsters in 24-hour spree</title>
      <description>Bank card fraudsters target Surrey residents in a series of attempted thefts over a period of 24 hours, police say.</description>

      <date>1381053103</date>
      <body>Bank card fraudsters have targeted Surrey residents in a series of attempted thefts over a period of 24 hours, police said.Ten reports of attempted scams were reported to police, with the latest three calls received just after 21:00 BST on Saturday.The fraudsters phone people claiming to be a police officer and try to get them to hand over cash and cards.Attempted thefts happened in Guildford, Woking, Pyrford, Burpham and Chobham.The callers use a variety of stories including saying the person's bank card has been used by somebody they have in custody.They then ask the card holder to phone the bank to cancel the card and say they will send a courier round to collect it.The fraudster stays on the line and obtains the person's bank details whilst they think they are phoning the bank.A courier then visits the victim's home, saying they have been sent by the police to collect the card.The latest calls were received in Upshot Lane, Woking; Frog Grove Lane, Wood Street Village and Burnet Avenue, Burpham.An attempt was also made in Boltons Lane, Pyrford at about 17:30 BST, when a man claiming to be a courier attempted to get bank cards from an elderly resident.He is described as white, aged about 40, 5ft 8in (1.7m) tall and spoke with an eastern European accent. He was stocky, with short dark hair and was wearing a dark jacket and trousers.Officers have urged anyone who receives a suspicious call not give away any details and to call the police.</body>

      <title>Demand for Royal Mail shares strong</title>
      <description>Demand for Royal Mail shares is high enough for the government to sell them near the top of its hoped-for price band.</description>

      <date>1380883939</date>
      <body>Demand for Royal Mail shares is high enough for the government to be able to sell them near the top of its hoped-for price band.The government had priced the shares at between 260-330p, but demand is outstripping supply and they will be sold for between 300-330p.BBC business editor Robert Peston says applications for the shares are a "few times" the value of those on offer.Labour says there is a danger the privatisation undervalues the business.Shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, expressed concern over the possible sale of Royal Mail sites after the privatisation."Royal Mail has a huge property portfolio in prime development sites in London and across Britain and there is nothing to stop the privatised company making a quick buck by flogging off these assets for development," he said.He also said that if sites are sold customers could face longer trips to collect their mail.The government is selling up to 62% of the business and will keep the rest.Under the terms of the share sale a 10% stake in the business has been reserved for Royal Mail employees.Members of the Communication Workers Union are currently voting on whether to strike over the government's privatisation plan.The ballot closes on 16 October. The earliest a strike could be held would be 23 October.Members of the public can apply for Royal Mail shares online until 8 October. Shares will begin trading in full on 15 October.The minimum application for the public wishing to purchase shares is £750, or £500 for eligible Royal Mail employees.The government said it might also sell an additional 15% of its stake in what is called an "over-allotment" option, if the demand for shares was very high.In the official prospectus for the share issuing, the Royal Mail warned that industrial action posed a potential risk for the share price.The statement said: "National industrial action, or the threat of national industrial action... could also have a material adverse effect on the success of the offer and, if it occurs after admission, could cause the price of ordinary shares to fall significantly."</body>

      <title>Bank card fraud 'highest since 2009'</title>
      <description>Card fraud hits its highest half-yearly level since 2009 as fraudsters tricked consumers into handing over details, an industry group says.</description>

      <date>1380898071</date>
      <body>Card fraud hit its highest half-yearly level since 2009 as fraudsters tricked consumers into handing over details.Some £216m on credit and debit cards was lost to fraudsters in the first six months of the year, a 17% increase on the same period in 2012.Financial Fraud Action, which represents the financial services industry, said this was still well below the peak of £304m in 2008.Some con-artists have posed as police officers to gather vital information.Others have posed as bank fraud investigators to deceive people into handing over their cards or four-digit Pin.The figures show a 23% rise in the level of fraud on telephone, online and mail order shopping, as the trend of buying over the internet continues.Meanwhile, ID theft has risen by 24% and counterfeiting was up 15% when people's cards were cloned or skimmed.In June, Financial Fraud Action warned about "shoulder surfing", when thieves look over a person's shoulder while they key in their number at cash machines and then distract them as the card comes out of the ATM, enabling the thief to snatch it."The move towards these low-tech crimes of deception highlights the importance of consumers knowing how they can protect themselves," said Detective Chief Inspector Dave Carter, head of the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit."Whether victims are targeted on the phone or online, we know that these professional conmen are highly persuasive."He urged people to keep their Pin safe, shield it when using a cash machine, and check that a website is secure - featuring a padlock icon - when shopping online.He stressed that banks and police officers would never call or email to ask for a Pin number, or full login details.</body>

      <title>Cadbury loses colour purple fight</title>

      <date>1380892432</date>
      <body>Nestle has won a court battle with confectionery rival Cadbury, over Cadbury's attempt to trademark the purple colour of its Dairy Milk bars.Last year Cadbury won a legal case to stop other chocolate firms using the colour - known as Pantone 2865c.But Swiss firm Nestle, the world's biggest food company, has now won an appeal against that earlier ruling."Cadbury's formulation does not comply with the requirements for [trademark] registration," said the UK court.The Court of Appeal also said the trademark application lacked "the required clarity, precision, self-containment, durability and objectivity to qualify for registration".The legal battle has been running since 2008, when Nestle first opposed Cadbury's initial trademark application.Cadbury - bought by US food giant Kraft in 2010 - has been using a purple colour on its chocolate wrappers since the early 20th century."We are disappointed by this latest decision but it's important to point out that it does not affect our long held right to protect our distinctive colour purple from others seeking to pass off their products as Cadbury chocolate," said a Cadbury spokesman."Our colour purple has been linked with Cadbury for a century and the British public has grown up understanding its link with our chocolate."We are studying this particular ruling and will consider our next steps which includes the possibility of an appeal."Nestle said it welcomed the court decision, which it believed "was the right outcome from a legal perspective".</body>

      <title>Sotheby's adopts 'poison pill'</title>

      <body>The auction house Sotheby's has put in place a defence to ward off takeovers, just days after an attack on its leadership by an activist investor.It gives existing shareholders rights to double their shareholding should any investor's stake go above 10%.The "poison pill" would make it much more expensive for Mr Loeb to build a stake of more than 10%.This week investor Daniel Loeb, who has a 9.3% stake, said Sotheby's was a painting desperately needing restoring."Poison pill" defences are so-called because they should make a target company unpalatable to predators.Through his hedge fund, Third Point, Mr Loeb targets what he considers to be underperforming companies.Previously his fund has taken significant stakes in Sony and Yahoo.In a letter sent earlier this week he said Sotheby's boss William Ruprecht enjoyed the perks of a "long-gone era of imperial CEOs", that included club memberships.He has accused Sotheby's management of wasting shareholders' money, singling out what he says was an "extravagant" lunch and dinner at a famous restaurant in New York, where they "feasted on organic delicacies and imbibed vintage wines at a cost to shareholders of multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars."We acknowledge that Sotheby's is a luxury brand, but there appears to be some confusion - this does not entitle senior management to live a life of luxury at the expense of shareholders."Third Point has been a strong buyer of Sotheby's shares, building up its stake from 5.7% in August to its current holding of more than 9%.</body>

      <title>Silk Road accused appears in court</title>

      <date>1380912783</date>
      <body>The alleged mastermind behind the online illegal drugs marketplace Silk Road is too dangerous to be bailed, US prosecutors have said.Ross Ulbricht, 29, was arrested this week and is charged with being the administrator of the site which has now been shut down.He is also accused of trying to arrange the killing of one of the site's users."We deny all charges and that is the end of the discussion at this point," Mr Ulbricht's lawyer said.Mr Ulbricht appeared in a San Francisco court on Friday wearing a green T-shirt under red jail clothes and had his ankles shackled.A request from his legal team for his bail hearing to be pushed back was granted - it will now take place on 9 October.Federal magistrate Joseph Spero asked Mr Ulbricht's lawyer Brandon LeBlanc whether seeing the criminal indictment that included a murder-for-hire charge had "changed his calculus" on whether he thought Mr Ulbricht would be granted bail.As part of its criminal complaint, the FBI alleged that Mr Ulbricht had sought to pay a Silk Road user to kill another user who had threatened to expose details of the site's users.Prosecutors opposed the delay, arguing that Mr Ulbricht represented a danger to the community, and that there was a high likelihood that he may attempt to flee.The Silk Road was a well-known destination on Tor, a so-called "dark web" service that anonymises users, making it much more difficult for authorities to track locations.The site sold a range of items, but was most famous for offering a host of illegal drugs, paid for using virtual currency Bitcoin.</body>

      <title>Child benefit deadline day looms</title>
      <description>A tax boss says nearly 200,000 parents must "get off their backsides" and register with the UK tax authority amid changes to child benefit.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24396857</url>
      <date>1380919790</date>
      <body>A tax boss has said nearly 200,000 parents must "get off their backsides" and register with the UK tax authority amid changes to child benefit.Saturday marks the first deadline for better-off families to sign up with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).They will need to register for self-assessment so the HMRC can claw some or all of the benefit back.Families where one parent has a taxable income of more than £50,000 are affected.They will lose some of the benefit, following the introduction of the new rules in January 2013, while child benefit has been withdrawn entirely if one parent earns more than £60,000.Eligible families receive £20.30 per week in child benefit for their first child and £13.40 a week for any further children.The new rules meant that this payment is reduced gradually for families where one parent is earning between £50,000 and £60,000.HMRC has written to people who it believes have a taxable income of more than £50,000 and so need to take some action. Taxable income is earnings from employment, as well as other income such as from savings and shares, but may not include some pension contributions.Lin Homer, HMRC chief executive, told BBC Radio 5 Live: "We think there is about 200,000 people who need to get off their backsides and do something."Some 350,000 people have opted out of receiving child benefit altogether, generally because they earn and will continue to earn a taxable income of more than £60,000 and therefore would not be entitled to the payment.HMRC says another 425,000 people were already in self-assessment, some 140,000 people have registered for self-assessment, and another 185,000 people have still to register.In theory, the deadline to register and avoid a possible penalty is 5 October. The penalty would be between 10% and 100% of the child benefit paid.However, HMRC says it is unlikely that anyone who registers and pays the tax by 31 January would be penalised."HMRC is committed to helping people pay the right amount of tax and urges parents who have been affected by the changes to child benefit to register for self-assessment," said Ms Homer."We know that lots of people leave it until the last minute."Anita Monteith, of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, said: "This adds considerable complication to the tax system for ordinary people, particularly for those brought into the self-assessment system for the first time."I would urge those affected to register for self-assessment as soon as they can."</body>

      <title>Twitter plans to raise $1bn in IPO</title>
      <description>In documents made public for the first time, social networking company Twitter has said it plans to raise $1bn as part of its stock market debut.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24392336</url>
      <date>1380856665</date>
      <body>Social networking company Twitter has said it plans to raise $1bn (£619m) in its stock market debut in documents filed with US regulators.In the filing, revealed on Thursday, the seven-year-old company said that it now has 218 million monthly users and that 500 million tweets are sent a day.It made a loss of $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m.It will be the largest Silicon Valley stock offering since Facebook's listing in 2012.Analysts said that the offering was likely to get a good response."Social media is red hot," said Internet analyst Lou Kerner. "Twitter is front and centre benefiting from market enthusiasm for all things social, and remarkably strong metrics."The filing also revealed Twitter's finances for the first time.While the company has never made a profit, its revenue has grown from just $28m in 2010 to $317m by the end of 2012.Around 85% of Twitter's revenue last year came from ad sales; the rest was from licensing its data.The company takes in a significant portion of its ad revenue from mobile devices, an important metric often tracked by analysts.As of 2013, over 65% of the company's advertising revenue was generated from mobile devices. More than 75% of Twitter users accessed the site from their mobile phone during that same time period.Some analysts said that the decision by the firm to raise capital indicated that it was keen on improving the way people enjoy content on its platform and how advertisers connect with its users."Users should be happy about this," said Zachary Reiss-Davis, an analyst with Forrester."It looks like Twitter is looking at how to enrich the experience and it understands that to build a successful service, they have to create something people like and want to come back to and spend time on."Peter Esho from Sydney-based Invast Financial Services, added that Twitter's ease to use had seen it increase its user base, making it an attractive option for advertisers."I think what Twitter has working in its favour is that it's very easy to use: it doesn't eat up too much bandwidth for the average user in places where broadband penetration is low," he said.The filing also revealed that two of the company's co-founders, Evan Williams and Jack Dorsey, own significant stakes in Twitter, and could stand to take in significant sums from the company's stock market listing.Mr Williams owns 12% of shares in the company, while Mr Dorsey owns 4.9%.Benchmark Capital's Peter Fenton, an early investor in the company, is the second-biggest shareholder, with 6.7% of shares.Twitter indicated three weeks earlier that it had filed for a public stock market offering.However, under a new law passed by Congress in 2012, it did not have to reveal its financial documents because it had revenue of less than $1bn.But by releasing the documents publicly, it gave an indication that it hopes to complete its stock sale soon.The company plans to list under the stock symbol TWTR, but it did not reveal which stock exchange, the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange, it had chosen.However, Mr Esho said that the listing was likely to be on the Nasdaq."I was to speculate, I think it would have to be Nasdaq," he said. "That really is the exchange that has seen so many tech names come to the market."Goldman Sachs is the lead bank taking the company public, a coveted position that is often fought for amongst the nation's biggest banks.The other banks helping with the offering are Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, BofA Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank Securities and CODE Advisors.</body>

      <body>Suspected members of a drug trafficking gang in Bolivia have thrown a bag containing more than $1m (£615,000) from a low-flying plane.The cash was supposed to be collected by other gang members on the ground in eastern Santa Cruz province, said Interior Minister Carlos Romero.But they missed the target and the bag was seized by Bolivian anti-drugs police, who later made several arrests.Bolivia is one of the world's top three cocaine producers.The authorities say the money - in US dollar bills of various denominations - was wrapped with a seal from a bank in neighbouring Paraguay.They believe it was going to be used either to build a cocaine production centre or to set up a fake commercial enterprise in Bolivia."Three Bolivian citizens have been detained in the operation," said Mr Romero.Guns and vehicles were also seized near the town of Rincon del Tigre.Bolivian police had been monitoring the gang, which is believed to be well organised and with links to several countries.Peru, Bolivia and Colombia are the world's biggest coca leaf and cocaine producers, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.Coca leaf production is legal in small amounts in Bolivia, where it is used to alleviate the effects of the high altitude. But the production of cocaine is banned.</body>

      <body>Students in England face a cost-of-living crisis as loans and grants fail to keep pace with rents and bills, claims the National Union of Students.The gap between income and expenditure for a typical student amounts to more than £7,600 according to NUS analysis.The union compared the cost of living and studying for the 39-week 2013-14 academic year with typical income from government grants and loans.The government said it was targeting support at those who needed it most.Rent, bills and other outgoings continue to rise year after year above the rate of inflation but grants and loan rates were frozen this year and will only rise by 1% next year, says the union.It estimates that a student living outside London will pay an average of £21,440 in tuition fees, books, equipment, rent, travel and other living expenses.Against this, they have a potential income of £13,747 composed of their tuition fee loan plus maintenance loans and the grants available to those on average and low incomes.This leaves a shortfall of £7,693.In London, higher rents mean students typically spend £23,187 says the union - but they are also eligible for a higher maintenance loan of £6,090 though this still leaves them with a shortfall of £7,654, says the union.The union adds that some students from less well-off families who are eligible for grants are facing an additional squeeze as the level at which they can claim maximum support has remained at a household income of £25,000 since 2008.NUS president Toni Pearce said: "Those who do not have the rare luxury of resorting to the 'bank of mum and dad' are increasingly being driven to work full-time alongside study where jobs can be found, or worse still, into the arms of predatory pay day lenders just to make ends meet."We need a financial support system that ensures students get what the support they need, when they need it."A spokeswoman for the Department for Business Innovation and Skills said the government's student finance package was designed to target support at students from the poorest households."This year, students from the lowest income households can access over £7,100 of living-cost support, of which over £3,350 does not have to be repaid."The government also provides additional, non-repayable support to students in specific circumstances, such as students with children and disabled students."Scholarships and bursaries are also available from most universities, and students in hardship can apply for additional support through the Access to Learning Fund."</body>

      <title>Fine over unemployment phone scam</title>
      <description>Unemployed people were tricked into calling expensive premium rate numbers while applying for non-existent jobs.</description>

      <body>The man behind a phone scam targeting the unemployed has been fined £75,000 by the regulator PhonepayPlus.Jobseekers were tricked into calling expensive premium rate numbers while applying for non-existent jobs.In the ruling, the regulator said the numbers were run by sole trader John Francis, from Epsom, and cost callers a least 50p a minute. Some spent more than £80 enquiring about jobs.The regulator said the trick gave false hope to vulnerable people.Jobseeker Karl Lever told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours he was charged £40 after he responded to an advert for bar staff in Brighton.In his hour-long phone call he was asked about his suitability for the role, previous experience and even his medical history."In hindsight it did feel like they were trying to keep me on the phone for as long as possible," he said.In a statement, PhonepayPlus said: "When it received these complaints PhonepayPlus launched an investigation and found that they were linked. It then identified John Francis, registered as a sole trader, as the person responsible for the service."As well as the £75,000 fine, he has been ordered to refund all those affected.Paul Whiteing, PhonepayPlus chief executive, told You and Yours: "He has seven days to pay and if he doesn't we will pursue him through the courts."They look like conventional mobile phone numbers, therefore many people don't realise what they are - so something should be done about that."It's unacceptable."None of the callers were told about the cost of the calls and most believed they were calling a mobile number. But the 070 numbers cost at least 50p a minute and those running the lines take a cut.PhonepayPlus acknowledge that it can be confusing and said they were working with Ofcom, which allocates phone numbers, and are reviewing the use of these numbers.The regulator also found the same numbers used for bogus jobs on adverts for cheap housing and in spam emails sent out offering work.One complainant told the regulator about spending an hour on the phone trying to arrange an interview. After complaining about the delay, the complainant was told: "You'll be even less happy when you get the bill."John Francis has seven days to pay the fine, otherwise further action will be taken. He did not respond to the regulator.</body>

      <title>Energy price freeze 'will happen'</title>
      <description>Labour leader Ed Miliband says he is "absolutely clear" that energy bills will be frozen if his party wins the next general election.</description>

      <date>1380878080</date>
      <body>Labour leader Ed Miliband has said he is "absolutely clear" that energy bills will be frozen if his party wins the next general election."We are absolutely confident because we've done all the figures, we've looked at all of the issues," he told the BBC's Breakfast programme.He repeated his accusation that energy companies have been over-charging businesses and consumers.Critics have warned that the plan could put future energy supplies at risk.But Mr Miliband claimed that energy companies were "unreliable witnesses" in the debate: "They're the people who would say that anyway.""There's a cost-of-living crisis in this country. Energy bills are a big part of it," he said."For too long the companies have been able to over-charge people. Somebody's got to stand up and be counted."That's why we'll freeze energy bills until the beginning of 2017 if we win the election. That will benefit 1.5 million businesses across our country, make a big difference to them."The policy was unveiled at the party's annual conference last week, and has faced strong criticism about its feasibility and the effect it would have on investment in energy infrastructure.But Mr Miliband continued: "Even if wholesale prices rise, this freeze is going to happen. I want to be absolutely clear about this."We're absolutely confident the companies can stomach this, can make this happen, and we're going to make this happen."He again dismissed predictions that energy companies might try to "collude" and hike prices before the election."If they try and do that, that is illegal," he said, "they can't do that."Labour has also released figures suggesting that British business could save £1.5bn if the price freeze came into force.The party said the estimate was based on research by the House of Commons Library.Meanwhile, two energy companies, EDF and First Utility, have unveiled plans to freeze current prices voluntarily.EDF Energy unveiled a new tariff that fixes bills until 2017, and First Utility said its current variable tariff would be frozen until March 2014.The former head of the UK's competition watchdog, John Fingleton, has suggested Labour's price-freeze policy was unlikely to work."In the long term [it] will harm consumers, and taking political responsibility for prices you cannot ultimately control is quite risky," he said earlier this month.The Conservatives have accused Labour of "bashing business" and insisted action was already being taken to ensure customers are on the cheapest tariff.Energy UK, the trade body representing the six largest energy firms, said the move could push up prices across the board and threaten the 600,000 people employed in the industry.</body>

      <title>UK services growth at 16-year high</title>
      <description>Activity in the UK services sector grew at its fastest pace since 1997 in the third quarter of the year, a survey indicates, helped by the housing market recovery.</description>

      <body>Activity in the UK services sector grew at its fastest pace since 1997 in the third quarter of the year, a closely-watched survey has indicated.The Markit/CIPS PMI services index said the rise was due to growth in financial services, bolstered by the housing market, and the business sector.The survey raises hopes that the economy as a whole saw strong growth in the July-to-September period.The PMI survey showed services continued to grow strongly last month.The activity index for the sector recorded 60.3 in September, which was marginally down from August's near seven-year high of 60.5. Any score above 50 indicates growth.The strong reading for the UK services sector follows similarly strong surveys of the manufacturing and construction sectors published earlier this week.David Noble, chief executive officer at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, said: "After nearly six lost years of economic output, the UK economy looks to have really found its feet."He said the survey reflected the stability in the global economy, which the services sector was taking "full advantage of"."The industry sustained August's impressive business growth, dipping only fractionally from a near seven-year high, and new orders have now been growing for nine months consecutively," Mr Noble added.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said there were "encouraging signs" that growth would continue in the coming months."September saw one of the largest inflows of new business ever seen by the services survey," he said.</body>

      <body>House prices are rising at their highest annual pace for more than three years, the Halifax says, as demand for properties continues to rise.Prices in the three months to September were 6.2% higher than a year earlier, the highest rate since June 2010.Prices rose by 0.3% in September compared with the month before, taking the average house price to £170,733.However, the average price of a home still remains 14% below the peak reached in August 2007.Last week, the Nationwide said that house prices rose at an annual pace of 5% in September.The Halifax said demand for property was rising thanks to low interest rates and improving consumer confidence.It added that government schemes - such as Funding for Lending and Help to Buy - also appeared to have increased demand for housing.The recovery in property prices over the past few months has led to concerns that the market could be in danger of overheating.However, others note that prices and activity still remain well below levels seen before the financial crisis, and that the rise in prices has been centred around London and the South East.The Halifax added there were signs that more properties were starting to come on to the market, which could begin to slow price increases."The recent strengthening in house prices is increasing the amount of equity that many homeowners have in their home, enabling more to put their property on the market for sale," said Martin Ellis, housing economist at the Halifax.The Halifax also noted that levels of housebuilding were starting to increase.On Wednesday, a survey of the UK's construction sector suggested that housebuilding activity grew last month at its fastest pace for almost a decade,</body>

      <body>Goldman Sachs' boss Lloyd Blankfein has warned that a failure to raise the nation's borrowing limit would be "extremely adverse".The warning came after a meeting between US President Barack Obama and 15 heads of large companies on Wednesday.Business leaders want Washington to understand "the long-term consequences of a shutdown," said Mr Blankfein.The US government has been shut down since Tuesday, 1 October.Other well-known business leaders who attended the meeting included Michael Corbat of Citigroup, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, and Brian Moynihan of Bank of America.By some estimates, the government shutdown is costing the US economy $300m (£185m) per day. If it continues, it could shave as much as 0.9% off third-quarter GDP growth.Mr Blankfein and his banking counterparts have expressed concern that there is a possibility the impasse over the US budget could bleed into efforts to raise the so-called debt ceiling, which allows the US government to borrow money to pay back its debts.The current debt ceiling of $16.7 trillion has already been breached in 2013, and the US Treasury has been engaging in a series of "extraordinary measures" since the summer to continue paying the nation's bills.US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has warned that those measures will be exhausted by 17 October, and then the nation would be forced to default on its debts.Mr Obama is scheduled to meet Congressional leaders later on Wednesday.</body>

      <title>The drink of kings makes a comeback</title>
      <description>Mead, the stuff of kings and Renaissance fairs, is growing in popularity again in the US, as the BBC's Kim Gittleson reports.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24184527</url>
      <date>1380755618</date>
      <body>Long relegated to the dusty corners of history, mead - the drink of kings and Vikings - is making a comeback in the US.But what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe."Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour.When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel."If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works," he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge."We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day," explains Mr Alexander.It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead."It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages," he gushes.After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business.His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US.It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China.Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead.Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade."We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years," she says."I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once."Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree.Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead "is becoming more and more available - similar to cider".Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry.But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments."I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is," says Mr Alexander."You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience."The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers who were just looking for something good to pair with food. But mead has since changed."People don't realise that just because it has honey in it, [mead] doesn't need to be sweet," says Ms Rowe, citing the proliferation of not only dry meads but also meads flavoured with fruits, herbs, and spicy peppers.Yet hampering efforts towards building mead awareness is also the name mead itself.Technically, mead is classified as wine by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which regulates alcohol sales and labelling in the US.This means that mead has to be labelled as "honey wine", which doesn't help combat people's perception of the drink as being as cloyingly sweet."How do people recognise it as mead if you can't say the word?" says Ms Rowe.Ironically, the alcoholic beverage that most credit with the resurgence of the mead business is beer.The craft brewing movement, which was recently singled out in a report by the Atlanta Federal Reserve as a source of job growth, inspired many home brewers to expand their repertoire."I was a home brewer, and at first I liked mead because I had never had it," says Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit, Michigan."Every home brewer has the same dream of, 'Hey what if I could sell this? Wouldn't that be great?'" he says.After he spent months making batch after batch of mead, perfecting his recipe, he realised that mead was "kind of an untouched category", and that no-one, at least back in 2008, was really doing it commercially.So when he and his wife, Kerri, were both laid off of their jobs in Detroit's car industry during the recession, they decided to take the plunge.Now, B Nektar is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, US meadery, shipping 1,100 cases a week across the country.But for Mr Dahlhofer and his fellow mead enthusiasts, that's just the beginning."If you look at craft beer 25 years ago, they had 1% of the total beer market, and now they have 8%," says Maine Mead's Mr Alexander."So we've got a long way to go, but I feel like it's got the opportunity because of the diversity of the beverage."You've got a canvas with very few limits."</body>

      <title>Pioneer woman in Sri Lankan business</title>
      <description>Nimali Gunawardana is a 25-year-old Sri Lankan proving that young women can succeed in the country's male-dominated business world.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24206038</url>
      <date>1380496667</date>
      <body>Nimali Gunawardana, a petite, soft-spoken 25-year-old, is a lot tougher than she looks.From an impoverished upbringing as one of seven children in a poor family in rural Sri Lanka, she has turned herself through sheer drive and determination into one of the country's most up-and-coming young businesswomen.Able to recover from one serious business setback along the way, the self-made boss and her company - Nimali Chips and Fibre Mill - are now continuing to prosper in Sri Lanka's male-dominated business community.And Ms Gunawardana now has her sights set on exporting."I am happy that I have broken down the barriers a woman has to face in Sri Lankan society," she says."I've always had ambition, and I want to get to the top."Ms Gunawardana's company turns discarded coconut husks into three useful materials - coir, coir pith and husk chips.Coir is the fibrous outer cover of the coconut. It can be made into everything from string and rope to fishing nets, brushes and mattresses.Coir pith, one layer down, has a cork-like texture, and is used as a compost. Husk chips, made by crushing up the hard part of coconut shells, are also used as a growing material for plants, and even to filter water.Ms Gunawardana set up the company just over a year ago, and it now processes 15,000 coconuts a day.The business, based in the southern rural district of Ambalantota, employs 13 people - 11 women and two men.For Ms Gunawardana it is a far cry from her first job working as a sewing machine operator in a clothing factory.She says: "My parents are poor, and when I was at school I always wanted more money for the family."So I had to earn money, and I got a job at a garment factory. I didn't like it, I didn't like the supervisors always blaming you, I didn't like working for someone else, but I was able to save up money."I knew I wanted to save up the money to establish my own business."And so, using cash she had saved and money invested by some of her friends, she bought the lease for a coir-producing factory in 2010.Unfortunately she soon realised she did not have the experience to run a company. More pressingly, she was unaware that the business had a number of outstanding loans.As a result, she had to close down the company, losing 300,000 Sri Lankan rupees ($2,300; £1,400).Many people would have given up the dream of owning their own business, but Ms Gunawardana was determined to bounce back.After the company failure, no bank would lend to her, so she went to Youth Business Sri Lanka, a business support organisation that is part of Youth Business International, the global charity run by the Prince of Wales.Youth Business gave her a week's training in running a company, her own mentor, and a modest loan of 100,000 Sri Lankan rupees.And so her new company, Nimali Chips and Fibre Mill, was born in August last year, and is proving a success.Ms Gunawardana says she is on target for turnover this year of 5.1m Sri Lankan rupees ($39,000), and she is able to pay back the money lent by her friends.She says: "When I first started out in business, my parents did not agree with my choice, mainly because I am a girl. In rural parts of Sri Lanka, women like me are very rare."But now my parents are proud, and they give me their support, as does my husband."Ms Gunawardana has now been married for nine months, and her husband quit his job to work for her.Such has been the success of her new company that Youth Business International recently awarded her the global title of Start-up Entrepreneur of the Year 2013.Ms Gunawardana travelled to London this month to receive the award from the Prince of Wales.She now has her eyes on expanding the business.Ms Gunawardana currently sells her products to other companies who then export them. She wants to start doing the exporting herself. She also plans to start making products from what she produces, with her company starting to turn its coir into rope."I have faced a lot of challenges, but I have also had help from Youth Business. I hope that more young women in Sri Lanka think of starting their own companies."</body>

      <description>The BBC's Jennifer Pak speaks to Lew Fong Voon about his passion for shoe design and how he came to create his own brand in Malaysia.</description>

      <date>1380668759</date>
      <body>What makes an entrepreneur? The BBC's Jennifer Pak spoke to Lew Fong Voon (now known as Lewre Lew) about discovering his passion for shoe design while working in a manufacturers and how, despite initial obstacles, he came to create his own brand.In 1991, Lew Fong Voon thought he had a big break when his shoe trading company was chosen as one of nine businesses to represent Malaysia at an international exhibition.He gathered all of the best designs sourced from Malaysian factories because he said that the GDS fair in Germany was "like the Olympics" of the shoe industry.But nobody looked at his collection.People had no idea where Malaysia was or how to even pronounce the name of the country, said Mr Lew."It was very discouraging and at the same time humiliating," he said.Mr Lew did not get any business that year or the next two years after that but he continued to show up at the annual international shoe fair even when the other Malaysian companies had given up.He believed Malaysia had very good shoe craftsmen but didn't have updated designs. Bringing back ideas from the fair, he aimed to change this.In the fourth year, two customers finally ordered a thousand pairs of shoes from Mr Lew. The small shipment helped launch his overseas business.Over the next decade he produced shoes for international labels, but there was a slow push in the country to not only rely on natural resources and cheap manufacturing.Mr Lew was inspired to work on his own brand after he met fellow Malaysian designer Jimmy Choo.He produced his mid-priced collection under the name Lewre, a loose combination of his surname and the name of his first company, Roondy, in 1997 at the start of the Asian financial crisis.The venture was risky but it also meant that production costs became cheaper, he says.Mr Lew's company weathered the financial crisis. He attributes this to the fact that his childhood prepared him for the tough battle. He was one of ten children in his family. Food was a struggle. At eight years old, he started working at a plantation in northern Perak state, tapping rubber trees before dawn to help make ends meet for his family.Mr Lew 's commute to work required him to walk across terrain filled with snakes and the sounds of tigers growling nearby."It was full of challenges [and] I think full of fun," he said.Today, Mr Lew has exchanged the jungle for a spacious office on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur and has expanded his brand to more than 20 countries.He turned an initial capital investment of RM50,000 ($15,000; £10,000) in shoe manufacturing in the late 1980s into a company whose revenue is expected to reach $25m (£15.5m) in three years' time.At the Lewre headquarters in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia, middle-aged women sit in the back of the workshop sewing each bead onto a satin heel.Mint-green shoe moulds belonging to affluent women, including actress Michelle Yeoh and the Duchess of Cambridge, hang in the backroom.The recent global downturn has not slowed down Mr Lew's expansion plans. He is set to open a couture shop in London and the company has invested millions to develop several new sub-brands.Mr Lew describes his designs as "fashion forward". He wants to prove that Asian brands can produce quality products that appeal to a global audience.His future projects could make even more customers take notice - Mr Lew has considered designing high-heel shoes for men.It was normal for women to wear 4-5in (10-13cm) heels now, so as our women got taller so the men needed to "catch up," said Mr Lew.</body>

      <title>Fifa sets up 2022 World Cup taskforce</title>
      <description>Fifa agrees to set up a taskforce to look into alternative dates for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</description>

      <body>Fifa has agreed to set up a taskforce to look into alternative dates for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.But a final decision on when the tournament could be played will not take place before the 2014 World Cup.Fears that Qatar's hot summer temperatures could pose a heath risk to players and fans forced football's world governing body to act.The taskforce will consult with medical experts, broadcasters, sponsors and influential European leagues."We need to carry out very deep consultations and investigations and show some diplomacy and wisdom," said Fifa president Sepp Blatter.At the climax of a two-day meeting in Zurich, Blatter also confirmed Asian Football Confederation president Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim al-Khalifa would head the taskforce.The BBC understands that Fifa is considering inviting English Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore to be a member of the working group.He has been an outspoken opponent of plans to stage a World Cup in the northern hemisphere winter, claiming it would lead to disruption in many domestic leagues.The name of FA general secretary Alex Horne has also been mooted but sources say the final composition will be subject to agreement by Fifa's executive committee.The Premier League said in a statement: "We welcome the news that Fifa intends to conduct a thorough consultation process involving all of the appropriate stakeholders, including confederations, associations, leagues and clubs."Qatar was awarded the World Cup in December 2010, beating Australia, Japan, South Korea and the United States in a vote.The Gulf state planned to combat the fierce heat, with temperatures rising to in excess of 40C, by building air-conditioned stadiums.But concerns remained, prompting Blatter to announce in July this year that the World Cup should be switched to a cooler time of the year, away from Qatar's summer months of June and July.There have also been calls to strip the desert nation of the right to stage the World Cup completely and run the vote again.But Blatter insisted: "The Fifa World Cup 2022 will be played in Qatar. There you have it."Qatar has also come under scrutiny after a British newspaper published a report that accused the country of abusing the rights of migrant workers.Blatter said Fifa could not get involved in labour issues in any country but added that his organisation "cannot ignore" the allegations."I express all my sympathy and regret for anything that happens in any country where there are deaths on construction sites, especially when they are related to a World Cup," he told a news conference.Hassan Al Thawadi, head of Qatar's organising committee, has already said the Gulf state was addressing concerns."It's not a World Cup being built on the blood of innocents," he said. "That is unacceptable to anybody. We will be eradicating these issues."Prior to Friday's announcement, Harold Mayne-Nicholls, the head of the Fifa inspection team that assessed Qatar's 2022 World Cup bid, thought the tournament should be moved to January and February, when temperatures in the Gulf state average about 22C.However, that could lead to a potential clash with other big sporting events, notably the Winter Olympics and American football's Super Bowl, as well as domestic football leagues and the Champions League.New International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach has said he is confident there will be no clash with the Winter Olympics.American TV network Fox, World Cup rights-holder for North America, is understood to be concerned over the commercial implications of any move that would see the World Cup clash with the NFL season.</body>

Refurbishment work on the stadium is already lagging behind schedule.Judge Lorena Colnago said workers were at serious risk of accidents.She ordered a new inspection be carried out before work could resume."Countless infractions have been committed, in various stages of the building process," the judge from Brazil's labour tribunal said.She said workers were in danger of "being buried, run over and of collision, falling from heights and being hit by construction material, among other serious risks".The news comes a week after an investigation revealed that construction workers employed on another World Cup-related project faced what were termed "slave-like" conditions.Investigators said that more than 100 workers employed to expand Sao Paulo's international airport were living in unsuitable accommodation near the building site.In August, Sports Minister Aldo Rebelo said he was worried about delays at five stadiums still being built for next year's football World Cup.Arena de Baixada, which is owned by football club Atletico Paranaense, was among the five.Plans for its refurbishment have already been scaled back. After a visit from Fifa Secretary-General Jerome Valcke, the club said it would now not fit a retractable roof in order to speed the work up.Mr Valcke said all the stadiums would have to be ready in December and warned he would not tolerate any more delays as there was "no plan B".The World Cup will be played in 12 stadiums across the country.The opening match is due to take place at a brand-new venue being built in the outskirts of Sao Paulo on 12 June 2014.The final is scheduled for 13 July in the country's most famous football stadium, the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro.</body>

      <body>The Scottish Professional Football League has signed a new sponsorship deal with Irn Bru believed to be worth a "substantial six-figure sum".The figure for Scottish-based beverage company AG Barr for their beverage to become the league's official soft drink was confirmed by a SPFL source.But the league is continuing its search for a main sponsor.Irn Bru was the sponsor of the Scottish Football League for six seasons before this summer's league merger.SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster said: "It is a very positive sign to the market that such a strong brand has invested in the new SPFL set-up."AG Barr head of marketing Adrian Troy also welcomed the three-year agreement."We're proud that our deal with the SPFL lets us extend our support to the clubs across all four divisions," he said.Doncaster revealed the search for a title sponsor of the Scottish Professional Football League and League Cup continues but refused to put a time scale on any announcement."We remain in discussions with a number of different bodies around League title sponsorship and also League Cup sponsorship," said Doncaster. "Those conversations will continue."It is important that we take the time to partner with the right organisation. It is important not to put time scales on this. It is important to work with the various brands that we are talking to and in time, be able to announce the right brand and the right fit for the SPFL."We have all sorts of licensing deals and we have a very good broadcast deal."I think today's deal demonstrates the confidence that exists within the SPFL and within Scottish football in general."</body>

      <title>One city's house price surge</title>
      <description>House prices double in a decade - but this is not London</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24348196</url>
      <date>1381100429</date>
      <body>Two cities in the UK - one is a centre of commerce, has runaway house prices, and welcomes a constant stream of overseas property buyers. The other is London.House prices in and around Aberdeen have more than doubled in the past 10 years, according to data from the Nationwide Building Society.That increase is only matched by the trendy north London borough of Islington, and by Westminster in the heart of the capital of the UK.Recent figures show that Scotland's third city is recording a fresh surge in property prices. One estate agent describes the area as a property force field."Everywhere outside is doom and gloom, but it is boom time here," says Brian Sutton, of James and George Collie solicitors and estate agents.Take a closer look at Aberdeen, and its picturesque, shimmering granite homes, and you can see the complexity of the UK property market.The city has demand from first-time buyers willing to pay above valuation levels, interest from workers moving to the area, investors keen to get in on the act, and a lack of homes for sale.All this pushes up prices. Yet, in Scotland as a whole, prices are only creeping up after years of stagnation.It shows that averages can be misleading and that local areas can have very different trends to neighbouring regions, for reasons ranging from the quality of local schools to employment levels.It also questions a widely held belief that the London property market is unique - that soaring prices in the south-east of England are unequalled in the rest of the country.At the mouth of Aberdeen Harbour, next to the fishermen's village of Footdee, is a landmark called the Roundhouse.The Shoremaster's accounts for 1797-98 show that more than £225 was spent on the new house and telescope on the site.Nowadays, first-time buyers in the city can expect to pay up to £140,000 for a one-bedroom flat, or up to £500,000 for a bigger property.Competition for homes means many buyers are paying 5% to 10% over valuation at the moment, says Bill Barclay, partner at Raeburns solicitors and estate agents.Often sales go to sealed bids, with first-timers stretching their savings to compete with buy-to-let investors.Spend a few minutes standing by the harbour and the reason for this active property market is clear - North Sea oil."It drives the local economy," says Mr Barclay. "Big companies are making long-term financial plans for the area, so we are not going to see much changing."The area was not immune to the financial crisis. Banks were not lending at the levels they had been before 2008, but Mr Barclay says Glasgow and Edinburgh suffered much more.Now, he says - using a phrase apt for an oil-producing region - the banks are "starting to open the taps" again to fund mortgages.Figures published by the University of Aberdeen show a 25% increase in the volume of sales in the second quarter of the year compared with the same three months in 2011. Prices were up by 5.5% in the city and its suburbs over the same period.Sales volumes of flats were up by 53% in that time, as buy-to-let investors find the finance and predict demand from tenants.All this is gloomy news for potential first-time buyers. One 32-year-old tells the BBC he has been renting on the south coast of England and then Aberdeen over the past 15 years and is unable to save anything close to what is needed as a deposit.You hardly see a sale sign erected within the city's sought-after areas, with supply low and competition picking up. But the market is far from overheating, as it was in 2007, according to estate agent Brian Sutton."We had people in their early 20s buying property, with 10 to 20 bidding for one property. Competition has come back, but it is three to four people bidding," he says."First-time buyers are in their early 30s, not their 20s, often with their parents helping."He predicts the housing market will continue to rise at a "sustainable rate", especially as the oil companies build headquarters in the area and continue to relocate staff to the region.Prices may grow by single figures year-on-year, he says, but nobody wants to return to the days of 20% a year increases.Much the same point was made by Business Secretary Vince Cable when he raised concerns about a property bubble potentially being inflated by government schemes to kick-start the market."In London and the south east, in the north-east of Scotland, in other areas, there are serious housing inflationary pressures," he said.Despite his warning, the second phase of the Help to Buy scheme has been brought forward by three months in England, and the Scottish government has announced the start of its own scheme.The UK and Scottish governments both argue that Help to Buy, which includes allowing buyers to apply for a shared equity loan for part of the property, are vital to give people the chance to secure a mortgage from risk-averse lenders.Buyers only qualify under the Scottish scheme if they are buying a newly built property.Critics might argue that they should encourage the developers to follow the example of the fishermen's cottages at Footdee - where the front doors face inwards to protect occupants from incoming storms.</body>

      <title>Turning around the world's oldest travel firm</title>
      <description>The boss trying to return travel firm Thomas Cook to its former glory</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24328944</url>
      <date>1381100422</date>
      <body>It is safe to say that Harriet Green, the boss of Thomas Cook, is not lacking in confidence - or the desire to take on a big challenge.Ms Green was appointed chief executive of the UK-based travel company in July 2012, after she cold-called the chairman and told him she was the right person to lead the troubled group's recovery.At that time Thomas Cook, the world's oldest travel business, was struggling with losses caused by a general fall in tourism numbers as a result of the global recession, and unrest in the Middle East hitting its package holidays to Egypt and Tunisia. The company was also saddled with debts of more than £1bn.Ms Green, 51, was convincing enough to be given the job, despite having no previous experience of working in a travel company.She says her strength of purpose can be traced back to coping with the death of her father when she was 14."You know I lost a parent in my early teens, and for a child that is the worst that can happen," she says. "And if you can cope with that, pretty much everything else - except a very similar situation of loss - is unlikely to derail you."Staff engagementMs Green, who was previously boss of electronic components distributor Premier Farnell for six years, says her first job at Thomas Cook was to boost staff confidence, and get them on side."You need to be really working on the psychology of the business, building belief, beginning to rebuild a culture, giving people a self, a sense of renewed self-esteem," she says.Ms Green emailed all 35,000 employees, asking them to share with her "everything you think and feel about what we need to do in this company".More than 8,000 workers replied, sharing "chapter and verse" with her.And while Ms Green continued to formulate her detailed plan for the turnaround, she says she was aware that she had to calm her own go-getting, no-nonsense attitude."Thomas Cook was quite unwell and so... I moderated my style and approach," she says."I was much less edgy, much less aggressive. I was still very focused on time and the issues, but [at the same time] creating this environment where people could believe."However, Ms Green did show early steel when she replaced most of the previous Thomas Cook board.Ms Green said the core turnaround focus was then very simple - "managing our cash better and reducing cost".In March of this year, she unveiled her strategy. The company intends to save £350m by 2015, largely through cutting the number of its physical stores, and focusing instead on internet sales. At the same time, non-core parts of the business will be sold.More than 2,500 jobs are going, and 199 shops out of 1,069 in the UK are shutting.Transport union TSSA, which represents many Thomas Cook staff, was angry at the job losses, but says they were the result of "the over expansion and bad decisions" of Thomas Cook's previous regime.In May the company completed a £1.6bn capital refinancing, which helped to halve its net debt. Then in August it announced that its nine-month losses had fallen to £470m from £667m a year earlier.The markets have so far welcomed Ms Green's efforts, and Thomas Cook's share price has soared. In May of last year, before she joined, the shares were trading at 21 pence each. They finished last month at 153.13p.TSSA is also hopeful that the company is now moving in the right direction.Manuel Cortes, its general secretary, says: "We believe that Thomas Cook staff are its biggest asset and that the company is now back on track. We are confident that it can once again be a successful company and a great British brand."Ms Green herself says she should be judged after five years in the job.As Ms Green continues her work at Thomas Cook, she says successful chief executives have a wide range of skills, which she terms "a rich DNA toolkit".While she highlights traits such as resilience, agility, and ability to lead speedy change, she says the most important factor is the need to be good with people, something she sees in herself.Ms Green says: "It is my experience that [chief executives] that really enjoy people - either love to develop them, or coach them or support them, or engage with their work - are much more successful than those who really are great on strategy, love the numbers, but don't really love the people aspect."I think there is an authenticity that comes through, and if you don't love the people that you work with, that begins to show. So I think it's hard to be a successful [chief executive] if you don't really like working, developing [and] supporting other people."Ms Green adds that the DNA needed to make a good chief executive is "not gender specific". However, she does agree that more needs to be done to see more female bosses of large companies."There are gender issues associated with why there are so few of us female [chief executives], but I think that's a different issue about role-modelling, education, the media that we can all help with," she says.Regarding the future of Thomas Cook, which traces its history back to 1841, Ms Green has eyes on East Asia."Thomas Cook is not yet in the East, which I think is an amazing opportunity," she says. "Helping Chinese and Korean customers to explore Europe would be amazing."Yet despite the big plans for Thomas Cook's future, Ms Green says she won't stay forever."I generally think [chief executives] spend far too long in the same business," she says. "I think you should... make the business great, stay around a little while to enjoy that, and then probably move on to the next thing."</body>

      <title>Row over Spain's proposed solar tax</title>
      <description>Row in Spain over proposed toll on solar panel owners</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24272061</url>
      <date>1381100409</date>
      <body>"We will be the only country in the world charging for the use of the sun," says Jaume Serrasolses."Strange things are happening in Spain. This is one of them."Mr Serrasolses, the secretary of an association promoting the use of solar energy, SEBA, is referring to the government's proposal for a tax solely on those who generate their own electricity.They would pay a backup toll for the power from their solar panels, in addition to the access toll paid by everyone who consumes electricity from the conventional grid.Although the tolls vary, if you pay an access toll of 0.053 euros per kWh, you could face a backup toll of 0.068 euros per kWh.The new tax would extend the average time it would take for solar panels to pay for themselves from eight to 25 years, according to the solar lobby.The government says that with increasing "self-consumption", the income for conventional energy systems will decrease, but grid maintenance will cost the same."If I produce my own energy, but am connected to the grid, having the backup in case my production fails, I have to contribute to the cost of the entire system," says Energy Secretary Alberto Nadal.The government is hoping the energy reform will settle a debt of 26bn euros (£22bn; $35bn), which has built up over years as a result of regulating energy costs and prices.This is just the latest in a series of setbacks for the renewable energy sector.The government has gradually lowered a feed-in tariff - a scheme that paid people to produce their own "green electricity" - first reducing the period over which it was paid, then limiting it to already existing installations and finally an energy reform in July opened up the possibility of withdrawing it retroactively.At the same time it has not endorsed net metering, a policy allowing solar panel owners to send surplus energy to the grid and use it later. The idea was part of a previous proposal but was not included in the latest reform proposal.But while the government may have been heavily promoting solar energy six years ago, those who followed that lead may now pay dearly for their investment."The majority are people like your or my parents who at one time had savings and wanted to make an investment with a better return," says Piet Holtrop, a Dutch lawyer who is defending over 1,000 of them."Many of these people are going to lose their houses (that they used as collateral to buy solar panels). They are unable to pay back at the bank. They can't sell the installations, because the government has made them toxic assets," Mr Holtrop says.Though many people believe the government has succumbed to pressure from the big five energy companies, Mr Nadal insists that "solar energy is much more expensive than that mass-produced by large utilities".He adds that Spain is now paying for being at the forefront of solar energy development: "If we hadn't rushed into constructing large quantities of photovoltaic installations, we could have had them much better for [a] much lower price. It would have been much better introducing them step by step."The backup toll, still to be approved, has already paralysed the photovoltaic sector. "Nobody is going to make significant investment if it takes over 20 years to pay it off," says Jaume Serrasolses.However, the proposal has also prompted defiance.Ricard Jornet has fitted his beachside restaurant with 36 solar panels. Alongside other efficiency measures, they have cut his electricity bill by 40%.To avoid the backup toll, he plans to split the restaurant so that it uses two independent electricity systems, with only 30% connected to the grid. The rest will be self-sufficient, thanks to insulation and batteries storing the produced energy."I will save more money, because for the little part of the restaurant I will pay smaller access toll. I will also prove to the government this is not the way to do things."Civil disobedience is another option, despite hefty fines of up to 30m euros.Oriol, a chicken farmer, is willing to take the risk of undeclared self-consumption. "I believe they will warn me first. Then... we will have to invent another way to save the situation."The fines were originally designed for electricity companies and have to be approved by a cabinet council."The more people disobey, the more difficult it will be to fine them," says Jaume Serrasolses.Spain's energy regulator has sided with the opponents of the toll. It has found the proposal discriminatory, concluding that it makes self-consumption economically unviable and sacrifices middle and long-term economic efficiency for short-term economic sustainability. However, the regulator's word is non-binding.There are hopes that the European Commission will help, as its objective is to achieve 20% of energy production from renewable sources by 2020. The body is currently probing one of several complaints against Spain's energy policies.However, the Commission might have a dilemma."They are anxious to not jeopardise the plans for Spain's economic recovery," says Piet Holtrop."We are afraid the Commission is willing to sacrifice the EU legal framework for policy objectives."Other countries are carefully watching developments in Spain. The governments in Latvia, the Czech Republic, Italy and Greece seem to be pondering similar cutbacks."We want to make the Commission aware of the spillover effect," says Mr Holtrop.The backup toll may not end up being introduced, but the proposal has put many people off installing solar panels in the meantime, which means they are still getting their energy from the five big suppliers."I think they (the government) know this proposal does not make sense. They just want to gain time," says Ricard Jornet."[And] during all these months the energy oligopoly is making thousands of millions of euros."</body>

      <title>How to get broadband to rural UK</title>
      <description>How to get broadband to rural Britain</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24366190</url>
      <date>1381100451</date>
      <body>Over the summer there was a lot of digging going on in the Lancashire countryside.Nothing unusual there you may think until you realise that these trenches are being built to house a fibre optic network with speeds to rival those that Google is installing in Kansas City.The community-led Broadband 4 Rural North (B4RN) scheme offers speeds of up to 1Gbps (gigabit per second) to communities along its route.And as it expands its network, more villages are asking if they can be connected too, proving that if you build it, they will come.The project has hit problems - some minor, like a delay over the summer caused by some nesting lapwings, but some bigger, for example when Network Rail refused permission for the ducts to run over a bridge, forcing it to reroute in a river.However its biggest problem is money. Despite raising £300,000 worth of local investment, the team behind the project estimate that the total cost will be £1.86m.It applied for a government grant but is still waiting to hear whether it will qualify while it is also finding it tricky to get a loan.It illustrates the difficulty of getting even a small-scale broadband network up and running and also begs the questions - why would farmers digging the trenches even want to take on such a project?The reality is that they and other local residents are fed up with slow or non-existent broadband.Commercial broadband providers like BT see no profit in rolling out complicated networks to a handful of houses in the middle of nowhere.And that is rather galling for the people living in such communities who need broadband just as much, in some cases more, than their urban counterparts.Broadband is now widely acknowledged as the fourth utility, and the government is all too aware that it needs to close the digital divide between town and country.But its solution - to offer £530m to councils to subsidise rural broadband roll-outs - has been widely criticised, most recently in a report from a group of MPs who make up the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).The process has been painfully slow. Initially the Department of Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) planned to complete the roll-outs by 2015.Now that has been put back to 2017, with the caveat that up to 10% of the country will still not be covered.When it became clear that former telecoms monopoly BT had won every single council contract, there were some angry reactions.The PAC report accused the DCMS of ripping off taxpayers by simply handing public money to BT.This week as BT puts the final dots on those contracts, the big question is where does it leave the community schemes like B4RN?While the current subsidy is now gone, the PAC report recommended the government make every effort to ensure that the next round of public funding - the £250m earmarked for the final 10% not covered in current plans - is spent more wisely."It can't simply be put into a pot marked BT. There has to be more competition. This is a good opportunity to make government funding go a lot further," said Malcolm Corbett, who heads up the independent networks co-operative association (Inca).He estimates that the local community broadband schemes supported by his organisation can offer a much faster service to remote communities and require far less state aid than that demanded by BT, largely because they rely on co-investments with the local people.It is a view that the government does not seem to share. A separate £20m provided by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to specifically fund innovative rural broadband schemes, including Lancashire's B4RN project, looks like it could be going the same way as the money provided by the DCMS."Our information indicates that almost all of the money will go to BT," said Mr Corbett."I'm on the point of giving up. Whatever we do and despite an extraordinarily critical government report, we still can't get these schemes out there. BT is just so powerful," he said.BT's managing director of Next Generation Access, Bill Murphy, is not surprised that community schemes are struggling to gain headway."Our payback on rural broadband is 15 years. This is not for the faint-hearted. If people want to go build, then go build but, as I tell them, broadband networks aren't just for Christmas,"And he is dubious that community schemes can roll out networks cheaper than BT."I spend a lot of time sitting in village halls hearing about how they want to build their own thing but none of them have ever built anything before. I admire their passion and commitment but I'm not going to be preached at by people who don't have the experience. Don't tell me that you can build a network cheaper than me," he said.One of the biggest criticisms in the PAC report was that BT and local authorities are failing to provide detailed information about how far their roll-outs would extend.Without such information it will be hard for rivals to offer projects to compete with BT.Gigaclear is one such rival. It is offering a 1Gbps fibre to the home service to homes in Oxfordshire and Rutland and hopes to extend its footprint to Hampshire and Kent.But lack of certainty about where BT may build networks is hampering its efforts."Under the current contracts drawn up with BT, councils can't say what areas will be upgraded until three months beforehand," said their marketing director Joe Frost."It means that whole areas will not be told anything for two years. That is a problem for them and for us," he said.The issue has led the Countryside Alliance to demand change."BT and the local authorities aren't being transparent about where the roll-out will cover. We need to see a map with postcode trackers showing what communities will be left out," said their head of policy Sarah Lee.For its part, BT said that it is up to local authorities to provide this information and that increasingly they are doing so.Anyone wanting to know whether their community will be covered by the current roll-out has simply to phone their council, added Mr Murphy.One of the most interesting things about the alternative community schemes is that they tend to favour faster fibre to the home technology (FTTH) over BT's preferred fibre to the street cabinet (FTTC), even though it is far more expensive to lay.Retired engineer Walter Wilcox has campaigned for years to get better broadband in the village of Ewhurst in Surrey and when it finally did come, he was unhappy with it."There are 76 houses that can't get the service, two properties where the fibre service is worse than the one they had before and we estimate 226 properties out of about 942 are unable to achieve the lower limit of 24 Mbps," he said.The upgrade was done by BT using FTTC.BT admits that the upgrade in Ewhurst took "longer than it should" and that 'there is still work to do"."There are about 5% of people in the village who can't get the service but we are working on solutions to fix this." said Mr Murphy.But what has happened in Ewhurst could be replicated around the country because, with a few exceptions, it is the technology that will form the backbone of BT's rollout.Many worry that FTTC is already an outdated technology, ill-suited to rural communities because the speed you get is in relation to how close you live to a street cabinet.In contrast the FTTH technology favoured by B4RN and other community schemes offers the same speed to everyone - and with a top speed of 1Gbps it is not going to be past its sell by date any time soon.As Chris Conder who sits on B4RN's management team puts it: "Fibre to the cabinet is like giving people a cold water tap whereas with fibre to the home they can have a hot power shower."B4RN already has plenty of satisfied customers on its network but whether it and others like it are really equipped for a nationwide fibre battle with BT remains distinctly uncertain.But there are plenty of people living in some of Britain's remotest places rooting for them.</body>

      <title>Recovering from the Westgate attack</title>
      <description>Nairobi's firms 'resilient' in wake of Westgate attack</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24403698</url>
      <date>1381022446</date>
      <body>The Westgate shopping centre today stands defiantly in the middle of the rich leafy suburb of Westlands.The world's focus was fixed on it for days after gunmen struck at midday on a Saturday, shooting at people - young and old - killing more than 60.Driving down Peponi Road just beside the centre, all seems well from the outside except for some broken glass windows and bullet holes on the wall.But inside, the scenes of chaos, death and looting are all too evident.Shop owners are among the very few people who have been allowed into the shopping centre since the attack.Martin Omondi owns a camera shop on the ground floor."Almost 100% of our cameras - all gone - worth more than a million shillings (US$11,000; £6,863)," he says after collecting what remained in his shop.He cannot say who stole his merchandise, and is waiting for a government investigation.But Serah Wambui, the owner of a salon located on the first floor, blames it all on the security forces."Our small cabinet that we used to display ornaments was looted," she says."They also opened our lockers to see whether we had money. They stole our cash box but our products are still there."Kenya's defence ministry has asked people with evidence of looting to give them that information.Business owners like Omondi and Serah are now pondering their next move.'Mall culture'Other shopping centres in Nairobi have also felt the impact of the attack on Westgate.Hamed Ehsani manages the upmarket Village Market, which is next to the US embassy and the UN headquarters."The first couple of days we were down to 20% of the number of customers," he says."But in the last few days we're up to 60%, and we expect that to increase."Ally Khan Satchu, a business analyst and Nairobi resident, says that people have been going to smaller shops, and shopping centres have been quieter."The whole mall culture is what has excited middle-class shoppers because it has consolidated middle-class demand and allowed retailers to come in, in a big way and service this demand," he says."The question is, is this going to change shopping habits of middle class Kenyans? I don't think it's going to be that long-lasting."Other indicators also point to a resilience within Kenya's economy.The stock market dropped on the two days after the attack, but it has subsequently rallied more than 2% and is not far off its 2013 high."What supported the stock market was international investors," says Mr Satchu."These guys thought this was an opportunity to get supply, so they used that as a liquidity opportunity to buy up a lot of stock."But he says that Kenya's tourism sector, which accounts for 10% of the country's annual economy, is a soft target.Yet so far, says Mike Macharia, the chairman of the Association of Hotel Keepers and Caterers - there have not been significant cancellations in hotel bookings."We were pleasantly surprised to find the level of cancellations was very low - we had two conferences the Monday after the attack and of those two we had only 4% cancellations," he says.At the Karen Blixen museum in Nairobi, tourists who spoke to the BBC were continuing with their holiday plans.Frenchman Andre Mairie says he will not be changing his travel arrangements following the attack."We are used to this kind of things. We had the one at Saint Michel station, we had the one at rue de Rennes, and so what?" he states, referring to previous explosions in his home country, France."People were telling me: 'Why are you going to Kenya? It must be dangerous.'"I said: 'Look, I'm still taking my subway at Saint Michel, I'm still walking at rue de Rennes.'"Kay Headfield and her husband were already en route to Nairobi from New Zealand when the attack at Westgate took place."It's been arranged through Child Fund and the staff there have been very good in advising us and keeping us informed so we carried on," says Mrs Headfield.Mike Macharia attributes the positive reaction from tourists to the messages of support from countries like the United Kingdom - which accounts for some 16% of all visitors to Kenya."The messages that came out of the key source markets were very positive, particularly from the UK."The International Monetary Fund said in the aftermath of the attack that Kenya could withstand a "one-off" attack by Islamist militants.With the second half of the year normally the peak season for tourism, analysts are predicting that the economy is on track for growth of between 4.5% to as much as 6% this year.But analysts warn that if there were to be another Westgate-style attack, then those growth prospects could change.Africa Business Report is broadcast on BBC World News on Fridays at 18:40, Saturdays at 10:10 and 20:10, and Sundays at 00:10 (all times GMT).</body>

      <body>On Thursday, Twitter announced that it wanted to raise $1bn (£619m) by listing on the US stock markets, making it the biggest initial public offering (IPO) from a technology company since Facebook went public in May 2012.The giant micro-blogging site, founded just seven years ago, has been valued at about $10bn.So, how does Twitter make its money and how can we explain its high valuation?Twitter may have more than 218 million monthly users, but the company does not make money - yet.In papers filed with US regulators, it was revealed for the first time that Twitter made a loss of $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m.But analysts say the company is showing strong signs of growth, with revenue rising from just $28m in 2010 to $317m by the end of 2012.One research firm, eMarketer, estimates that Twitter's revenues from advertising sales will increase by more than 100% by the end of this year.Almost all of Twitter's revenue - about 85% of it - comes from advertising on its site.There are three main ways for a company or an individual to advertise on Twitter: by promoting a tweet that will appear in people's timelines, promoting a whole account, or promoting a trend.Twitter tends to charge its advertisers according to the amount of interaction their content generates.A budget is usually set at the start of the campaign and then the advertiser pays per click or per retweet.It also has a "bidding" system in which advertisers compete with each other to have their content appear in a particular space."One of the advantages of Twitter for marketers over traditional display advertising is they have worked really hard to make sure that advertising on Twitter is not interruptive," says Lara O'Reilly, senior reporter at Marketing Week.Anything that disrupts the user experience might reduce engagement from users, which in turn can put off advertisers, Ms O'Reilly says."It's not a flashy banner that gets in the way of something. It looks very native," she explains.Also, the company takes in a significant portion of its advertising revenue from mobile devices - in contrast with Facebook, which had not fully developed its mobile strategy at the time of its listing.As of 2013, more than 65% of Twitter's advertising revenue was generated from mobile devices.More than 75% of Twitter users accessed the site from their mobile phone during that same time period."Because Twitter was born as a mobile platform they already have this part sorted," Ms O'Reilly adds. "In investors' eyes, they have a mobile strategy."Data licensing is Twitter's second major revenue stream.The micro-blogger sells something known as the "firehose", its public data, which often adds up to about 500 million tweets each day.Companies can dive deep into the data to analyse consumer trends and sell their insight on to other brands and companies.Because the tweets are public, consumers also have access to this data.But Nick Halstead, founder of DataSift, one of the only two companies with access to the firehose, says that with sophisticated analysis companies can learn detailed and specific information about their users that, because of the volume of data, an ordinary user or company would not be able to get.Firms could use the data to do simple things, he says, like monitoring sentiment towards their brand or product.But the data can also be used in a much more complex way."One of my favourites is around stock levels," Mr Halstead says."For example, in the US football teams will analyse the popularity of players by region to work out how much they should buy of a particular football top to stock them in shops."He adds: "In the UK we all rush out and buy barbecue equipment on particular weekends, and supermarkets want to stock up when that happens, but they need three or four days to do that."You can use Twitter for modelling when people are planning to hold those kind of events."While Twitter may have proved it has the potential to make money, analysts say there are still hurdles to profitability.The company is spending a lot of money investing in advertising technology and expanding its team, says Clark Fredericksen, vice president at eMarketer.And it plans to keep spending after going public."We can expect that they will continue to make those investments because they're looking long-term," he says.But Mr Fredericksen adds Twitter needs to show it can monetise its international users and work with small businesses."When Twitter goes to advertisers a big part of their pitch is using Twitter to work with other media," he says, adding that the site gets huge traction with users around events like the Oscars or episodes of popular television shows such as Breaking Bad."Whether that formula will translate in smaller TV markets needs to be seen."</body>

      <body>If you are already missing the sunshine then here is something to consider.The pound is having a revival on the currency markets, thanks to the strengthening British economy.It is a welcome change for British tourists who saw the pound slump after the 2008 financial crisis.But the economy has perked up and sterling has seen a spectacular rise against some currencies this year.And there are other trends in the currency market which are making a difference.Now obviously changes in the value of the pound are not the top priority when it comes to choosing a holiday destination, not least because some cheap countries are not particularly safe.And it is impossible to predict exactly what's going to happen on the markets.(You can check travel advice from the Foreign Office here.)But after years of suffering the effects of a weak pound, travellers may be tempted by countries that are once again looking like good value.Currency experts in the City of London have given their views on where that value can be found over the next 12 months.South Africa is one of a group of nations which, in economic circles, are called the Brics.Along with Brazil, Russia, India and China, it was favoured by investors for its fast-growing economy.But it has run into trouble recently.Prices for its main exports such as gold, platinum and diamonds have fallen and the mining industry has also been hit by labour trouble.As a result the South African rand has plunged 25% this year."There are question marks over the economy," says Jeremy Stretch, market strategist at CIBC."Even if sterling does badly I expect the rand to underperform."Another nation that has fallen out of favour with international investors is India.Economic growth has been weak and the government has struggled to push through reform that economists say would lift growth.This year the rupee has fallen 12% against the pound.Analysts say the situation is unlikely to change in the near future."India will always be vulnerable," says Jane Foley, senior forex strategist at Rabobank in London."India has disappointing growth and a lack of reform and other emerging markets will be seen as better bets."The Australian economy has become tied to the fortunes of China.Much of its iron ore and other commodities are exported there.But prices and volumes have fallen and so has the Australian dollar.It is down more than 10% against the pound this year, currently trading at around 1.73 Australian dollars to the pound."The Oz dollar has been overvalued since mid-2010," says Jeremy Stretch."It (the pound) will probably get to 1.85, maybe 1.90, but not as high as 2. That overvaluation is dissipating."Turkey's economy has been a success story in recent years.But protests against the government in June have unsettled investors. Confidence in Turkey is also vulnerable to unrest in Syria and to a lesser extent Egypt.The Turkish lira is down 12% against the pound so far this year. But since the worst of the financial crisis in 2008, the lira has fallen 50% against the pound."It's been a very, very big move," says Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon in London."But it's very hard to know with emerging markets because they are illiquid. If political tensions ease there would be a rapid move back."If I was going to to Turkey I would buy my lira now."Anyone considering a visit to Turkey should check on the latest advice from the Foreign Office.</body>

      <title>Hydrogen: The car fuel of the future?</title>
      <description>Could hydrogen power the cars of tomorrow?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24381812</url>
      <date>1380843391</date>
      <body>A small British firm is looking forward to a day in which we will take our cars to the garage and fill them with hydrogen.Acal Energy, based in Runcorn in Cheshire, says it has developed a chemistry that could make hydrogen fuel cells much cheaper and longer-lasting than current technologies.It wants to license its chemistry to the world's car-makers, opening the way for hydrogen vehicles to sell in large volumes in 10 or 20 years' time."We believe this is one of the breakthrough technologies," says Brendan Bilton, the company's chief commercial officer."We're pretty confident and excited... that this will start unlocking the barriers," he continues, "Allowing fuel cells to be in products for mass market applications."It is a bold dream but not a crazy one.The automotive industry is already far advanced with plans for a first generation of hydrogen cars.Hyundai, the South Korean manufacturer, has said it will soon start selling a hydrogen-powered version of its ix35 model.Meanwhile, the Japanese giant Toyota is expected to unveil its first nearly-production-ready foray into the territory at next month's Tokyo motor show.Other big names - including Daimler and Volkswagen - are thought to be on track to get hydrogen vehicles into showrooms by 2017.But few expect these first-generation hydrogen cars to sell in very large numbers.Acal Energy is pitching its technology as the enabler for a second generation of less costly, more durable vehicles which could - if all goes to plan - pose a serious challenge to the long domination of the internal combustion engine from about 2020 onwards.To begin with, consumers may take a bit of persuading.Hydrogen is widely seen as a dangerous fuel - an image underpinned by that grainy newsreel footage of the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg airship bursting into flames in the 1930s.But actually, experts do not seem daunted by this particular technical challenge.They point out that hydrogen is already used and managed on a routine basis in industrial processes.The main reason anyone bothers with it as a fuel for the future is because it is emission-free at the point of use.The hydrogen is combined with oxygen in a bit of kit called a fuel cell. This process generates electricity to power the engine in the vehicle.The waste products are heat and harmless water.Water is benign, unlike the global warming-inducing, carbon dioxide emissions that spew from even the most efficient petrol and diesel vehicles.The car industry has been developing fuel cells that use costly platinum as the catalyst for generating power from hydrogen for many years.Acal Energy claims the problem with this current technology is that it results in fuel cells that are either prohibitively expensive because of the high platinum content, or prone to degrade quickly.To get round these issues, the company has developed what Mr Bilton describes as a "liquid catalyst" composed of "a dissolved solution of metal salts".As well as being a lot cheaper than a platinum catalyst, the liquid doubles up as a coolant and a cleaning agent that extends the life of the fuel cell by taking away damaging by-products as it circulates through a "regenerator"."We have a solution that both increases durability and reduces cost," says Mr Bilton.The company has its offices in a science park that until a few years ago was the research and development centre for the British chemicals giant ICI, now shrunken in size and foreign-owned.Intriguingly, the ideas behind Acal Energy's patented "FlowCath" technology derive from techniques developed to clean clothes more efficiently.The founder of the company, Dr Andrew Creeth, now its chief technology officer, spent much of his career working as a scientist for the washing powder giant Unilever.Development of the product is taking place in an environment not unlike a gigantic school chemistry lab - full of bubbling chemicals, complicated equipment and clever looking people in white coats.The company has already raised £15m ($24m) to finance its work from a mixture of private investors and government sources.It is currently hoping to raise another £15m or so from a new funding round, with the outcome due to be announced soon.Eventually, Acal Energy aims to earn profits from the business model pioneered by the successful British micro-chip designer Arm Holdings.Arm's technology is embedded in most of the chips used in the world's smartphones and tablet computers.It receives a small royalty payment every time anyone upgrades their mobile device.Acal Energy dreams of equal success from licensing its technology to car manufacturers in decades to come.The big questions, though, are does the technology work and will it be the breakthrough that the company claims?Prof Nigel Brandon of Imperial College in London, a leading academic in hydrogen energy, is well qualified to comment."The core technology looks very exciting," he says."There are some components in their system they need to improve. I don't see any reason why they can't do that but they've still got to do it," Prof Brandon adds.It is guarded optimism that could equally be applied to the whole field of hydrogen fuel cell energy.The big advantages over battery-powered electric vehicles are hydrogen cars can be refuelled in a just a few minutes, they can run for 300 or 400 miles between refuelling and they have the environmental benefits of battery driven cars with the same range and convenience as those with petrol or diesel engines.But there are also significant snags.Among them is the need to create a hugely expensive new infrastructure of hydrogen filling stations to replace garages.Hydrogen enthusiasts often quote the example of the internet.Once the demand was proven, a global network of optical fibre cables to carry data traffic was rapidly built despite the cost.Major players in the car industry are betting - but not yet on a truly large scale - that hydrogen energy will follow the same pattern.</body>

      <title>Economic impact of a US shutdown</title>
      <description>What will be the economic cost of a shutdown?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24341406</url>
      <date>1380646665</date>
      <body>The US government has shut down, laying off hundreds of thousands of workers, closing national parks, and delaying vital services like passport renewal.On Monday, US President Barack Obama said the "shutdown will have a very real economic impact on real people, right away".But what exactly will that economic impact be?Research firm IHS estimates that it's costing the US government about $300m a day, for each day of the shut down.Overall, the last time the US government shut down in 1995 for 21 days, it cost the federal government $1.5bn (£927m) - that's $2.1bn (£1.3bn) in today's dollars.Goldman Sachs estimates a three-week shutdown could shave as much as 0.9% from US GDP this quarter.However, markets have largely shrugged off the shut down, with all three indexes rising after markets re-opened on Tuesday.Overall, US stocks are up 18% for the year.For now, it seems, the business community is focused on other concerns, like when the Federal Reserve will begin to ease off its extraordinary efforts to prop up the US economy - something the central bank says will not happen any time soon, partially due to Washington dysfunction.Not an economic barometer"They're going to eventually get to a compromise and then we'll move on," O'Neil Securities trader Kenny Polcari told the BBC from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.A veteran trader, Mr Polcari was also at the NYSE during the last government shutdown, from 1995-1996.Back then, he remembers, markets sold off but then actually rebounded."A government shutdown is not necessarily a comment on the state of the US economy," says Mr Polcari."All indications are that they US economy is starting to turn a corner."In fact, for traders like him, he says now might actually be a good time to get into the market, before third quarter earnings next week."This is in hindsight will probably be viewed as a good buying opportunity, as long as you don't get real panicked," says Mr Polcari."I don't expect to get panicked."And, for many businesses, another debt squabble in Washington is just background noise during a time of good, if not great, economic growth."The difference between now and a couple years ago was that a couple years ago we were coming out the depths of a recession," says David Zarin, who owns a fabric store on Manhattan's Lower East Side.During the debt ceiling negotiations of 2011, he says he saw his business decline in the wake of so much uncertainty at a fragile time of the US economic recovery.Now, while business isn't as a robust as it was prior to the crisis, he's no longer as sensitive to what he calls "Washington posturing.""Frankly, I'm a little numb," he says.Brian Hamilton, boss of Sageworks, a market research company, says Mr Zarin's views are common throughout the private business community."There's sort of an assumption that what happens in Washington looms large on the minds of people who run private companies," says Mr Hamilton."Not to be flip about it, but I don't believe that the people who run private companies wake up every morning and worry very much about what's happening in Washington unless it affects their bottom lines."But for one place, the economic impact of the shutdown will be felt immediately.According to George Mason University professor George Fuller, the Washington DC area will lose an estimated $220m a day while federal workers and contractors are furloughed, perhaps not spending money at local restaurants and businesses.The federal government accounts for one-third of the region's economy."If it's a one day event, it's like a snow day, if its three days it's a blizzard - but if it's more than that, it's a big deal," says Prof Fuller.Furthermore, uncertainty is never good for hiring.One-half of bosses surveyed by the Business Roundtable "indicated that the ongoing disagreement in Washington over the 2014 budget and debt ceiling is having a negative impact on their plans for hiring additional employees over the next six months".And global markets, always keen to see how the world's largest economy is faring, will certainly have cause to pause.If the shutdown continues until Friday, the release of crucial US jobs figures could be delayed."All survey and other programme operations will cease and the public website will not be updated," said Erica Groshen, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said in a memo published on the department's website.However, some reports suggest that the jobs figures would be deemed "essential" and would end up being released on time.A prolonged closure could also have an impact on the biggest stock market news of the year: Twitter, the social networking company, has indicated that it would like to make its stock market debut soon, filing the proper paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission.The SEC says it has funds to stay open for a few weeks, but a prolonged shutdown could force the agency to delay reviewing public offering applications.But for now, at least, traders and economists have painted the shutdown as a wait-and-see moment - but something with a bit of popcorn value, like must-see TV."Investors have been riveted on still another gripping episode of fiscal policy dysfunction in a divided US government," wrote UBS's chief US economist Maury Harris in a note to clients.Mr Harris notes that indications that Washington dysfunction could spill over into wider economic impacts have been muted, with consumer confidence surveys still pointing towards a positive US public.And the main worry continues to be what happens, if, in a few weeks time, politicians cannot agree on raising the limit the US can borrow so that the country can pay its creditors."Any delay in raising the debt ceiling would have dire economic consequences," said Moody's chief US economist Mark Zandi in recent testimony in front of Congress."There will be a violent reaction in financial markets if policymakers fail to act in time," he warned.</body>

      <title>Silk Road accused appears in court</title>

      <body>The alleged mastermind behind the online illegal drugs marketplace Silk Road is too dangerous to be bailed, US prosecutors have said.Ross Ulbricht, 29, was arrested this week and is charged with being the administrator of the site which has now been shut down.He is also accused of trying to arrange the killing of one of the site's users."We deny all charges and that is the end of the discussion at this point," Mr Ulbricht's lawyer said.Mr Ulbricht appeared in a San Francisco court on Friday wearing a green T-shirt under red jail clothes and had his ankles shackled.A request from his legal team for his bail hearing to be pushed back was granted - it will now take place on 9 October.Federal magistrate Joseph Spero asked Mr Ulbricht's lawyer Brandon LeBlanc whether seeing the criminal indictment that included a murder-for-hire charge had "changed his calculus" on whether he thought Mr Ulbricht would be granted bail.As part of its criminal complaint, the FBI alleged that Mr Ulbricht had sought to pay a Silk Road user to kill another user who had threatened to expose details of the site's users.Prosecutors opposed the delay, arguing that Mr Ulbricht represented a danger to the community, and that there was a high likelihood that he may attempt to flee.The Silk Road was a well-known destination on Tor, a so-called "dark web" service that anonymises users, making it much more difficult for authorities to track locations.The site sold a range of items, but was most famous for offering a host of illegal drugs, paid for using virtual currency Bitcoin.</body>

      <title>'Terminator' cube robots unveiled</title>
      <description>As MIT scientists unveil cube-shaped self-assembling robots, does a future of Terminator-style "liquid steel" androids come a step closer?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24397880</url>
      <date>1380895882</date>
      <body>Cube-shaped robots that can flip, jump and assemble themselves into different shapes have been unveiled by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).The small robots, known as M-Blocks, have no external parts but can move using an internal flywheel mechanism.They stick together using magnets.The scientists envisage miniaturised "swarmbot" versions self-assembling like the "liquid steel" androids in the Terminator films.More realistically, the researchers at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), believe armies of such cubes could be used for making temporary repairs to bridges or buildings, or as self-assembly, re-configurable scaffolding.Modular robots have the advantage of being able to adapt to whatever task or terrain is presented to them.John Romanishin, one of the research scientists at CSAIL leading the project, said: "We want hundreds of cubes, scattered randomly across the floor, to be able to identify each other, coalesce, and autonomously transform into a chair, or a ladder, or a desk, on demand."The M-Blocks are currently controlled by computer instructions sent over wireless radio, but in future the researchers hope algorithms can be loaded on the blocks directly, making them entirely autonomous and capable of adapting to different environments.Blocks equipped with sensors and cameras would be able to work out how to accomplish specific tasks in combat or emergency situations, the scientists hope.</body>

      <body>The only British team to qualify for a solar car race in Australia has been forced to pull out after its vehicle crashed just days before the start.The Cambridge University Eco Racing car, Resolution, was expected to take part in the Bridgestone World Solar Challenge, but crashed on Tuesday.The team hoped to fix it before the start, but withdrew on Saturday.In a statement, the team said: "We have not been able to reassure ourselves of the safety of our solar drivers."Resolution was one of 28 vehicles entered in the Challenger category of the 1,860-mile (3,000km), seven-day race from Darwin to Adelaide which started earlier.Built by a 60-strong team of students at the university's engineering department, the car weighs 265lb (120kg) and is designed to run at an average speed of 50mph (80km/h).During testing prior to the race, the team wrote on their blog: "The first three hours of testing went exactly as planned."Unfortunately, we also did one unplanned test, of the structural integrity of the chassis. We had an accident."The vehicle rolled on its side, skidded along the road and slipped down an embankment.The driver walked away unhurt as the roll cage and chassis stood up to the impact.However, the team said: "[The] solar cells on the side of the door... do not take kindly to being sanded by 50m of rough tarmac."Large portions of the side panel cells are now scattered in a thin, very expensive layer over the surface of [the road]."The team added the car was "only designed to withstand one such impact - and as such needs to be repaired to be fit for purpose".Members were unable to make the repairs in time for the start of the race.A message on their website said: "The team is very disappointed but we are confident that we have made the right decision."</body>

      <body>Adobe has confirmed that 2.9 million customers have had private information stolen during a "sophisticated" cyber attack on its website.The attackers accessed encrypted customer passwords and payment card numbers, the company said.But it does not believe decrypted debit or credit card data was removed.Adobe also revealed that it was investigating the "illegal access" of source code for numerous products, including Adobe Acrobat and ColdFusion."We deeply regret that this incident occurred," said Brad Arkin, Adobe's chief security officer."Based on our findings to date, we are not aware of any specific increased risk to customers as a result of this incident," he said.But Chester Wisniewski, senior adviser at internet security company Sophos, told the BBC: "Access to the source code could be very serious."Billions of computers around the world use Adobe software, so if hackers manage to embed malicious code in official-looking software updates they could potentially take control of millions of machines."This is on the same level as a Microsoft security breach," he added.Adobe said it had been helped in its investigation by internet security journalist Brian Krebs and security expert Alex Holden.The two discovered a 40GB cache of Adobe source code while investigating attacks on three US data providers, Dun and Bradstreet, Kroll Background America, and LexisNexis.Mr Krebs said the Adobe code was on a server he believed the hackers used.Adobe said that it is resetting passwords for the customer accounts it believes were compromised, and that those customers will get an email alerting them to the change.It is also recommending that, as a precaution, customers affected change their passwords and user information for other websites for which they used the same ID.For those US customers whose debit or credit card information is suspected of being accessed, Adobe is offering a complimentary one-year subscription to a credit-monitoring programme.Finally, the company said it had notified law enforcement officials and is working to identify the hackers.</body>

      <body>More than two million people in China are employed by the government to monitor web activity, state media say, providing a rare glimpse into how the state tries to control the internet.The Beijing News says the monitors, described as internet opinion analysts, are on state and commercial payrolls.China's hundreds of millions of web users increasingly use microblogs to criticise the state or vent anger.Recent research suggested Chinese censors actively target social media.The report by the Beijing News said that these monitors were not required to delete postings.They are "strictly to gather and analyse public opinions on microblog sites and compile reports for decision-makers", it said. It also added details about how some of these monitors work.Tang Xiaotao has been working as a monitor for less than six months, the report says, without revealing where he works."He sits in front of a PC every day, and opening up an application, he types in key words which are specified by clients."He then monitors negative opinions related to the clients, and gathers (them) and compile reports and send them to the clients," it says.The reports says the software used in the office is even more advanced and supported by thousands of servers. It also monitors websites outside China.China rarely reveals any details concerning the scale and sophistication of its internet police force.It is believed that the two million internet monitors are part of a huge army which the government relies on to control the internet.The government is also to organise training classes for them for the first time from 14 to 18 October, the paper says.But it is not clear whether the training will be for existing monitors or for new recruits.The training will have eight modules, and teach participants how to analyse and judge online postings and deal with crisis situations, it says.The most popular microblogging site Sina Weibo, launched in 2010, now has more than 500 million registered users with 100 million messages posted daily.Topics cover a wide range - from personal hobbies, health to celebrity gossip and food safety but they talso include politically sensitive issues like official corruption.Postings deemed to be politically incorrect are routinely deleted.</body>

      <body>Thirteen alleged members of hacktivist group Anonymous have been indicted, accused of carrying out cyber-attacks.They have been charged in the US with conspiring to intentionally cause damage to protected computers.They were said to have targeted firms that refused to process payments for WikiLeaks, the whistle-blowing site founded by Julian Assange.The group flooded services with large amounts of traffic in an attempt to overwhelm the sites.This method - known as a Distributed Denial of Service attack, or DDoS - is a typical tactic of the hacktivist movement.The accused allegedly targeted groups or businesses they felt did not share the philosophy of Anonymous to make all information free for everyone, regardless of copyright laws or national security considerations.Those hit included governments, trade associations, law firms and financial institutions.Court documents said that from September 2010 to January 2011, Anonymous members waged a campaign they dubbed Operation Payback.In December 2010, the conspirators are alleged to have discussed possible targets related to WikiLeaks, the whistle-blowing site that struggled to receive funding after several payment processing companies, including Mastercard and Visa, refused to facilitate the transfer of donations to the group.The Swedish prosecutor's office was also hit, in connection with arrest warrants for sexual crimes issued for Mr Assange.The accused were also said to have gone after music industry bodies in retaliation for action taken against The Pirate Bay, a Sweden-based file sharing website devoted to the illegal downloading of copyrighted material.</body>

      <title>Twitter plans to raise $1bn in IPO</title>
      <description>In documents made public for the first time, social networking company Twitter has said it plans to raise $1bn as part of its stock market debut.</description>

      <body>Social networking company Twitter has said it plans to raise $1bn (£619m) in its stock market debut in documents filed with US regulators.In the filing, revealed on Thursday, the seven-year-old company said that it now has 218 million monthly users and that 500 million tweets are sent a day.It made a loss of $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m.It will be the largest Silicon Valley stock offering since Facebook's listing in 2012.Analysts said that the offering was likely to get a good response."Social media is red hot," said Internet analyst Lou Kerner. "Twitter is front and centre benefiting from market enthusiasm for all things social, and remarkably strong metrics."The filing also revealed Twitter's finances for the first time.While the company has never made a profit, its revenue has grown from just $28m in 2010 to $317m by the end of 2012.Around 85% of Twitter's revenue last year came from ad sales; the rest was from licensing its data.The company takes in a significant portion of its ad revenue from mobile devices, an important metric often tracked by analysts.As of 2013, over 65% of the company's advertising revenue was generated from mobile devices. More than 75% of Twitter users accessed the site from their mobile phone during that same time period.Some analysts said that the decision by the firm to raise capital indicated that it was keen on improving the way people enjoy content on its platform and how advertisers connect with its users."Users should be happy about this," said Zachary Reiss-Davis, an analyst with Forrester."It looks like Twitter is looking at how to enrich the experience and it understands that to build a successful service, they have to create something people like and want to come back to and spend time on."Peter Esho from Sydney-based Invast Financial Services, added that Twitter's ease to use had seen it increase its user base, making it an attractive option for advertisers."I think what Twitter has working in its favour is that it's very easy to use: it doesn't eat up too much bandwidth for the average user in places where broadband penetration is low," he said.The filing also revealed that two of the company's co-founders, Evan Williams and Jack Dorsey, own significant stakes in Twitter, and could stand to take in significant sums from the company's stock market listing.Mr Williams owns 12% of shares in the company, while Mr Dorsey owns 4.9%.Benchmark Capital's Peter Fenton, an early investor in the company, is the second-biggest shareholder, with 6.7% of shares.Twitter indicated three weeks earlier that it had filed for a public stock market offering.However, under a new law passed by Congress in 2012, it did not have to reveal its financial documents because it had revenue of less than $1bn.But by releasing the documents publicly, it gave an indication that it hopes to complete its stock sale soon.The company plans to list under the stock symbol TWTR, but it did not reveal which stock exchange, the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange, it had chosen.However, Mr Esho said that the listing was likely to be on the Nasdaq."I was to speculate, I think it would have to be Nasdaq," he said. "That really is the exchange that has seen so many tech names come to the market."Goldman Sachs is the lead bank taking the company public, a coveted position that is often fought for amongst the nation's biggest banks.The other banks helping with the offering are Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, BofA Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank Securities and CODE Advisors.</body>

      <title>Fury over Sindh messaging ban plan</title>

      <body>Internet freedom activists in Pakistan have expressed anger over proposals by the government of Sindh province to ban messaging apps including Skype, Viber and WhatsApp for three months.The provincial government says the move is necessary as a security measure.It says the move "detaches criminals from modern communication means".But the proposal has to be approved by the central government before it is implemented and so far no decision has been taken.Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan has said that he was not in favour of such a move."But I will go through the Sindh government's application in favour of the ban to see how much weight it carries," Mr Khan was quoted by local media as saying.Scores of social media users have condemned the proposals arguing that they are infringements of personal freedom and will impede small businesses and entrepreneurs from working effectively."The ban on Skype, Viber and WhatsApp in Sindh is a cyber-drone attack from the government," social media user Umer Pirzada tweeted.Another critic wrote: "This is when you know the country has gone down the drain. Blocking WhatsApp, Skype, What's next? Blocking oxygen?"But senior Pakistan People's Party (PPP) leader Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has spoken out in favour of the move arguing on Twitter that it was necessary to "catch some terrorists and save some lives".Sindh has been plagued by serious militant, sectarian and criminal violence throughout 2013 with the port city of Karachi being especially badly hit.Technology experts have pointed out that the proposed restrictions may be doomed to failure because they could easily be circumvented by criminals.Correspondents says that Pakistan's mobile network has been switched off about 12 times over the last year.Former PPP Interior Minister Rehman Malik frequently shut down cellular networks for extended periods on important national and religious holidays to "ensure the safety of the people".A ban on video sharing website YouTube - deemed by the authorities to be blasphemous - was introduced by the central government in September 2012.</body>

      <body>The photo sharing service Instagram announced it will start placing ads in US users photo streams in a posting on its website."We have big ideas for the future, and part of making them happen is building Instagram into a sustainable business," it said.Ads will appear in a few months and involve just a handful of firms.Instagram was bought by Facebook for $1bn (£619m), but has never made a profit.The company, which now has 150 million users, has been a favourite among consumers but has long left analysts wondering how it could turn enthusiasm among photographers into a business model.Early efforts by Instagram to generate revenue were met with user backlash, such as when the company changed the terms of service to seemingly indicate that it would own user images and could sell those images to advertisers.The failure of this move was acknowledged in the company's posting."As always, you own your own photos and videos. The introduction of advertising won't change this," it said.In an interview earlier this year with the BBC, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom said that Instagram must "fund its own future."Social media advertising is a booming business in the US.According to research firm eMarketer, advertisers will spend $9.5bn on social network ads worldwide this year.Facebook has boosted its efforts to gain a larger share of this ad spending.This year, the company's share of global mobile ad revenues will rise to 15.8% from 5.35% last year.</body>

      <body>Campaigners are trying to force a change in UK law after accusations of mass UK internet surveillance.Three privacy campaign groups have open legal proceedings in Europe in a bid to alter UK bugging legislation.The groups are trying to get the court to decide if UK surveillance rules give spies too much leeway to collect huge volumes of data.UK signals intelligence agency GCHQ declined to comment on Thursday.Three privacy groups have launched a bid to take the UK government to court in Europe after revelations of mass surveillance schemes.Under Tempora, UK agencies allegedly tapped cross-Atlantic fibre-optic cables to scoop up data headed for the US.The scheme was revealed by the Guardian newspaper in June.According to leaked documents, the UK also participated in the US Prism scheme, which allowed law enforcement access to detailed mass records of smartphone and internet activity.The campaigners allege that internet communications taps collected huge amounts of data traffic in a way that went against European human rights law.The groups want the European Court of Human Rights to force the UK government to tighten up a UK bugging law called the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa).Big Brother Watch, the Open Rights Group, and the English Pen campaign groups opened legal proceedings with the European Court of Human Rights this week.The groups sent a detailed letter to the court stating their concerns, Daniel Carey of Deighton Pierce Glynn solicitors told the BBC.Mr Carey, who is acting on behalf of the groups, said that the court could make a decision within two to three months about whether it will take the proceedings any further.</body>

      <body>Samsung Electronics, the world's biggest mobile phone and TV maker, has forecast record profits for the July-to-September quarter.It expects operating profit of 10.1 trillion won ($9.4bn; £5.8bn) for the quarter, a 25% jump from a year ago.The profit guidance beats many analyst forecasts.Samsung has enjoyed tremendous success with its Galaxy range of smartphones, but there had been concerns recently that its growth rate may be slowing."The company is doing a phenomenal job of continuing its growth rate," said Andrew Milroy, an analyst with consulting firm Frost and Sullivan."One would have expected that its growth rate may be hit by the emergence of other cheaper mobile phone makers."But it doesn't seemed to have happened, at least not yet," he added.The success of its Galaxy range of smartphones has seen Samsung become the leading player in the global mobile phone market.Analysts say the company's policy of catering to the low and high-end segments of the market has proved particularly effective.Samsung has launched top-end products such as the Galaxy S4 in a bid to take on the likes of Apple's iPhone.It has also introduced low-cost smartphones targeted at customers in emerging markets such as India and China.Many mobile phone operators in those markets do not subsidise phones, making low-cost devices a much more attractive option for many consumers."Samsung realises that growth opportunities in emerging markets are key to overall success of their business, and they have been smart enough to tap into it," said Mr Milroy."They have covered both ends of the spectrum really well."Last month, Samsung said that it is planning to launch handsets with curved displays.It exhibited prototype products with bendy and extendable screens in January this year, but there are doubts as to how this technology can be mass-produced cheaply and reliably.The firm also launched a smartwatch, the Galaxy Gear, last month - beating Microsoft, Apple and Google in the race to bring this type of technology to market.The smartwatch has a colour screen that can show alerts, be used for voice calls and run apps.</body>

      <body>A US patent for a database that uses DNA testing to tell prospective parents which traits their future offspring may inherit has been criticised by experts.23andMe says its Family Traits Inheritor Calculator can predict the risk of inheriting specific diseases as well as details such as height, weight, eye colour and even personality.Couples send the firm a saliva sample to see what their babies might be like.But critics have called the project "ethically and socially treacherous".The patent suggests the database could also be used by fertility clinics to find appropriate donors.But the Mountain View, California-based firm was quick to say this was no longer part of its plan."At the time 23andMe filed the patent, there was consideration that the technology could have potential applications for fertility clinics so language specific to the fertility treatment process was included in the patent," it said in a blog post."The company never pursued the concepts discussed in the patent beyond our Family Traits Inheritance Calculator, nor do we have any plans to do so."Instead it described the tool for prospective parents as "an enjoyable way to dip their toes into genetics".But critics remain concerned that such technology could be misused."It would be highly irresponsible for 23andMe or anyone else to offer a product or service based on this patent," said Marcy Darnovsky, executive director of the Center for Genetics and Society."It amounts to shopping for designer donors in an effort to produce designer babies."We believe the patent office made a serious mistake in allowing a patent that includes drop-down menus for which to choose a future child's traits."A project like this would also be ethically and socially treacherous."</body>

      <body>Scotland's largest health board has yet to fully assess the financial cost of a two-day IT systems crash which saw 709 appointments and procedures cancelled.NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (GGC) said it would be premature to speculate what caused the problem while diagnostic checks were continuing.The crash meant that 599 outpatient appointments were postponed along with 62 planned inpatient procedures and day cases and 48 chemotherapy treatments.The system was restored on Thursday.Problems with the health board's computer system were identified on Tuesday following the local September holiday weekend.Despite round-the-clock efforts from NHS GGC's own IT teams, with input from suppliers at Microsoft and Charteris, the issue was not resolved until Thursday.The delay and widespread nature of the problems saw NHS GGC chief executive Robert Calderwood issue an "unreserved apology" to patients who had appointments and treatments at 11 hospitals postponed.In the aftermath of the crash, BBC Scotland asked the health board how much the problem was likely to cost, who would pay and the likelihood of any legal action.In reply, a spokeswoman for NHS GGC said: "Our IT teams and our external experts are running full diagnostic checks to try and understand exactly what caused the problem in the first place and until a cause it identified it would be premature to speculate on what element of the system was responsible."The focus to date has been on resolving the issue and getting our systems back online and as such the cost implications have yet to be fully assessed."The input by our main IT suppliers is covered under existing contractual arrangements."</body>

      <body>The value of bitcoins has dropped after the closure of the clandestine Silk Road online marketplace.The FBI seized bitcoins worth approximately $3.6m (£2.2m) on Tuesday.The price of a bitcoin, a virtual currency for use online, fell steeply after the arrest of suspected website administrator Ross Ulbricht.Investor confidence may have been shaken by the association of bitcoins with illegal activity, according to a security expert."When there's a big bust, that's going to knock people's confidence in investing," said Rik Ferguson, a senior researcher at security company Trend Micro."The more a currency is associated with illegal activity, the more people will be nervous about using it," he said.Silk Road, which allowed users to trade in illegal drugs, required transactions to be made using the virtual currency.News of the closure was followed by a rapid drop in the price of bitcoins, according to figures from the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange.The going rate for the virtual currency dropped from more than $140 (£86) to around $110, before climbing back up to $123 (£75).Investors may have been concerned about the FBI's ability to confiscate bitcoins, said Mr Ferguson."Knowing that a currency could be seized or shut down could pressure people to look for alternative investment vehicles," he said.The FBI seized the virtual currency by getting hold of encryption keys for the bitcoins, according to Jerry Brito, George Mason University's technology policy director.The keys were made available through seized computer equipment, Mr Brito said in a blog post.The FBI then transferred the bitcoins to an address controlled by the US government, according to the seizure order (PDF).</body>

      <body>Taiwanese mobile phone maker HTC has reported its first ever loss as it continues to lose ground to rivals.It made a net loss of 2.97bn Taiwan dollars ($100m; £62m) in the three months to September.Its numbers are in sharp contrast with rival Samsung, which has forecast record profit for the same period.HTC was one of the early market leaders in Android smartphones, but has lost market share to rivals such as Samsung and Apple in recent years.It has launched new products, such as the HTC One, in an attempt to regain some of the lost ground.While the firm has claimed that the response to those products has been encouraging, analysts have warned that prospects of a recovery continue to remain weak.Laura Chen, an analyst at BNP Paribas, said that there were "no signs" of a recovery anytime soon.The company's shares have fallen more than 50% over the past 12 months amid concerns over its future growth.</body>

      <title>New shape-shifting metals discovered</title>
      <description>Scientists develop a new family of smart materials that could be used in applications ranging from space vehicles to electronics to jet engines.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24400101</url>
      <date>1380888037</date>
      <body>A new shape-changing metal crystal is reported in the journal Nature, by scientists at University of Minnesota.It is the prototype of a new family of smart materials that could be used in applications ranging from space vehicles to electronics to jet engines.Called a "martensite", the crystal has two different arrangements of atoms, switching seamlessly between them.It can change shape tens of thousands of times when heated and cooled without degrading, unlike existing technology.Currently, martensite metals are made of an alloyed mixture of nickel and titanium.They have the remarkable ability to "remember" their shape and even after being bent will return to their original form. For this, they are called "shape memory" metals.They have been used in spectacle frames and brassiere wires, but also in surgery as frameworks for shaping healing bones, and as "stents" for holding heart arteries open.Martensite metals change shape when heated or cooled through a certain temperature, when the atoms that make up their structure rearrange themselves in a sudden transformation.Some call this a "military transformation" because the rows of atoms that make up the metal crystal click into their new shape in an orderly manner.The transformation means that martensite can be used in smart mechanisms that respond to temperature change.Examples include automatic windows-openers in glasshouses, a means for automatically guiding solar panels to point at the Sun on the Hubble Space Telescope, and, very recently, in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to morph the trailing edge of the engine cowling, making it quieter when it runs hot on take-off.The pitfall of current martensites is that after repeated shape changes, they build up stresses inside that degrade them and eventually break them apart. The new alloy, made of a mixture of zinc, gold and copper, changes back and forth almost indefinitely with little internal damage, opening up a new range of applications for these types of "active materials".The aim is now to apply the lessons learned from the new metal to make a family of ceramic solids that can also be shape-switched back and forth."The real advance is to make the transformations reversible that could be applied in many situations" explains Prof Richard James, one of the authors of the study."You could make devices that convert heat to electricity directly. They could use the waste heat from computers and cell phones to recharge the battery and make them more efficient."As the material cycles through its different atomic arrangements, crystals can be seen at its surface in ever-changing patterns, looking like microscopic rivers.The structures fit together without any stress layers between them, and this seems to be the key to their longevity and potential.The new materials could also be used in improved and efficient microelectromechanical systems - energy harvesting devices, in which small vibrations can be converted directly into power.These sorts of gizmos are already used in tyre pressure-monitoring systems in cars to power the electronics in the sensors.</body>

      <title>Delta gives pilots Microsoft tablets</title>
      <description>An American airline is using the latest Microsoft tablets in an effort to create paperless cockpits.</description>

      <date>1380643386</date>
      <body>American airline Delta is to equip 11,000 of its pilots with Microsoft Surface 2 tablets, in a bid to eliminate paper resources.The recently launched Surface 2, which runs the Windows RT 8.1 platform, will provide crews with key charts and navigation tools via a customised app.The tablets will replace the 17kg (2st 10lb) flight bags currently carried by pilots, reducing fuel consumption.The company expects all its cockpits to be paperless by the end of 2014.Delta had previously tested Apple iPads as potential Electronic Flight Bags (EFB), but has recently embraced Microsoft devices.It equipped 19,000 of its flight attendants with Nokia Lumia 820 smartphones in August, which run on a Windows operating system.The sight of pilots wheeling heavy cases through airports is a familiar one, but electronic alternatives have been around for decades.Many commercial airlines now use tablets as EFBs, and the devices are even common among single-seat, or recreational pilots.Delta pilots had been using their own tablet devices in the cockpit, but now only the Surface 2 will be allowed - a move that has been unpopular with some employees, who vented their frustrations on online forums.A Delta spokesman told the BBC that crews will be allowed to run personal applications on the Surface 2, as long as they use a separate profile.Delta's senior vice president, Capt Steve Dickson, said the Surface tablets would "minimise time spent looking for flight information", and allow pilots the "opportunity for greater situational awareness in the air and on the ground".The tablets will feature a custom-built app called FliteDeck Pro, developed by aerospace technology company Jeppesen, a subsidiary of Boeing.They will contain thousands of electronic documents, charts, navigational aids, checklists and other key reference materials.A spokesman for Delta said the company chose the Surface 2 "because of its ease of integration into existing IT systems as well as training and communications programs".Delta says it will roll out the device to pilots on its Boeing 757 and Boeing 767 fleets later this year, subject to approval by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).The airline estimates the weight reduction resulting from the switch to a paperless cockpit will reduce fuel usage by 1.2 million gallons per year - leading to a reduction in carbon emissions of 26 million pounds (12 million kg).Aviation consultant Chris Yates told the BBC the weight of flight bags "have been an issue for a while".</body>

      <body>Over the summer there was a lot of digging going on in the Lancashire countryside.Nothing unusual there you may think until you realise that these trenches are being built to house a fibre optic network with speeds to rival those that Google is installing in Kansas City.The community-led Broadband 4 Rural North (B4RN) scheme offers speeds of up to 1Gbps (gigabit per second) to communities along its route.And as it expands its network, more villages are asking if they can be connected too, proving that if you build it, they will come.The project has hit problems - some minor, like a delay over the summer caused by some nesting lapwings, but some bigger, for example when Network Rail refused permission for the ducts to run over a bridge, forcing it to reroute in a river.However its biggest problem is money. Despite raising £300,000 worth of local investment, the team behind the project estimate that the total cost will be £1.86m.It applied for a government grant but is still waiting to hear whether it will qualify while it is also finding it tricky to get a loan.It illustrates the difficulty of getting even a small-scale broadband network up and running and also begs the questions - why would farmers digging the trenches even want to take on such a project?The reality is that they and other local residents are fed up with slow or non-existent broadband.Commercial broadband providers like BT see no profit in rolling out complicated networks to a handful of houses in the middle of nowhere.And that is rather galling for the people living in such communities who need broadband just as much, in some cases more, than their urban counterparts.Broadband is now widely acknowledged as the fourth utility, and the government is all too aware that it needs to close the digital divide between town and country.But its solution - to offer £530m to councils to subsidise rural broadband roll-outs - has been widely criticised, most recently in a report from a group of MPs who make up the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).The process has been painfully slow. Initially the Department of Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) planned to complete the roll-outs by 2015.Now that has been put back to 2017, with the caveat that up to 10% of the country will still not be covered.When it became clear that former telecoms monopoly BT had won every single council contract, there were some angry reactions.The PAC report accused the DCMS of ripping off taxpayers by simply handing public money to BT.This week as BT puts the final dots on those contracts, the big question is where does it leave the community schemes like B4RN?While the current subsidy is now gone, the PAC report recommended the government make every effort to ensure that the next round of public funding - the £250m earmarked for the final 10% not covered in current plans - is spent more wisely."It can't simply be put into a pot marked BT. There has to be more competition. This is a good opportunity to make government funding go a lot further," said Malcolm Corbett, who heads up the independent networks co-operative association (Inca).He estimates that the local community broadband schemes supported by his organisation can offer a much faster service to remote communities and require far less state aid than that demanded by BT, largely because they rely on co-investments with the local people.It is a view that the government does not seem to share. A separate £20m provided by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to specifically fund innovative rural broadband schemes, including Lancashire's B4RN project, looks like it could be going the same way as the money provided by the DCMS."Our information indicates that almost all of the money will go to BT," said Mr Corbett."I'm on the point of giving up. Whatever we do and despite an extraordinarily critical government report, we still can't get these schemes out there. BT is just so powerful," he said.BT's managing director of Next Generation Access, Bill Murphy, is not surprised that community schemes are struggling to gain headway."Our payback on rural broadband is 15 years. This is not for the faint-hearted. If people want to go build, then go build but, as I tell them, broadband networks aren't just for Christmas,"And he is dubious that community schemes can roll out networks cheaper than BT."I spend a lot of time sitting in village halls hearing about how they want to build their own thing but none of them have ever built anything before. I admire their passion and commitment but I'm not going to be preached at by people who don't have the experience. Don't tell me that you can build a network cheaper than me," he said.One of the biggest criticisms in the PAC report was that BT and local authorities are failing to provide detailed information about how far their roll-outs would extend.Without such information it will be hard for rivals to offer projects to compete with BT.Gigaclear is one such rival. It is offering a 1Gbps fibre to the home service to homes in Oxfordshire and Rutland and hopes to extend its footprint to Hampshire and Kent.But lack of certainty about where BT may build networks is hampering its efforts."Under the current contracts drawn up with BT, councils can't say what areas will be upgraded until three months beforehand," said their marketing director Joe Frost."It means that whole areas will not be told anything for two years. That is a problem for them and for us," he said.The issue has led the Countryside Alliance to demand change."BT and the local authorities aren't being transparent about where the roll-out will cover. We need to see a map with postcode trackers showing what communities will be left out," said their head of policy Sarah Lee.For its part, BT said that it is up to local authorities to provide this information and that increasingly they are doing so.Anyone wanting to know whether their community will be covered by the current roll-out has simply to phone their council, added Mr Murphy.One of the most interesting things about the alternative community schemes is that they tend to favour faster fibre to the home technology (FTTH) over BT's preferred fibre to the street cabinet (FTTC), even though it is far more expensive to lay.Retired engineer Walter Wilcox has campaigned for years to get better broadband in the village of Ewhurst in Surrey and when it finally did come, he was unhappy with it."There are 76 houses that can't get the service, two properties where the fibre service is worse than the one they had before and we estimate 226 properties out of about 942 are unable to achieve the lower limit of 24 Mbps," he said.The upgrade was done by BT using FTTC.BT admits that the upgrade in Ewhurst took "longer than it should" and that 'there is still work to do"."There are about 5% of people in the village who can't get the service but we are working on solutions to fix this." said Mr Murphy.But what has happened in Ewhurst could be replicated around the country because, with a few exceptions, it is the technology that will form the backbone of BT's rollout.Many worry that FTTC is already an outdated technology, ill-suited to rural communities because the speed you get is in relation to how close you live to a street cabinet.In contrast the FTTH technology favoured by B4RN and other community schemes offers the same speed to everyone - and with a top speed of 1Gbps it is not going to be past its sell by date any time soon.As Chris Conder who sits on B4RN's management team puts it: "Fibre to the cabinet is like giving people a cold water tap whereas with fibre to the home they can have a hot power shower."B4RN already has plenty of satisfied customers on its network but whether it and others like it are really equipped for a nationwide fibre battle with BT remains distinctly uncertain.But there are plenty of people living in some of Britain's remotest places rooting for them.</body>

      <title>Can we trust the spying state?</title>
      <description>Assessing the impact of Edward Snowden</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24399213</url>
      <date>1380887494</date>
      <body>How worried should we be by the state's capability to spy on us?Top secret documents, leaked by former American intelligence analyst Edward Snowden, have revealed the huge capacity of Britain and America's intelligence agencies - GCHQ and the NSA - to capture communications.Snowden and his supporters have argued that the public should know more about what is happening, while governments have argued that exposure has endangered national security.Four months after the first revelations in the Guardian newspaper, a picture has emerged of Britain and America's intelligence-gathering capabilities.Taken together, the reports point to an ambition to be able to reach into the vast global tide of digital communications and be able to pick out any message and read it, as well as to conduct wide-ranging searches of billions of records to look for patterns and connections."Even if you're not doing anything wrong you're being watched and recorded," argued Edward Snowden. "You should decide if they should be doing this."Those who have worked inside the secret state say that the power is vital for national security and only used for national security."You have to have a powerful capability to find the small amount you're looking for - but that doesn't mean the state is reading everyone's emails," former GCHQ director Sir David Omand told the BBC."What the state needs and law enforcement needs is the possibility of accessing the communications of the terrorists, the criminals, the kidnappers, the proliferators, the paedophiles. But those communications are all mixed up with everyone else's communications - there are 204 million emails a minute buzzing around the globe."So you have to have a powerful capability to find the small amount that you are looking for. But it doesn't mean that the state is reading everyone's emails, nor would that conceivably be feasible."But can we trust the state with this power?Technology allows it to do things it could never have done before - collecting and sifting through billions of records using data mining to find a connection or reconstructing a person's social interactions from the trail they leave behind online.The lack of sufficient oversight worries those who have campaigned on civil liberties."Part of the problem here is an age problem," says David Davis, a former Conservative Shadow Home Secretary."My generation of politicians - up to ones 20 years younger than me - don't really understand the extent to which we are intruding into people's privacy."Mr Davis believes the current system of oversight and accountability is not strong enough, especially when access to metadata about communications and interactions only requires internal authorisation within an intelligence agency - and not the warrant that is required to intercept the actual content of communications."There is no need to trust the state unless it has got a good reason and they must justify that to someone else - a judge or a magistrate or someone who is outside their system and can check they are using it properly," he argues.The claim that encryption standards have been deliberately weakened or had so-called "backdoors" added to allow access by intelligence agencies caused particular anger among those who have spent their careers trying to improve internet security and ensure the privacy of communications."The NSA's actions have done more than undermine online security - they've threatened to break the internet," Ross Anderson, Professor in Security Engineering at Cambridge University says of its attempts to ensure access."In order to do this they have compromised in various ways the protocols on which the internet relies. When you introduce these vulnerabilities, they are not just for the spies to use. They are available for bad guys to use as well."The Snowden documents have surprised many, including Prof Anderson, in terms of the scale of what they reveal."To find that they had built this machine and got it working is an eye-opener," he told the BBC.Critics of the intelligence agencies believe the disclosures have been important in starting a public debate about whether we know enough about the state's capability and whether there are enough controls and oversight.But many of those inside the intelligence world point to the damage which they say the revelations have done. They fear that since Edward Snowden is in Russia, the Russian state will have found some way of accessing the information."Part of me says that not even the KGB in its heyday of Philby, Burgess and Maclean in the 1950s could have dreamt of acquiring 58,000 highly classified intelligence documents," Sir David Omand told the BBC.The concern is also that the more that is revealed in public, the more the targets of surveillance adapt their behaviour. Sir David believes Snowden's actions will do real damage to national security."My fear is that we are now going to witness a slow-motion car crash in which gradually sources dry up, targets such as terrorists and cybercriminals will work out what are the kind of capabilities we have, and they will adopt their methods and be harder to track down," says the former GCHQ director.In the last week, the BBC was given direct access to a small selection of original documents held outside the UK that form the basis of stories the Guardian newspaper has already published.The scale of the capability they reveal - and the secrets they contain - make clear there are serious issues involved in balancing the public interest and national security. That balance lies at the heart of this debate - between the public interest and the right to know about what the state can do and the need for the state to protect its secrets and its capabilities for the sake of national security.The question remains - who gets to decide?</body>

      <description>How does Twitter make its money?</description>

      <body>On Thursday, Twitter announced that it wanted to raise $1bn (£619m) by listing on the US stock markets, making it the biggest initial public offering (IPO) from a technology company since Facebook went public in May 2012.The giant micro-blogging site, founded just seven years ago, has been valued at about $10bn.So, how does Twitter make its money and how can we explain its high valuation?Twitter may have more than 218 million monthly users, but the company does not make money - yet.In papers filed with US regulators, it was revealed for the first time that Twitter made a loss of $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m.But analysts say the company is showing strong signs of growth, with revenue rising from just $28m in 2010 to $317m by the end of 2012.One research firm, eMarketer, estimates that Twitter's revenues from advertising sales will increase by more than 100% by the end of this year.Almost all of Twitter's revenue - about 85% of it - comes from advertising on its site.There are three main ways for a company or an individual to advertise on Twitter: by promoting a tweet that will appear in people's timelines, promoting a whole account, or promoting a trend.Twitter tends to charge its advertisers according to the amount of interaction their content generates.A budget is usually set at the start of the campaign and then the advertiser pays per click or per retweet.It also has a "bidding" system in which advertisers compete with each other to have their content appear in a particular space."One of the advantages of Twitter for marketers over traditional display advertising is they have worked really hard to make sure that advertising on Twitter is not interruptive," says Lara O'Reilly, senior reporter at Marketing Week.Anything that disrupts the user experience might reduce engagement from users, which in turn can put off advertisers, Ms O'Reilly says."It's not a flashy banner that gets in the way of something. It looks very native," she explains.Also, the company takes in a significant portion of its advertising revenue from mobile devices - in contrast with Facebook, which had not fully developed its mobile strategy at the time of its listing.As of 2013, more than 65% of Twitter's advertising revenue was generated from mobile devices.More than 75% of Twitter users accessed the site from their mobile phone during that same time period."Because Twitter was born as a mobile platform they already have this part sorted," Ms O'Reilly adds. "In investors' eyes, they have a mobile strategy."Data licensing is Twitter's second major revenue stream.The micro-blogger sells something known as the "firehose", its public data, which often adds up to about 500 million tweets each day.Companies can dive deep into the data to analyse consumer trends and sell their insight on to other brands and companies.Because the tweets are public, consumers also have access to this data.But Nick Halstead, founder of DataSift, one of the only two companies with access to the firehose, says that with sophisticated analysis companies can learn detailed and specific information about their users that, because of the volume of data, an ordinary user or company would not be able to get.Firms could use the data to do simple things, he says, like monitoring sentiment towards their brand or product.But the data can also be used in a much more complex way."One of my favourites is around stock levels," Mr Halstead says."For example, in the US football teams will analyse the popularity of players by region to work out how much they should buy of a particular football top to stock them in shops."He adds: "In the UK we all rush out and buy barbecue equipment on particular weekends, and supermarkets want to stock up when that happens, but they need three or four days to do that."You can use Twitter for modelling when people are planning to hold those kind of events."While Twitter may have proved it has the potential to make money, analysts say there are still hurdles to profitability.The company is spending a lot of money investing in advertising technology and expanding its team, says Clark Fredericksen, vice president at eMarketer.And it plans to keep spending after going public."We can expect that they will continue to make those investments because they're looking long-term," he says.But Mr Fredericksen adds Twitter needs to show it can monetise its international users and work with small businesses."When Twitter goes to advertisers a big part of their pitch is using Twitter to work with other media," he says, adding that the site gets huge traction with users around events like the Oscars or episodes of popular television shows such as Breaking Bad."Whether that formula will translate in smaller TV markets needs to be seen."</body>

      <title>Hydrogen: The car fuel of the future?</title>
      <description>Could hydrogen power the cars of tomorrow?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24381812</url>
      <date>1380843391</date>
      <body>A small British firm is looking forward to a day in which we will take our cars to the garage and fill them with hydrogen.Acal Energy, based in Runcorn in Cheshire, says it has developed a chemistry that could make hydrogen fuel cells much cheaper and longer-lasting than current technologies.It wants to license its chemistry to the world's car-makers, opening the way for hydrogen vehicles to sell in large volumes in 10 or 20 years' time."We believe this is one of the breakthrough technologies," says Brendan Bilton, the company's chief commercial officer."We're pretty confident and excited... that this will start unlocking the barriers," he continues, "Allowing fuel cells to be in products for mass market applications."It is a bold dream but not a crazy one.The automotive industry is already far advanced with plans for a first generation of hydrogen cars.Hyundai, the South Korean manufacturer, has said it will soon start selling a hydrogen-powered version of its ix35 model.Meanwhile, the Japanese giant Toyota is expected to unveil its first nearly-production-ready foray into the territory at next month's Tokyo motor show.Other big names - including Daimler and Volkswagen - are thought to be on track to get hydrogen vehicles into showrooms by 2017.But few expect these first-generation hydrogen cars to sell in very large numbers.Acal Energy is pitching its technology as the enabler for a second generation of less costly, more durable vehicles which could - if all goes to plan - pose a serious challenge to the long domination of the internal combustion engine from about 2020 onwards.To begin with, consumers may take a bit of persuading.Hydrogen is widely seen as a dangerous fuel - an image underpinned by that grainy newsreel footage of the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg airship bursting into flames in the 1930s.But actually, experts do not seem daunted by this particular technical challenge.They point out that hydrogen is already used and managed on a routine basis in industrial processes.The main reason anyone bothers with it as a fuel for the future is because it is emission-free at the point of use.The hydrogen is combined with oxygen in a bit of kit called a fuel cell. This process generates electricity to power the engine in the vehicle.The waste products are heat and harmless water.Water is benign, unlike the global warming-inducing, carbon dioxide emissions that spew from even the most efficient petrol and diesel vehicles.The car industry has been developing fuel cells that use costly platinum as the catalyst for generating power from hydrogen for many years.Acal Energy claims the problem with this current technology is that it results in fuel cells that are either prohibitively expensive because of the high platinum content, or prone to degrade quickly.To get round these issues, the company has developed what Mr Bilton describes as a "liquid catalyst" composed of "a dissolved solution of metal salts".As well as being a lot cheaper than a platinum catalyst, the liquid doubles up as a coolant and a cleaning agent that extends the life of the fuel cell by taking away damaging by-products as it circulates through a "regenerator"."We have a solution that both increases durability and reduces cost," says Mr Bilton.The company has its offices in a science park that until a few years ago was the research and development centre for the British chemicals giant ICI, now shrunken in size and foreign-owned.Intriguingly, the ideas behind Acal Energy's patented "FlowCath" technology derive from techniques developed to clean clothes more efficiently.The founder of the company, Dr Andrew Creeth, now its chief technology officer, spent much of his career working as a scientist for the washing powder giant Unilever.Development of the product is taking place in an environment not unlike a gigantic school chemistry lab - full of bubbling chemicals, complicated equipment and clever looking people in white coats.The company has already raised £15m ($24m) to finance its work from a mixture of private investors and government sources.It is currently hoping to raise another £15m or so from a new funding round, with the outcome due to be announced soon.Eventually, Acal Energy aims to earn profits from the business model pioneered by the successful British micro-chip designer Arm Holdings.Arm's technology is embedded in most of the chips used in the world's smartphones and tablet computers.It receives a small royalty payment every time anyone upgrades their mobile device.Acal Energy dreams of equal success from licensing its technology to car manufacturers in decades to come.The big questions, though, are does the technology work and will it be the breakthrough that the company claims?Prof Nigel Brandon of Imperial College in London, a leading academic in hydrogen energy, is well qualified to comment."The core technology looks very exciting," he says."There are some components in their system they need to improve. I don't see any reason why they can't do that but they've still got to do it," Prof Brandon adds.It is guarded optimism that could equally be applied to the whole field of hydrogen fuel cell energy.The big advantages over battery-powered electric vehicles are hydrogen cars can be refuelled in a just a few minutes, they can run for 300 or 400 miles between refuelling and they have the environmental benefits of battery driven cars with the same range and convenience as those with petrol or diesel engines.But there are also significant snags.Among them is the need to create a hugely expensive new infrastructure of hydrogen filling stations to replace garages.Hydrogen enthusiasts often quote the example of the internet.Once the demand was proven, a global network of optical fibre cables to carry data traffic was rapidly built despite the cost.Major players in the car industry are betting - but not yet on a truly large scale - that hydrogen energy will follow the same pattern.</body>

      <description>Avoid big costs for using the net on your phone when abroad</description>

      <body>You would have a shock if you received a £5,858 phone bill following a trip abroad.That's what Claude Douglas from Aldershot got because he forgot to turn off the data roaming function on his handset.Smartphones and tablets automatically seek out mobile connections in order to install updates so it's easy to run up a high bill.Here are some ways to avoid a nasty surprise when you get home.Check the data roaming prices for the country you are visiting with your network provider before you leave.Ask them about data bundles and packages which could make your bill cheaper.When you connect your mobile to a network abroad you are charged for the data you send and receive.The price for data is usually based on the volume you use, which is measured in kilobytes (KB) or megabytes (MB).Print out anything you need, such as local maps or places to eat and drink before you leave.If you only plan to make calls or send texts, switch your data roaming off before you leave home.You can do this in your device settings.If you're planning to access the internet reset your device's data usage counter then keep an eye on it.Try to stay within your allowance.Mobile operators must send customers a text message or email when they reach 80% and 100% of the agreed limit, according to Uswitch.There is a price cap on data roaming charges in the European Union (EU).In the EU, phone companies can charge no more than €0.45 (around 38p) per MB of data. This will then fall to €0.20 in July 2014.Data roaming costs can be significantly higher outside Europe.Try to avoid data heavy activities such accessing maps or downloading updates.Take advantage of free wi-fi in airports, cafes or hotels. Turn off data roaming on your device, just in case.If you have a free wi-fi connection its an especially good time for contacting friends and family through apps such as Google+ Hangouts, Facetime, Skype or Viber.Consider buying a local pay-as-you-go SIM card in the country you visit, for local prices. Beware though, it won't work if your phone is locked to a particular network.If you are a frequent traveller you can buy a global SIM. You can usually purchase these in your local mobile phone shop or supermarket.First of all, contact your network provider to look into the unexpected charges.You can make a formal complaint to them if you can't reach an agreement. Check the guidelines outlined on the back of your bill or on the company website.You can take your complaint to the Communications and Internet Services Adjudication Scheme (CISAS) or Ombudsman Services: Communications if you still don't resolve it.These are free services which provide an independent decision in a dispute for customers of communications companies.Watchdog is broadcast on BBC One, Wednesdays at 20:00.</body>

      <title>Why loving One Direction is hard work</title>
      <description>Why loving One Direction can be hard work</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24351904</url>
      <date>1380698885</date>
      <body>Every night, 16-year-old SJ arrives home from her school in London and gets back to running her global media empire.She is one of the UK's most famous Directioners - as fans of heart-throb boy band One Direction are known.And while she would never go so far as to call herself 1D's biggest fan - that's just asking for trouble - her Harry Styles-inspired account, @STYLATORARMY, is certainly up there: 850,000 followers and counting."I think it's just because I tweet the content other fans want to see and can relate to," she explains, deftly simplifying a social media strategy for which marketing agencies routinely charge thousands."Also because I talk to a lot of other fans on there and don't ignore people - that makes them like my account, spread the word and follow me."Her account is a mixture of news about the boys, dialogue with other fans, and general adoration for the X-Factor runners-up who have seemingly taken over the world.She is the epitome of the modern day super-fan - because in 2013, loving popstars means a lot more than simply running down the road after the Beatles.No, in an age where so-called "big data" is changing business, it's also changing what it means to idolise as well.And not only can music fans say they merely love an artist, but they can demonstrate that love with black and white statistics - and use it to their advantage.Buddybounce, a London-based start-up, is seeking to provide something of an idolisation dashboard for both fans and artists alike, taking into account the millions of plays, tweets and other interactions that take place every day."It is a modern-day fan club that allows fans to get their dream, really, of being the biggest fan and get closer to their idols," explains Emma Obanye, one of the company's co-founders, who has fond memories from her teens of standing outside BBC Television Centre, waiting for the Backstreet Boys.When a fan signs up to Buddybounce, they are given the option to plug in various different services to monitor how often they interact with an artist.The site can monitor how often you tweet about the band, or watch a YouTube clip, or listen to an album on Spotify, and a whole host of other things.To get noticed, it means hours and hours of effort to clock up the points.For the labels that use it, Buddybounce is a tool that is attempting to make sense of the thousands of digital acts of fandom that come an artist's way every day."We have developed a way for artists to keep track of who has been rewarded as a fan," explains Giulia Piu, Ms Obanye's business partner, where "rewards" mean some kind of reciprocal interaction from a band member."So instead of basing it on luck, we give them a way to try and interact with as many fans as possible."It is this idea of "luck" which causes perhaps the most friction within fan communities.Fans often go to extreme lengths to catch an artist's eye, says Directioner SJ."People come up with all sorts of ideas to get their attention. Sometimes people throw their phones on stage - once a girl hid in a bin!"It didn't work. The boys went inside... and then security took her out of the bin."Naturally, faced with the noise, it's hard for artists to spot the real devotees - and getting it wrong can cause great upset."Justin Bieber once mentioned someone on Twitter who had just listened to his album once, but wasn't much of a fan, and said, 'This album's all right,'" explains Ms Obanye."Justin retweeted her - and there was so much hate from within his fan base because they were like, 'Oh my god, you should be noticing us' and this, that and the other."For fans now, that kind of interaction is so sought after - a mention, a follow... it's a reward, it's what they dream, what they really want."The company has teamed up with artists, including Conor Maynard, who has granted highly sought-after meet-and-greets to fans with the best Buddybounce scores.So for fans like SJ, having such a huge following may see them rewarded by getting closer to the band.But being a "famous" fan has some dangerous downsides."Recently, I've had emails from a team of people," SJ says, "pretending they were from 1D's management.""They made it look like it was coming from them - it had [official domain] onedirectionmusic.com in the email address."Then they pretended to be [the band's record label] Syco as well, basically emailing me saying, 'We have an amazing opportunity for you.'"What followed was a stream of emails, spoofed tweets and messages with the sole intention of gaining control of SJ's account.It wasn't an isolated incident - fake accounts are set up frequently, capitalising on fans' dreams of meeting their idols, even if such offers do raise alarm bells as seemingly too good to be true.Social networks have put in place efforts to make spotting scams easier, the most obvious of which is Twitter's "blue tick" system - an added logo showing an account has been checked and is legitimate.It's a problem that artists and their labels need to remain on top of if they are to make sure that social media remains a key part of the marketing machine, up there with making music videos or even going on tour."It was the UK fans' excitement about One Direction that really got them started," argues Sunil Singhvi, Twitter's head of entertainment for the UK."The fans' ability, via Twitter, to tell Europeans about One Direction really catapulted them there, then from Europe to America, and now it's a global phenomenon."Sonny Takhar, chief executive for Syco Records, is equally enthused: "Social media has become the new radio, it's never broken an act globally like this before."And unsurprisingly, Directioner SJ agrees: "The boys have said themselves how social media has been part of their success, because if we make a 'trend' about them, you can see that worldwide - so it spreads the message to other nations."So while the super-fan of 2013 may have their work cut out to stay digitally popular, their efforts might not be in vain, even if they never do get to meet the subject of their adoration."There are a few others like SJ who are benefiting right now, from a young age," says SJ's mum, Rebecca."That is a credit to all those fans out there who have done so well in learning how to use Twitter as a tool to communicate with their idol, but at the same time within their own community as well."Quite a lot of young people are going to be getting very good jobs in that field very soon."Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC</body>

      <title>'Over half of schools failing in RE'</title>
      <description>More than half of schools in England are failing pupils on religious education, says watchdog Ofsted.</description>

      <date>1381051158</date>
      <body>More than half of England's schools are failing pupils on religious education, the schools watchdog Ofsted has said.Its report accuses schools and the government of failing to focus effectively on the subject.It adds that six in 10 schools are not "realising the subject's full potential" in an increasingly globalised and multicultural century.The Religious Education Council for England and Wales called the findings disappointing but not surprising.The report highlights low standards, weak teaching, weak examination provision and confusion about the purpose of RE.In particular, it says the recent introduction of the English Baccalaureate measure for pupils who achieve grade C or above in English, mathematics, science, a language and either history or geography, ignores RE and has further marginalised the subject.The report echoes comments by the Education Secretary Michael Gove. In July he told religious leaders RE had "suffered" because of government changes.He said he had thought that because schools have a statutory duty to provide RE lessons the subject was protected.Ofsted's report, Religious Education: realising the potential, says the subject "plays a key role in promoting social cohesion and the virtues of respect and empathy, which are important in our diverse society" but it finds "many pupils leave school with scant subject knowledge and understanding".It adds: "Moreover RE teaching often fails to challenge and extend pupils' ability to explore fundamental questions about human life, religion and belief."Inspectors visited a sample of 185 schools, both primary and secondary, between September 2009 and July 2012.They found achievement and teaching in RE was less than good in six out of 10 primary schools, and in fewer than half of secondary schools and that not enough had been done to improve provision since a previous report in 2010.Teaching in primary schools was "not good enough because of weaknesses in teachers understanding of the subject", they found.Standards were higher for GCSE and sixth form students but even at GCSE level teaching often "failed to secure the core aim of the examination specifications, that is to enable pupils to adopt an enquiring, critical and reflective approach to the study of religion."The authors urge the Department for Education (DfE) to consider whether the quality and quantity of statutory RE provision should be decided locally by schools and local authorities - or specified by central government.They want the DfE to work with professional RE teaching associations to "clarify the aims and purposes of RE" and to improve teacher training.Schools should ensure that teaching deepens "pupils' understanding of the nature, diversity and impact of religion and belief in the contemporary world," they urge.John Keast, chairman of the Religious Education Council for England and Wales said they had been warning "for some time about the poor state of religious education in many schools".He said they would publish their own report and RE curriculum later in October."It is now vital that the DfE works with the Religious Education Council on putting things right. We can do better than this."Stephen Evans of the National Secular Society said the recommendations did not go far enough."With the freedom to determine their own syllabus for RE, many schools with a religious character abuse the subject and use it for missionising."Young people would be better served by a new national curriculum subject for all pupils that covers a variety of religious, non-religious and secular philosophies and world views."Meanwhile, Gail Larkin from the National Association of Head Teachers said consecutive governments were responsible for schools placing less emphasis on the subject.She said: "Some of the major policy changes that we've had, the impact has been to convey the message that RE is of less value than other subjects."So, as a head teacher... we are concentrating more - as we've been told to do by consecutive governments - on core subjects and subjects that can be measured.""Unfortunately", she added, "I think RE has fallen off the radar".</body>

      <title>Gove pressed over Muslim free school</title>
      <description>Labour asks the education secretary to explain what checks his department have carried out on the Al-Madinah Muslim free school.</description>

      <date>1381015587</date>
      <body>Michael Gove is coming under pressure to explain what checks his department carried out on a Muslim free school which has been closed since Tuesday.Al-Madinah, in Derby, cited "health and safety concerns" when it shut last week. It is due to reopen on Monday.But Labour called on the education secretary to "reassure the public" amid persistent concerns over the school.The Department for Education was already investigating allegations against the school, a spokesman said.Free schools - which can be opened by anyone - are state-funded but not overseen by the local authority.Al-Madinah says it has a "strong Muslim ethos" and when it opened last year claimed to be the first such school in the country for pupils from reception age to 16.Preliminary findings from an Ofsted inspection into the school gave it the lowest possible rating.The Department for Education had asked Ofsted to bring their inspection forward. Allegations had been made by parents and staff that pupils at Al-Madinah had been told to follow strict Islamic practices.Former staff have claimed non-Muslim female teachers came under pressure to wear the hijab head-scarf.It has also been reported that girls were made to sit at the back of class.The school denies pupils have been segregated and says its dress code was made clear to anyone wanting to work at the school.Sources have told the BBC the closure was due to incomplete records of child protection checks being done on all staff.But ahead of the school re-opening to pupils on Monday, shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said the situation must be "urgently clarified in order to reassure the public".In a letter to Mr Gove the Labour MP said: "This is, of course, not the first time that there have been questions surrounding your department's oversight of a free school."While I understand that there is an ongoing investigation, the reports concerning this school are of extreme concern to parents and the wider community."Given the confusion as to why the school has closed, and that pupils may be returning to the school on Monday, I would ask that these matters be clarified urgently in order to reassure the public."He called on the department to say what "due diligence" was carried out when the school was approved.And he asked whether there had been "appropriate vetting" of staff and what oversight ministers had had since it opened.Interim principal Stuart Wilson closed the school after Ofsted inspectors shared their preliminary findings with him."While unfortunate, my decision to close the school related to a short-term health and safety issue that has now been completely resolved and will not reoccur," a statement on the school's website read.The school "will be open as normal on Monday," Mr Wilson added.A Department for Education spokesman said: "We were already investigating this school before the allegations became public."We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection. We are waiting for Ofsted's final report and considering all legal options."Mr Twigg also questioned what would happen to children at the school if it did not reopen on Monday or had to close again.</body>

      <title>'Students face living-cost crisis'</title>
      <description>Students in England face a cost-of living-crisis as loans and grants fail to keep pace with rents and bills, suggest figures from the National Union of Students.</description>

      <date>1380883609</date>
      <body>Students in England face a cost-of-living crisis as loans and grants fail to keep pace with rents and bills, claims the National Union of Students.The gap between income and expenditure for a typical student amounts to more than £7,600 according to NUS analysis.The union compared the cost of living and studying for the 39-week 2013-14 academic year with typical income from government grants and loans.The government said it was targeting support at those who needed it most.Rent, bills and other outgoings continue to rise year after year above the rate of inflation but grants and loan rates were frozen this year and will only rise by 1% next year, says the union.It estimates that a student living outside London will pay an average of £21,440 in tuition fees, books, equipment, rent, travel and other living expenses.Against this, they have a potential income of £13,747 composed of their tuition fee loan plus maintenance loans and the grants available to those on average and low incomes.This leaves a shortfall of £7,693.In London, higher rents mean students typically spend £23,187 says the union - but they are also eligible for a higher maintenance loan of £6,090 though this still leaves them with a shortfall of £7,654, says the union.The union adds that some students from less well-off families who are eligible for grants are facing an additional squeeze as the level at which they can claim maximum support has remained at a household income of £25,000 since 2008.NUS president Toni Pearce said: "Those who do not have the rare luxury of resorting to the 'bank of mum and dad' are increasingly being driven to work full-time alongside study where jobs can be found, or worse still, into the arms of predatory pay day lenders just to make ends meet."We need a financial support system that ensures students get what the support they need, when they need it."A spokeswoman for the Department for Business Innovation and Skills said the government's student finance package was designed to target support at students from the poorest households."This year, students from the lowest income households can access over £7,100 of living-cost support, of which over £3,350 does not have to be repaid."The government also provides additional, non-repayable support to students in specific circumstances, such as students with children and disabled students."Scholarships and bursaries are also available from most universities, and students in hardship can apply for additional support through the Access to Learning Fund."</body>

      <title>Fewer children 'read in spare time'</title>
      <description>Fewer children in the UK are reading in their own time and one in five says they are embarrassed to be caught with a book, a survey suggests.</description>

      <body>Fewer children across the UK are reading in their own time and one in five is embarrassed to be caught with a book, a survey suggests.Just over a quarter of 35,000 children from 188 schools told the National Literacy Trust that they read outside of school.About the same number said they did not think their parents cared if they read.The trust says a similar survey in 2005 found one in three children read in their own time.The survey for the trust involved children filling in online questionnaires last winter.Half of those taking part said they enjoyed reading either "very much" or "quite a lot" and a high proportion (four out of five) agreed with the statement "the more I read, the better I become".Nearly two in five agreed reading was "cool", but about one in three said they only read when they had to.Report author Christina Clark, from the Literacy Trust, said young people who enjoyed reading very much were four times as likely to read above the level expected for their age compared with those who did not enjoy reading at all.Those who read outside of class every day were five times as likely to read above the expected level compared with those who never did.And children who do not think "reading is cool" were four times more likely to be below-average readers, the report says.National Literacy Trust director Jonathan Douglas said: "Our research not only reveals that children are reading less and developing more negative attitudes towards reading, but also that there is a clear correlation between this and their performance in reading tests."The study, of children aged from eight to 16, found that the proportion who read e-books outside of school had doubled since 2010 to 12%.Reading is most popular among eight to 11-year-olds, the survey suggests, although teenagers are more likely to read for longer.The charity released the research to coincide with a new campaign to find the UK's "literacy heroes".It is asking the public to name people who might have inspired a love of books or helped to improve reading skills.Anyone from a parent, teacher or young person who has overcome a personal literacy problem to a favourite author or celebrity can be nominated, the Literacy Trust said.The campaign is being supported by the Duchess of Cornwall, who said: "I firmly believe in the importance of igniting a passion for reading in the next generation."In a world where the written word competes with so many other calls on our attention, we need more literacy heroes to keep inspiring young people to find the pleasure and power of reading for themselves."</body>

      <title>Concerns delay schools' flu vaccine</title>
      <description>A programme to vaccinate children against flu is delayed in Glasgow after concerns from Muslim parents that it contains products derived from pork.</description>

      <date>1380868054</date>
      <body>A programme to vaccinate schoolchildren against flu has been delayed in Glasgow after concerns from Muslim parents that it contains products derived from pork.About 100,000 primary school pupils in Scottish health board areas taking part in a pilot programme are being offered the Fluenz vaccine.It is given as a nasal spray rather than the traditional jab.But parents in Pollokshields, which has a high number of Muslim pupils, have complained the spray contains gelatine.A letter sent to Glasgow schools in the wake of concerns cites a World Health Organisation study in 2001 which indicated that Islamic and Jewish scholars had agreed pork gelatine was permissible within a vaccine.However, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC), whose area contains most of Scotland's Muslims, said it had put back the rollout of the vaccinations "following concerns raised by a small number of parents".The programme is due to resume next week when parents will be offered a choice of the nasal spray or the more traditional jab.Scottish government public health minister Michael Matheson said flu was a "very serious infection" which needed to be vaccinated against.He said: "That is why, for the new programme for children, we are using a quick and painless nasal spray Fluenz, which has proven to be more effective in children and avoids the use of needles."Parents should be reassured that the existing guidance issued in 2001 from the World Health Organisation, prepared by religious scholars, advises that gelatine of porcine origin used in vaccines and other medicines is judicially permissible as the gelatine in the final product is a completely changed substance."Vaccination is voluntary and we want all parents to have the information they need to make an informed choice."If parents continue to have any concerns, children can be given an alternative safe injectable vaccine which does not contain any porcine gelatine but provides less protection than the nasal spray."He added: "The Scottish Government very much appreciates the help and advice provided by Muslim councils in response to these concerns and a letter has been issued to parents of children in Glasgow to offer reassurance about the use of the Fluenz vaccine."A fifth of the Scottish population will be offered a free flu vaccine, including people aged over 65 and those with conditions that put them at greater risk.For the first time, all two and three-year-olds - about 120,000 children - will be offered the vaccine, as well as 100,000 primary school pupils in health board areas which are taking part in a pilot programme.The programme will be rolled out to eventually see about one million children aged between two and 17 have the chance to be immunised towards the end of 2015.</body>

      <title>Call to revamp IT studies in schools</title>
      <description>A subject called "computing" should be created to replace information and communications technology (ICT) in school, a report suggests.</description>

      <body>A subject called "computing" should be created to replace information and communications technology (ICT) in school, a report suggests.ICT is no longer regarded as relevant for the future, the report by a steering group says.It said its replacement should encourage creativity, develop real-life problem solving and be flexible enough to evolve to stay current.Education Minister Huw Lewis called the report detailed and thorough.The report also suggested grouping computing with the three main science subjects."A career in IT typically involves some degree of logic, creativity, com­munication and collaboration, managing uncertainty, and problem solving," the report said."This is at odds with the current ICT curriculum that is prescriptive, outdated and documentation heavy, focusing on the consumption rather than cre­ation of software and digital content."It added: "We feel strongly that ICT has lost its meaning and become synonymous with word processing and spreadsheets."By renaming and rebranding it as computing as part of a new curriculum we will have an opportunity to improve these perceptions."The new subject would be broken down into two areas - computer science and information technology.Computer science would include the academic side and encompass programming, while information technology would focus on the use of computers in industry, commerce, arts and elsewhere.The report, prepared by an independent steering group chaired by Stuart Arthur from software experts Box UK, recommended computing should be designed with input from the industry and have an online assessment tool.It also added that digital literacy - the general ability to use computers - should start in primary school when pupils are five years old."We should equip children with the skills and empower them with the knowl­edge and confidence to become innovative digital creators, effective digital citizens and successful entrepreneurs so they can take advantage of the global growth opportunities that exist in the digital economy and beyond," the authors said."We have a unique opportunity to learn from the challenges identified in this report and aspire to become truly world class, not just by delivering a digital Wales but by becoming a world leader in computing and digital skills."It is essential to empower our children by giving them the skills required to con­tribute to the rapidly growing digital economy."Education Minister Huw Lewis said: "ICT in Wales is global and dynamic and I want Welsh learners to be given opportunities to develop the skills required to work in and contribute to the sector."We have concerns that fewer Welsh learners are seeing the value in pursuing a career in ICT and that many learners, as well as the wider public, perceive learning about computing in a negative way."It's therefore of great importance what is currently being taught is relevant to the global economy of the future."We will now take time to consider the report's findings in the context of our wider review of assessment and the national curriculum."</body>

      <body>More children have passed the new phonics reading test for England's five- and six-year-olds this year.More than two-thirds (69%) of pupils in state schools reached the expected level - up from 58% last year.Nearly 180,000 pupils failed to meet the expected standard in the controversial new check, which is carried out at the end of Year 1.Girls did better than boys - almost three-quarters passed - while about two-thirds of boys did so.The statistics were published on Thursday by the Department for Education.This is the second year that pupils have taken the test, which is based on "synthetic phonics", a system that focuses on children being able to identify sounds of letters and groups of letters so that they are then able to decode and read real words.For the check, the children are asked to sound out 40 words, some of which are made up, such as "voo", "spron" and "terg" - to test their reading skills.They need correctly to identify 32 out of the 40 phonic sounds to pass.Ministers say the phonics check will improve literacy standards by helping to identify children who need extra help with reading and say it has helped to increase schools' focus on phonics.Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said: "We are committed to improving children's reading."The phonics check helps teachers identify those pupils who need extra help in learning to read."Many thousands of children will now receive the extra support they need to catch up with their peers and develop a love of reading."Teaching unions say the phonics check does not tell teachers anything they did not know about their pupils and risks labelling some as failures at an early age.And they warn that children could be confused by reading "non-words".Christine Blower, the head of the National Union of Teachers, said: "To be telling five- and six-year-olds that they have failed is quite simply wrong."Children develop at different levels, the slow reader at five can easily be the good reader by the age of 11."In many other countries with successful education systems such as Finland most children haven't even started school until seven."</body>

      <title>Teachers in China 'highest status'</title>
      <description>Teachers in China are the most highly respected, in an international study comparing the status of teachers in 21 countries.</description>

      <body>Teachers in China have the highest levels of public respect, according to an international study comparing their status in 21 countries.Teachers in the UK were in 10th place in the global index which was compiled by the University of Sussex professor Peter Dolton.The study was based on surveys of 1,000 adults in each of the countries.This examined public attitudes to professional status, trust, pay and the desirability of teaching as a career.The study confirmed the high status of teachers in China, where there is a strong cultural emphasis on the importance of education."Teachers are revered," says Prof Dolton.A large majority of adults in China believed that students would respect their teachers - in contrast to most European countries where only a minority believed that students would show respect.In the UK, only about one in five adults believed that students showed their teachers respect in school.And while teachers in China were compared with doctors, in the UK they were more likely to be bracketed with nurses and social workers.In the US, people compared teachers with librarians and in Japan the feeling was that they were on a par with local government officials.This reveals the cultural differences in how the role of teaching is perceived, says Prof Dolton, a professor of economics at Sussex University and senior research fellow at the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics.The status of teachers in China was considerably above the next highest countries, which were Greece, Turkey and South Korea.The study, published by the Varkey GEMS Foundation, also included some results that might be thought of as unexpected.Finland, often seen as a model for recruiting high-quality, high-status teachers, was in the bottom half of the rankings, in 13th place. while Germany (16th) and Japan (17th) were ranked among the lowest countries.No countries from sub-Saharan Africa were included in the survey.The findings for the UK are based on a single national figure, rather than individual devolved administrations.They show a positive picture in public attitudes, with much higher levels of trust in the education system than in the US and most other European countries in the survey.There was a considerable level of public support for teachers - with a majority believing that they should be better paid and also underestimating the starting salary for teachers (currently about £22,000 in England outside London).More people thought that teachers' unions should have greater influence, compared with those who thought that they had too much influence.But a large majority were sympathetic to the principle of performance pay for teachers.Head teachers in the UK are particularly highly respected - more so than in any other of the countries surveyed.Former education minister, Lord Adonis, said the rankings showed the importance of the role of teaching in education reform."To recruit the brightest and best, teaching needs to be a high status occupation, and we need to understand better what contributes to the social standing of teachers," said Lord Adonis.Sunny Varkey, founder of the Varkey GEMS Foundation, said: "It is my ambition that teachers are treated with as much respect as doctors. Sadly, in many countries around the world teachers no longer retain the elevated status that we used to take for granted."Prof Dalton says the public status of teaching will influence standards of education."This informs who decides to become a teacher in each country, how they are respected and how they are financially rewarded. Ultimately, this affects the kind of job they do in teaching our children," he says.</body>

      <body>There were "a number of significant missed opportunities" to save a two-year-old boy from being beaten to death by his mother, a report has found.Rebecca Shuttleworth is serving a life sentence for murdering Keanu Williams.The toddler was found with 37 injuries including a fractured skull and torn abdomen, in Ward End, Birmingham.A serious case review said social care workers, the police and health professionals had "collectively failed to prevent Keanu's death".Shuttleworth, 25, was spoken to in prison by members of the serious case review team, telling them she was "surprised" social workers allowed her to keep custody of Keanu.The report states: "She expressed some surprise that Keanu had not been removed from her care when born."As Rebecca Shuttleworth is intending to appeal her sentence, although it is unclear if that is possible, she was not able to talk more about services which might have prevented Keanu's death."The report found different agencies had "become confused" as their strategy discussions had focused on the medical and forensic aspect of his injuries, the report said.It concluded that although Keanu's death on 9 January 2011 could not have been predicted, the agencies involved could have seen that he was "likely to suffer significant harm".The toddler should have been subject to a child protection plan "on at least two occasions" to address issues of neglect and physical harm, the report said.Jane Held, from the Birmingham Safeguarding Children Board, said Keanu died because there were "failings across every agency"."No-one walked in his shoes, staff were distracted by his mother's needs and by taking what she had told them at face value," she said.Ms Held said there had been "double-figure sackings" since Keanu's death, but added: "It is unfortunately an appalling situation."We are unequivocally sorry about the fact that unacceptable failures in 2011 and from the start of Keanu's life meant that we did not prevent his death and we failed to protect him, and that is something that I think all the board feel incredibly distressed about."Shuttleworth, of Cottingham Road, Manchester, was convicted of murder and four counts of child cruelty after a five-month trial. She was ordered to serve at least 18 years.Keanu was born in Torbay, Devon, and the report also found Torbay's Children's Services should have been aware of the risks even before his birth.It states: "There was enough information available to raise concerns that the unborn child was likely to be at risk of suffering significant harm."The authority also later received two anonymous reports of concerns about Rebecca Shuttleworth's care of Keanu which should have led to a reassessment of his safety.It concluded: "If a child protection plan had been in place, there would have been more robust arrangements to safeguard and promote Keanu's interests."Torbay Council's director of children's services, Richard Williams, said: "This is an extremely sad case and I would like to reassure everyone that we take the recommendations in this review very seriously and have acted upon them all."The serious case review makes eight recommendations:The report was told there has been an "end-to-end" review of the child protection system since Keanu's death, as it became clear there had been poor performance and a general lack of compliance with child protection procedures.In a comment that echoes those made after the death of starved four-year-old Daniel Pelka, the report says that Keanu had become "invisible".The serious case review into the death of Keanu Williams is the twenty-third to be published in Birmingham since the Local Safeguarding Board's inception in 2006.Peter Hay, from Birmingham City Council said admitted that its track record over recent years was "poor" and said the council was "unequivocally sorry"."Keanu's death is another tragic reminder of the consequences of failing children's services," he said.Edward Timpson, the government minister for children and families, said he has issued the council with a "final warning"."There is no quick fix, however I have been very clear with Birmingham that unless I see rapid improvement further action will follow," he added.Ofsted will return to Birmingham in autumn to determine what progress has been made, the minister said.The National Children's Bureau said it was "particularly worrying" that the review found that no conversations were held with Keanu to find out what he was feeling.Dr Hilary Emery, from the children's charity, said no child at risk should ever be "only seen and not heard"."We urgently need to review how best to support children within the child protection system - especially the very young ones - to ensure their voices are listened to at every opportunity," he said.West Midlands Police said their officers need to "challenge social workers and doctors" in future.Assistant Chief Constable Sharon Rowe said: "Of course it's a collective failure and we paid a key role in that."Ultimate accountability rests with Keanu's mother who was convicted of his murder - let's not forget that."Fay Baillie, director of nursing for NHS England in Birmingham, Solihull and the Black Country said: "I don't think children in Birmingham will ever be completely safe."We are always going to have deceptive mothers and families, however we can aim to make it as safe as possible by working together and improving education."</body>

      <body>An "inspirational" head teacher has been given a suspended prison sentence after admitting false accounting.Sir Alan Davies, 66, of Grants Close, the former head at Wembley's Copland School, in north London, pleaded guilty to creating a false paper trail on bonus payments and allowances.Davies, knighted for his services to education, resigned in 2009.At Southwark Crown Court, Judge Deborah Taylor said: "Your dishonest behaviour represents a fall from grace."Davies had pleaded guilty to six counts of false accounting after he admitted creating eight back-payment documents at the same time.The court heard that Davies paid himself, three staff members and two governors a total of £2.7m over several years through bonuses and salaries.Defending Davies, William Clegg QC, told the court he was an "inspirational" teacher and the offences needed to be taken in context.He said: "This is not a case of documents being forged to permit payments to be made that were unlawful and not agreed or made dishonestly. The position is the opposite."The payments were honestly made and honestly received. This is not somebody seeking to obtain money he was not entitled to."Prosecutor John Black QC added there was no dishonesty in the making or receiving of the payments.He said: "The dishonesty relates to false paper trails in order to legitimise these payments."The Crown say they [paperwork backing up payments] were all generated at the same time, after Sir Alan Davies had become aware of the impending or likely scrutiny, to give the impression the right procedure was being adhered to."Two counts of money laundering and conspiracy to defraud were dropped and conspiracy charges against five others were also dropped.Following the case Davies said: "In some instances I have felt that we were being tried by the media and there were a lot of misrepresentations made in the press, many of which were wholly unfounded."I do, however, have to accept that I did not have all the necessary paperwork in place and I made a profound error of judgment by backdating eight documents."In a statement, Brent Council, said: "The council will always act robustly and take action where allegations of financial irregularities have been made, to investigate and pursue legal action."In this case the guilty plea of false accounting vindicates the actions taken although we are disappointed the Crown Prosecution Service saw fit not to pursue the conspiracy to defraud."</body>

      <title>London top city in university table</title>
      <description>London has more universities ranked in the top 40 of a global table than any other city, although only one of the four makes the top 10.</description>

      <body>London has four universities in the top 40 of a global league table - more than any other individual city - although only one makes the top 10.US universities are still the most dominant international force in the Times Higher Education rankings.In top place, as last year, is the California Institute of Technology.In the UK there are concerns that, outside Oxford, Cambridge and London colleges, many major universities are slipping down international rankings.The so-called "golden triangle" of UK universities - Oxford, Cambridge and leading London institutions - is seen as a breakaway elite group, with these universities consolidating their international reputations.Imperial College, University College London, LSE and King's College London are all in the top 40. London has more universities in this league table than all of Japan, although only Imperial College makes the top 10.Phil Baty, editor of the rankings, says this is part of a global pattern of clustering of "excellent universities". Boston in the US has eight universities in the top 200, more than entire countries such as China, Switzerland and Australia.But there are warnings from the rankings organisation that prominent UK regional universities are falling away.Edinburgh, Manchester, Bristol, Sheffield, Warwick, Southampton, Nottingham and Newcastle are all seen as going downwards against international rivals.However the University of Leicester has risen sharply, which has been described as the "Richard III effect", after the high-profile research associated with the discovery of the body of the medieval king.This is described by the Times Higher Education rankings as showing that "power is draining from the UK regions".The top 20 still reflects the dominance of wealthy US university powerhouses, taking 15 of the top 20 places, with institutions such Harvard, MIT and Stanford in the leading pack behind the California Institute of Technology.The highest UK university is Oxford and the highest ranked continental European university is ETH Zurich in Switzerland, which is also the only non-English speaking university in the top 20."No university can rest on its laurels. No-one is guaranteed to retain a top-200 place when the US, Far East and others are investing in research so heavily," said Sir David Bell, vice-chancellor of Reading University, which has fallen from 176th to 194th place."There are some dramatic year-on-year rises and falls this year, so we should be careful not to read too much into a single set of figures.""It is no surprise that a small number of UK universities at the very top end will remain more stable, with others more likely to fluctuate."Sir Christopher Snowden, president of Universities UK, said the rankings showed that the UK had "the second-strongest university system in the world after the US"."What is clear, however, is that the UK must continue to invest in higher education if we are to maintain this global competitiveness."</body>

      <title>Disabled students 'need campus help'</title>
      <description>Disabled students are calling on universities across the UK to do more to help them take part fully in campus life.</description>

      <body>Disabled students are calling on UK universities to do more to help them take part fully in campus life.A study by the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign's Trailblazers suggests many students are unable to access areas such as lecture theatres and libraries.It says many institutions are failing to signpost key information such as details of accessible accommodation.The Equality Challenge Unit said many universities were working hard to be as accessible and welcoming as possible.The Disability Discrimination Act 2005 means it is illegal for education providers to treat disabled students less favourably because of their disability.A Trailblazers' survey of 100 UK universities found only half of those questioned confirmed that all teaching rooms, study rooms and libraries were fully accessible for students with mobility difficulties.The research found half of universities questioned said that not all inter-campus transport was accessible.Only a quarter of the universities surveyed had considered disabled students when planning freshers' week information and only a third had a society representing disabled students in the student union.Tanvi Vyas, manager of Trailblazers, said: "We continue to hear about how many universities are still missing the mark when it comes to helping people planning on entering higher education - and helping them to complete their time there."There are plenty of simple measures that universities can take. Providing inclusive freshers' guides, handy information on accessible transport and buildings and support networks can all make a huge difference to students adapting to campus life."We also need the government and local authorities to examine the issue of relocating care packages, which continues to be an enormous struggle for many students studying away from home."Chris Brill, senior policy adviser for the Equality Challenge Unit, which helps universities ensure equality for staff and students, said: "Trailblazers' audit highlights a number of small changes that would make big improvements for students."For example, making sure information is clearly signposted on websites, and ensuring the needs of disabled students are reflected in freshers' week programmes."Students' unions, often a conduit between universities and students, could also be encouraged to consider how they involve disabled students in the democratic structures."Through this, we may see an increase in societies representing disabled students, and better involvement of disabled people in higher education."</body>

      <title>Tories may cut under-25s' benefits</title>
      <description>David Cameron suggests that out-of-work benefits paid to people under the age of 25 could be cut so all of them are either "earning or learning".</description>

      <date>1380745590</date>
      <body>David Cameron has suggested benefits paid to people under the age of 25 could be cut in an effort to reduce long-term worklessness.In his speech to the Conservative conference, the prime minister promised to "nag and push and guide" young people away from a life on the dole.It was later confirmed that the government is reviewing policies for 16 to 25-year-olds.But Labour accused the Conservatives of a "desperate" lack of ideas.In his speech, Mr Cameron promised to create a "land of opportunity" by boosting business and reducing reliance on benefits.He also vowed to improve the education system and told party activists that there was still much work to do to fix the economic "mess" left by Labour.The latest figures from the Department of Work and Pensions showed 1.09 million people between the ages of 16 and 24 were not in work, education or training.The problem has proved stubbornly hard to tackle across Europe, with rates of youth unemployment soaring above 50% in Spain.Mr Cameron argued that action was needed in the UK, saying: "There are still over a million young people not in education, employment, or training."Today it is still possible to leave school, sign on, find a flat, start claiming housing benefit and opt for a life on benefits. It's time for bold action here."He promised the Conservatives would consider, as they write their manifesto for the 2015 general election, whether "that option should really exist at all".A Conservative source has told the BBC the manifesto will definitely contain a commitment to end the automatic entitlement to housing benefit for the under-25s, as suggested previously by Mr Cameron.In his speech, the prime minister criticised reliance on benefits, saying: "Instead we should give young people a clear, positive choice: Go to school. Go to college. Do an apprenticeship. Get a job."But just choose the dole? We've got to offer them something better than that."He added: "And let no one paint ideas like this as callous. Think about it: with your children, would you dream of just leaving them to their own devices, not getting a job, not training, nothing?"No - you'd nag and push and guide and do anything to get them on their way… and so must we. So this is what we want to see: everyone under 25 - earning or learning."During the week-long conference in Manchester, the Conservatives have announced plans to make the long-term unemployed undertake work placements if they want to continue receiving benefits.Mr Cameron did not set out any specific changes regarding under-25s during his 50-minute speech, but Education Secretary Michael Gove offered more detail when questioned on BBC Radio 4's The World at One.He announced that Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood was already reviewing the policies in place. He is expected to report his findings by the end of the year.Mr Gove said: "It is always going to be the case that there are some people for whom you need not so much a nudge as a dunt (a firm blow or stroke) towards the workplace."It's important also that we all recognise that welfare is there explicitly to help those people through hard times that it shouldn't become habituated."He said he would not pre-empt the policy review, adding: "I don't think any of us would want to take away any form of necessary support to young or old vulnerable people."However, unions warned that any cut in benefits would hurt the worst-off.TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: "Given the government's awful track record of helping young people find jobs, the prime minister's threat to ban the dole for under-25s will simply push hundreds of thousands of young people, including those with young families, even deeper into poverty."Young people suffered most in the recession. Today the prime minister has pledged that they will suffer most during the recovery too."The general secretary of the University and College Union, Sally Hunt, said: "What we need is a real plan at local and national level which provides sustainable and secure employment opportunities for young people and access to education which is useful and mind-broadening."Cheap headlines about lazy youngsters or cutting their benefits are no substitute for a strategy which is on the side of young people and allows them to realise their potential."A Labour spokesperson said: "This is an empty and a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that there was absolutely nothing in David Cameron's speech to deal with the cost-of-living crisis facing families."If the Conservatives really wanted to get young people off benefits, they'd be backing Labour's youth jobs guarantee, giving young people who've been out of work for over a year a job they must take or lose benefits."</body>

      <title>Private schools 'only share crumbs'</title>
      <description>Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw says private schools need to make greater efforts to support their state school neighbours</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24367150</url>
      <date>1380792922</date>
      <body>Private schools have been accused of failing to support their local state schools, in a "call to arms" from Ofsted chief, Sir Michael Wilshaw.He told the head teachers of leading independent schools that they should sponsor academies, rather than only offer "crumbs off your table".There was a frosty reception from some of the heads, who accused Sir Michael of creating a false impression.But he told them: "Not enough of you are willingly going the extra mile."Sir Michael's call for greater involvement between state and independent schools was delivered at the annual conference of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in London.The delegates, representing some of the most prestigious private schools, were challenged to make greater efforts to use their resources and expertise to support their neighbouring state schools.Sir Michael argued that many of the links between private and state schools were only "thin stuff", such as occasionally making a playing field available.He called for a more sustained connection, such as sponsoring an academy, telling the head teachers that the private and state sectors should not be seen as rivals but as sharing a joint moral project to educate.As state schools become increasingly more autonomous, Sir Michael said, they could learn much from the long experience of independent schools at running their own affairs.He told the private school heads that they would not diminish their own success or academic advantage by supporting other local schools."Education should not be a scarce resource hoarded by those lucky enough to possess it. Education is meant to be shared. Its power does not decrease with the giving. It is an economic and social good," said Sir Michael.But the criticism prompted an angry response from some delegates, who claimed that Sir Michael was misrepresenting their commitment to collaborating with state schools.They also challenged the idea that sponsoring an academy should be the key measure of their intentions.Head teachers also told Sir Michael that their attempts to engage with local state schools had been rejected, because of political hostility to the independent sector.However Anthony Seldon, master of Wellington College, spoke in support of Sir Michael's emphasis on sponsoring academies.He told fellow head teachers that there was more to be gained by both private and state schools from such a sustained and structured relationship.Sir Michael also took issue with the idea that inner city head teachers were focusing too much on exam results, rather than a more holistic approach.He said their priority must be helping disadvantaged children to academic success."These heads in inner city London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds haven't got the time to worry whether their children are climbing trees proficiently," said Sir Michael."These heads know that gaining academic qualifications is the one route out of poverty and disadvantage."They would find it deeply insulting to believe that some in this room felt that they don't worry sufficiently about a balanced education for their students," he said.In response, the HMC's general secretary, William Richardson, said: "We look forward to continuing our highly varied work with colleagues in maintained schools, in providing Sir Michael with illuminating examples and in assuring him that such work is informed by educational values that are both thorough-going and broadly-based."Sir Michael's comments were criticised by the leader of another independent schools' body, who said 90% of private schools were working with state schools.Matthew Burgess, general secretary of the Independent Schools Council, said: "Once again, Sir Michael Wilshaw shows his lack of understanding at just how much work independent schools are already doing in collaboration with their state sector colleagues."As a sector, we can be proud of the enormous amount of time and energy devoted by independent school teachers and leaders in working for the benefit of all children."</body>

      <title>Call to delay GCSE entry changes</title>
      <description>Michael Gove is asked to delay last-minute exam system changes aimed at stopping schools in England "gaming" the league tables.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24366724</url>
      <date>1380722998</date>
      <body>Education Secretary Michael Gove has been asked to delay mid-course changes aimed at stopping schools from entering pupils for GCSEs before they are ready.The Independent Academies Association head Nick Weller said stopping GCSE retakes from counting in England's league tables could backfire on pupils.It is claimed that schools enter pupils early so they can bank a key C-grade, only taking exams again if they fail.The government says heads will still be able to enter students for GCSEs early.But it argues that if pupils are entered for exams at the expected time - at the end of a two-year course - they are more likely to do better.Mr Weller, who is chairman of the main body representing state-funded but privately run schools known as academies, said in a letter to Mr Gove that he shared the secretary of state's concern about multiple entries for the same qualification and other aspects of league table "game-playing".But he was worried about "damage being done to students' prospects this year" because the changes were effective almost immediately - affecting the league tables based on next summer's GCSE results.He appealed to Mr Gove to delay the proposed changes so that current GCSE students could continue their courses as planned."I am not sure that the department has fully understood the unintended consequences of previous mid-course changes in relation to the GCSE qualification, and I fear that these latest revisions, if they are as reported, will further undermine confidence in the system," he said.He also questioned whether the Department for Education could clearly distinguish between "gaming" the league tables and doing what was best for students."Many schools will now cancel early entries, despite the fact that students themselves might be better off sitting a paper this winter with the chance to retake if necessary in the summer," he said.He added that academy leaders were "dismayed at the confusion and loss of confidence in the GCSE examination since the summer of 2012".This follows the changes to grade boundaries to GCSE English courses midway through the year, which left pupils with the same marks on different grades. It was the subject of a judicial review against Ofqual and some exam boards by teaching unions, which was not upheld.Mr Weller said: "Sensible reform in the pursuit of rigour should be associated with greater clarity, consistency and logic, not less."And he urged the secretary of state to consult properly with professionals he trusted on any further revisions to the exams system.A Department for Education spokesman has said: "We recognise that early entry can be used effectively in certain cases and schools will continue to be able to enter pupils early for examinations where they feel it is appropriate."However, schools should definitely not be entering children for exams before they are ready. It is not good for pupils to be put in early in a school's hope they can 'bank' a C - it is far better that children study the subject fully and take it when they are ready."A document on its website said the changes were being made to address "the significant increase" in early entry in recent years.The education secretary has previously described early entry as a "damaging trend that is harming the interests of many pupils", adding that there is evidence that "candidates who enter early perform worse overall than those who do not, even after resits are taken into account".The DfE paper continues: "It seems likely that candidates are being entered before they are ready, and 'banking' a C grade where their performance at Key Stage 2 [end of primary school] would suggest that if they had continued to study the subject and taken the GCSE at the end of year 11 they could have achieved a top grade.""If schools decide they wish to withdraw students from November examinations, they should contact their exam board."If schools are confident that pupils will achieve well even when entered early and that early entry is therefore in the interests of the pupil, they should not need to make any changes to entry plans. Any pupil who does enter early from this point on will still be able to retake if they receive a disappointing result."That result will not count towards the performance tables for their school, even if it is an improvement on their earlier entry, but pupils will still be able to use their best result to support applications to further and higher education, or for employment."It comes as head teachers are writing to parents also expressing concern about the changes.A joint letter from the National Association of Head Teachers and the Association of School and College leaders says: "Without any notice and with immediate effect, the government has limited schools' ability to enter students early for GCSEs - after we had already planned entries for the year. Early entry can serve many good purposes, including vital 'live' preparation for later exams."It seems that barely a term goes by without another sudden change to GCSE examinations. Worst of all, these changes are often made in the middle of students' courses of study, making it impossible to plan properly or to focus on learning rather than constant administrative change. They changed grade boundaries between exam sittings; they dropped the vital skills of speaking and listening from English mid-course; and now this latest announcement."These changes are often timed to coincide with party conferences or similar events, leading us to fear that students and schools are just collateral damage in party political squabbles."The move, announced last weekend, is one of a number steps brought in aimed at preventing schools from engaging in league table "tricks" that some say may harm pupils' prospects.</body>

      <title>Muslim free school closes doors</title>
      <description>A Muslim free school accused of imposing strict Islamic practices closes after an inspection by Ofsted, but its interim head insists it is temporary.</description>

      <body>A Muslim free school accused of imposing strict Islamic practices, such as segregated classrooms, has closed following an inspection by Ofsted.The BBC understands Ofsted's findings were so damning that the acting head of Al-Madinah, in Derby, had little choice but to shut it down immediately.The school said the move was due to a "health and safety issue" but expected it to reopen in the "very near future".Ofsted said it could not disclose its concerns until the inspection ended.It added it had "made some findings and shared them with the principal". The second day of the inspection is taking place later.In a statement on the school's website titled "short term closure", interim principal Stuart Wilson said: "Owing to a health and safety issue, I have taken the decision to close the school... until I am confident that all children are safe on site."As parents, you will be informed directly, and on the website, when you are able to send your children back to school..."Assuring you that we have your children's best interests at heart."In a series of newspaper reports unnamed former staff members of Al-Madinah, which opened as a free school in September last year, had alleged that girls were forced to sit at the back of the classroom.Unnamed female staff members have also claimed they were forced to conform to a strict dress code including wearing a head scarf or hijab - whether or not they were Muslim.When it opened Al-Madinah claimed to be the first Muslim ethos, all-through [reception, primary and secondary] free school in the country.The school's first head teacher, Andrew Cutts-Mckay, left the school after less than a year in the job.Last week, the interim principal told the BBC that he had not received any complaints from colleagues regarding the dress code and that pupils were not being segregated, with girls and boys being treated equally.Ofsted is not the only organisation with concerns about Al-Madinah.The Education Funding Agency - from which the school gets its public funding - is investigating alleged financial irregularities.In a statement, the Department for Education said it was already investigating the school before the allegations became public.It said: ''We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection. We are waiting for Ofsted's final report and considering all legal options."The school's closure is likely to be embarrassing for Education Secretary Michael Gove, who introduced free schools in 2010 in an effort to raise standards in education.Free schools are state funded but operate outside local education authority control and can be set up by parents and community groups in England.</body>

      <body>Teaching Shakespeare with a hip-hop soundtrack is patronising, evil and "viciously racist" to black pupils, the Tory Party conference has been told.Youth mentor and writer Lindsay Johns, a guest speaker invited by Education Secretary Michael Gove, said teachers were "hell-bent on making everything cool or hip".They should "stop genuflecting at the altar of youth", he said."Hamlet doesn't need a hip-hop sound track for young people to enjoy it."Mr Johns added: "It's been doing just fine for the last 400 years.""It's not only incredibly patronising, but also viciously racist to think that black and brown kids in the inner cities will only 'get Shakespeare' if it's set to a hip-hop beat and presented in three-minute, MTV-Base-style chunks."It is positively evil to deny inner city kids access to the manifold joys of hearing their national poet's true voice, in essence their birthright, simply because of a culture of low expectations."Mr Johns said he was tired of "vacuous PC [politically correct] educationalists who took great offence at Mr Gove's drive for a national curriculum more focused on English literary classics and the history of Britain.He said: "Young people need more not fewer dead white men - by dead white men I mean the Western literary canon."You can of course be fiercely proud of your Jamaican, Ghanaian or black British roots and ardently love Horace, Boccaccio and Milton."The two are in no way mutually exclusive and they certainly don't make you any less black or less brown by reading them."The novels of Jane Austen and Charles Dickens were just as relevant to all young people no matter what colour or creed, he said, adding that it was "positively nefarious" to deny access to them.Mr Johns also attacked "bling culture" and "ghetto grammar", which he said were holding some youngsters back and making them sound like they had had "a frontal lobotomy""Our aim is for the young people to confound, not conform to stereotypes," he said.Mr Johns, who himself studied French and Italian at Oxford, also said a portrayal of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge as institutionally racist was "actually putting off ferociously bright, black, brown, and white, working-class kids from applying"."Maybe, just maybe, if you didn't keep on discouraging them from applying in the first place with your duplicitous horror stories of how terrible life is there, then levels of representation would actually get better," he said.</body>

      <title>Harvard plans to boldly go with 'Spocs'</title>
      <description>Harvard develops the next big thing for online learning. Is this the real deal?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24166247</url>
      <date>1380062273</date>
      <body>Keep up, keep up. If you've only just caught on to the concept of online university courses called Moocs, then you're in danger of falling behind again.Harvard, one of the world's most influential universities, is moving on to Spocs - which stands for small private online courses. Nothing to do with Star Trek and sombre Vulcans, but plenty to do with ambitions "to boldly go".And could these be the real deal? The academic chairing Harvard's online experiments says we are already "post-Mooc".Moocs - massive open online courses - have been something of a hurricane in universities, making a lot of noise and promising to rip everything up.Pioneered by some of the most prestigious US universities, they have been re-packaging course units into online lessons and making them available to anyone with an internet connection.But it's still not clear whether this is a passing storm or something that will fundamentally change how higher education is delivered.Last week the UK joined the fray, with more than 20 universities launching an online platform called FutureLearn, which will challenge the dominant players on the east and west US coasts.The biggest success for online courses and their greatest problem are the same - the huge numbers attracted.It demonstrates the scale of the unmet demand for higher education, but at the same time it's not clear how tens of thousands of students on a course could ever satisfactorily be taught, assessed and accredited. Most of these signs-up will sign off without completing courses.At Harvard, more people have signed up for Moocs in a single year than have attended the university in its entire 377-year history. That's a great success story in opening up education, but what do you do with all those hungry minds?Enter the Spoc. And the clue is in the "small, private" part of the name. These courses are still free and delivered through the internet, but access is restricted to much smaller numbers, tens or hundreds, rather than tens of thousands.It means a selection process for applicants and the capacity for a more customised experience. Looking further down the track, it wouldn't be difficult to imagine fees and course credits.Harvard and University of California, Berkeley, part of the edX online alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are among the universities beginning to experiment with this more refined model.Next week a popular and highly topical course in US national security strategy will begin at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Alongside the campus students in Cambridge, Massachusetts, there will be a parallel Spoc version with a limit of about 500 online students.Students wanting to get into this online classroom have to submit a written assignment about the US government's response to the conflict in Syria, along with details of their academic credentials.Even though this online course won't have a formal academic credit at the end, it's going to require eight hours of work a week and a capacity to tackle questions about "Iran's nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria's civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information".These Spoc students might include Harvard students who couldn't get into the campus course, alongside those who might be studying from home or at work.Harvard isn't abandoning Moocs, but rather like Russian dolls sitting inside each other, a single course might now be delivered to a large open Mooc audience, to a much smaller number of Spoc students and then down to an even smaller number enrolled at the bricks-and-mortar campus.It's taking the limited and expensive resource of a Harvard course and amplifying it for widening rings of audiences.Prof Robert Lue chairs the committee of academics that runs Harvard's online experiments, under the banner of HarvardX.He describes the current online learning experiments as a "remarkable moment of possibility".And he sees the move towards more flexible and refined formats such as Spocs as an "almost inevitable evolution"."The Mooc represents just the first version of what we can do with online education," says Prof Lue. And this first version has now been overtaken. "We're already in a post-Mooc era.""What has become very clear is that the engagement you get from a very large group with a wide-ranging set of priorities can be radically different from what you get from a more focused group," says Prof Lue.It also paves the way to tackling one of the biggest problems for Moocs. How can they provide formally-recognised qualifications?The smaller class size will allow "much more rigorous assessment and greater validation of identity and that will be more closely tied to what kind of certification might be possible," he says."It's safe to say that in the quite near term there will be announcements of experiments in this area."There are voices of caution about over-hyped expectations for online learning.A report published last week by the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggested there remained many uncertainties over Moocs.The lack of a clear business model was described as a "burning issue".The edX project is in the fortunate position of being given $60m by Harvard and MIT, but few universities have the resources to give away so much expensively-produced content and staff time.Prof Lue suggests that the really tough questions raised by Moocs are not only about online learning but about what it means for the rest of the traditional campus."What is it that a student gets out of being on campus and being in the classroom?"If students on campus prefer learning online, what does it mean for the funding model for universities? What happens if a recorded online lecture is preferable to a mediocre live talk? How do universities show their "added value"?Prof Lue argues that the significance of Spocs is that online learning is now moving beyond trying to replicate classroom courses and is trying to produce something that is more flexible and more effective.Universities that ignore such developments, or think that Moocs can just be showreels for conventional courses, are putting themselves at risk, he suggests."The really big questions for university are about what students get from the classroom, what works, what could be done better.""Institutions that sit back and watch, they may be in trouble. One can imagine a large institution where there isn't much difference between online and classroom - and then you'd be silly not to realise there's a problem."</body>

      <title>UK enters online university race</title>
      <description>The UK's biggest online university project is being launched, with a partnership of more than 20 universities offering free courses.</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest online university project has been launched, with more than 20 universities offering free courses.Students will be able to follow courses on mobile phones as well as computers.The UK's project, called FutureLearn, sees UK universities entering the global market in so-called Moocs - massive open online courses.It could "revolutionise conventional models of formal education", says universities minister David Willetts.Mr Willetts, speaking at the British Library, said that the expansion of access to higher education was no longer necessarily about "bricks and mortar".He said that the FutureLearn partnership would help to serve the unmet demand for university courses, particularly overseas.The launch of FutureLearn sees 21 UK universities, plus Trinity College Dublin and Monash University in Australia, offering courses that are taught and assessed on the internet.The UK universities include Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham, Warwick, Bristol, Reading, Southampton and the Open University, which has headed the project.The British Library, British Museum and British Council will make material available to students.There are 20 short courses announced, with eight starting this year.In this experimental phase, students taking these courses will carry out multiple choice questions, without any formal qualifications.But universities are hoping that many people will be attracted by the chance to follow university-level courses without any travel or cost and at a time that suits them.It will also provide taster courses for youngsters considering their university options.When the University of Edinburgh offered Moocs through a US network it had more than 300,000 students signing up. The University of London international programme had more than 200,000 registrations.FutureLearn will see the UK taking a much bigger step into the rapidly expanding online university market - with claims that higher education is now facing its own online revolution.They are anticipating that each Mooc course will attract 20,000 students.Universities also see the project as a way of recruiting students to degree courses. Martin Bean, vice chancellor of the Open University, described it as a "digital storefront".But Mr Bean says he expects some universities to begin thinking about how to offer formal credits for Moocs.Reading University is going to offer a Mooc course about basic computer programming."Offering free taster courses online is a no-brainer," says David Bell, the university's vice-chancellor."Universities shouldn't be afraid to open up teaching and research, either in the UK or beyond. Learning never stops and as the economy's demand for higher skills rises, universities should be in the vanguard when it comes to providing new opportunities."Making courses accessible online, on mobiles and tablets means that people can fit their studying around their lives, rather than their lives around study."Southampton University is offering a course in web science, Leicester University's course looks at England at the time of Richard III and the University of Warwick has a psychology course.FutureLearn's chief executive Simon Nelson says it will offer a "fresh approach" with all its courses designed to work across all kinds of online platforms, so that a student could begin a course on a laptop at home and then continue on a mobile phone while commuting.He also promises a less isolated experience for students learning at home. He says that it can be a "solitary experience", but that FutureLearn will try to create a supportive online community, with "very strong social architecture".This will allow students to discuss their courses and ask questions, using social networking-style comment pages alongside the lesson content.This consortium will also draw upon the experience in distance learning of the Open University."Time and again we have seen the disruptive impact the internet can have on industries - driving innovation and enhancing the customer experience. I have no doubt Moocs will do the same for education," says Mr Bean.There were also suggestions from the Department for Education last week that Moocs could be used for vocational courses for students in further education colleges and sixth forms in England.Moocs have already had a major impact in the US, launching last year and spearheaded by alliances of top institutions, including Harvard, MIT and Stanford.Coursera, set up by Stanford academics in California and backed by venture capital, has signed up more than four million students in its first 18 months for courses provided by more than 80 universities.These projects have revealed a high level of demand for courses, but also exposed the difficulty in retaining students, with very high levels of drop-out rates.It has sparked a debate about the cost of higher education and what students are paying for when so much information and so many high-quality university materials are available online.These US online courses have begun to develop ways of giving students formal credits, such as students paying to take invigilated exams.Among the Mooc pioneers has been the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which set up the edX online platform with Harvard.On Tuesday, MIT announced a series of new online courses which will have an identity verification system using webcams and with plans for certification for courses.But there have also been questions asked about the long-term financial viability of online university courses.Last week, William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, challenged whether many universities could afford to invest in the type of free online courses offered by wealthy institutions such as Harvard and MIT.He suggested that online courses might work better as part of a "blended" course, where students spend some time together in the classroom as well as studying online.Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said that online universities represented an overdue technological advance."The models of higher education that marched triumphantly across the globe in the second half of the 20th Century require radical and urgent transformation. My fear is that the nature of change is incremental and the pace of change too slow."The establishment of FutureLearn represents an important step in realising this change and seizing the opportunities technology offers in creating a broader, deeper and more exciting education system."Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: "I encourage all our institutions to explore the opportunities offered by new modes of technology, such as Moocs. This will keep the UK ahead in the global race to deliver education in worldwide markets."</body>

      <title>Gordon Brown's Syrian refugee school plan</title>
      <description>Syria's refugee crisis is also threatening to become a long-term education disaster.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24034422</url>

      <body>Syria's refugee crisis is threatening to become a long-term education disaster. There will soon be 500,000 refugee children in Lebanon, with few having access to school. But Gordon Brown, former UK prime minister and UN special envoy for global education, says that lessons could be in place in weeks."A few days ago, global education campaigner Malala Yousafzai was able to speak over Skype to Zahra and Om Kolhtoum Katou, teenage Syrian twins exiled in Baalbeck in East Lebanon.As they talked, the three girls realised that they shared something in common. All three are victims of violence that threatened to destroy their youth and their future, and all three cannot do what most other girls and boys do every morning: leave the home in which they grew up and go to school.Now there is a plan that could help the biggest single group of Syrian child refugees - 300,000 of those exiled to Lebanon - which could see them in school and being fed within weeks.It has been prepared by Kevin Watkins of the Overseas Development Institute for the charity, A World at School, which campaigns to get an education for the millions of children without access to school.But this plan can only be put into practice - and this seems unlikely today - if the international community, which is financing just 2% of schooling needs in humanitarian crises, offers an additional $500m (£319m).The plan involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double or even triple shift system; hiring Syrian refugees as teachers in Arabic in community colleges; providing school meals to tackle hunger as we tackle illiteracy.This strategy is also rooted in the realistic presumption that the plight of the Syrian children is more than a short-term emergency: their exile could last years. It has the active support of the Lebanese government, but it is an open question as to whether the world community will put up the funds.Children are always the most neglected and forgotten victims of conflict. Already deprived of food and shelter, boys and girls are also denied their right to education, condemned to forfeit a childhood that, once lost, can never be re-run or re-lived.The one million Syrian children, who make up half of that country's refugees, are simply the most recent victims of this monumental gap in our global system. They are among 28 million children worldwide now being denied their right to schooling in conflict zones and under broken-down regimes.Soon small, unstable Lebanon will have absorbed 500,000 Syrian boys and girls. Already in just a few months, the refugees have grown in number to an astonishing 25% of Lebanon's child population.But today, and for the foreseeable future, there are school places for only a small fraction of them - just 30,000. If they suffer the typical exile of children in conflict they could spend 10 years in camps and without schooling.The traumas engulfing Syrian children underscores an enduring global failure. One hundred years ago, through support for the Red Cross, the world decided it would meet people's basic health needs, even in theatres of war.Forty years ago Médecins Sans Frontières established that healthcare should be available across the most dangerous and violent of war zones.Today, the concept of "Education Without Borders" still remains an unfamiliar idea, a concept yet to be built into our system of humanitarian relief.Yet the cost of inaction for young people deprived of an education, destroyed by anger, restlessness, and desperation and sentenced to tents and camps often for years, will haunt us for generations.Because these millions of young unemployed will become the adult unemployable, and many will graduate not into jobs but into violence.On 23 September in New York, organisations that have for years fought valiantly to deliver education in emergencies will build on pioneering work by UNICEF, UNHCR, UN Refugees and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) to bring to life the Education Without Borders initiative for Lebanon's Syrian refugees.In New York, young people from conflict zones around the world, joined by Malala and backed up by a petition presented to the UN Secretary General, will lead an appeal for funds.It will show that while we cannot do everything we can do something, that hope can survive even amid horror and that good can yet triumph over the worst evils, even in the most troubled and desperate parts of the world."</body>

      <title>Zombie apocalypse: The future of universities?</title>
      <description>A US university is going to create an online course based on the TV drama the Walking Dead.</description>

      <body>Can zombies be the stuff of serious academic study? And could they be shuffling towards a new type of future for higher education?In what is being claimed as the biggest ever experiment in "edutainment", a US television company is forming a partnership with a top-ranking Californian university to produce online courses linked to a hit TV show.This blurring of the digital boundaries between academic study and the entertainment industry will see a course being launched next month based on the post-apocalypse drama series the Walking Dead.Television shows might have spin-off video games or merchandising, but this drama about surviving disaster and social collapse is now going to have its own university course.Academics from the University of California, Irvine, who are setting up the online courses, say these will be academically rigorous and tackle serious scientific issues, related to events in the show.A physicist will look at the "science behind decay"; the public health department will use the series to study questions such as "What can we learn from past epidemics?" and maths lecturers will show how "post-calculus maths can be used to model population and epidemic dynamics".Showbiz lessonsThe show is made by AMC, which also produced cult series such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Killing, and AMC vice-president Theresa Beyer says this showbiz-academic partnership will create a "legitimate educational experience".She says AMC will be the "first entertainment group to make the foray into the online education arena" and wants the course to "drive a deep, sustained connection with the show".The TV series has an audience of 10 million and student numbers for the online course are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands. If this experiment proves successful, the online platform provider, Instructure, suggests there could be further TV show and university hybrids.It's not difficult to imagine an advertising course being built around a series such as Mad Men, suggests Josh Coates, Instructure's chief executive.This partnership also marks another development in the rapidly-expanding world of MOOCs - the massive open online courses - an acronym sufficiently established to have made it into the Oxford online dictionary last week.Millions of students have signed up for online courses in the past year, suggesting the scale of demand for higher education.And millions of students have failed to complete those courses suggesting the scale of the challenge of online learning.Dumbing down?This eight-module course will begin in mid-October and will be accessible without charge to anyone with an internet connection.There will be online tests and discussion groups, but students taking the course will not get any formal qualifications or credits towards a degree, so it's going to be for students who want to follow the course in their own time.But isn't there a risk of dumbing down? The University of California, Irvine, has Nobel prize-winning researchers, it contributes $4.3bn (£2.77bn; 3.3bn euro) to the local economy, does it want to have zombies on its prospectus?"When we entered this partnership it was really important to make each of the modules as academically strong as they would be in our classes at UC Irvine," says Melissa Loble, associate dean of distance learning at the university."The lessons will be academically rigorous and rich and still have connections to the show."Joanne Christopherson, social science lecturer, says that it's taking another step forward from how universities already use contemporary media examples."In all of my classes I have to bring in current issues to keep it interesting. Not just because they're young adults coming out of high school, but because it's important to make these classic theories relevant to them. What we're doing is using this series as an example through the whole course."Apocalypse studiesJosh Coates, head of Instructure, which provides the Canvas online platform, says it will present science and social science issues, using the hook of a TV show."This is real curriculum about infectious diseases, public health, nutrition, psychology and sociology. The fact that the context is this fictional world of an apocalypse is incidental.""This is very topical. We have terrorist attacks, we have Katrina, Fukushima, all these things happen in our world today, which create small vignettes of a local apocalypse. This is an opportunity to educate people about the science of these disasters."Mr Coates says a significant part of this experiment will be to see if it can crack one of the biggest weaknesses of MOOCs, the high drop-out rate. Will the pulling power of television keep people switched on to learning?"Can we get more students through because it's linked to a TV show they really like?" he says.He describes the link between the university and the TV industry as the "cross-pollination" that comes with the internet."The internet tears down walls of tradition and the isolation of different areas of research and interest," he says.Personal learningFor the university, it's a shop window putting their brand in front of a global audience. It also allows them to refine the process of putting courses online."The first MOOCs had great videos and great quizzes, but didn't help students really interact with one another," says Melissa Loble."The next step for MOOCs is to figure how to make them personal without it being overwhelming for the institution trying to deliver that."These are the type of practical questions that come with the huge numbers of online students.Dr Christopherson says that scale of the demand for MOOCs has been a "wake-up call" for universities.But it remains a challenge to provide an online structure that can allow so many students to follow a course without feeling anonymous and disconnected.William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, says there also remains a longer term question about the funding model for MOOCs.And he suggests that universities which have begun to invest in them might become wary at the extent of the drop-out rate.They might work better as part of a "blended" course, where there is a taught, classroom element as well as online study, he says.Spoiler alertAlan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, also has reservations about the value of TV-related online courses.Without formal assessment and personal content, he says it remains to be seen how this delivers more than a good television documentary."The student must be able to sift the evidence."For genuine learning, personal contact really matters," he says.Prof Smithers says such links with a popular TV show might work as a way of attracting students, but the academic element needs to outweigh the entertainment.But don't expect the march of the MOOCs to stop any time soon. And Mr Coates says he wants people to look back at the Walking Dead course as a watershed when education and entertainment connected.With the online course available globally and when different series are being shown at different stages in different countries, this could also be the first university course that has to come with its own spoiler alert.</body>

      <body>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most likely place to have studied.The Times Higher Education magazine ranked the universities attended by chief executive officers of Fortune Global 500 companies.There are four US universities in the top 10, with three from France, two from Japan and one from South Korea.The highest ranked UK university is Oxford in 21st place.This league table, described as the Alma Mater Index, shows which universities around the world taught the bosses of some of the world's biggest companies.One in 20 had a degree from a single institution, Harvard.This included Margaret C Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Jeffrey R Immelt of General Electric and Vittorio Colao of Vodafone.This academic powerhouse regularly appears at the top of university league tables, including the rich list, with an endowment worth $31bn (£20bn' 23.5bn euro).But the top 10 for producing business leaders does not contain all the usual names that appear at the top of university rankings.Oxford and Cambridge are absent, but the University of Pennsylvania in the US and Keio University in Japan are included, along with three French universities, headed by the Ecole Polytechnique.It means that in this top 10 cradles of global CEOs, there are two institutions from Paris, two from the Boston area and two from Tokyo.Across the top 100, universities from the US dominate, followed by universities in China, Japan, France and Germany. There are more CEOs who went to university in Asia than in Europe.In terms of national comparisons, UK universities produced the sixth highest number of global chief executives, with Oxford in 21st place and Cambridge in 45th place.But even though Harvard might have taught the biggest number of bosses from the top 500 companies, it was not attended by any of the heads of the biggest 10 companies, who were from a more diverse range of universities.Royal Dutch Shell is headed by a graduate of Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Wal-Mart is headed by a student of Georgia Tech and Exxon Mobil has a chief executive from the University of Texas, Austin.Three of the leaders of these biggest companies went to university in China and the head of Volkswagen went to university in Stuttgart.</body>

      <title>The scientists who escaped the Nazis</title>
      <description>A first-hand memory of the scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23261289</url>
      <date>1374016582</date>
      <body>When Gustav Born's family were advised in early 1933 that it was time to leave Nazi-controlled Germany, it was from a good authority.The advice was from Albert Einstein, who told his friend and fellow scientist Max Born to "leave immediately" with his family while they were still able to travel.They packed their bags and headed across the border, first to Italy and then to England, where they arrived as part of what must have been the best-qualified refugee trail in history.Gustav Born was 11 at the time, living in Gottingen, Lower Saxony, where his father, Max, was director of one of the world's leading centres for physics research.The Borns were Jewish, and when Hitler took power, Max Born and his Jewish colleagues were prevented from working at the university. This pioneering, elite group of theoretical scientists were turned into asylum seekers.Gustav now lives in London, a few days short of his 92nd birthday, and he looks back with great clarity on the remarkable flight of these German academics. The conversation is like opening a 1930s Mitteleuropa time capsule.He is now one of the last living links to these academic refugees, who between them went on to win 16 Nobel prizes - his father received the award for his work in quantum mechanics.Did these scientists realise the extent of the threat from the Nazis?"Yes, I think my father probably did. Among his Jewish colleagues, some did, but some didn't believe for some time. But the scale of what the Nazis were doing became apparent in the first three to six months."Gustav remembers that the ugly mood of anti-Semitism had even reached the playground, with some children not allowed to play with him.There were also positive examples of human nature, such as the academics who stood by their Jewish colleagues. The Nobel prize winner Max von Laue showed great support, says Gustav.The physicist Max Planck went to see Hitler in person to challenge the exclusion of Jewish scientists, but Hitler "foamed at the mouth and wouldn't let him talk any more".It was still tough to leave. Max Born had to give up running an institute, his wife was heartbroken at the prospect of emigrating."They hated to be uprooted in this crude and dangerous way."When the Borns left, they were not under any illusions that this would be a temporary departure. "Nazification" was happening rapidly and there were political murders."My parents were pretty sure this was a one-way journey."While the Borns were watching the swastikas appearing in Gottingen, a much more tweedily humanitarian response was being marshalled by university staff in Britain.The economist William Beveridge had set up the Academic Assistance Council, with the aim of rescuing Jewish and politically vulnerable academics.It was an organisation that would help 1,500 academics escape Germany and continue their research work in safety in Britain.It was quickly backed by academics whose names now read like a row of text books - J B S Haldane, John Maynard Keynes, Ernest Rutherford, G M Trevelyan and the poet A E Housman.Albert Einstein supported this high-brow escape committee with a highly-charged speech in the Albert Hall in London in October 1933.He set out an epic defence of Western liberal values of "tolerance and justice" against the "temptations of hatred and oppression", at a time of deepening extremism and economic and political turmoil."It is in times of economic distress such as we experience everywhere today, one sees very clearly the strength of the moral forces that live in a people."He told his audience that it was "the liberty of the individual that has brought us every advance of knowledge and invention - liberty without which life to a self-respecting man is not worth living".The council launched its "rescue operation", arranging for academics to come to Britain and providing practical support in the form of grants, accommodation and most importantly jobs.This was a remarkably talented group being cast aside by the Nazis. As well as the trawl of Nobel prizes, there were 18 future knighthoods and over 100 fellows of the Royal Society or British Academy.According to the Association of Jewish Refugees there were about 70,000 Jewish refugees who came to Britain before the outbreak of war in 1939.Max Born and his family went first to Cambridge and then to Edinburgh University. He paid his way by writing a science text book that became a school standard.There were others who moved on to the United States. Mathematician Richard Courant went to New York where one of the foremost centres for applied maths, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is named after him.Losing such intellectual powerhouses was a self-inflicted wound for the Nazi war effort.In the race to develop atomic weapons, German refugees played a key role in making sure that it was the United States that won.Even though Max Born refused on moral grounds to work on atomic weapons research, Robert Oppenheimer, the US-born "father of the atomic bomb", had been Born's PhD student at Gottingen.There were signs at one stage that the Nazis might have realised their mistake.In 1934, Max Born and his family were visited in Cambridge by Werner Heisenberg, another Nobel prize winner and old colleague who had continued working at Gottingen.Heisenberg brought a message from the Nazi government inviting Max Born to return to continue his scientific work in Germany. The invitation left Born "beside himself with fury", his son recalls.But Max Born and his wife did eventually go back to Germany, after the war was over and after he had retired. He died there in 1970 and is buried in the same cemetery in Gottingen as Max Planck and Max von Laue.Gustav, who became a professor of pharmacology at King's College London, says that his parents were committed to trying to rebuild Germany in a way that would prevent the return of such political extremism.What lessons should be learned from all this?Gustav Born remains a strong supporter of the campaign to rescue academics, which is now marking its 80th year.It has become the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara) and its current chair, Anne Lonsdale, says that after 80 years the organisation "would love to be out of a job", but the problems in Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq and Syria mean that academics still need help in places where "civil society no longer functions".There is an "urgent need for scholars from across the Middle East to get to exile in a place of safety", she said.The stories of refugees from the Nazis, with grainy photos of faces with lines like old railway maps of Europe, might seem like something from a lost world.But Gustav Born says that Cara's ongoing work shows that it is as relevant as ever. It is also a reminder not to make hasty judgements about refugees and what they might be able to achieve.His descriptions of that academic world of the 1930s are also a last glimpse of a highly cultured society. His father, remembered for his science research, played Bach on the piano every day. These were internationalists, their ideas and research moving across national and political boundaries.Such a world proved fragile in the face of the Nazis. And Gustav Born says people can too often overlook that Germany had still been a young country in the 1930s, little more than 60 years old, and that it hadn't built the institutions able to resist its own "militaristic and nationalistic" tendencies.He is very much aware that he is now one of the few remaining people who can talk first-hand about such a legacy."I'm sad that it almost ends with me."I want them not to forget that things like this, the suppression of a country by a gang of murderous crooks and the victimisation of people of good nature and good intention, it could happen again."</body>

      <title>Education is a 'security issue', says UN</title>
      <description>Unesco chief says even though pledge for education for all will be missed, huge progress has been achieved.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23197565</url>
      <date>1373478808</date>
      <body>The tinderbox mix of high youth unemployment, lack of education and the threat of extremism is turning access to school into a "security issue", says Irina Bokova, director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation.The volatile prospect of millions of uneducated, illiterate youngsters in developing countries, under pressure from the financial downturn, has brought an unprecedented political significance to the campaign to give every child a primary school education, she says.Ms Bokova was speaking ahead of a speech later this week at the United Nations from Malala Yousafzai, who will call for all children to have the right to go to school.The Pakistani schoolgirl, who will make her speech in New York on her 16th birthday, defied the bullets of the Taliban in defence of her right to an education.But behind the optimism of Malala's campaign and the creation of an annual "Malala Day" is a much more complex global story, with failure as well as success.In 2000, in the warm glow of a new millennium, world leaders pledged that universal primary education would be achieved by 2015. No child would miss out on the basics of schooling.After an initial surge, progress stalled and achieving the target in the next 18 months now seems unlikely."By 2015, it's impossible," says Ms Bokova, the Paris-based head of Unesco.But she says that rather than being a cause of pessimism, the pursuit of the target has brought "huge progress". There were 108 million children out of school when the pledge was made; the most recent figures suggest this has fallen to 57 million."If the right strategies are in place, and you put your head where your heart is, then things can be improved. In Afghanistan in 2000 only 4% of girls were in school, now there are more than 70%."Ms Bokova says that another positive outcome has been a much stronger recognition of the importance of measuring the quality of education, rather than simply counting heads going into a classroom.Among the more sobering discoveries has been that many pupils have spent years in school but remained functionally illiterate.So in the autumn, Unesco is planning to produce a new set of global metrics to measure what's actually being learned in primary classrooms around the world. "It will give a global understanding of what quality education means," says Ms Bokova.It remains unclear whether there will be more targets after 2015, but anything that emerges will be more about quality of education, rather than simply volume of places.Ms Bokova says the financial crisis delivered a major blow to achieving the goal of universal primary education. Donor countries pulled the plug and left an "alarming gap" in funding.In sub-Saharan Africa there remains a shortage of 1.7 million teachers.But despite this gloom, she says that the financial crisis has given education a "paradoxical" political importance.Youth unemployment is a major threat in many countries and education and training are seen as vital investments."Education is now becoming in some cases a security issue," she says, with examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq and across the Middle East, where there is huge pressure to provide education to promote stability and democracy and to avoid extremism."The same is true of big emerging powers. In Brazil, the government recognises that the education system is one of the biggest challenges as it moves forward to a competitive economy and an inclusive society."The social tensions of deepening inequality and a lack of social mobility are also shaped by decisions about education systems, she says.Economic and political stability are now inextricably linked to improving education, says the Bulgarian-born Unesco director general."Education is becoming the key issue now in discussions about overcoming the economic crisis."But how are we going to make this happen? Budgets and international aid are shrinking."We try to convince countries that if they want to invest in coming out of the crisis, then invest in education."Another barrier to getting all children to school is a lack of fair access, particularly for girls.Ms Bokova says it's not acceptable for countries to hide behind ideas of "cultural differences" or "tradition" as a reason for discriminating against girls.Malala Yousafzai has become a powerful emblem."One event can spark a huge reaction and understanding and I think it was the case with Malala," she says."It was a stunning example of courage and a desire to learn."And she says that getting more girls into school is the single most important goal."It's not just a human right, it's what is needed to have normal societies. If a girl goes to school, she is less likely to have an early marriage, she will have healthier children, she'll find it easier to earn an income, she's less likely to be subjected to violence, less likely to have an early pregnancy."There are so many advantages, healthier communities, less violence, more economic growth. It has such an incredible multiplying effect."This is the best thing that could happen to humanity."The pledge for education for all has also highlighted where the problem is most acute.A meeting organised by the UN in April brought together eight countries - Bangladesh, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen - which between them have about half the children in the world who are missing out on school.It was an unprecedented attempt to systematically work out what has been going wrong.A minister from the DR Congo said that about 60% of those missing out on school did so because of the cost of school fees with the other 40% blamed on armed conflict.In Ethiopia the problem was identified as being focused on rural communities and lack of access for girls. In South Sudan it was a lack of trained teachers and a low level of school participation among girls.In Nigeria, which has the most children out of school, the difficulty was not necessarily about money, but was caused by low participation among girls in some areas and problems with "infrastructure" about providing teachers. Weaknesses in state authorities delivering the plans of the national government were also blamed.The country has also seen brutal attacks on schools. Secondary schools in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe were ordered to close this week after a massacre in which suspected Islamist extremists killed 22 students.Ms Bokova says that there is now a willingness among such countries to recognise what needs to be changed.Despite the failure to make the 2015 deadline, she says the attempt has shown the international community what can be achieved. Countries such as India and Ethiopia have taken substantial steps forward.This has disproved the feeling that "education is too complex, too costly and it takes too long to show results".But there is no escaping the harsh truth that millions of children, born a decade after the world promised universal primary education, still won't have even the most basic access to school.It's been possible to launch hundreds of satellites and put a spacecraft on Mars, but not to put children into classrooms a few hours south of Heathrow."In many cases we have failed, but it shouldn't discourage us. We're winning the argument."</body>

      <title>Teachers in strike action over pay</title>
      <description>Thousands of schools close as members of the two biggest teaching unions take strike action in a row over pay, pensions and workloads.</description>

      <body>Thousands of schools were closed as members of the two biggest teaching unions took strike action in a row over pay, pensions and workloads.The walkout affected schools in 49 authorities in the east of England, the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber.It is part of a continuing campaign of rolling regional strikes involving members of the NUT and NASUWT.The government said the strike would disrupt learning, inconvenience parents and damage the reputation of teachers.At least 2,500 schools were closed or partially closed.The strikers are angry about changes to their pensions, increased workloads and government plans to bring in performance-related pay.NUT general secretary Christine Blower said teachers could not "stand by and watch our profession be systematically attacked and undermined".She declared the action a "huge success" and added: "There can be no doubt left about the feeling of anger towards this government's treatment of the teaching profession."Strike action is never a step that teachers take lightly and we are very aware and concerned about the inconvenience it causes parents."Unfortunately we are faced with a coalition government that is refusing to listen to the reasonable demands of the profession."Teachers gathered for a series of marches and rallies in support of the strike.Ian Lever, from the NUT in Leicester, said: "Teachers are very angry about what is happening to the education system in this country and are prepared to make a stand on it."These are relentless attacks from this government, not just on our pay and conditions but on the education system in general."As professionals, as people who care about education, teachers are saying 'enough is enough' - we have to do something about this."BBC News Online journalist Max Mulgrew said he had seen about 3,000 people in Birmingham's Victoria Square."I've seen banners from NUT and NASUWT groups from Dudley, Coventry, Warwickshire, Walsall, the West Midlands region and even Wigan," he said.About 2,000 people had gathered in Barkers Pool, Sheffield, and about 800 assembled at Parker's Piece, Cambridge.Susi Artis, a spokeswoman for the NUT in Nottingham, said: "I recognise that for a lot of parents this is really inconvenient and we're very sorry for that. Striking is very much a last resort."Alison Core, a Shropshire primary school teacher, said: "Teachers do not want to strike but we feel we have no choice."Our jobs should not be about pay and targets. The bigger picture is the education of the children and with so many fast changes in the industry, we cannot lose sight of that."Jane Lucas, a parent from Coventry, said one of her children was at home and one was at school.She said: "Luckily, there's a couple of mums that we've managed to rally round and we're going to share the childcare today."It's difficult because I do support any worker who wants to fight for the right of their pensions and pay, it's just unfortunate that it's affecting children."Lisa Chambers, Conservative deputy leader of Suffolk County Council and cabinet member for education, said she had taken her son Alex, 13, with her to County Hall meetings."Unfortunately we don't have grandparents close to us and friends have got to make arrangements for their own children so he's had to come to work with me," she said."I have a diary of commitments to people and I really don't feel I can let people down because of this strike."Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said: "Strike action is a last resort, teachers have been left with no choice but to demonstrate their anger and frustration in the face of their genuine concerns being dismissed and trivialised."Teachers of course deeply regret any disruption to children and families."Such action would have been unnecessary had the secretary of state been prepared to engage in genuine discussions."A Department for Education spokesman said: "It is disappointing that the NUT and NASUWT are striking over the government's measures to allow heads to pay good teachers more."Industrial action will disrupt pupils' education, hugely inconvenience parents and damage the profession's reputation in the eyes of the public at a time when our reforms are driving up standards across the country."In a recent poll, 61% of respondents supported linking teachers' pay to performance and 70% either opposed the strikes or believed that teachers should not be allowed to strike at all."A further regional strike is planned in London, the North East, South East and South West on 17 October.Plans for a national one-day walkout before Christmas have also been announced by the two unions.</body>

      <title>Pupils breakfasting on energy drinks</title>
      <description>A survey suggests one in 20 teenage pupils goes to school on a can of energy drink instead of a good breakfast.</description>

      <body>One in 20 teenage pupils goes to school on a can of energy drink instead of a good breakfast, a survey suggests.A third of UK teenagers eat unhealthy breakfasts such as fry-ups or crisps, the poll of 2,000 youngsters aged between 12 and 18 suggests.Four out of 10 skip breakfast altogether to lose weight, the poll for the Make Mine Milk campaign suggests.Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the results were a worry.He said pupils breakfasting on energy drinks, which are not usually recommended for children, was something he had seen as a head teacher."When children arrive in schools having started the day eating or drinking totally inappropriate things like that, they are in no fit state to be in the classroom."They can be hyperactive, and it can have a very negative effect on their behaviour."He added that parents should be ensuring that their children were eating good breakfasts, rather than sending them off with money to buy something on the way to school.He added: "There's a lot of advertising with these drinks and they are fashionable, and teenagers love things that are fashionable."Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL), also said it was vital that children had a good and nutritious breakfast to set them up for the day and enable them to concentrate in class."A healthy breakfast is also important in stopping children become fractious and badly behaved."It is worrying to think that some children are breakfasting on energy drinks, such as Red Bull, which are stuffed full of sugar and stimulants and have little nutritional value."School breakfast clubs can play a key role in making sure children have had a good breakfast before they start school to help their learning. And we would like children to be taught about healthy eating, so they learn about healthy diets and how to cook nutritious meals."Caffeine content in such energy drinks ranges from about 8mg of caffeine - about the same as an espresso coffee - to as much as 400mg.Some of the smaller "shot style" products can contain as much as 175mg of caffeine in a 60ml bottle.Drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre (mg/l) must be labelled with the term "high caffeine content", and the Food Standards Agency recommends that children should only "consume in moderation drinks with high levels of caffeine".The makers of the Red Bull Energy Drink did not wish to comment on the issue raised but its website says: "Red Bull Energy Drink's special formula has been appreciated worldwide by top athletes, students, and when undertaking demanding work or during long drives."It adds the drink is "the ideal equipment when you are active and keen to set personal bests".Director general of the British Soft Drinks Association Gavin Partington said: "The soft drinks industry is clear that energy drinks are not suitable for children, and we want to get that message across to young people and their parents."Adults might choose an energy drink, containing about as much caffeine as a typical cup of coffee, when they want a physical or mental boost. But, like all food and drink, energy drinks should be consumed in moderation as part of a balanced diet and active lifestyle."</body>

      <title>'Childhood damaged' by over-testing</title>
      <description>Too much testing in schools risks damaging the "quality of childhood", claim academics and writers, including poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy.</description>

      <body>Children in England's schools are being damaged by a culture of "incessant testing", says a group of academics and writers, including poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy.They have written to the Times, warning that changes to the curriculum and targets are harmful for children.The letter warns of "devastating consequences" for childhood.A Department for Education spokesman said schools now had greater "freedom to innovate and inspire".The letter, with 198 signatories, argues that the increasing pressure to improve test results will create a narrowing education for children, with teachers put in a "strait jacket" of targets.The academics and writers call for a consensus among teachers, parents and politicians about the "future of education"."Competition between children through incessant testing and labelling results is a public sense of failure for the vast majority," says the letter to the Times."The drive towards ever-higher attainment in national tests leads inevitably to teaching to the test, which narrows the range of learning experiences."Harmful stress is put on young people, their parents and their teachers."These damaging developments must stop. If they go ahead, there will be devastating consequences for children's mental health, for future opportunities and, most importantly, for the quality of childhood itself."The theme of getting the balance right between academic testing and children's well-being was also raised by Tim Hands, chairman of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), which is holding its annual conference.Mr Hands, speaking on Monday, criticised political interference in education - "the long interfering arm and dead restraining hand of government" - and said that the "principles of commercial accountability" had been applied to schools in a way that was "flawed"."The story of the last 50 years is the intrusion of government and the disappearance of the child. More radically put, it is by extension the intrusion of the state, and the disappearance of love," said Mr Hands.Education Secretary Michael Gove is to address the Conservative party conference on Tuesday.And a spokesman for the education department defended school reforms as raising standards and giving more freedoms to heads and teachers."Our rigorous new curriculum, demanding GCSEs and high-quality A-levels involving universities will raise academic standards for all children."The new TechBacc means young people more suited to a vocational route will again be able to take courses we know lead to good jobs and skilled trades."Teachers now have more power than ever before to ensure discipline in the classroom."And thousands of brilliant heads and teachers now have the freedom to innovate and inspire thanks to our academies and free schools programmes."</body>

      <title>Parents 'too guilty to go private'</title>
      <description>An elite private schools leader says parents are made to feel it is morally unacceptable to pay for an education.</description>

      <body>Parents are made to feel it is morally unacceptable to pay for an education, says a private schools leader.HMC chairman Tim Hands said there was an "illogicality" about families buying a house near a good school but not being willing to pay school fees.Parents clearly felt it was more morally acceptable to buy an expensive car or holiday, the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference heard.Average fees in UK private schools are £14,000 a year.For boarders it tops £27,600 a year - more than the average yearly wage in England.Michael Pyke, a spokesman for the Campaign for State Education, said: "It's inevitable that parents will try to seek advantages for their own children and there is no point anybody arguing the reverse."If we want a fairer education system it has to be brought about by political means."But Mr Hands said parents were making illogical choices and that private schools, such as those in his association, were wrongly attacked for restricting social mobility because of the fees they charged.He stressed that 36% of pupils in HMC schools across the UK received help with their fees.And he told heads at the group's annual meeting in London: "Tony Blair, opening a London Academy in 2005, talked of the different ways in which parents could transform their child's education."Examples included moving house in order to access a better school and employing a personal tutor - one quarter of all parents in London pay for private tuition in the course of their child's school career."Moral opprobrium attached to neither of these, though the latter is of course paying for a private education, and the former is not social but postcode mobility, potentially productive of social division."He added: "Making the journey to independent education, parents are currently made to feel, is an unacceptable mobility - expenditure on purchase of a car, holiday or house is moral; expenditure on the education of the child is not. The illogicality is clear."Speaking to reporters ahead of the conference, Mr Hands, said he felt that "over the decades parents have come to feel more bothered about the concept of private education and that has been politically encouraged".He highlighted how both Tony Blair and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg had sent their children to the London Oratory - a high-achieving Catholic state school in Brompton, south-west London with a reported 6% of pupils eligible for free school meals.And he compared this with Christ's Hospital School, in West Sussex, where he said 88% of pupils were on means-tested bursaries and almost half of pupils paid 10% of full fees.</body>

      <title>Teachers 'may like performance pay'</title>
      <description>Teachers could be won over to performance related pay but need reassurance about its fairness and efficiency, claims a right-leaning think tank.</description>

      <body>Teachers in England and Wales could be won over to performance-related pay but need reassurance about its fairness and efficiency, a think tank claims.The right-leaning Policy Exchange has published a poll of teachers on the eve of regional strikes over pay, conditions and pensions.Members of the NUT and NASUWT unions will strike on Tuesday in the Midlands, East of England, Yorkshire and Humber.Teaching unions said the survey detail did not support Policy Exchange's view.Performance-related pay (PRP) came into force for teachers in England's schools this term, giving heads more flexibility over salaries.Unions say the changes are really about cutting most teachers' salaries and most parents want schools to follow a national pay system.But Jonathan Simons, head of education at Policy Exchange, claims the poll suggests "that teachers could easily be won round to the idea of performance-related pay but more needs to be done to explain how the system would work".Pollsters YouGov questioned a weighted sample of more than 1,000 teachers in England and Wales.The main question on performance-related pay received a broadly negative response from teachers, with only 16% saying they would like to work in a school where pay was "more explicitly linked" to their overall performance, 40% saying they would not and 44% that it would make no difference.However, Policy Exchange claims that answers to other questions may indicate the possibility of a change of heart if teachers could be convinced that performance-related pay would lead to less paperwork.Some 55% said they would be more likely to want to work in a school with performance-related pay "if it also resulted in a reduction in your administrative, reporting and bureaucratic workload".Some 12% said they were less likely to want to work in such a school, while 33% said it would make no difference.Teachers said they spent an average of more than 48 minutes a week on reporting their own performance, with over half (54%) saying it was the least valuable use of their time.Some (79%) complained of too much bureaucracy, target-setting and inspection.Christine Blower, of the NUT, said the survey showed that "a clear majority of teachers are far more concerned about workload than any apparent benefits of performance-related pay."According to this survey, only 2% said that it would make them significantly more likely to want to work in a school where pay was more explicitly linked to overall performance."Far more said it would make them less likely. Even under the proposal of PRP being offered in return for an imagined reduction in bureaucratic workload, only 13% said that it would make them significantly more interested in working in a school with PRP."Yet in many schools the introduction of PRP will lead to a much greater bureaucratic workload as head teachers introduce new forms and evidence gathering."Teachers work in a collaborative fashion. Young people's success depends on the interplay between the work of all their teachers."There is also every scope in linking pay to performance for the creation of unfairness."Policy Exchange said the poll also suggested that most teachers (60%) were against pay being driven by years of experience in the profession, preferring measures such as students' progress (66%) and teaching quality (89%).A third of those polled said they were dissatisfied at having to work with lower-performing colleagues, while more than half (52%) said performance pay would make it easier to dismiss poor teachers.Mr Simons said: "Policymakers should make huge efforts to talk to teachers up and down the country, even if that means bypassing their union leaders, and answer any questions they might have about the new system."</body>

      <title>UK A&amp;Es seeing 'drunk children'</title>
      <description>Nearly 300 children aged 11 or under were admitted to A&amp;E units across the UK last year after drinking too much, a BBC Radio 5 live investigation has found.</description>

      <date>1380525292</date>
      <body>Nearly 300 children aged 11 or under were admitted to AandE units across the UK last year after drinking too much, a BBC Radio 5 live investigation shows.Revealing UK-wide data for the first time, it said a total of 6,500 under-18s were admitted in 2012-13.Charities and public health bodies say fewer children are drinking overall, but those who do may be drinking more.The five years of data comes from Freedom of Information requests to 125 of the 189 UK NHS organisations.Prof Ian Gilmore, chairman of the UK Alcohol Health Alliance, told the BBC: "I think in under-11s, it's mainly experimenting, but I think we see children in the 11 to 16-year-old range who are beginning to drink regularly."He added: "There are some encouraging signs in that the numbers of under-18s drinking is probably falling, but those that are drinking are probably drinking earlier and drinking more heavily, so we certainly can't be complacent."Over the last five years AandE departments across the UK have dealt with nearly 48,000 incidents where under-18s have been admitted for drink or drug related illnesses.During 2012/13 there were 293 cases of children aged 11 or under attending AandE with alcohol-related conditions - a third more than in 2011/12 when there were 216 cases.Among teens, more girls than boys are now being admitted, a reversal of the past trend.Ayrshire and Arran Health Board dealt with the highest number of cases last year - with 483 alcohol-related attendances.Morten Draegebo, an AandE consultant at Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock, said children were exposing themselves to significant danger.He said: "The typical patient may be found in a field. They often need to hide away from any sort of adults in the area so they're picked up by the ambulance service."They have difficulty locating where they are because the description comes through from a distressed half-drunk teenager potentially saying that they're under a tree somewhere in a large park."Eventually they're found but even in summer-time in Scotland they're vaguely hypothermic."They have vomited. The vomit may go down the wrong way into the lungs. They are unable to defend themselves even from assault."Dr Draegebo added: "We have had many cases where teenage, young teenage females have come in saying that they may have been sexually assaulted and they're that intoxicated and are distressed and say, 'I may have been', but they don't even know if they have been or not."On a humane level that is very distressing. I'm a parent, I would hate for that to happen to my daughter."Elaine Hindal, chief executive of Drinkaware, said the incidence of drunkenness among under-11s was "really alarming" and parents must be vigilant."It's really unlikely that children are buying alcohol. When children talk to us in our research, they tell us they get alcohol from home, primarily from their parents and from friends," she said."But parents need to simply be aware of the dangers of drinking, particularly with younger children. Their bodies can't take it, they're more at risk of alcoholic poisoning, they are more likely to be a victim of alcohol-related violence."Across the UK, experts agree that fewer children are drinking now than several years ago, but say the amount being consumed by those underage has stayed the same - suggesting those who do drink are consuming more.Public Health England says one in four underage drinkers consumes more than 15 units a week - the equivalent of seven pints of lager.The official advice from the chief medical officers across the UK is that no children should be given alcohol until they are 16, and alcohol should only be given to older teenagers under supervision of a carer or parent, and never on more than one day a week.A Department of Health England spokesman said: "We know that fewer young people are drinking and being admitted to hospital as a result."But with more than one million alcohol-related hospital admissions overall in the last year we know too many people are drinking too much and that alcohol places a heavy burden on the NHS, costing around £3.5bn every year.

      <body>The number of people visiting public libraries in the UK has dropped by a quarter in the past eight years, according to a government survey.The proportion of adults using libraries has fallen from 48% to 36% since 2005, according to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS).The drop comes as some councils shut branches in an attempt to save money.Around 350 libraries are thought to have shut since April or be at risk, according to Public Libraries News.But cities including Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester have had major schemes to open or refurbish their central libraries.The decrease in library visitors has been a relatively steady trend since the DCMS' annual Taking Part survey began in 2005.The drop has been seen in all parts of the UK and all age groups, the survey found.The Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (Cilip) said the figures were "deeply disappointing".Cilip chief executive Annie Mauger pointed out reductions in staff numbers, spending and opening hours that had been felt over the past few years."Local authorities have had to make tough choices, but libraries are under pressure and cuts to services will mean that visits drop," she said.The body, which represents library workers, called for "stronger political leadership that supports a clear national vision to provide high quality, relevant and well used library services in communities across the country".The figures come days after Cilip passed a vote of no confidence in culture minister Ed Vaizey for his "failures" to intervene on library closures.In a speech in March, Mr Vaizey insisted libraries were not in crisis, saying: "I'm delighted our library service continues to thrive and modernise."Referring to the survey results, a DCMS spokesman said libraries were "still hugely important", with 4.5 million visits per week."Local authorities, of course, are best placed to decide the scale and nature of the services they provide, based on local needs," he said."But it is crucial that they understand what important resources library services are, and adapt and develop services to meet people's expectations in our rapidly changing world."There are great examples of innovation and creativity in the delivery of library services, and we want to see more local authorities doing that."Cllr Flick Rea of the Local Government Association said fewer than 5% of libraries had closed and councils were "working hard to innovate and re-design them" for the future."What is clear is that government can't keep reducing funding and expect councils to be able to keep protecting popular library services in this way," Cllr Rea said."Any further cuts would certainly result in widespread library service closures and stop this positive work in its tracks."Other figures from the survey showed that the proportion of adults visiting museums or art galleries had risen from 42% to 53% since 2005.The East Midlands and north of England have shown the biggest rises in people watching or taking part in the arts, the survey found.Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the overall figures "show once again just how important the nation's arts and culture are to people".</body>

      <title>Call for child mental health checks</title>
      <description>Children as young as seven should be tested in school for their mental health, a Cambridge academic has said.</description>

      <body>Children as young as seven should be tested in school for their mental health, a Cambridge academic has said.In an article for the British Medical Journal, Simon Nicholas Williams argues that screening pupils at that age would mean problems could be diagnosed and treated earlier.Heads say it is an "interesting idea".Mr Williams, from the university's Institute of Public Health, said three-quarters of adult mental disorders were "extensions of juvenile disorders"."If left untreated, these can lead to more serious social and economic problems in adolescence and adulthood, related to crime, unemployment, and suicide, for example," he wrote.He said early intervention and prevention of mental health problems should be aimed at young people."Introducing mental health screening in schools could enable early diagnosis and treatment of childhood mental health problems and therefore reduce many of the costs associated with adolescent and adult mental health problems," he wrote.He said mental health problems cost the UK an estimated £105bn a year."Physical health checks have been done in schools for more than a century, so why not mental health checks?", he added.Russell Hobby, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), which represents most primary heads, said the idea was an interesting one.But any such scheme would have to be carefully handled, he said, with the checks carried out by experts."I think we should be checking children for much more than whether they have mastered phonics," he said."The evidence suggests that the earlier we start checking people, the better. But schools themselves are not qualified to do this and health professionals would have to be involved."Mr Hobby added: "We would have to be quite careful about any labels and stigma attached to this. It would have to be done in a sensitive fashion."But Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said the idea was a "further reflection of the growing intrusion into our lives of the nanny state"."Children, parents and schools should be trusted. This new initiative is as likely to cause children and parents anxiety and stress as it is to help anyone," he said."Good schools, with high aspirations, inspirational teachers and a broad curriculum, will do far more to support children who may be vulnerable to mental health issues than a screening programme that will, inevitably focus on introspection and the looking for problems where none exist. God help the poor children if this latest initiative gains ground."In his article, Simon Williams said the "stigma associated with a mental health diagnosis is likely a deterrent, particularly for parents", as well as the financial costs involved."However, a programme in which all children are screened, rather than just those who are traditionally deemed at risk, would likely have a de-stigmatising effect," he said."Although many mental health disorders are more common among children from lower socio-economic groups, others, such as anxiety disorders, are just as common, if not more common, among children from higher socio-economic groups."He said such screening could be carried out in groups "cheaply", at an estimated cost of £27 per child, amounting to £18.5 million for all of the UK's seven-year-olds.Lucie Russell, from the Young Minds charity, said mental health screening was a good idea if there was good support for children "with emerging mental health problems", but current provision was "patchy"."Screening as part of early intervention is theoretically a positive step forward, but it must be backed up with comprehensive support and treatment for any identified children and their families," she said.</body>

      <title>Adoptions show 'record' increase</title>
      <description>Nearly 4,000 children in England were adopted from care in the year to March.</description>

      <body>Nearly 4,000 children in England were adopted from care in the year to March.The latest statistics from the government show an increase of 15% compared with the year before, and ministers say it is a record.The government has a drive to increase the number of children adopted, saying a child's life-chances are greatly improved if they are in a stable permanent home.Children's Minister Edward Timpson said the rise was "hugely encouraging".Between April 2012 and March 2013, 3,980 children were adopted, up from 3,470 the previous year.Officials say the figure is higher than in any year since 1992, when comparable records began.Councils are now being compared against each other in league tables showing how many children are in care and how many have been adopted.There are many supporters of the drive, but some have warned that adoption is not always the best option, and that other schemes such as children being looked after by members of the wider family group, should not be over-looked.The statistics show a continued increase in the number of children being taken in to care.In total, there were 68,110 children in care in England in March this year - a 2% rise on the same time last year and 12% up on March 2009.That trend began following the death of Peter Connelly, who was 17 months old when he died after months of abuse in 2007.Social workers were criticised for leaving the toddler with his mother and partner despite serious concerns.The pair and another man were jailed over his death.Children's minister Edward Timpson said: "It is hugely encouraging that the number of children adopted from care has risen to the highest level yet - but too many children are still waiting too long for stable, loving homes."More needs to be done to recruit adoptive parents."Of the children in care in March, 75% (nearly 51,000) were being fostered.Local councils have said they are playing their part in increasing adoption rates, but complain too many cases are held up by bureaucracy and delays in the legal system.The government is pressing local authorities to do more, saying adoption should be considered as an option for more children and encouraging them to place babies with foster families who want to go to adopt them, so that there is less upheaval.David Simmonds, from the Local Government Association, said: "It is heartening to see this record increase in the number of children being placed in loving homes. Councils have been working hard to recruit more adoptive mums and dads and are doing everything in their power to ensure that vulnerable children get the best start in life."We know that there is still much more to be done, and it will be vital that government works with local authorities and not against us."It has been estimated that about one in five adoptions breaks down, although the government's adviser Sir Martin Narey says the figure is probably "half that".No national official figures are published for this.</body>

      <title>Freshers' fun? Not for the cleaners</title>
      <description>Fun for students but not the university cleaners</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24275092</url>
      <date>1380759129</date>
      <body>Students are returning for the new university term. There will be parties, long beery nights and bleary late mornings. It's the binge-fest of freshers' week.But for cleaners at one London university, it is the "worst week of the year" when there is "double work".The students and the cleaners share the university campus; they both work here, but to very different timetables. The cleaners are on the way to work before some of the students will be on the way home.University cleaners start work from 04:00, travelling through the dark streets on buses from the edges of the capital.Mostly Spanish speakers from South and Central America, many will have begun their journey more than an hour earlier.While the new term means freshers' parties for students, there's a different kind of freshening going on for the cleaners.They will have cleaned the toilets, emptied the bins, swept the floor, wiped the desks, while the students and their teachers will have been asleep. It's a double life for this university.As the first students begin to come through the doors in the morning, holding on to their textbooks and takeaway coffees, the cleaners have already finished their shifts.But they haven't finished working. Many will have multiple jobs, a few hours at a time, criss-crossing London by bus because the Tube fares are too expensive and they're not paid for the travelling in between.One university cleaner, who wants to remain anonymous, describes his daily timetable and gives his perspective on university life.He leaves his home at 03:00 for the first of three cleaning jobs. He works shifts from 04:00 - 06:00 and then 06:00 - 16:30 in central London and then finishes with a two-hour shift in south London, between 17:30 and 19:30.Then he goes home to his three children and gets ready to start work again the next morning.He works five days a week, but he says he has colleagues who work like this six or seven days a week."Sometimes I don't want to wake up. But I can't afford to miss a single day."It's dirty. People leave their rubbish on the floor. You think they would appreciate you, but you get into the lift and they turn away from you."That affects me. When you're trying to clean the toilets, people get cross. There's a lack of respect - it's very hard."Is it because we're cleaners? Because we're foreigners and we don't speak the language?"It's easy for families to break up, he says. Children without parents around can get into trouble. With no spare cash, people have to borrow and quickly get into high-interest borrowing. Long hours are worked to pay high London rents.And before making any assumptions about who gets caught up in this cycle, he says he works alongside cleaners who in their own countries had been a lawyer, a psychologist and a teacher. He is a graduate himself, before coming to the UK more than a decade ago.What's the worst part of cleaning?He says it's the toilets. And he can't understand how people can leave the bathrooms in such a bad way.Just as crushing is the sense of not being valued, particularly in an educational institution, where students debate ideas of equality, labour rights and social justice."I thought people would behave well, they would have courtesy, good manners."Instead, he says, even when he has been taking out a bin from below someone's desk they've refused to acknowledge him.These might be corridors of learning. But someone still has to clean them.Not speaking much English, competing at the most precarious end of the temporary labour market, cleaners are vulnerable to being exploited. It's part of the reason that he doesn't want to be identified.A previous contractor owed the cleaners money for three months, he says.They can't take their concerns to the university, because they work for an international outsourcing company. And there have been long-running campaigns over pay and conditions.But without being part of the university staff, the cleaners still share the same buildings, a parallel set of footsteps in the libraries, the lecture halls, the classrooms, unseen during the hours before dawn.He says they see the photos of families on the desks each day, they prepare the rooms. Without any sign of self-pity, he says: "Some of these tables are cleaned with tears."It's a tale of two cities invisible to one another.</body>

      <title>The state school sixth formers twinned with Eton</title>
      <description>State and public school sixth formers twinned</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24289105</url>
      <date>1381016264</date>
      <body>From a busy junction at Stratford High Street in East London, there is a great view of a symbol of one of the UK's most glittering recent successes - the Olympic Park - and the modern station created to go with it.And close by is an unusual school which is striving to bring together the old and the new traditions of England - much like the spectacular opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics.The London Academy of Excellence is a government-funded sixth-form serving the East End of the capital which is trying to bridge the gap between private and state schools.It opened its doors as London basked in the glow of the Olympics last year.In an unusual partnership, pupils there share lessons, sport and teachers with a local community school and several independent fee-paying schools including Eton, Brighton College and Highgate.It is easy to miss the London Academy of Excellence. Its modern building looks like any other shiny office block, perched on the edge of a busy road.It is as far from the green playing fields and quads of Eton and Brighton College as you could imagine - but pupils at these and the other schools involved are sharing more than lessons and aspirations.Through a buddy system, they are getting to know each other during visits and getting a window on each other's lives.Yousef, 17, was one of the first group of sixth-formers to join the academy."I was attracted by the links with Eton and the other schools," he said."This has built a bridge between us and independent schools. It's taught us a lot. It's illustrated that we have far more in common than difference."I get to visit Eton House boys with tailcoats. That was a bit of an experience, out of the ordinary, but behind that we saw a lot of similarities between us."Do the teenagers feel envious when they see the very different surroundings of pupils at the other schools?Curtis, 17, says no."One buddy took us on a tour and I studied a lesson of history with them. There was a similar-sized classroom, a similar way of teaching and talking. I felt at home there," he said."I did not feel envious. I am not that kind of individual. But who would not want to study at Eton?"Some of the sixth-formers say they feel lucky, because they do not have to pay for their education."We have this free. They are paying vast amounts to go to a college similar to ours", says Clinton.Ellie says the students at the other schools seemed really pleased to meet them."They were just as interested in us as we were in them. My buddy was asking so many questions about what we do."Most of their education takes place in the bright modern, business-like surroundings of their academy, in a converted office block.Their "uniform" is a "smart, professional dress code".The walls are white, the furniture bright. Big bold canvases with faces of famous intellectuals, scientists, artists and writers decorate the walls, dotted with their words of inspiration.In front of one of them is the academy's headmaster Robert Wilne, an energetic man, who bubbles over with enthusiasm for his pupils' success, their futures - and the aims of this experimental school."There are many schools doing interesting partnerships," he said."But this is a third way for independent schools, aside from giving bursaries or sponsoring academies."It is an experiment. I would love another city to look at it."It's a genuine, deep-seated partnership between eight schools that are woven in to the DNA of this academy."It's not window dressing or surface gloss."It is an experiment praised by the head of England's schools inspectorate Sir Michael Wilshaw, who in the summer accused many independent schools of living in "splendid isolation" from the state sector.He drew criticism from some in the private school sector this week too, for saying some schools' links with state schools were small, like crumbs from their tables.Some responded angrily, saying that their schools saved taxpayers money by educating children outside of the state sector.Both Labour and coalition governments have called for more links between private and state sector schools.All the academy's funding is from the government, says Mr Wilne and there is no direct funding from private schools.But there is support "in kind" and through links. Some of the governors are from the independent schools in the partnership."We draw on their various expertise and resources," says the headmaster."So if I want a scheme of work [curriculum plan] for maths, I go to to Highgate and ask for that. The head of economics at Brighton College is de facto head of economics here."They have been down and given feedback and mentoring support."Mr Wilne hopes the school will help social mobility."Education is the fuel of social mobility, education changes lives," he says."This 360 degree education we are offering here should fuel that mobility. Students will get the grades that will unlock doors to top universities and they are taking up extra-curricular activities and sports."They are interested in meeting others and they are not going to be daunted by meeting Etonians in the future."Sport, it seems, has also proved to be a good ice-breaker between students at the various schools."We enjoy visiting them as much as the sport," says Yousef.Curtis says he is enjoying trying out new sports."There is so much sport available. We do rowing. In my secondary school, we did rowing on a rowing machine, now we get to go on the water."With the first full exam season under its belt, the academy is now into its second year. The pioneer year looks to be a hard act to follow, having achieved 70% of their AS-levels at grades of A or B.Three students, including Ellie, spent part of the summer in the USA on a summer school after being encouraged to apply."I always wanted to go to university but did not aspire to the top ones," she said.The students say the school has widened their horizons, with encouragement to do so often coming in the shape of one of the many emails pumped out by their headmaster telling them of various opportunities."I get worried if I don't get an email from the head," one teenager says.They are getting help with their university applications and personal statements from one of the visiting teachers from the private sector.Student Harmanpreet says: "Our old head was always saying it's not about where you come from but where you are going."We know we are from a deprived area but LAE has shown us where we want to go."</body>

      <title>Greece crisis: Inside the student-occupied schools</title>
      <description>Angry Greek students taking over their classrooms</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24332586</url>
      <date>1380610490</date>
      <body>Drastic public spending cuts in Greece are having severe consequences for public services including education. With teachers and students now taking direct action, some universities are warning that a whole semester could be written off.Last Monday was no ordinary school day for 17-year-old Enea Tola.At 06:00, Enea and several other senior students climbed the fence of their school and locked the doors. They informed the principal that the students had taken over the school in central Thessaloniki, Greece's second city.On the same day, hundreds of students across the country were staging or preparing to stage their own school takeovers.By the end of last week, more than 100 high schools in Greece had been occupied.The students took the baton from teachers, who had begun rolling strikes only a few days after the school year began.Teachers were protesting against the lay-offs and forced job transfers that are part of Greece's bailout agreement with international lenders.After two weeks the strikes ended and students stepped in."Our main goal is to demonstrate our solidarity with our teachers, who could not go on striking indefinitely," says Enea."It is the only way to make ourselves heard."At Enea's school, no outsiders are allowed to enter the premises. Some students guard the main entrance, while 10 to 15 others spend the night there, turning their desks into beds.In one classroom, a girl is diligently sweeping the floor."You came on cleaning day. We don't want to vindicate those accusing us of vandalising our schools," says Enea, the son of Albanian immigrants, who moved to Greece when he was four years old."We have been severely affected by the crisis. Last year many of our friends fainted from malnutrition. We cannot sit in silence."Illegal in theory, school takeovers are tolerated by the authorities.Across the street from another Thessaloniki secondary school in the suburb of Kalamaria, a policeman is watching as the students gather in the yard to debate their next moves."The police do not intervene. They do not want to go against the people," says one student.Many parents are unhappy."First it was the teachers' strikes, now the student takeovers, soon it will be Christmas vacation. No wonder our education is in such a mess," says the mother of a 16-year-old girl, who did not wish to be identified.And others believe children are learning the wrong lessons."What will happen to 12- to 15-year-old students in junior high school, who learn at this tender age how to break the law?" wrote Paschos Mandravelis in his column for the conservative daily, Kathimerini.For many teachers, however, the turmoil is only a natural consequence of austerity policies imposed by the so-called troika - the officials from the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank.Τhe number of teachers in Greek high schools has been cut by 18,000 since last year; 100 vocational schools have been closed; and thousands of teachers are placed on reserve.According to the EU Commission, education spending in Greece, one of the lowest in Europe even before the crisis, has remained steady at around 4% of GDP since 2008. But since the Greek economy has shrunk by almost 25% over the same period, education has suffered an equivalent cut in its actual funding.Thomai Pagiantza, who teaches at an elementary school in Alexandria, a town in northern Greece, says the problems are so grave that the union should have continued its strikes."We have suffered dramatic wage cuts. With 14 years of experience, my monthly salary has been cut from 1,400 to 950 euros [£1170 to £790]. But we are not fighting for money or privileges, as many Greeks think. We are fighting to save education," she says.Greek universities are also paralysed - not by student takeovers, but by the rolling strikes of administrative staff. The governing bodies of several institutions suspended their activities last week, saying they can no longer function.Greek universities have to contribute 1,349 employees to the total reserve pool of 25,000 civil servants, who will receive reduced pay and could lose their jobs if they are not transferred to other government agencies.The situation is aggravating social tensions. Thodoris Karagiannis, a postgraduate student and senior youth member of the ruling conservative New Democracy party, calls the blockades of universities "extortion, with students and parents being the victims".The government insists that the reforms will make Greek education more effective and less wasteful.But university employees say they are striking to save tertiary education and not just their jobs.Last Friday, dozens gathered outside the administrative building of Thessaloniki's Aristotle University, which is the largest in the country with approximately 100,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students.Already on strike for 14 days, they were sitting by the blindfolded statue of Aristotle which dominates the courtyard, drinking coffee and talking about their bleak future.Yannis Kourmoulis, the president of the Administrative Personnel Association, says they will keep fighting."Some department secretariats are staffed by a single employee... How on earth will universities do their job if they lose another 40% of their staff?"</body>

      <description>Nigerian students live in fear following dormitory massacre</description>

      <body>Sagir Adam, 21, survived the weekend attack on his agricultural college in north-eastern Nigeria when suspected Islamist militants killed about 50 students sleeping in their dormitory."It was a night of horror," he told me, struggling to find words to describe what happened.Gunmen in military uniform in a convoy of two vehicles and motorcycles stormed the college at about 01:00 - a time when students are asleep in their hostels, surrounded by complete darkness.Yobe State College of Agriculture is down the road from Gujba village. The entrance is fenced but the rest of the campus merges with the bush that stretches from Yobe state into the deep forests of neighbouring Borno state - the stronghold of the Islamist group Boko Haram.Its fighters regard schools as a symbol of Western culture. The group's name translates as "Western education is forbidden".Despite the attack, and others like it, Mr Adam wants to go back to the college and continue with his studies as he believes an education will help him find a job.But he is now back in his home town of Nguru - a four-and-a-half-hour bus journey from Gujba - and his parents will never let him go back to any school as long as the danger of Boko Haram exists.His father has told him that his priority is to stay alive.Yobe state is one of the poorest and educationally disadvantaged states of Nigeria - it is certainly the least developed state in the north-east.Sharing a border with Niger to the north, it is arid and its inhabitants are largely farmers. But farming is becoming more difficult or impossible as a result of growing desert encroachment.Many tertiary students I have spoken to in Yobe's major towns - Damaturu, Geidam, Nguru, Gashua and Potiskum - say their parents have asked them to return home for security reasons.Three states in north-eastern Nigeria have been under a state of emergency since May when a security operation was launched against Boko Haram.Many of the militants left their bases and violence initially fell, but revenge attacks quickly followed - several on schools in Yobe."I always live imagining I can be killed. No-one is sure of what will happen," Potiskum resident Kadai Musa, who has three wives and 15 children, told the BBC about life under the state of emergency.He says none of his children have gone to school in the last six months because of fears of further attacks."We no longer care about anything else except to live and see the next day," he says.Agricultural lecturer Bukar Mustapha can testify to shrinking class sizes. He says the weekend attack may mean teaching unions will refuse to allow staff to go back into classrooms until security can be guaranteed.But there is no security in the remote area around Gujba, a village along a major road linking Yobe with Adamawa state.Apart from some mud houses sparsely strewn over an area the size of two football pitches, Yobe State College of Agriculture is the only prominent feature of Gujba.At the gate of the college there is a security guard, who is usually untrained and armed with a torch light and a bow and arrows.In the early hours of Sunday when the gunmen arrived, they demanded that the night guard show them the hostels for male and female students.He prevaricated, saying that most of the students had gone home for the weekend - only pointing out one dormitory.Other students awoke when they heard the shooting - the sleeping students were killed with guns and a hand-held saw.Some students died running, while others were killed after being mistaken for bandits by villagers as they fled.The gunfire lasted for four hours. Hostels were burnt, the college's shops ransacked.No security agents intervened during this time and the militants eventually left with the college ambulance.When dawn broke, dead bodies could be seen dotted around the hostel area.All day, wailing and tearful relatives hung around the morgue in the state capital Damaturu, 30km (18 miles) north of Gujba, where the dead bodies had been conveyed.The two sons of Ishaku Lawan, a 60-year-old driver, survived the dorm attack."I am grateful to Allah my sons survived," he told the BBC."After previous school attacks in Yobe state, we have been asking government to provide security in other schools but nothing has been done. Now the worst has happened."Most Yobe residents bemoan this precarious security situation.They have been living with on-and-off curfews for more than a year.Motorcycles were banned because of the many drive-by shootings - a trademark of Boko Haram killings.Thousands of young men who earned their living running motorbike taxis are out of work.But now life is more risky than ever.Muhammed Abba, a civil servant in Damaturu, has visited his mother in Maiduguri, in Borno state, every weekend for more than a decade.But in the last two months he has been unable to make the journey, which takes about an hour."In recent days, gunmen of Boko Haram have been blocking the road and slaughtering commuters. They killed over 100 recently," he said."They normally operate in the evenings and early mornings. My mum begged me not to come and see her because of the risk involved."Going to Maiduguri now by road is like a suicide mission."For now schools will officially remain open in Yobe, but they are likely to be abandoned as Boko Haram increasingly targets them.But Mr Lawan is desperate for his sons - Muhammed, 23, and Fusami, 25 - to get an education."I want my sons to be educated. I am 60 and a driver - I don't want my sons to be like me. I will look for a school in a state where there is security," he said.His meagre driver's salary means he will struggle financially, but he says it will be worth it to send his sons to any school outside Yobe state.</body>

      <title>Stones and apples thrown at university reformer</title>
      <description>A harsh reception for a would-be reformer in Iraqi Kurdistan</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23977422</url>
      <date>1380669333</date>
      <body>Prof Dlawer Ala'Aldeen had tomatoes, stones and apples thrown at him. He faced countless demonstrations.The reason for this hostility, facing the microbiologist from the University of Nottingham, was his controversial attempt to reform the university system in his birthplace of Kurdistan.Prof Ala'Aldeen was the architect of plans to improve the quality and to internationalise higher education in Iraqi Kurdistan.He says he was up against "deeply entrenched interests, people, institutions and long stagnant cultures".The region, autonomous for two decades in the wake of the Gulf War, had inherited a post-Saddam university system that Prof Ala'Aldeen has described as "grossly outdated" and designed for a closed, centralised country.In 2009 Prof Ala'Aldeen was given a secondment away from his job as professor of clinical microbiology at Nottingham University in the UK.He stepped from academic life in the English midlands into the role of Kurdistan's higher education minister, a post he held until last year.Prime Minister Barham Salih, a good friend, chose him for his knowledge of the higher education system and the series of critical articles on education and governance he had written in the years up to his appointment.Barham Salih's election manifesto had included significant support for higher education and training to support Kurdistan's large population of under 20 year olds.There were already plans for more scholarships to send talented students to study overseas.Within a week of being appointed, Prof Ala'Aldeen had written up a radical vision document and it was quickly endorsed by the cabinet.Higher education in Kurdistan was suffering a major crisis of quality, capacity and infrastructure.There was a consensus in support of reform and it helped that Prof Ala'Aldeen had been very critical of the government in the past.The reforms, which planned to improve the quality and accreditation of university teachers, brought considerable opposition from student and teacher organisations as well as businesses linked with the burgeoning market in private universities.Several new private universities were threatened with closure, much to the anger of their staff and prospective students who had paid fees for their courses."Many teachers had been licensed prematurely. There were 11 private universities when I started with 18 more waiting to be opened. These mushrooming private colleges were relying on the same pool of resources as the public universities which lacked staff and facilities," Prof Ala'Aldeen says.The problem of staffing was particularly acute in medicine, pharmacy and dentistry and in postgraduate studies.But Prof Ala'Aldeen faced protests and opposition.He was accused of trying to transplant the UK system onto Kurdistan, something he vehemently denies since he was educated and worked in his home region, before coming to study in the UK."I knew the system from the inside and studied what had happened in similar countries. I wanted to apply international principles of quality, but tailor-made to Kurdish traditions," he says.He responded by redoubling his efforts to communicate the purpose of the reforms, which also included curriculum development, moving beyond a single teacher delivering a lecture to a class, the introduction of an electronic admissions system and reforming the teaching of PhDs.In the end, the government closed three private universities as well as five health-related colleges, three pharmacy colleges and two dentistry ones."If we had allowed the system to keep evolving as it was it would have taken at least a generation to fix it - a generation would have been wasted. We knew we had to act fast. It was a risky policy, but it would have been far riskier to do nothing," he says.The speed of his action was criticised as were aspects of the efforts to improve teaching standards, such as student feedback being used to measure teacher performance and pay. There was also opposition to teachers being asked to engage in professional development once a week.Prof Brendan O'Leary, director of the programme in ethnic conflict at the University of Pennsylvania, says that a longer process might have worked better.But he says it was against a background when unprecedented changes were happening in Kurdish society as the region opened up to foreign investment."The Kurdistan region is going through a difficult and fast-paced transformation."Ideally a long and rich discussion is needed to agree new institutional conditions to enable higher education to flourish in a region emerging from decades of destruction, war, genocide, internal fighting, academic isolation and lack of resources."University and institutional reforms are more likely to succeed if all the stakeholders have clear ideas on what to do, when, and at what pace. One should not be surprised if people with vested interests fear reforms," said Prof O'Leary.Thomas Hill, assistant professor at New York University Center for Global Affairs, adds: "I do not believe there is consensus even now that the reforms the former minister wanted to implement would have been in the best interest of the Kurdistan region."There are many, many people with very conservative views within the higher education sector in the Kurdistan region and many did not and do not like the progressive path the former minister was plotting."There were areas in which vested interests remained unmoved. Prof Ala'Aldeen could not increase the independence of universities.The government continues to choose university leaders and universities have been totally dependent on government funding.Prof Ala'Aldeen put together draft legislation on institutional autonomy, but says the challenge to the status quo was too great to push it through.He is in close touch with the current government and is pleased that the reforms to improve quality have been maintained, despite the fact that there is still not consensus in favour of them, and says the scholarship programme is already making a difference."Almost 3,000 students have studied abroad, the majority in the UK. Half of these are or will be back by the end of this year. They will provide leadership and bring a breath of fresh air. They will link their institutions to the outside world and break Kurdistan's academic isolation."Although Kurdistan has its own particular circumstances, Prof Ala'Aldeen says that the problems facing the university system are not unique - and that the model for modernisation could be applied elsewhere in the Middle East."The problems are generic and the solutions can be implemented anywhere in the world."Commentators on Kurdistan's politics agree. Prof O'Leary says: "The Kurdistan region, Iraq and several other states in the Middle East are going through dramatic changes, and in some cases, deeply regrettable authoritarian restorations."Most institutions are highly politicised in these societies. If the Kurdistan region can successfully reform its education system, including higher education, it can provide a model for the wider Middle East."</body>

      <title>Angry Birds fires into the classroom</title>
      <description>Do video games have a place in the classroom?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24228473</url>
      <date>1380236413</date>
      <body>From Angry Birds to Minecraft, computer games are invading the classroom. But this is not going on behind the teacher's back anymore: it is part of the lesson plan.The average young person will have spent 10,000 hours gaming by the time they are 21 years old, research suggests.This has been mainly for entertainment, providing light relief from the maths textbooks and science experiments taking place in classrooms. But gaming is taking up more time of a child's life.For a child in the US with perfect attendance, 10,080 hours will be spent in school from fifth grade (age 10) to high school graduation, according to game designer Jane McGonigal.In the UK, computer games offering "stealth learning" have been used by many schools. But the big developers have generally, so far at least, not been keen to get involved.Angry Birds creator Rovio has brought Angry Birds Playground, a schools initiative devised with the University of Helsinki in Finland, into the kindergarten classroom of children, aimed at six-year-olds.With the initiative already in use in Finland, Rovio has now entered into an agreement with schools in China."With small children, the Finnish approach to education is very much play-orientated," says Sanna Lukander, vice president of book publishing at Rovio Entertainment."These characters and their world seemed to inspire children. You can't not think about how you might motivate children to do more than play."Finland is rated as having the best education system in the developed world.And it is not just the same edition of Angry Birds re-packaged: it is using the now-famous characters in new education-based games and a "full 360-degree approach to learning" involving books, teachers and digital devices.But what is it that children can learn from computer games which can really help with the hard learning needed in the classroom?"Games have a larger effect on learning than traditional materials in particular areas, like language acquisition, science, mathematics and social studies," says games scholar Professor Constance Steinkuehler, a former White House analyst."It's not just making the game, it's then about going back and assessing it - is it having the impact and educating in the way you hoped?"If you're talking about games in the classroom, games aren't the only vehicle for learning. You have a teacher, you have peer interaction and a structure of activities, that all plays a role, whether it's productive or whether it's rubbish."It's just like giving a textbook - you can have a fabulous one you can do great stuff with or not."And Rovio is keen to point out that it is not just the games having an impact in the classroom."Angry Birds Playground is not an educational game, it's an educational environment," says Ms Lukander."We couldn't put Angry Birds stickers on learning and just export it. It's a lot of careful RandD and research. It's been in the works for two and a half years."What this means is more than just using a slingshot to launch birds at pigs.Rovio has already worked with the publishers Penguin, National Geographic, Nasa, the National Geographic and others on educational books. It is not even branding itself as a games company but as a media company,But it is not the only media company in educational games.At the more avant garde end of games aimed at educating children, there are shooting games attempting to make chewing vegetables seem cool right through to combating sexually transmitted infections with a choice of superhero characters like Willy the Kid.Yes, really.More widely, Minecraft, the virtual world game, is being used in classrooms in all sorts of innovative ways."Minecraft is one of the most important games for learning right now," says Prof Steinkuehler."What kids are doing with Minecraft is mind-blowing. It's just amazing."In a classroom at Reykjavik University in Iceland, just like many others, Minecraft is used as a 3D graphical interface to help young people understand the basics of telling a computer what to do.According to MinecraftEdu, which is working with around 1,000 schools, the game is being used in every subject area across all school age groups, providing digital building blocks of what a lesson can demonstrate and teach.But interestingly, Minecraft is blocked by a number of school firewalls.And there are those who think games in the classroom do more harm than good."Gaming in the classroom might be frivolous at worst or entertaining at best," says teacher and author Dr Gary Stager.Current systems of education, Dr Stager argues, are seen as "unpleasant, tortuous and create a league table of winners and losers". But games in the classroom are not the way to fix it."The games developed for education tend to be a lot less fun, interesting and merely test prior knowledge," he says."Worst of all, they're coercive. Adults are taking something kids love - games - and using them in a coercive fashion to deliver curriculum."But the technology companies working with children see the move towards gaming and technology as inevitable. LeapFrog's LeapPad2 tablet device was one of the best-selling toys last year."Children already live in a multi-screen environment," says Sally Plumridge, LeapFrog's international marketing director."The whole world they work in is much more interactive. Bringing gaming into their lives really allows them to develop those cognitive skills.""There's still a need to learn in a traditional way; however, the way that traditional learning extends into new technologies just gives a different dimension to education and a more practical dimension."Children develop in role play and looking what their parents do. From a very early age, they see their parents with tablets and phones."Their instincts in that world of what to do and when to do it are much more enhanced than our own. We're learning it and they're growing up with it."Perhaps that is why so many parents look to their children for help when their phone stops working - they've spent 10,000 hours on these devices before they turn 21.</body>

      <title>The parents' long goodbye</title>
      <description>How parents cope when children head to university</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24208545</url>
      <date>1380157439</date>
      <body>More than 400,000 youngsters are starting university in the UK this year. That means hundreds of thousands of parents saying goodbye.The approach road to the student village is a long traffic jam of family cars, stuffed full with boxes, pillows, nervous families, memories and expectations.This is the very first day at university - parents taking their children and getting ready to say goodbye.It's one of those big events that never makes the headlines but will have been ringed in the diaries of hundreds of thousands of families.On motorways and trains, more than 421,000 youngsters will be making this symbolic journey. After months of anticipation, checklists on fridge doors, last meals at home, last drink with friends, it's now here.At the University of Sheffield, a stream of parents arrive with their sons and daughters at the Endcliffe Student Village. There are balloons, music, banners and the upbeat banter of student radio in a well-orchestrated welcome.It's like the first day at an academic holiday resort. Parents and their teenage children look around the newly-refurbished student union bar as if they are about to begin one last family trip.But under the South Yorkshire autumn sunshine there's no escaping the poignancy. For parents, this is what they've always wanted for their children and many will have quietly dreaded. It's a bittersweet journey.No one wants to spoil this big first day, but it's no secret that they'll be thinking about the empty room at home.There are T-shirted volunteers all around ready to help anyone looking lost. They know the teenagers are going to have worries.And what do the new arrivals most want to know about? Internet connection, of course. It's their most urgent concern, say the helpers. Not so much Generation Y as Generation Wi-fi.Meanwhile their dads, looking misty-eyed, have the conversations that they have at times of big emotions. They talk huskily about parking problems and the fleeting nature of mobile phone signals.It's a mixture of epic understatement and Alan Partridge as parents fill the long silences by talking about the ring roads that have brought them there.Suitcases and boxes full of gadgets are lugged along neat paths in the shade of newly planted trees. There will soon be 3,000 youngsters living here. There's a beach-themed party already lined up and a whole week of ice-breaking activities.There's a long gaggle of arrivals waiting to check in. There are girls who have travelled with clingy soon-to-be ex-boyfriends; there are siblings suddenly close to each other instead of fighting.But the biggest group are mothers, fathers and a teenager now taller than them. They stand together like they might have done on the first day of primary school. If there was a Club 45 to 55, it would look like this.Their estates and people-carriers look like the cars bought a few years ago for a young family, the ghosts of child seats still pressed into the upholstery.The university has put on a friendly face to help the new students over this threshold.In fact, universities have had a major collective make-over in their bid to attract students. There has been a campus building boom since the increase in tuition fees.Alongside the rigorous academic stuff, universities are also selling a leisure experience. It's part-science park, part-theme park.The student union bar at Sheffield has been re-vamped. Forget student unions with sticky carpets and punctured leatherette. It's now all clean, airy and comfortable and the bar manager at Sheffield says these days it's driven more by food than booze.If parents want to visit, Sheffield has just opened its own campus hotel.Even on their first day, it won't be an entirely unfamiliar environment for the new students. Before they arrive they will have been using social networking to get to know their future flatmates. They're bringing enough computer technology to launch a space mission, so keeping in touch with home should be easier than ever before.There is still time for some instant re-invention. Starting at university is one of the most significant changes for any young person. They will have spent several weeks deciding the big academic questions, like what they should wear in the bar.The first night is the stuff of myth. There are people you meet and then spend three years avoiding and people you meet on a corridor and then become friends with for the rest of your life. There will be freshers' week stories of excessive drinking, ineffective cooking and misguided outfits.These new students are entering their own soap opera of romance, friendship and ambition. It's a huge adventure that they've worked hard for years to achieve and for which they'll be paying for many years afterwards.But after the small talk over cups of coffee and a constant stream of text messages, there is no escaping where this is heading. For many families, if childhood has a final moment, this is it.The door closes on a student's room and parents and children go their separate ways.</body>

      <title>Glastonbury 2014 tickets sell out</title>
      <description>Glastonbury Festival organisers Michael and Emily Eavis say they are "blown away" by demand as tickets for 2014 sell out in one hour 27 minutes.</description>

      <body>Tickets for next year's Glastonbury Festival have sold out in record time, according to organisers.Michael and Emily Eavis issued a joint statement confirming all 120,000 remaining tickets had been sold in just one hour and 27 minutes.They said they were "blown away" by the numbers logging on and were "genuinely sorry" that so many had missed out.Ticketing website See Tickets had earlier apologised to customers on Twitter for "technical difficulties".The site, which had been managing the sale of tickets for Glastonbury, wrote that the issues had led to "a very difficult half an hour" before the site stabilised, later adding that it was selling 3,000 tickets a minute.Prices for the 2014 event had been increased by £10 to £210, plus a booking fee, but festival-goers could pay a deposit of £50 before settling their bill in April.For the first time, coach packages were available three days earlier, with all 15,000 tickets selling out in half an hour.A statement by the father and daughter Eavis team, Michael and Emily, was posted on the festival's own Twitter feed, saying: "We genuinely try to make the ticket system as fair as it can be, but when demand outstrips supply, it is an unfortunate inevitability that some people will be left disappointed."They went on to thank people for their "incredible support", adding: "We really don't take it for granted and we are exceedingly fortunate to have that loyalty."No acts have yet been confirmed to play at the festival at Worthy Farm between 26 and 29 June next year, but there is already speculation about who will headline.David Bowie is one of the bookies' favourites, with other rumours including Foo Fighters and Fleetwood Mac.This year saw Arctic Monkeys, Rolling Stones and Mumford and Sons top the bill on the festival's famous Pyramid Stage.</body>

      <title>Haim beat Justin to top album chart</title>
      <description>Californian sisters Haim deny Justin Timberlake his fourth UK number one album as their debut album Days Are Gone enters the chart at number one.</description>

      <date>1381082411</date>
      <body>US band Haim have denied Justin Timberlake his fourth UK number one album, after topping the chart with their debut, Days Are Gone.Timberlake's album, The 20/20 Experience 2 of 2, had led midweek sales by just 28 copies but was overtaken by Californian sisters, Haim.In the singles chart, OneRepublic's Counting Stars claimed victory from The Vamps' Can We Dance.The Official Charts Company said it was "the closest race of the year".Ryan Tedder's band OneRepublic secured its first UK number one after rising two places, with just 1,150 copies standing between the two tracks.The debut record from Haim, made up of sisters Este, Danielle and Alana, had been eagerly anticipated since the band won the BBC's Sound Of 2013 poll in January.Days Are Gone features their three hit singles Don't Save Me, Falling and The Wire, which the band dedicated to Prime Minister David Cameron when they both appeared on the Andrew Marr programme on BBC One last week.It finished the week 2,100 copies ahead of the second instalment of Timberlake's 20/20 Experience album series.The original album, which is still at number 33 in the chart, spent three weeks at Number 1 in March and was the star's third consecutive UK number one album.Last week's number one album - Mechanical Bull by Kings Of Leon - slipped down to three, with Arctic Monkeys' AM static at four and Drake's Nothing Was The Same down to five.Dizzee Rascal's The Fifth enterted the album chart at number ten, while his new single Something Really Bad took the same position in the single's chart.Jason Derulo's single Talk Dirty FT 2 Chainz dropped to number three with Katy Perry's Roar in fourth and Chase and Status in fifth with Count On Me FT Moko.This week's chart also saw Avicii's Wake Me Up become one of the UK's biggest-selling singles of all time, after it broke through the million copies sales barrier on Sunday.The Official Charts Company said the track is only the 140th single to achieve this milestone, and the third of 2013 behind Daft Punk's Get Lucky FT Pharrell Williams and Nile Rodgers, and Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines FT TI and Pharrell Williams.Wake Me Up, by 24-year-old Swedish DJ and Producer Avicii, spent three consecutive weeks at number one after debuting in that position in July, and denied One Direction their fourth UK chart topper with Best Song Ever.</body>

      <body>Lord Sugar has been investigated by police after he was accused of posting a racist message on Twitter.The businessman and star of The Apprentice posted a photo of a child apparently of Chinese origin crying.He wrote: "The kid in the middle is upset because he was told off for leaving the production line of the iPhone 5."Merseyside Police said it had investigated a complaint but said "no criminal offences" had taken place.Lord Sugar's spokesman said he would not be commenting on the complaint.Liverpool shop owner Nichola Szeto had taken offence about the reference to the Asian factories where the mobile phones are produced and complained about the "racist tweet" to the Metropolitan Police.She was then contacted by Merseyside Police and went to a Liverpool police station to make a statement about the tweet, which was posted on 30 September.A police spokesman said: "Merseyside Police can confirm officers received a complaint in relation to the tweet sent on the evening of Sunday September 30."The communication has been examined by the force's specialist hate crime investigation team and at this time it has been recorded as a hate incident and no criminal offences have taken place."Officers from the specialist team will be contacting the person who made the initial complaint to discuss this."</body>

      <body>Funding for the BBC's arts coverage will go up by 20%, the broadcaster's director general is to announce.Tony Hall - who used to run the Royal Opera House - says he wants to return the arts to the corporation's "heart".It will mean plays, art exhibitions and more live music from around the UK being broadcast on the BBC.Among Lord Hall's proposals are a new "BBC Arts at" brand and new television series fronted by historian Simon Schama and broadcaster Andrew Marr.The director general, formerly the BBC's head of news, returned to the corporation following the Jimmy Savile scandal.He wants to see the BBC collaborate more with arts institutions around the country.In a speech on Tuesday he is expected to unveil new partnerships with London's British Museum, the Tate and the Manchester International Festival.The plans mean that more opening nights, major exhibitions and arts events will be shown live on television.An experimental digital service known as The Space, developed by the BBC and Arts Council England, is also due to be relaunched in 2014."Arts programming sits right at the heart of the BBC and is a vital part of who we are, but I want us to to be much more ambitious," Lord Hall said."We need to showcase more of the incredible talent that this country has to offer to the widest possible audiences.He is due to announce major new television series featuring two faces familiar to BBC audiences.Mr Schama will front a five-part series in partnership with the National Portrait Gallery exploring the history of Britain through portraiture.A series looking at the greatest writers in Scotland will be presented by journalist Mr Marr.And there will be a series of six BBC One programmes seeking to uncover the "hidden heroes" of British art, with 10 amateurs competing for the title of Britain's best artists.The announcement is part of the director general's new strategy for the BBC and comes as the corporation looks to cut 2,000 jobs over five years after the freezing of the licence fee.</body>

      <title>Italian director Carlo Lizzani dies</title>
      <description>Police investigate a suspected suicide after 91-year-old film director Carlo Lizzani falls from a balcony at his house in Rome, local reports say.</description>

      <body>Tributes are being paid to Italian director Carlo Lizzani, 91, who died on Saturday after falling from a third-floor balcony at his house in Rome.Local news agencies said authorities were investigating if it was suicide.Lizzani, who was head of the Venice Film Festival for four years, directed 1968 film The Violent Four and worked on Rossellini's Germany Year Zero.Fellow Italian director Ettore Scola told the ANSA news agency: "This is a time of great sadness."President Giorgio Napolitano, who had known Lizzani for decades, honoured the filmmaker for his contributions to "cinema, to culture and to the democratic development of our country".Lizzani started out as a film critic and then screenwriter for famous neo-realist, Rossellini.As well as a writing credit on his 1948 film, Germany Year Zero, Lizzani also earned an Oscar nomination for his work on Giuseppe De Santis' 1950 film Bitter Rice.He was awarded best director by the Academy of Italian Cinema in 1968 for his own film The Violent Four about a manhunt for bank robbers.He won its best screenwriter award for 1996 film Celluloide about the making of Rossellini's masterpiece, Rome, Open City.Throughout his career Lizzani collaborated with film directors including, Jean-Luc Godard, Marco Bellocchio, Bernardo Bertolucci and Pier Paolo Pasolini.He directed the Venice Film Festival from 1979-1982, and was a member of the jury of the Berlin Film Festival in 1994.Paolo Baratta, president of the Biennale - which includes the film festival - praised Lizzani's work."The Biennale is crying on the day of Carlo Lizzani's death," said Baratta."He knew how to give the festival new energy. He knew how to create a nucleus of young students and experts that would represent in future years the true elite. The world of Italian cinema owes him a lot."Lizzani began his career just after World War II in 1948 with a documentary about Italian Communist Party leader Palmiro Togliatti.His death comes nearly three years after another well-known director, Mario Monicelli, died after jumping from a hospital window in Rome.</body>

      <body>An Oxford University music student has won the Bryn Terfel Scholarship at the Urdd Gobaith Cymru youth competition in Aberystwyth.Flautist Chloe Angharad-Bradshaw from Hengoed, Caerphilly county, took the £4,000 prize following a concert at the Great Hall in Aberystwyth Arts Centre.Judges called her a "master at creating the fine sound of the flute".Ms Angharad-Bradshaw plans to use the money to pay for travel expenses to overseas auditions for further study.As well as her studies at Oxford, she is also president of the university's music society and a member of the orchestra and sinfonietta.She said of the win: "I really enjoyed performing tonight, even though I was very nervous before performing my first piece."The other competitors were very professional, friendly and it was great to get a chance to share a stage with them."When they announced my name as the winner, I could not believe my ears and I just couldn't stop smiling."With the scholarship money, I am going to use it towards a masters degree. I've seen a few courses that appeal in Europe and the USA and this money will enable me to pay for flights to auditions abroad."Judge Eirian Owen praised all six competitors, adding: "They were all experienced in their field and mature performers but the winner did stand out."Even though it was close, we were unanimous that Chloe was the winner."Chloe's technique on the flute is excellent. She is obviously a master at creating the fine sound of the flute and I'm sure that she will go far."The prize was established by opera singer Bryn Terfel in 1999 to nurture young singing talent in Wales and is open to winners of eight specified competitions at the Urdd National Eisteddfod, an annual Welsh-language youth festival of literature, music and performing arts.</body>

      <description>Pop star Miley Cyrus hits back at Sinead O'Connor, after the Irish singer warned her not to be exploited by the music business.</description>

      <body>Pop star Miley Cyrus has hit back at Sinead O'Connor, after the Irish singer warned her not to be exploited by the music business.In a series of tweets, Cyrus mocked O'Connor, comparing her to US actress Amanda Bynes before alluding to O'Connor's mental health problems.O'Connor responded with another open letter to the singer, accusing her of "irresponsible" behaviour.The Irish singer told her to "remove her tweets immediately".The tit-for-tat conversation began after Cyrus, 20, cited O'Connor's video Nothing Compares 2 U as an inspiration for her explicit Wrecking Ball video.O'Connor, 46, said she was prompted to write, "in the spirit of motherliness" after "phone calls from various newspapers" who wanted the singer-songwriter to comment upon similarities between the two videos.In the video for Nothing Compares 2 U, O'Connor sheds a single tear as she performs the Prince-penned break-up ballad.Cyrus cries in the promo clip for Wrecking Ball, which shares similar lyrical themes to O'Connor's song. But the video also finds her licking a sledgehammer and swinging naked on a metal demolition ball.O'Connor said she was "extremely concerned" that those around Cyrus had led or encouraged her to believe "that it is in any way 'cool' to be naked and licking sledgehammers in your videos".Cyrus, who found fame as the child star of Disney children's show Hannah Montana, has been criticised in recent weeks for her controversial performances, particularly at the MTV Video Music Awards in Brooklyn last month.O'Connor continued: "The message you keep sending is that it's somehow cool to be prostituted.. it's so not cool Miley... it's dangerous."It is in fact the case that you will obscure your talent by allowing yourself to be pimped, whether it's the music business or yourself doing the pimping," added O'Connor.Responding on Twitter, Cyrus wrote: "Top of the mornin to ya."She added a screen shot of O'Connor's tweets from 2012 in which the Irish star, who has bi-polar disorder, referred to her own mental health problems, asking for Twitter followers to recommend a psychiatrist.She compared the singer to former child actress Amanda Bynes, who is currently undergoing psychiatric treatment."I don't have time to write you an open letter cause I'm hosting and performing on SNL this week," Cyrus continued.Cyrus also tweeted a picture of O'Connor ripping up a photograph of the pope, an infamous on-stage stunt by the singer, before asking her to "meet up and talk".Responding to Cyrus in a third open letter, O'Connor said she would take legal action against her if she did not remove the tweets."You have posted today tweets of mine which are two years old, which were posted by me when I was unwell and seeking help so as to make them look like they are recent."In doing so you mock myself and Amanda Bynes for having suffered with mental health issues and for having sought help," said O'Connor.She added: "It is most unbecoming of you to respond in such a fashion to someone who expressed care for you," O'Connor added.</body>

      <description>Channel 4's Jay Hunt denies racing pundit John McCririck claims that she was a "serial age discrimination offender".</description>

      <date>1380898859</date>
      <body>Channel 4's Jay Hunt has denied racing pundit John McCririck's claims that she was a "serial age discrimination offender".Speaking at an employment tribunal in London, Ms Hunt said she felt there was "no correlation" between younger presenters drawing younger audiences.She accused Mr McCririck of making "false allegations".The 73-year-old - who was dropped by the channel last year - is accusing his former employers of age discrimination.Ms Hunt - chief creative officer at Channel 4 - told the tribunal she had instigated voluntary training courses on discrimination at the broadcaster after she joined from the BBC, adding that she had "learned her lesson" from the Miriam O'Reilly case.Ms O'Reilly, who was in her 50s when she was dropped from the BBC's Countryfile programme, won an age discrimination case against the corporation in 2011.Mr McCririck had cited Moira Stuart's decision to leave the BBC while Ms Hunt was the BBC's controller of daytime. Ms Hunt said she had no involvement in the Stuart decision.In a statement, Ms Hunt noted: "John McCririck's allegation that I am a 'serial age discrimination offender' is untrue."I have been responsible for a channel or part of a channel for the past eight years. In that time, hundreds of on-screen talent decisions have been run past me by those making them."Only one of those decisions has ever led to a claim of age discrimination and, contrary to what John McCririck says, I have learnt from that case."She added: "I had no reason to believe that anyone in the team which worked up the new programme had acted on the grounds of John McCririck's age, and that remains the position."'Chauvanistic extraordinaire'Jamie Aitchison, Channel 4's commissioning editor for sport - who was responsible for dropping Mr McCririck from the channel's horse-racing coverage - told a tribunal earlier this week that the pundit's "exaggerated tone" was "out of step" with the channel's coverage.His opinion was echoed by a senior television producer, giving evidence on Friday, who had previously called for Mr McCririck to be dropped from the revamped racing line-up.Carl Hicks, part of production company IMG - which is also being sued by Mr McCririck - told the central London hearing that the commentator "was not appropriate and there was not an appropriate role for him"."John was an eccentric and seen, at worst, as a loud-mouthed and chauvinistic extraordinaire which was not what I wanted to be part of the team to broaden racing."He also told the hearing that Mr McCririck was inclined to upset his fellow colleagues.In his tribunal witness statement, he said: "My view remained that John McCririck was not right for the programme and I thought he should not be included in any capacity."I was fully aware that John was one of the most recognisable faces in horseracing," adding that he held the pundit's expertise for the subject in the highest regard."However, I did not think his exaggerated presentation style was consistent with a more serious programme and was aware that he had a potential to offend and alienate viewers and potential viewers.In March 2012, Channel 4 secured the rights to broadcast all UK horse racing events for the following year, including "crown jewel" events such as Royal Ascot and the Grand National. A new-look team, fronted by Clare Balding, took over last year.The hearing continues.</body>

      <title>Shankar addresses Delhi gang rape</title>
      <description>Musician Anoushka Shankar says she decided to reveal her own experiences of sexual abuse after the gang rape and murder of a woman in Delhi.</description>

      <date>1380907941</date>
      <body>Musician Anoushka Shankar says she was prompted to reveal her experience of sexual abuse after learning of the gang rape and murder of a woman in Delhi.Shankar, daughter of legendary Indian sitar player Ravi Shankar, said in February she had been abused by "a man my parents trusted" in her childhood.Her revelation followed the fatal attack on an Indian student, for which four men have been sentenced to death."Her story is the apex of millions of stories," Shankar told BBC Radio 4.Speaking on the Front Row programme, she said: "No-one I knew could help being affected by the gravity and intensity of that attack - and if it resonates with something in our experience then obviously it doubles the impact of hearing a story like that."I felt quite conscious as an Indian woman that there was a very unique moment happening where the entire world's attention was on sexual violence and on the role and position of women in India."I felt almost an obligation [to talk about my experience]. It didn't feel dragged out of me. If I was ever going to talk about my story, that felt like the right moment."Shankar, 32, took the decision to talk about her experiences in a video, recorded in her London home, in which she appealed for people to support a campaign in memory of the gang rape victim."As a child I suffered sexual and emotional abuse for several years at the hands of a man my parents trusted implicitly," she said.She added the attacks had included "groping, touching and verbal abuse".Reflecting on the statement, the musician told Front Row's John Wilson: "It was something I never spoke to the media about."It had never felt like something relevant in a public context until this moment where I thought 'hang on, it's important for people to realise that this kind of thing can happen to anyone, anywhere'."I think there's a class issue in India where there can be an assumption that things like this don't happen to people from upper classes or who are privileged. I think part of what shocked people within India was that [the victim] was a middle-class girl. It's so ridiculous."The musician has responded to the attack, and tried to address its causes, with a track on her new album, Traces Of You.She said the song, which references the 23-year-old victim's name in its title, tries to capture a sense of the horror of the attack.The album, recorded with producer Nitin Sawhney and her sister Norah Jones, also addresses the death of her father last year.Shankar said her experiences had informed the spirit of the record, and brought a sense of "resilience" to the music."It's not necessarily about the passing of my father, it's about me passing through the passing of my father."There's a way that we all go through horrible and painful things and I'm not nullifying it in any way when I say we do go on."My childhood experiences were one of the big experiences for me [but] I know as a woman I've come through that."At some cost, but I've come through it."You can hear the full interview with Anoushka Shankar on BBC Radio 4's Front Row at 19:15 BST on 4 October, 2013. It will then be available on the iPlayer.</body>

      <body>More than £2.3m has been raised for charity as dozens of Gromit statues were auctioned in Bristol.All 81 of the sculptures were sold for Wallace and Gromit's Grand Appeal, which is raising £3.5m for an expansion of Bristol Royal Hospital for Children.One lot, Gromit Lightyear, designed by animation studio Pixar and based on the Toy Story character, sold for £65,000.Nick Park, who created the Gromit character, said he was "stunned" by how much had been raised."I couldn't wait to see the Pixar Gromit Lightyear go because obviously that was a top runner," Mr Park said."It just kept going up. When the first few started climbing I started tingling. It was double the target."It is obviously for the children's hospital, everyone has been so generous, the people in the room, on the internet and the artists," he added.Bidders packed into a specially erected pavilion at Bristol's Cribbs Causeway shopping centre, with almost 2,000 more taking part in the action online.One of the unsuccessful bidders was five-year-old Thom Clarke from Fishponds.He wrote a letter to the "Gromit keepers" to say he had visited all of the statues over the summer and Blossom was his favourite."I have £11.57 saved up and I would like to bid my money on Blossom please."I hope I win," he said.The Grand Appeal hopes to fund state-of-the-art equipment, family facilities and child-friendly artwork to complement a £31m investment by the NHS.Last month a pre-auction show of the Gromit sculptures, called The Greatest Dog Show On Earth, drew crowds of about 22,000.They had previously been displayed around the city during the summer and quickly became a popular tourist attraction.While the majority of the sculptures were based around Bristol, there were others at London Paddington station, Westonbirt Arboretum in Gloucestershire, Cheddar Gorge in Somerset and Hawkesbury Upton, South Gloucestershire.The trail attracted visitors from numerous countries across Europe, the Americas and Asia.</body>

      <body>Photojournalist Bill Eppridge - who took images of the aftermath of Robert Kennedy's assassination - has died aged 75.Eppridge died in hospital in Connecticut from a blood infection caused by a fall.His image of Kennedy lying on the floor of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles is widely considered one of the greatest news photos of all time.He worked for Life Magazine at the time of the shooting in 1968.Friend and fellow photographer David Hume Kennerly said: "He extended a helping hand and a bushel of inspiration to me, and his kindness shaped the course of my career.Born in Buenos Aires, Eppridge moved to the US with his family as a young boy.Working as a staff photographer for Life Magazine from 1964, he covered a wide variety of stories from revolutions in Latin America to the Beatles' arrival in the US.Eppridge followed Kennedy from a campaign event at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles into the back kitchen where a 24-year-old Palestinian Christian, Sirhan Sirhan, shot and killed the 42-year-old presidential hopeful.Eppridge took several black and white images that night, but the most enduring and haunting depicted Kennedy lying on the floor, with a halo of light in the background, with a hotel worker at his side."You are not just a photojournalist, you're a historian," he once explained when asked how he could keep snapping pictures while someone was lying injured in front of him.Commenting on his unforgettable image of Kennedy, he said: "I never hung it on my wall."His 1965 photo essay about a drug-addicted New York couple inspired the Al Pacino film The Panic in Needle Park.After leaving Life in 1972, Eppridge worked for other magazines including Time and Sports Illustrated.Before his death, he and his wife, Adrienne Aurichio, had been putting the finishing touches to a book on the Beatles, to mark next year's 50th anniversary of their arrival to the US.</body>

      <body>Morrissey's autobiography is to be published later this month after the former Smiths singer resolved a dispute with his publisher that had threatened to derail the book's release.Last month, the singer claimed "a last-minute content disagreement" with Penguin had led the deal to "collapse".Despite initially saying he was seeking a new publisher, Morrissey has now patched up relations with Penguin.Penguin Classics said Autobiography by Morrissey would come out on 17 October.That is a month later than the original publication date of 16 September.A Penguin spokesperson declined to comment on the cause of the dispute and the delay.The memoir is expected to lift the lid on the 54-year-old's life growing up in Manchester and his relationship with his former bandmates in The Smiths, one of the most important bands in British music.He has enjoyed a successful solo career since the band split up in 1987 and is also known for outspoken views on animal cruelty, politics and the royal family.This year, the singer suffered a series of what he referred to as "medical mishaps" which led to him cancelling his US tour.He was also forced to cancel part of his South American tour in July due, he said, to a "lack of funding".</body>

      <body>Crime writer Alexander McCall Smith has become the latest contemporary writer invited to reinterpret the work of Jane Austen for a modern audience.The Edinburgh-based author said being asked to write a 21st Century version of Emma was "like being asked to eat a box of delicious chocolates".McCall Smith's take on Emma will be published next autumn, 199 years after the original's debut.Joanna Trollope's version of Sense and Sensibility is due out this month.Val McDermid's interpretation of Northanger Abbey will follow next year, while a new version of Pride and Prejudice by US writer Curtis Sittenfeld comes out in 2015.The names of two more writers who are taking part in the six-book Austen Project will be announced later this year."Writing a contemporary version of Emma is both a privilege and a real challenge," said McCall Smith, best known as the author of The No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency."Not only is Emma one of the finest novels in the English language, but it is possibly Jane Austen's most thought-provoking and interesting book."Trollope said it was "wonderful to hear" that McCall Smith was taking on Emma, a heroine she said would "benefit" from being "handled by a man".The project's authors have to stick with their individual novel's existing plot and characters, but are free to make some changes.Emma tells of an immature young woman whose attempts to play matchmaker backfire both on herself and those she attempts to bring together.Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Beckinsale are among those to have played the character on screen, while the story was successfully transplanted to a modern setting in 1995 film Clueless.Mansfield Park and Sense and Sensibility are the other two titles that will be adapted as part of the Harper Collins project, one of several attempts to adapt or continue Austen's works.Others include Death Comes to Pemberley, a 2011 sequel to Pride and Prejudice by P D James that is currently being turned into a BBC TV series.</body>

      <date>1380793310</date>
      <body>The director of Diana says he has "no regrets", despite the film's poor reception in the UK.Oliver Hirschbiegel told the BBC that the movie's critical mauling was "devastating, but when you make a film you don't think about the reactions".The Telegraph described the film "a special class of awful", while the Mirror called it "cheap and cheerless".Hirschbiegel admitted the reviews had put off audiences, but he still hoped people would "make their own minds up"."In all the other places where it's opened - in Poland, the Czech Republic, Turkey and Slovakia - it's been very strong," he said."I think for the British, Diana is still a trauma they haven't come to terms with."Starring Naomi Watts, the film depicts Princess Diana in the final years of her life, with a focus on her affair with heart surgeon Hasnat Khan, played by Lost's Naveen Andrews.It entered the UK chart at number five in its opening weekend, taking £623,000 at the box office. This week, it dropped to number nine.Hirschbiegel, who previously made Downfall, a German-language film about the last days of Hitler, called his experiences with Diana "deja vu, because it has the same reactions in the UK as Downfall had in Germany on release"."I hope it is a matter of stepping back and looking at it afresh in a year or so, because it is a very British story and I am a very German director."He added that Diana "was the most complex character I have ever tried to depict - more complex than Hitler. The one thing they both had in common was they were born actors".Earlier this week, at the Zurich Film Festival, Hirschbiegel described the film as "very un-British" and described the critical reaction as harking back "to what newspapers like the Daily Mail would write about her back then - really vile things. So I guess I succeeded."The film has been sold to distributors in more than 40 countries and will be released in the US on 1 November, 2013.</body>

      <title>Farrow paternity story 'absurd'</title>
      <description>Speculation that Frank Sinatra and not Woody Allen may be the father of Mia Farrow's 25-year-old son Ronan is dismissed by both Allen's spokesman and Sinatra's widow.</description>

      <date>1380797137</date>
      <body>Speculation that Woody Allen may not be the father of Mia Farrow's son Ronan has been dismissed as "absurd" by the director's spokesman.The claims are "so fictitious and extravagantly absurd that he is not going to comment," said his spokesman.Farrow's admission to Vanity Fair that Ronan may "possibly" have been fathered by ex-husband Frank Sinatra has also been rubbished by the singer's widow."It's just a bunch of junk," Barbara Sinatra told the Desert Sun newspaper."There's always junk written - lies that aren't true," the 85-year-old said on Wednesday. "It sounds like a phony to me."Ronan Farrow, 25, has made his own comment on the story, tweeting: "Listen, we're all *possibly* Frank Sinatra's son."Mia Farrow's comments came in a lengthy article in Vanity Fair's November issue, which also contains quotes from eight of the actress's children.In excerpts released ahead of its publication, Farrow claims she and Sinatra "never really split up" following the end of their two-year marriage in 1968.Farrow subsequently married, and divorced, the composer Andre Previn, with whom she had three children and adopted three more.The actress went on to have both a professional and personal relationship with Allen, with whom she had Ronan - originally named Satchel - in 1987.The revelation that Allen was having a secret affair with Farrow's adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn caused the break-up of their 12-year relationship in 1992.This led to a bitter custody battle in which Allen was accused of molesting their adopted daughter Dylan, charges Allen denied and which have never been proved.Dylan, who now goes under the name Malone, refers to the alleged molestation in the Vanity Fair article, claiming she had been "scared" and had "wanted it to stop"."I have never been asked to testify," she is quoted as saying.

      <title>Beatles memorabilia price gap probed</title>
      <description>An inquiry is launched after £2m of public money was used to buy Beatles memorabilia later revalued at £300,000.</description>

      <body>An inquiry has been launched after £2m of public money was used to buy Beatles memorabilia later revalued at £300,000.The review of the 2008 purchase by Merseytravel began when auditors found a conflict of interest between the valuer and seller.KPMG said "serious failures" occurred when the transport authority bought items including John Lennon's glasses for The Beatles Story museum.Merseytravel said "due process" was not followed but changes had been made.The authority took over the running of the museum in 2008.It bought Lennon's wire-rimmed glasses for a permanent exhibition at The Beatles Story museum which it runs along with two other Merseyside visitor attractions.The glasses and other exhibits including handwritten studio notes from Beatles producer George Martin were revalued as part of an internal scrutiny process.When the valuation was put at £300,000, Merseytravel started its own investigation. The auditor, KPMG, also found two areas of concern over the purchase.The combined report said: "The person carrying out the valuation had been a company director with the person selling the Beatles' items."Although the conflict was identified, the lawyers were still instructed to proceed with using this valuer."Both issues represent a serious failure in corporate governance."KPMG recommended a "full investigation into the Beatles memorabilia valuation and the authority should take appropriate action".Merseytravel chairman Liam Robinson confirmed its initial investigation showed elements of "due process" were not followed.He said: "We will look to take action if we establish that we were let down by those we were relying on at the time and that the interests of the taxpayer were not well served in the original negotiation."This could not happen now. Our new governance and scrutiny processes would not allow it."Mr Robinson added The Beatles Story was "unaffected by this revaluation" and "remains profitable".KPMG concluded it was "satisfied" that Merseytravel had "proper arrangements in place for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in their use of resources."</body>

      <description>Glee star Cory Monteith died of a fatal cocktail of heroin and alcohol, a coroner's report concludes.</description>

      <body>Glee star Cory Monteith died of a fatal cocktail of heroin and alcohol, a coroner's report has concluded.The 31-year-old star, who played Finn Hudson on the hit TV show, was found dead in a Vancouver hotel in July.Investigators at the scene found drug paraphernalia, including "a spoon with drug residue and a used hypodermic needle, along with two empty champagne bottles and multiple glasses".Coroner Claire Thompson concluded that Monteith's death was "accidental".The final findings support the initial coroner's report into the death of the Canadian actor on 13 July.At the time of his death, Monteith had an alcohol level of 0.13 percent, with a "moderate" level of intoxication. The report also pointed to the presence of morphine, codeine and "6-monoacetylmorphine," a by-product of heroin.Hotel video footage showed the actor returning alone to his room in the early hours of 13 July, marking the final time he was seen alive."He had checked in to the hotel on July 6 and had been expected to check out on the 13th," the report stated. "When he had not done so, hotel staff checked his room and found him unresponsive on the floor."The report concluded the actor had been dead for several hours: "Mr Monteith was clearly deceased and resuscitation was not attempted."Monteith, who had been in Glee since its inception in 2009, was admitted to rehab earlier this year having struggled with addiction since he was a teenager. The coroner's report said the actor's "periods of abstinence ranged from years to months in duration".The report found that his erratic drug use contributed to his death, adding that "after a period of cessation from opiod drug use, a previously tolerated drug concentration level may become toxic and fatal".Glee, which follows a group of American high school misfits who form a singing club, will pay tribute to Monteith in a special episode to be broadcast in the US next week."[The] third episode will deal with the Finn Hudson character being written out of the show," Fox's Kevin Reilly told reporters at a Television Critics Association meeting in August.The show - now in its fifth series - is known for its upbeat pop covers and cameo appearances by celebrities.</body>

      <body>Former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis has appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court to face two further sexual offence charges.Mr Travis, 68, of Mentmore, Bucks, is alleged to have indecently assaulted a woman aged over 16 between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 1993.These are in addition to 12 counts he already faces.Mr Travis, who has indicated he will contest all charges, spoke to confirm his name, address and date of birth.He previously appeared in court to face 12 charges, which are said to have taken place between 1977 and 2007 against nine alleged victims aged between 15 and 29.Leaving the court in central London, Mr Travis, whose real name is David Patrick Griffin, did not make any comment to reporters.Mr Travis was first arrested in November 2012 and charged on 15 August as part of Operation Yewtree, the police investigation which followed the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal, but the accusations against him are not connected with the disgraced ex-DJ and TV presenter.He was charged with the two fresh counts on 1 October.Mr Travis was released on bail following an appearance at the Old Bailey on 6 September on condition that he lives at his Buckinghamshire home and does not contact the alleged victims.Mr Justice Sweeney adjourned the case for a plea and case management hearing on 21 October and fixed a trial date for 4 March 2014.Mr Travis faces the following counts:</body>

      <title>McAvoy: 'I toy with the audience'</title>
      <description>James McAvoy says his new film is "not for the fainthearted"</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24373354</url>
      <date>1380933124</date>
      <body>James McAvoy's latest role as a drug-fuelled corrupt Scottish police officer in Filth will not be for everyone - but the actor tells the BBC that's exactly why he signed up."It's full on and definitely not for the fainthearted, and there's not a lot of that in the film industry," he explains."The character represented an opportunity to take an audience and really toy with them."Filth sees McAvoy as detective sergeant Bruce Robertson, a man whose average day involves casual drug-taking, obscene phone calls, blackmailing young women into sex or sleeping with his friends' wives."You're making somebody laugh, and they know they shouldn't be. And then you're kind of wagging your finger going, 'Shame on you for laughing!'" he continues."Then, when they're feeling bad about themselves, you try and make the audience feel some sympathy. And they're like, 'Oh, there's depth to him! Of course, of course!'"And then you just go, 'No, there's not any depth to me! And you should feel bad about yourself for liking me again'."That just seemed really good fun. To be able to toy with whether they were enjoying it or were repulsed by it or not," he says.Based on the 1998 novel by Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh, some cinema-goers will find plenty to be repulsed by in McAvoy's immoral copper, whose antics become more and more outrageous as he loses touch with reality.Jamie Bell and Imogen Poots play colleagues competing for a promotion, while Jim Broadbent is his psychiatrist and Eddie Marsan a tormented friend.Originally branded "un-filmable", it was relative newcomer Jon S Baird's screenplay that finally convinced Welsh that Filth could be brought to the big screen. But neither was convinced McAvoy was suitable the role."He looked very young this particular day," remembers director Baird, sitting in the very seat at London's Soho Hotel where McAvoy first changed his and Welsh's minds."But 20 minutes after talking to him, he had morphed into this middle-aged, grizzled, alcoholic divorcee. It was pretty mad."He started talking about his experience with mental illness, and that's the thing that bonded us. He had experience of that with somebody he grew up with."As soon as I knew he understood that, it was game over. It was like, 'He is the guy'. We offered him the part the same day."For The Last King of Scotland and Atonement star, it was "a cathartic experience" to portray Bruce as he slowly unravelled.But the star, who recently took a beating in Danny Boyle's psychological thriller Trance, found himself being roughed up again for Filth - except this time he was in drag."I hated being in that outfit," grimaces McAvoy."There's something about being covered in blood and cold and you're having to act all mashed up - it makes me feel abused and not nice."Then he laughs: "And yeah, you look at yourself with a wig on and a beard and blood all over your face and just go, 'How am I ever going to get my wife to fancy me again?'"The pain was worth it - if you believe the cinema-going public in Scotland, where the film was released a week ahead of the rest of the UK and took £250,000 at just 38 screens."Trying to get this thing made over the years, I'm so relieved now that it didn't get made earlier, because it would never have been as good," confesses Welsh, who calls McAvoy's performance "off the scale"."I'm still astonished by it, to be honest. Thinking about all the great iconic solo performances that I've seen in my lifetime, I just can't think of anyone that betters it."He's got to convey loss and pathos, aggression and violence, hatred and manipulation. It's like watching a great Shakespearean."As one of the film's many producers (who also include Trudie Styler), McAvoy got to see that fearless performance of his up close in the edit suite - and even sent some scenes to the cutting-room floor."I'd be saying to Jon, 'Get rid of that bit. I know you love it, I know you think that's great but it's slowing everything down,'" he says."And you're like, 'I've just told him to cut a bit of my performance!' I never thought I'd see the day that happens, you know?"Filth also provided McAvoy with another first - acting alongside his sister, Joy."It was amazing, she's an amazing actress. She's got her own approach and her own on-screen and on-stage charisma, which I'm in thrall of at times," he says."Once the camera started rolling she was there, she was in it; and I was there and I was in it; and we just kind of went for it. That's the McAvoy way, maybe!"Next May, audiences will see McAvoy return to the land of big budget blockbusters in his second X-Men film, Days of Future Past, which he finished shooting around a month ago.He plays a younger Charles Xavier alongside the likes of Hugh Jackman and Michael Fassbender, and has a scene with the "original" Charles, Patrick Stewart."It was good, it was really good," says McAvoy. "We got to almost physically, but still metaphorically a little bit, pass the baton."The star has already moved on to his next film - a new take on Mary Shelley's classic novel Frankenstein, in which he plays Victor Von Frankenstein to Daniel Radcliffe's Igor."Me and him met last week," reveals McAvoy. "We had our first rehearsal, it was awesome.""The monster isn't so much trying to come to terms with his existence as he is in the Kenneth Branagh one," he explains."It's an adventure, and the backbone of the adventure is the relationship between me and Daniel. It's more about those two - brothers in science and brothers in adventure."He pauses, and laughs: "It sounds like I'm pitching 'Weird Science: The Movie' here!"</body>

      <description>Paul McCartney on how happiness inspired new album</description>

      <date>1380881740</date>
      <body>As Sir Paul McCartney prepares to release his first solo album in six years he tells of how his happiness with his wife Nancy Shevell has inspired his writing, how he struggles not to repeat the past and how his wedding DJ ended up as a producer on the album New.Is New a joyful album?This is a happy period in my life, having a new woman - so you get new songs when you get a new woman. But in actual fact there is a lot of sadness mixed in on the record - the more you listen to it you'll find pain getting changed to laughter - there is quite an undercurrent of that. But generally I'm having a good time so I hope that's made it onto the record.Why did you chose the four producers for this album?Mark Ronson DJ'd at our wedding. He's a really good DJ and we like to dance and a lot of our friends do - so we had a little dance floor and there was kind of disco situation at the reception. He was DJing and putting on great music and it just kept us all going and I knew I liked him. I'd also met him on and off because he's friends with Sean Lennon.I've known Giles Martin (son of Beatles producer George Martin) since he was a little kid. Ethan Johns (Ryan Adams and Kings of Leon) was the son of Glyn Johns one of my Beatles and Wing's producers. Paul Epworth (Adele, Florence and the Machine) I didn't really know but I knew his work.But I was mainly really looking at their work and if you look at any of those producers they've all done great work recently. It's not just something they did in the past and that's what I was looking for. I just really enjoyed working with each one of them, but in a different way every time.Could they say no to you?I always make it one of the first things we talk about when we're sitting down and just settling in and I say OK lets get this straight everyone in this room has got an opinion and don't be frightened to tell me, particularly the producer because that's his job.I say 'tell me if you don't like it or I'm doing it lousy' and I will refer to them and say 'was that any good?' So they do have a voice and I encourage the voice. I say 'please don't be frightened just because I've done that or I've done that, don't worry about it let's just start fresh and you tell me'.But can they challenge you as much as John Lennon did?No. We were just kids that had grown up together, so any of the guys in the Beatles just could tell each other 'I don't like that' and then it meant it had to go.Do you wish you could release this album without people knowing your past work?In an impossible world it would be nice if no-one knew what I had done - and there are a lot of young people who don't know what I've done. But mainly people are looking at what I'm doing now as a continuation of all the other stuff.But I don't really worry about it. The main thing I try and do is not copy what I've done in the past. I've found myself once or twice, picking up a guitar and thinking I'm going to write a new Eleanor Rigby - I have to stop myself trying to do that.There is the past but I don't see it as a burden, I see it as something I'm very lucky to have. But when you do a show - you can't just do new songs, if I don't do Hey Jude I've missed an opportunity. In Las Vegas (performing at the iHeartRadio music festival) we were mainly doing our new songs and it was going down well, but man when we got to Live and Let Die the audience responded - we basically blew them up and they loved that.Are you trying to make a statement with the track Early Days?When I write songs I don't always think I'm going to make a statement. On the day (I wrote the track Early Days) I was thinking about the past, particularly me and John in Liverpool in the early days so I just ran with that. I started to get images of us in the record shop listening to early rock and roll and looking at the posters and the joy that that gave me remembering all those moments.So that song just evolved around that and then I found that one of the things that came was - you can't take it away from me, even though you can say 'hey this is what happened in Liverpool in the late 1950s but I'm going to say 'were you there or did you just read about it?' Because I was there and I was walking down that street - so it's that kind of song. It gets a bit of a dig at people who say they know what it was all about but they weren't there - but mainly it's just fond memories for me.Are you going to open the World Cup in Brazil, as has been rumoured?That's just a rumour - there's no truth to it. I know somebody asked me to be involved in the (Rio) Olympics. Every time these great occasions come up it's great that they think about me, I love it and I'm very flattered, but you can't just be the guy on all of them. It's going to get boring for the audience 'oh no not him again here we go again na na na na, nananana'.Are you cool?I never feel cool. I'm just me. I recently went to Las Vegas to do iHeartRadio (music festival) and there's a lot of cool people on that and so because they're in Las Vegas they all walk around with their entourage and their security and everyone's very serious about how cool they are.And course there's me and I'm going 'Hi Miley' and I think 'oh god what am I doing I sound like a fan, I should try to be cool'. But they didn't even notice me. Actually, the security noticed me and they doubled back and she came and said hello.New is released on 14 October (15 in US)</body>

      <title>The bumpy road to the National Theatre</title>
      <description>Did its early difficulties aid the National Theatre's vibrancy?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24382746</url>
      <date>1380846771</date>
      <body>The National Theatre may be approaching its 50th anniversary on 22 October, but did the delays and obstacles it encountered during its creation result in a more versatile and creative establishment than elsewhere in Europe?Disdain and hostility are not uncommon responses to major new cultural projects in the UK, but the venomous attacks levelled, over two centuries, against the idea of a national theatre leave a sour taste in the mouth even today.Seymour Hicks, an early 20th Century dramatist and star of musical comedies, was against it being created and said: "The National Theatre! I wonder if there are really half a dozen people insane enough to think it will ever come into existence. We have national taxes, national schools, national horrors of every kind - spare us a national theatre!"France has had a national theatre since 1680, Denmark since 1748 and Greece since 1901. The National Theatre in London is a youngster by comparison, which seems surprising, perhaps, for the country of Shakespeare. But this is a complex and singularly British story in which the arts, history, politics and changing ideas about national identity share the stage.The story begins in 1848, when the radical publisher Effingham Wilson published a pamphlet called A House for Shakespeare.His passionate plea for a national theatre seized the imagination and support of figures such as Charles Dickens and Matthew Arnold, but there was fierce opposition from powerful West End actor-managers who liked the non-subsidised status quo.National Theatre associate director Michael Blakemore said the real reason there was not a national theatre earlier was because the language was English."Now, if you run a theatre in say Denmark, then the performances and the productions' lives end at the border, since very few people in Europe speak your language, so the only way you can support a national theatre is with public money," he said."But in England, what happened was that a great actor like Henry Irving and all the great 19th Century actors had another market for their work and that market was the US and Australasia. They all went on tour and made a fortune so they didn't need to be supported by public money."Meanwhile, in the countries where there was a theatre subsidised by the state or court - such as the Comedie Francaise in France - the same classic plays tended to be performed again and again in the same old way.So, perhaps it helped that the London National was not established earlier by the state?Nicholas Hytner, the outgoing artistic director of the National, is proud of the range of its productions and wholeheartedly agrees."It was a very good thing that it was never set up by the court or by competing principalities looking to express their prestige through their theatres and opera houses and orchestras and dance companies. It's a good thing that it always bubbled up organically from underneath," he said.This bubbling up still took a surprisingly long time - with two World Wars intervening.Playwright Michael Frayn says the optimism of the period immediately after World War Two when other national institutions were established may have been key in getting the National Theatre off the ground."The war fostered the idea that you could actually collaborate as a nation, you could get together to think about how to live your life," he said."And this made possible after the war a lot of things like the National Health Service and the so-called welfare state which would have been impossible in the context of the 1930s, and maybe the National Theatre rode on the back of that."James Naughtie, the presenter of BBC radio programme Road to the National Theatre, believes in the powerful symbolic value of a third event."Post-war Britain was austere but exciting. From the rubble and the broken homes something better had to emerge. The National Theatre would become part of that process," he said,"The Festival of Britain, the centrepiece of post-war culture, was erected in 1951, on the anniversary of the Great Exhibition, intended as a symbol of recovery and a confident trumpet call."At long last, during that year, a foundation stone was laid. It still took until 1963 for the establishment of the National Theatre, and the Denys Lasdun building on the South Bank did not open its doors to audiences until 1976.What would Seymour Hicks - with his notion that less than half a dozen people believed in the idea of National Theatre - make of its success today?Last year, one and a half million people attended National Theatre shows, either on the South Bank or at West End transfers such as War Horse, One Man, Two Guvnors or The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.And that is not to mention the latest venture - National Theatre Live - which last year beamed performances of productions such as Frankenstein and Hamlet to more than three million people in cinemas across the globe.The road may have been long, hard and boulder-strewn but, at a youthful 50, the National Theatre is more vibrant than ever.Listen to the Road to the National Theatre on BBC Radio 4 on 6 and 13 October at 13:30 BST, or hear it on iPlayer.</body>

      <title>'Flying' care visits 'disgraceful'</title>
      <description>Short care visits mean disabled people must choose between staying thirsty or using the toilet, a charity warns, amid claims the practice is rising in England.</description>

      <body>Short care visits to elderly and disabled people are "disgraceful" and on the rise, a charity has claimed.In England, 60% of councils use 15-minute visits, which are not long enough to provide adequate care Leonard Cheshire Disability says.The charity says such visits can "force disabled people to choose whether to go thirsty or to go to the toilet".But care managers insisted some short visits could be "fully justified and fully adequate".Leonard Cheshire is pushing for a ban on what it calls the "scandal of flying 15-minute visits", lobbying the government to outlaw the practice in England.A report published by the charity said short visits "simply do not allow enough time to deliver good-quality care".It said data from 63 local authorities pointed to a 15% rise in such visits in the last five years, and said some in councils more than 75% of care visits were carried out in less than 15 minutes.Chief executive Clare Pelham said visits should be at least 30 minutes long."It is disgraceful to force disabled people to choose whether to go thirsty or to go to the toilet by providing care visits as short as 15 minutes long," she said.Ms Pelham said most people need 40 minutes to get up, washed, dressed and have breakfast."We are treating disabled and older people as if they are robots to be serviced, rather than real people who deserve to be treated with kindness and consideration," she added.But the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass), which represents care managers, argued it was "totally wrong" to suggest all caring tasks require more than 15 minutes.Sandie Keene, the association's president, said some short visits were "fully justified and fully adequate".It was "frankly naive to believe that simply by abolishing 15-minute slots a magic wand will have been waved, and improvements automatically achieved in our care services," she added."It doesn't work like that."Ms Keene said social workers and their managers had to make "horrendously difficult choices" every day to give the best possible care with limited resources.Leonard Cheshire wants peers to back a ban on short visits by amending the government's Care Bill when it is debated in the House of Lords on Wednesday.The Local Government Association (LGA), pointed to a "substantially underfunded" social care service which was putting councillors under increasing pressure."Significant cuts to council funding mean local authorities are struggling to meet the rising demand for home care visits," said Katie Hall, chairwoman of the LGA's community and wellbeing board.She said 15-minute visits "should never be the sole basis for care", but added: "In some circumstances such as administering medication they can be appropriate, but only as part of a wider comprehensive care plan involving longer one-to-one visits."Leonard Cheshire Disability said a survey of 2,025 people found 93% of those who expressed an opinion agreed 15 minutes was "not long enough to support a disabled or older person to do everyday things like wash, dress and get out of bed in the morning".</body>

      <title>Mentally ill crime victims 'ignored'</title>
      <description>Crime victims with mental illnesses are more likely to feel let down, dismissed or treated without respect by the police, new research suggests.</description>

      <date>1381104401</date>
      <body>Crime victims with mental illnesses are more likely to feel let down, dismissed or treated without respect by the police, new research suggests.Many of the 361 people questioned said they were often disbelieved when they sought help after a crime.This was despite the fact that those with severe mental illness were three times more likely to be crime victims.The findings come from a three-year study involving academics and the charities Victim Support and Mind.The report, co-authored by Kings College London, Kingston University and St George’s University of London - in collaboration with University College London - is the first British survey into crime victims which compared those with mental illness against the general population.The study said that almost half of people with some form of mental illness had experienced a crime in the last year.It said people with severe mental illness were five times more likely to experience assault, while severely mentally ill women were 10 times more likely to be assaulted.Six out of 10 women in this group reported being victims of sexual violence as adults, the study said.But interviewees said that when they sought help, they often found they were treated unfairly by the police and other agencies. Victims said they found it difficult to convince police to take their reports seriously.In the worst examples, victims said police left them with the impression that they themselves were to blame. Others refused to report crimes out of fear of being detained under mental health legislation.Victims whose cases went to court reported a range of problems which had an impact on their mental health. One interviewee reported meeting the offender while at court, an incident which triggered an episode of self-harming.The authors called for police and other agencies to be better trained to help mentally-ill victims of crime and said responses to incidents should be properly monitored and assessed.Javed Khan, chief executive of Victim Support, said: “It is nothing short of a national scandal that some of the most vulnerable people in our society become victims of crime so often and yet when they seek help they are met with disbelief or even blame.“It is unacceptable that the criminal justice system fails to meet the needs of people with mental health problems when this report shows all too clearly the terrible impact of crime on them.”And Paul Farmer, Mind’s chief executive, said: “Being a victim of crime is a horrible experience for anyone to cope with but when you have a mental health problem the impact on your life can be even worse.“People with mental health problems have an equal right to justice, yet this report reveals that this is not the reality for far too many of us.”Commander Christine Jones of the Association of Chief Police Officers said it had supported the research because senior officers recognised that the experiences of people with mental illnesses were not widely understood.“Anyone reporting a crime against them expects to be listened to, taken seriously and treated with respect,” she said.“Policing and mental health is high on the agenda for chief constables. We support the recommendations in this report, which will further that work.”The research team interviewed a random sample of 361 people in London who have severe mental illness and the results were compared with official data in the Crime Survey for England and Wales. Further in-depth interviews were conducted with 81 people with mental health problems who had been victims of crime during the last three years.</body>

      <title>Royal Mail undervalued, says Labour</title>
      <description>The shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, says the government's privatisation of Royal Mail has "undervalued" the firm by as much as £1bn.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24426116</url>
      <date>1381133307</date>
      <body>The privatisation of Royal Mail undervalues the company by as much as a £1bn, with City investors and hedge funds being the biggest beneficiaries of the share offering, says shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Umunna said that the sale is "short changing" taxpayers.The government said it was following "normal commercial practice".Members of the public can apply for the shares online until 8 October.Shares will begin trading in full on 15 October.62% of the business will be sold, with the rest remaining state-owned.Under the terms of the share sale, a 10% stake in the business has been reserved for Royal Mail employees.There is a £750 minimum amount for members of the public wishing to purchase Royal Mail shares, with the threshold falling to £500 for Royal Mail employees.Mr Umunna said that the £750 minimum application was too high."That is a lot of money for most people - it is out of reach for many. Most of the people benefiting from this will be the speculators and the hedge funds".The government may also sell an additional 15% of its stake in what is called an "over-allotment" option, if the demand for shares was very high.Labour has already said that it would not renationalise Royal Mail after it is privatised.In response to Mr Umunna's comments, the Department for Business said: "This is a commercial transaction and government is following normal commercial practice in setting and publicising the share price and delivering value for the taxpayer. The value of Royal Mail will depend on a number of factors, notably the company's on-going financial performance, its future prospects and the level of investor interest."On Friday it was reported that demand for shares is outstripping supply, and they are to be sold at the top end of the government's suggested range.Initially the government priced the shares at 260-330p, however, they are to be sold between 300-330p. Shares will begin trading in full on the London Stock Exchange on 15 October.BBC business editor Robert Peston said applications for the shares are a "few times" the value of those on offer.Members of the Communication Workers Union are currently being balloted on a potential strike over the planned privatisation, and other pay issues.The strike vote closes on 16 October, and the earliest a strike could be held is seven days after that.</body>

      <title>Buckingham Palace to host football</title>
      <description>Buckingham Palace is hosting its first official football match later, to mark the Football Association's 150th anniversary.</description>

      <date>1381105519</date>
      <body>Buckingham Palace is to host its first official football match later, to mark the Football Association's 150th anniversary.The competitive fixture involving two amateur sides was the idea of the Duke of Cambridge, President of the FA.London sides Civil Service FC, the sole survivor of the 11 teams that formed the FA on 26 October 1863, will take on Polytechnic FC, set up in 1875.Prince William will host the event and also present medals to 150 volunteers.The Queen gave permission for the Southern Amateur League fixture to take place.Wembley groundsman Tony Stones worked with royal household gardeners to create the 110 yards x 65 yards (100m x 60m) pitch in the 39-acre (16 hectares) garden.The lawn was seeded in parts to repair wear and tear following a busy summer which saw the grounds host garden parties and the Coronation Festival.The pitch started to be marked out last month.Since then the royal gardeners have been mowing the ground three times a week and creating a criss-cross pattern in the turf to mirror the Wembley stadium pitch.But the turf - made up of rye, bents and fescues - is a mixture of finer grasses than Wembley. And unlike any top flight ground, it also contains patches of camomile, a plant found on the site of Buckingham Palace for centuries.Premier League referee Howard Webb, who officiated at the 2010 World Cup final match in South Africa, will be in charge of the fixture.Civil Service FC were selected to take part in the game and suggested that Polytechnic, who are also based in Chiswick, west London, would be fitting opponents.Polytechnic FC manager Geoff Brown said: "We first played 120 years ago - so there's a fair bit of history between the two of us."He added: "The organisation up to the day has been absolutely manic. It's only now we're getting the chance to soak it all up and get ready for the experience."It's only been this week that I was able to confirm that everybody in the first and second squads will be able to get to the game as well."So there's been a little bit of trepidation, with people not really knowing if they're going to be involved or not - but since Thursday everybody is really buzzing about it now."They all know they are going to be part of something very special."The match forms the centrepiece of the FA's Grassroots Heroes Day, celebrating the work of volunteers including the founders of local clubs, coaches, referees and other officials.</body>

      <title>Two Tories quit government posts</title>
      <description>Deputy Chief Whip John Randall and Cabinet Office Minister Chloe Smith resign from the government amid speculation of an imminent reshuffle.</description>

      <date>1381098193</date>
      <body>Two Conservative members of the government have quit amid speculation of an imminent ministerial reshuffle.Deputy Chief Whip John Randall and Cabinet Office Minister Chloe Smith stepped down late on Sunday.Mr Randall, 58, has been Conservative MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip since 1997, while Chloe Smith has represented Norwich North since 2009.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said a government reshuffle could take place as soon as Monday.He said it was likely to focus on "mid-ranking ministers below Cabinet level".As deputy chief whip, Mr Randall was partly responsible for ensuring party discipline among fellow Tory MPs.He offered to quit at the end of last year, his resignation letter said.Ms Smith, 31, served in the Treasury before being moved to the Cabinet Office last September.Stepping down, she wrote to the prime minister pointing out she had been "only 27" when she became an MP and said she now wanted to "develop other ways of giving public service".She was thrust into the limelight last summer when she appeared on BBC Two's Newsnight to defend the government's fuel duty policy.The widely-viewed interview with Jeremy Paxman prompted one Tory MP to label Chancellor George Osborne a "coward" for putting her forward in his place.Mr Randall had worked in the whips' office, either in government or opposition, for 13 years.In his resignation letter he paid tribute to David Cameron said it had been "a great privilege and honour" to serve the party.The departures come after Transport Minister Simon Burns quit his post on Friday to launch a bid to become a deputy commons speaker.Our political editor said: "The prime minister is known to be keen to promote women and those representing northern constituencies ahead of the general election and a wider Cabinet reshuffle which may take place next spring."BBC political correspondent Vicky Young says the Tories have a lot of talented women in junior roles who could be candidates for promotion.It is thought that Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will also make changes to the Liberal Democrat ministerial line-up and Labour leader Ed Miliband is expected to reshuffle his shadow ministerial team.</body>

      <title>'British FBI' crime agency launched</title>
      <description>A new national crime agency labelled the "British FBI" comes into force to tackle and pursue organised criminal gangs.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24418847</url>
      <date>1381126467</date>
      <body>A new body to tackle some of the UK's most serious crimes has been launched.Labelled the "British FBI", the National Crime Agency (NCA) will "relentlessly pursue" organised criminals, the home secretary said.Theresa May told the BBC it would focus on organised, economic and cyber crime, border policing and child protection.It will replace a number of existing bodies but will have significantly less funding. Labour has called the move a "rebranding exercise".It is the third time since 1998 that an organised crime body has been set up.The National Crime Squad was set up 15 years ago, only to be replaced eight years later by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) - which is now being scrapped.The NCA will work with each of the regional police forces in the UK and similar organisations abroad.The agency will have 4,500 officers and aims to adopt a more visible, joined-up approach than was previously the case.Its head, Keith Bristow, warned criminals to expect "continuous disruption", including the confiscation of their assets."We are going to make a difference the public will see," he told the BBC, adding the "British FBI" label was "reasonable shorthand" for the new body.However, unlike the FBI, the NCA does not have responsibility for combating terrorism. That remains the responsibility of Scotland Yard, where the Metropolitan Police oversees a number of regional teams comprising police and MI5 officers.Mrs May told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that the new agency was "designed to be a relentless crime-fighting body which will relentlessly pursue organised criminals".The home secretary said: "Crime is falling in this country, but we can't be complacent. And particularly on organised crime, I don't think the last government put enough emphasis on this."But shadow policing minister David Hanson said the NCA "doesn't match the government's hype"."Most of the NCA is just the rebranding of existing organisations such as the Serious Organised Crime Agency, but with a substantial 20% cut imposed by the Home Office on their overall budget," he said."The new organisation is not strong enough to deal with the exponential growth of economic and online crime."It would simply absorb the existing national cyber crime unit but with fewer resources, he said."It is right to have stronger national action on organised crime with the NCA, on child exploitation and on intelligence - but the government has to support this effort and not simply use this as a rebranding exercise to hide substantial policing cuts."However, Mrs May told the BBC she was satisfied that the NCA was "going to be well resourced".She said the government had already shown it was "possible to keep up that relentless fight against crime" with less money.Keith Vaz, the chairman of the influential Home Affairs Select Committee said: "The organisations going into the NCA have a combined budget of £812m, yet the new agency will only have £473.9m next year."The Home Office needs to account for where this money has gone."Each police force in the UK has territorial responsibility for its particular area. Crimes that are carried out across more than one county or area usually involve officers from both areas.The new body will have a strategic role in which it will attempt to look at the bigger picture of organised crime in the UK, how it operates and how it can be disrupted.The NCA will answer directly to the home secretary and will have significant powers to compel police forces in England, Scotland and Wales to provide assistance and carry out policing operations.The situation will be different in Northern Ireland, where the agency will carry out border and customs functions, but not other crime-fighting roles.Mr Hanson added that this would leave a "serious operational gap" compared with the Serious Organised Crime Agency that the NCA is replacing."It is extremely worrying that organised crime which crosses between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK will not be properly dealt with because the Home Secretary mishandled the legislation with the relevant parties in Northern Ireland," he said.</body>

      <description>Thousands of lives could be saved each year in the UK if people walked more, according to a report from two charities.</description>

      <body>Tens of thousands of lives could be saved each year in the UK if people got off the sofa and stretched their legs more, say charities.The "Walking Works" report by the Ramblers and Macmillan Cancer Support said walking was a free activity which could transform people's health.Being physically active decreases the odds of heart problems and stroke.But it also makes a difference in other conditions such as type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and many cancers.Last week a British Medical Journal study showed that exercise was as good a medicine as pills for some conditions including heart diseases and another study showed walking at least an hour a day significantly cut the risk of breast cancer.The latest report said that if everyone, in England alone, did the recommended 150 minutes of moderate physical exercise every week it would:The two charities run the Walking for Health programme in an attempt to get more people up on their feet.Benedict Southworth, chief executive of the Ramblers, said: "We're facing a serious crisis of inactivity, but there is a simple solution,"We need to see greater investment in initiatives which support and promote walking as the most accessible and affordable way for people to get active."Ciarán Devane, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: "For cancer patients, being active can help manage some of the debilitating consequences of treatment and can even help reduce the chance of some cancers returning."Inactivity is a nationwide epidemic that must be tackled now before it is too late."Public Health England said inactivity had "life threatening consequences".Its director of health and wellbeing Prof Kevin Fenton said: "Inactivity increases the risk of serious illnesses like type 2 diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers."It makes it more likely that people will be overweight or obese. Supporting people to get active through walking can be a major part of the solution."</body>

      <title>Call to avert oil refinery strike</title>
      <description>Unions call for an emergency summit and parliamentary debate in a bid to avert strikes at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical site.</description>

      <date>1381132319</date>
      <body>Unions are calling for an emergency summit and parliamentary debate in a bid to avert strikes at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical site.Workers at the Ineos site have started an overtime ban and work to rule.The dispute centres on the treatment of a union convener.Ineos has warned that its Grangemouth site will close by 2017 if it does not find savings and fresh investment. It said the site had lost more than £150m over the past four years.A spokesman for the company has accused Unite of "fiddling while Rome burns".Finance Secretary John Swinney said the Scottish government would make all efforts to bring both sides together to help resolve the dispute, and get to a position of financial sustainability for the plant.Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme he said: "We have been talking to the company about how we might be able to invest to support the development of the plant."We can only make investment if there is a viable business proposition and that's where we need to have all parties working together to support a proposition that can deliver the employment and the opportunities that we want to see for the plant in Grangemouth, because of its very wider significance for the Scottish economy."Unite workers voted for the industrial action in support of Unite convener Stevie Deans.He was suspended, then reinstated, by the company over allegations linked to his involvement in the row over the selection of a Labour candidate in Falkirk, where he is chairman of the local constituency party.Mr Deans faces an investigation by Ineos over issues linked to the Falkirk row.Unite have accused Ineos of trying to "provoke" a strike, which it warned would be "hugely damaging" to the UK economy.A previous three-day stoppage at the site in 2008 was said to have cost hundreds of millions of pounds in lost production and other knock-on effects.Workers have voted heavily in favour of action up to and including a strike - and Unite officials said they had not ruled out calling for a walkout.Pat Rafferty, the union's Scottish regional secretary, said the company was using the Stevie Deans dispute as an excuse to introduce sweeping reforms, including pension changes, job losses, an end to collective bargaining and worse pay and conditions for new employees.Unite called for a summit with the company and politicians, and urged the Scottish government to hold an emergency debate to help prevent the dispute escalating."The company is holding Stevie Deans hostage, and playing Russian roulette with fuel supplies," Mr Rafferty said."The changes being proposed are completely unpalatable to us and we feel we are being pushed into taking strike action."We are trying to make the company see sense, but we are not ruling anything out at this stage."Unite said the work to rule and overtime ban would slow down maintenance work at Grangemouth, which is split into refinery and petrochemical operations.Ineos has put forward a survival plan and has asked the Scottish and UK governments for grants and loan guarantees totalling £150m.Chairman Calum MacLean has warned "there is no plan B".Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland, Tom Crotty, group director with Ineos, said: "We have got a survival plan. We haven't been sitting on our hands wailing about it, we are doing something about it."What we can do is invest in new terminal facilities that will allow us to bring gas in from the US to replace the gas from the North Sea."But to do that we will have to put another £300m into a site that is losing £10m a month, and we will not do that unless we can sort out this cost base."He added: "While this crucial issue is facing us, which will close the site before 2017 unless something is done, Unite are ignoring it and focusing on this issue about Steven Deans."It is frankly fiddling while Rome burns."On Sunday, the company announced that one of its key customers in Hull, which traditionally took up to 100,000 tonnes of product from Grangemouth, had been forced to close down.The Ineos Vinyl Acetate Monomer (Vam) facility at Saltend said that low cost imports into Europe had made closure inevitable.Mr MacLean said: "Unfortunately the closure of this world-scale Vam unit at the Hull site has a significant knock-on effect at Grangemouth as we lose a major customer for good."</body>

      <description>Tottenham Hotspur fans ignore police warnings not to use the word "Yid" in chants at a match against West Ham United.</description>

      <body>Thousands of Tottenham Hotspur fans have ignored a police warning not to use the word "Yid" in chants at a match against West Ham United.Spurs supporters chanted "We'll sing what we want" and "Yid Army" at White Hart Lane, in north London.Before the match, the Met Police warned fans using the term could be arrested. One fan was arrested at half-time.Spurs have a strong Jewish following and have been the target of abuse from opposition fans.However, some Spurs supporters use the term themselves in an act of defiance.Before the game, which West Ham won 3-0, match commander Ch Supt Mick Johnson said "racism and offensive language have no place in football".A police spokesman said officers were speaking with fans on their way into the stadium about the issue.The Met Police said one Tottenham fan had been arrested for a public order offence and was in custody at a north London police station.The Football Association has warned supporters the use of such words could result in a banning order or criminal charges.Last month, the chairman of the footballers' union, Clarke Carlisle, said fans should be banned for using the word, but Prime Minister David Cameron has said people should not be prosecuted unless it is used as an insult.On Friday, the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust said they believed no Spurs fan "uses the term 'yid' in an offensive or insulting way".However, it said the distinction between the use of the term as a "badge of honour and a call to arms" and the "anti-Semitic abuse levelled at our fans by supporters of opposing teams, appears to have been dismissed by the FA and the Metropolitan Police".Before the game, West Ham United also warned supporters that "unacceptable conduct" at the match could lead to fans being banned from attending games.</body>

      <body>Tickets for next year's Glastonbury Festival have sold out in record time, according to organisers.Michael and Emily Eavis issued a joint statement confirming all 120,000 remaining tickets had been sold in just one hour and 27 minutes.They said they were "blown away" by the numbers logging on and were "genuinely sorry" that so many had missed out.Ticketing website See Tickets had earlier apologised to customers on Twitter for "technical difficulties".The site, which had been managing the sale of tickets for Glastonbury, wrote that the issues had led to "a very difficult half an hour" before the site stabilised, later adding that it was selling 3,000 tickets a minute.Prices for the 2014 event had been increased by £10 to £210, plus a booking fee, but festival-goers could pay a deposit of £50 before settling their bill in April.For the first time, coach packages were available three days earlier, with all 15,000 tickets selling out in half an hour.A statement by the father and daughter Eavis team, Michael and Emily, was posted on the festival's own Twitter feed, saying: "We genuinely try to make the ticket system as fair as it can be, but when demand outstrips supply, it is an unfortunate inevitability that some people will be left disappointed."They went on to thank people for their "incredible support", adding: "We really don't take it for granted and we are exceedingly fortunate to have that loyalty."No acts have yet been confirmed to play at the festival at Worthy Farm between 26 and 29 June next year, but there is already speculation about who will headline.David Bowie is one of the bookies' favourites, with other rumours including Foo Fighters and Fleetwood Mac.This year saw Arctic Monkeys, Rolling Stones and Mumford and Sons top the bill on the festival's famous Pyramid Stage.</body>

      <title>Haim beat Justin to top album chart</title>

      <body>US band Haim have denied Justin Timberlake his fourth UK number one album, after topping the chart with their debut, Days Are Gone.Timberlake's album, The 20/20 Experience 2 of 2, had led midweek sales by just 28 copies but was overtaken by Californian sisters, Haim.In the singles chart, OneRepublic's Counting Stars claimed victory from The Vamps' Can We Dance.The Official Charts Company said it was "the closest race of the year".Ryan Tedder's band OneRepublic secured its first UK number one after rising two places, with just 1,150 copies standing between the two tracks.The debut record from Haim, made up of sisters Este, Danielle and Alana, had been eagerly anticipated since the band won the BBC's Sound Of 2013 poll in January.Days Are Gone features their three hit singles Don't Save Me, Falling and The Wire, which the band dedicated to Prime Minister David Cameron when they both appeared on the Andrew Marr programme on BBC One last week.It finished the week 2,100 copies ahead of the second instalment of Timberlake's 20/20 Experience album series.The original album, which is still at number 33 in the chart, spent three weeks at Number 1 in March and was the star's third consecutive UK number one album.Last week's number one album - Mechanical Bull by Kings Of Leon - slipped down to three, with Arctic Monkeys' AM static at four and Drake's Nothing Was The Same down to five.Dizzee Rascal's The Fifth enterted the album chart at number ten, while his new single Something Really Bad took the same position in the single's chart.Jason Derulo's single Talk Dirty FT 2 Chainz dropped to number three with Katy Perry's Roar in fourth and Chase and Status in fifth with Count On Me FT Moko.This week's chart also saw Avicii's Wake Me Up become one of the UK's biggest-selling singles of all time, after it broke through the million copies sales barrier on Sunday.The Official Charts Company said the track is only the 140th single to achieve this milestone, and the third of 2013 behind Daft Punk's Get Lucky FT Pharrell Williams and Nile Rodgers, and Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines FT TI and Pharrell Williams.Wake Me Up, by 24-year-old Swedish DJ and Producer Avicii, spent three consecutive weeks at number one after debuting in that position in July, and denied One Direction their fourth UK chart topper with Best Song Ever.</body>

      <body>The fact a new UK-wide policing agency has only limited powers in Northern Ireland, places an extra burden on the PSNI, the justice minister has said.The National Crime Agency (NCA), which comes into operation on Monday, will not operate in Northern Ireland in the same way as the rest of the UK.Sinn Féin and the SDLP blocked a move to give it powers to carry out police operations and recruit agents.Justice Minister David Ford said blocking the legislation was a mistake."I haven't lost hope that we will get full political agreement, that we will be able to see the NCA operational and discussions are ongoing to see if we can get that political agreement," Mr Ford said."In the meantime, the key problem is that in certain issues like child exploitation, like human trafficking, like serious organised crime which is operating in the devolved area, there will be no powers for the NCA and this will place an additional burden on the PSNI."Mr Ford said the PSNI was already facing pressure with the threat from dissident republicans and loyalist street violence."In the face of that the police do not need extra burdens placed on them when there's a fully equipped national agency able to carry out those duties," he said."I visited the Serious Organised Crime Agency last week and I know that some of their staff have already been diverted in support of operations in England and Wales because in effect there's less for them to do because the PSNI is having to take over issues here."Phil Gormley, deputy director of the National Crime Agency, said it was a disappointment that it would not have the same powers in Northern Ireland as in the rest of the UK."We're determined to do all that we can within the limitations placed upon us to better protect the people of Northern Ireland and cut serious and organised crime," he said."It is a disappointment on a professional level that we don't have the powers of constable and can't operate in quite the same way that we can in the rest of the UK."The principal difference is that the NCA officers won't have the powers of the constable and through that will have limited ability to deploy asset recovery powers. We will still have the ability to cover reserved and accepted matters including customs, immigration and national security."SDLP justice spokesman Alban Maginness said they were working to find a way where the NCA's operations would come under the jurisdiction of the PSNI chief constable."We fought long and hard to create the PSNI and we should not undermine its authority or that of the chief constable," he said."Given our history - the meddling and malign interference of British intelligence agencies in the past, particularly in relation to the RUC - it is little wonder that we have grave reservations."The NCA would want to run their own agents in Northern Ireland and conduct their own covert surveillance operations - we do not want that to happen."The NCA will target crime gangs across local, national and international borders.Its head is Keith Bristow.He will be directly accountable to Home Secretary Theresa May for the agency's actions - not to the chief constable of the PSNI, the Policing Board or the Police Ombudsman.Many of the policing powers being given to the NCA have been devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly; therefore it has to agree to give Westminster authority to exercise those powers.These include NCA officers being given:- the powers of a police constable in Northern Ireland;- the authority to carry out searches and make arrests;- the ability to conduct surveillance operations;- the ability to recruit and run informers and agents.The agency would also be responsible for recovering assets from criminals.However, Sinn Féin and the SDLP have refused to support the move - which means the powers will not be extended to Northern Ireland.The police are understood to share the justice minister's concerns about the potential implications of the decision.The PSNI has repeatedly warned that Northern Ireland is increasingly being targeted by international crime gangs operating on a global scale. They believe that cooperation with the NCA is essential.</body>

      <title>School maths results 'disappointing'</title>
      <description>"Disappointing" standards in maths among 14 to 16-year-olds in Wales must be tackled, says an education watchdog.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-24419852</url>
      <date>1381129541</date>
      <body>"Disappointing" standards in maths among 14 to 16-year-olds in Wales must be tackled, says an education watchdog.Estyn's report said maths was the lowest performing core subject at key stage four - when pupils work towards GCSEs - and the lowest in the UK.Last year the proportion of students in Wales achieving C grade and above at GCSE lagged well behind England.The Welsh government said the report had highlighted both successes and areas that could be improved.Estyn said schools must work hard to raise standards. It is due to publish its report on its website on Monday.Chief inspector Ann Keane said some employers were having to invest in numeracy skills training for school and college leavers."Many Welsh employers are concerned at the lack of mathematical skills demonstrated by employees," she said.The Estyn report by inspectors said there was a lack of support for the professional development of mathematics teachers.The findings and recommendations were drawn from visits to 18 secondary schools around Wales.The report recommended more support, advice and professional development opportunities should be provided for schools.It highlighted best practice at some schools such as Bishop Gore Comprehensive School in Swansea where it said 20% of pupils gained A* or A grades in GCSE maths in 2012.But the report found there was an 11 percentage point gap between England and Wales in the number of students getting a C grade and above last year.Its author Rob Davies told BBC Radio Wales: "Inspectors are noting that schools are setting their sights too low and and focusing too much on just doing enough to reach grade C and not stretching pupils enough."He pointed to various factors affecting results in Wales."I think there are question marks over whether key stage three [age 11-14] is preparing pupils suitably in Wales," he said."The inspectors have noted that pupils lack confidence in key aspects such as number work and algebra skills."They are the foundations of mathematics and they give pupils the skills to solve problems."Mr Davies said the weaker results were a combination of low expectations, poor teaching in some cases and the current set up of the GCSE, which allows schools not to enter pupils for higher grade material which Mr Davies said too many schools in Wales were doing.He also said too many weaker students were being entered early for the exam, and that there needed to be more consistency across Wales about networking between schools and sharing good practice.Last year the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) published a survey saying there was a "disconnect" between what employers needed and the basic skills of young job seekers.In July, the Welsh government revealed plans to introduce at least four new GCSE exams from September 2015, including two in numeracy and mathematics.It followed a qualifications review in Wales for pupils aged between 14 and 19 also affecting English language and Welsh exams.A Welsh government spokesperson said: "This report shows where we have been successful in developing mathematics in our schools at key stage four, and where we need to sharpen our performance."We welcome its findings and want to congratulate the schools highlighted in the report for their diligence and commitment to improving standards."We have clear evidence that, at an operational level, the best results in mathematics teaching at key stage four are achieved where schools and regional consortia work together, and where teachers have opportunities to share best practice and benefit from appropriate professional development and regular network opportunities."</body>

      <title>'Lifestyle changes affecting NHS'</title>
      <description>The NHS should not be there to "pick up the pieces" after people fall ill because of the health choices they have made, says the health minister.</description>

      <body>The NHS should not be there to "pick up the pieces" after people fall ill because of their lifestyle choices, said the Welsh health minister.Mark Drakeford said people needed to understand the consequences of becoming obese or drinking too much.He backed one Welsh health board's policy of making overweight people attend health courses before being put on treatment waiting lists.A BBC Wales poll found 82% people thought the policy should be extended.The survey of 502 people marks the start of a new season of BBC Wales programmes called Live Longer Wales about people's lifestyles.In one programme, Mr Drakeford denied claims of a "nanny state" claiming that "what the state does when it helps people to understand the consequences of their action is not nannying at all, it is acting as one responsible adult would to another".In July, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board launched its weight management programme saying improving weight before an operation gives a better outcome.Under the new policy, anyone who wants elective surgery with a body-mass index (BMI) above 40 must have been "offered, accepted and completed weight management support" before being added to the waiting list.The National Obesity Forum, an independent group looking at the treatment and management of obesity issues, has criticised the weight management programme warning the drop-out rate could be high.But Mr Drakeford said overweight people were less likely to benefit clinically from some operations.He added: "If you don't put yourself in a position where that treatment will be effective then that treatment won't be available to you."He said he was "not in favour of penalising people", adding it is "more than education - it is about motivation"."And it is about persuading people that if they want to live longer and they want to live healthily then that means eating better, moving more and drinking less," he said.Live Longer Wales is a new season of programmes from BBC Wales throughout October.</body>

      <body>The mother of a man who was hit by an HGV then dragged underneath it for three miles has appealed for anyone with information about the incident to contact police.Robert Finlayson, 22, was found dead on the B7078 Carlisle Road in Blackwood, Lanarkshire, on Monday 23 September.It is thought he had been trying to hitchhike when he was struck.His mother Angela said his family could not move on until they knew exactly what had happened.Police believe Mr Finlayson - who was known as Robbie - was hit by an unmarked light-coloured Mercedes Actros tractor unit towing a tri-axel rigid step framed trailer.They said it was possible the driver was not aware the vehicle had struck him.Mrs Finlayson said she could not get her son's body back for burial until the police investigation into his death came to a conclusion.Describing how she had last seen him on the Saturday before he died, she said: "I said I would see him later that night because I was going to work, and that was the last time I saw him."I really just can't put it into words how much we'll miss him, every aspect of his life. How can you put into words how important one person is?"Some days it's just like he'll be through the door for his dinner, other days we realise that he won't be."We can't move on because we can't do anything, we can't put Robbie to rest therefore we are just sitting waiting as well."I think for his brothers and for all the rest of the family its important that we have this conclusion, that we all know what happened so that we can piece together Robbie's last movements and understand what happened to him."Mr Finlayson, from Hamilton, was seen on CCTV at about 04:10, standing on the north side of the over bridge of the M74 motorway Junction 10 and then heading north on the northbound carriageway of the B7078, where it appears he was attempting to hitchhike.The road was busier than normal because of a diversion from the nearby M74 motorway.More than 40 vehicles, many of them heavy goods vehicles delivering to large retail outlets, were diverted from the motorway onto the B7078 between 04:00 and 04:30.Several northbound vehicles were seen moving onto the opposing lane to pass Mr Finlayson safely, but police said he was then struck by a vehicle and carried underneath it for three miles to where his body was found.Mrs Finlayson said: "There's only one thing we can do for Robbie and that is to find out what happened and that everything is dealt with and then be able to bury him."We can't do that for him until we get this information that we need, and that comes from the drivers that were on that road that night."So that is what we need - for people to come forward and give what information they can about anything they saw."Even if they think it is quite trivial it could be important to the police just to pinpoint a time or narrow the timescale down when this accident happened".Insp Calum Maider, of Police Scotland, emphasised that, although all of the drivers on the road at the time were potential witnesses, he was not looking for an accused or a suspect at this point.He added: "Our focus at this present time is on a heavy goods vehicle, which I fully believe would have been unaware of striking Robbie."We have retrieved an item of front trim from the vehicle. That has been identified as coming from a Mercedes Actros tractor unit, so therefore we are looking for that particular type of vehicle."</body>

      <title>Future of local government examined</title>
      <description>A detailed inquiry is to be carried out into the future of councils and local services in Scotland, Cosla announces.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-24422868</url>
      <date>1381102425</date>
      <body>A detailed inquiry is to be carried out into the future of councils and local services in Scotland.Cosla has announced details of a commission which will examine how councils and local services might evolve.Its remit is to examine ways of strengthening local democracy across the country, regardless of the result of the independence referendum.Members will include councillors, academics and journalists.Cosla hopes it will result in a blueprint for how local government might evolve in the discussions about the future of Scotland after the referendum - whether that means the shaping of an independent country's constitution, devising a "devo max" settlement or simply improving existing arrangements.The local government organisation's president, David O'Neill, said: "The bottom line is that local matters and it is valued within our communities. Making Scotland a fairer, healthier and wealthier place will not be achieved from the top down - we know that trying to do so simply does not work."He added: "The reality is that empowering lives in our communities means empowering local democracy and letting local people decide on their priorities, their services and their spending."As well as Mr O'Neill, the commission has 20 other members. They include councillors from across Scotland, representatives of voluntary groups, STUC general secretary Graham Smith, the academic Prof Richard Kerley and the editor of the Daily Record newspaper Alan Rennie.Some in local government fear that since devolution in 1999 there has been a trend towards the "creep centralisation" of services in Scotland.They would argue that unrelated measures such as the terms of the council tax freeze and the creation of national police and fire services have, when taken together, weakened local accountability.Some councillors argue devolution did not just mean a transfer of power from Westminster to Holyrood but from town halls to the Scottish government.Mr O'Neill is keen to see a form of "constitutional protection" for local government in Scotland after the independence question is settled.He believes central government and local government should have guaranteed responsibilities - at the moment councils could, in theory at least, be abolished by Holyrood.Mr O'Neill describes the need for "spheres of influence - not tiers of influence". In other words, he would want a formal mechanism to ensure that central government recognised the responsibility of councils to make certain decisions or provide local services."He said: "Over the decades we have moved away from the local aspect of almost everything. More and more services are being run by distant bureaucracies and often these services are being done to people rather than delivered with them."Yet, across Europe the opposite is often true. That trend simply won't see us through for much longer because it is no coincidence that our European neighbours are often more successful at improving outcomes."One question might concern the details of local government finance. At present around 80p of every pound each council spends comes directly from the Scottish government.Most of the rest comes from the council tax but the terms of the council tax freeze - due to last until 2016 - make it difficult to raise extra money to a significant level.Because of this, many councils feel their hands are tied when it comes to money. Some would like to have more financial flexibility to minimise the need for continuing austerity and hard decisions on local spending. This could mean, for instance, greater flexibility over business rates.Another question might be whether all councils should have the same set of powers - or if they should vary depending on local circumstances.The three island authorities are currently arguing for additional powers while the councils responsible for Scotland's cities are examining the case for extra economic powers and responsibilities.The commission might also look at ways of "devolving" power from councils to local communities.But it is unlikely to make recommendations about redrawing the map of Scotland's 32 councils while decisions to share local services - either by pooling them with neighbouring authorities or other public services - are likely to be left to individual councils.The commission intends to try to gather evidence from all across Scotland.But one challenge might simply be engaging the broader public in the debate. Just 38% of voters took part in last year's council elections.Another might be the extent to which it is possible to devolve real power to communities. Community councils have no formal legal responsibilities but exist to feed into local authority decision making.Supporters say they can make a real difference to the people they serve but in many parts of the country, community councils are lying moribund through apparent lack of interest.The commission's report is expected in the spring.In the event of Scots rejecting independence, it would be largely be up to the Scottish government to decide whether to put any of the commission's recommendations into practice.However it is possible the commission may also urge some council control over the practicalities of welfare delivery and other services which Westminster is responsible for.In the event of a no vote, Cosla might hope to convince Westminster that any move to give Scotland more power did not automatically mean transferring more power to the Scottish Parliament.Were there to be a vote in favour of independence, the report might play a part in the debate over what an independent Scotland would actually be like.</body>

      <body>A six-week cull of badgers in west Somerset is believed to have ended.The controversial pilot, which has been heavily fought by campaigners, was overseen by Defra in an attempt to stop the spread of TB in cattle.A similar pilot in west Gloucestershire is thought to still be under way. Marksman in both counties are aiming to kill a total of 5,000 badgers.Defra has refused to comment on the success of the cull and neither it nor the NFU could confirm it has ended.Jay Tiernan, spokesman for Stop the Cull, said protesters had "totally destroyed" the pilot.Every night for six weeks, volunteers held patrols of both cull zones to monitor badger setts and worked to disrupt the marksman from shooting.Avon and Somerset Police said just three arrests had been made during the six-week period. In Gloucestershire, 18 people were arrested.Mr Tiernan highlighted the campaigners' two main problems with the cull."The methodology isn't sound, he said."There's a group of badgers, you start shooting them and they disperse. Secondly the shooters can't get at the badgers to shoot them because we're there."The government licensed the shooting to test whether culling can be carried out in a safe, humane and effective way.It will analyse the results from both pilots to decide whether to extend the culling of badgers to other parts of the country.Supporters say it is the only way to eradicate the spread of TB to livestock.James Small, the Somerset chairman of the National Farmers' Union, said: "These are only two pilots and just represent a small step in trying to combat this disease, but I think there is a sense, at least, that a step has been taken."No details on the total number of badgers shot have yet been released despite requests from the BBC for details.</body>

      <body>Ravel Morrison scored a superb solo goal as West Ham earned a vital win against Tottenham to climb out of the Premier League's bottom three.Winston Reid's close-range effort just after the hour gave the Hammers a first away goal of the season.A ricochet off Ricardo Vaz Te doubled the lead before Morrison ran the length of the Spurs half to chip in.Tottenham's best chances fell to Jermain Defoe but he was denied by West Ham goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen.West Ham's first away win in nine Premier League games was their first at White Hart Lane since 1999 and lifts them to 13th in the table. Meanwhile, Spurs' second defeat of the season ended a six-game unbeaten run and sees them drop to sixth.It was more of a surprise given that Andre Villas-Boas's side had the joint-tightest defence in the league, having conceded only twice before this encounter.But the day arguably belonged to Morrison, 20, who capped a confident and hard-working display with a goal that underlined a talent that many observers have spoken of in glowing terms.The former Manchester United player was called into the England Under-21 squad last week and this performance showed that the youngster could perhaps now turn the corner after having questions asked of his temperament.Before Morrison's move to East London in January 2012, then United boss Sir Alex Ferguson said: "He's got a great talent but it's how to deal with it that is important."West Ham boss Sam Allardyce took the unusual step of naming no recognised strikers in his side, as Morrison rotated with Mohamed Diame as the furthest player forward, but it proved a masterstroke.Morrison was the visitors' most potent player in the first half and they almost took the lead when he was tripped near the edge of the box.Rather than take a shot, Mark Noble enterprisingly scooped the ball over the wall and Kevin Nolan volleyed just wide from an angle.At the other end, Andros Townsend gave watching England manager Roy Hodgson something to think about ahead of the World Cup qualifiers with another performance of direct running and confident dribbling.But, despite several decent crosses from the right, Defoe could not make contact on his first Premier League start of the season.Despite their tight defence, Villas-Boas's side have only scored six goals in six games prior to this match and their frustrations in front of goal continued after the break when Jaaskelainen twice thwarted Defoe.James Tomkins had a header well saved by Hugo Lloris from a corner, yet it was Tottenham who began to show the greater purpose and Reid's opener on 66 minutes came against the run of play.Reid expertly headed Stewart Downing's corner towards goal only for it to be blocked by Nolan on the line. The ball bounced back to the Kiwi and he made no mistake with the rebound.Vaz Te added a fortunate second soon after. The Portuguese was found by Noble and his tame shot hit Loris before bouncing back to him and in off his knee.There was nothing lucky about Morrison's goal, though. He collected Diame's clever flick and ran with the ball before taking on Michael Dawson and signalling his talent with a wonderfully composed finish.</body>

      <description>Jack Wilshere earns point for Gunners.</description>

      <body>Jack Wilshere's second-half strike earned Arsenal a point at West Brom and returned the Gunners to the top of the Premier League on goals scored.The Baggies took the lead when an unmarked Claudio Yacob headed home Morgan Amalfitano's cross.Nicolas Anelka missed two good chances to double the home side's lead shortly before Wilshere's deflected 20-yard shot levelled for Arsenal.Olivier Giroud almost won it for the visitors but Boaz Myhill denied him.Defeat would have been harsh on Steve Clarke's side, who followed last weekend's victory against champions Manchester United with a slick performance which saw them become the first team to take points off Arsenal since Aston Villa won at Emirates Stadium on the opening day.The Baggies were composed in possession and a constant threat in the final third as the fluid movement and creativity of their front four continually exposed the Arsenal defence.England Under-21 international Saido Berahino, who scored the winner at Old Trafford last week, produced another excellent display up front while Amalfitano and Stephane Sessegnon linked well with Anelka to cause the visitors problems.But Arsenal also had their moments and showed a resilience which is marking them out as genuine title contenders.They were indebted to goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny early on, the Pole getting down well to deny Berahino, who cut inside and fired in a low shot.At the other end, Aaron Ramsey had Arsenal's best opportunity and the impressive Myhill reacted instinctively to beat the ball clear after his fellow Welshman's shot found its way through a crowd of players.That save lifted the hosts, who went straight up to the other end and took the lead - Amalfitano putting an inch-perfect cross into the box from the right for Yacob to head home from six yards out.The hosts pressed for a second after the break and former Arsenal striker Anelka miscontrolled in the area after Berahino powered past Per Mertesacker on the left.Mertesacker was having a shaky 10 minutes - which led to him being shifted from the right side of central defence to the left - and Anelka sprinted past the German before curling a shot agonisingly wide.Arsene Wenger's side gradually began to assert their authority in midfield and equalised in impressive style when Tomas Rosicky and Giroud combined to tee up Wilshere for his first Premier League goal in almost three years.The England midfielder was now snapping into the tackle and spraying passes around - his clever ball forward splitting the Baggies defence and putting Giroud through, but Myhill saved well as the Frenchman tried to round him.Both sides continued to drive forward but struggled to break through, settling for a hard-earned point which sends Arsenal into the two-week international break at the league's summit and lifts West Brom up to 12th.</body>

      <title>Thomas wins vault bronze at Worlds</title>
      <description>Kristian Thomas wins bronze in the vault to claim Great Britain's first ever medal in the event at the World Championships.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/gymnastics/24421416</url>
      <date>1381077529</date>
      <body>Kristian Thomas won bronze in the vault to claim Britain's first ever medal in the event at the World Gymnastics.The London 2012 team bronze medallist delivered his two vaults to near-perfection on Sunday in Antwerp.Thomas, 24, finished with an average score of 15.233, behind South Korea's Yang Hak-Seon (15.533) and American Steven Legendre (15.249)."To make the final was the first aim, so I'm over the moon. I'm really happy and proud," said Thomas."Once again, the British gymnasts have proved how good we are and I'm delighted to have contributed to that success."The Wolverhampton gymnast has long been considered a vital contributor in the team event, exemplified by the stunning vault he produced during London 2012's team final, helping GB to bronze.But unlike world medallists Louis Smith, Daniel Keatings, Dan Purvis and most recently Max Whitlock, the podium had eluded him in individual competition until now.Nor had 2013 shaped up well for Thomas, who missed much of the year - including the European Championships in April - through a fractured tibia."Three weeks ago I didn't even know if I'd be coming to the World Championships," he told BBC Sport."It's been a real rollercoaster of a year. Three weeks ago I was still battling to try to get into the team. To nail the first vault the way I did was so special."Yang, the defending world and Olympic champion and the last to compete, cemented his dominance of the apparatus with another victory.Britain finish this year's World Championships with two medals, supplied by Thomas's vault and Whitlock on the pommel horse.Add to that two near-misses - Whitlock's fourth place in an exceptionally competitive all-around final on Thursday, with Purvis narrowly missing bronze in the men's floor event - and British Gymnastics can be satisfied that the men are building on last year's Olympic success."Today, watching Kristian's final on the vault was really good. For GB to come away with two medals is amazing," said Whitlock, a double bronze medallist at London 2012 yet making his Worlds debut this year.Elsewhere on Sunday, 16-year-old Simone Biles completed a hugely successful week for both her and the United States squad with victory in the women's floor final.Biles, already the all-around champion, scored 15.000 to beat Italy's Vanessa Ferrari, her nearest challenger with 14.633.The first-year senior also won silver on the vault and bronze on the balance beam at these championships.The US won an unprecedented 12 world medals in Belgium, three more than the previous American record set in Melbourne eight years earlier.The US men contributed four medals without winning a world title, while the women won at least one medal in every event - Kyla Ross taking three silvers and McKayla Maroney lifting the world vault title.Russia's Aliya Mustafina won the beam event for her first world title in three years, and Japanese all-around champion Kohei Uchimura shared parallel bars gold with China's Lin Chaopan.Sunday's concluding final, on the high bar, lived up to expectations as Olympic champion Epke Zonderland once again stunned the crowd with a daring and difficult routine.The Dutchman scored 16.000 for his first world title, beating German friend and arch-rival Fabian Hambuechen, who could only manage 15.933 in response.</body>

      <title>Ace cafe with quite a nice ancient monument attached?</title>
      <description>The new Stonehenge visitor centre will have a big cafe attached. But have attractions become all about the gift ship and cafe?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24335517</url>
      <date>1381130932</date>
      <body>English Heritage has announced that it is building a £27m visitor centre at Stonehenge, with what looks like a very large eating area. Is the cafe and gift shop almost as important as the attraction itself these days?Almost 50% of the shiny new visitor centre at Stonehenge will be taken up with a new "bright and spacious" cafe for up to 260 people and a bigger shop.It almost harks back to a memorable ad campaign by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. In 1988, the museum commissioned a poster with the slogan: "Where else do they give you £100,000,000 worth of objets d'art free with every egg salad?"The poster was one of six, all describing the VandA as: "An ace caff, with quite a nice museum attached."It's a premise that won't surprise anyone who has visited a stately home or garden run by the National Trust recently. Some 19.2 million people made a trip last year. Many of those will have dutifully queued for a flapjack and a cup of tea. Or even a substantial meal.Food writer Giles Coren recalls visiting London Zoo as a child and caring more about the gift shop than the animals: "Thousands of school children, coachloads of them have to visit these places, and all they care about is the shop."He associates past visits to stately homes with rock-hard scones but thinks for many people it's increasingly all about the food. "It's like the Colosseum in Rome, people go all that way to see it only to discover it's a lot of boring old stones, but at least you can get an excellent pizza."Visitors now demand a nice place to eat, having put up with poor facilities for far too long, Coren suggests. "Everything in Britain has been rubbish for years and people won't put up with it anymore."There is scepticism among some about the new generation of visitor centres.TripAdvisor is full of reviews from people who are unimpressed. One reviewer was very upset when changes were made at a cathedral in East Anglia. "I love this cathedral, have been taking visitors to it for over 20 years… but it was so much nicer when you could walk in at the front. Now you have to go through a new visitors' centre, which adds nothing to your experience of visiting the cathedral, but does direct you past a desk for collecting your 'optional' entrance fee."Another visitor to a major modern art museum in London recalled: "We ordered their vegetable soup - a small bowl with watery soup containing some vegetables and a small hard roll (and we had to ask for some butter!) - 6.50 each! For us that's a rip-off and we were not impressed."But generally the trend is for the cafes in museums, galleries and castles to get better and better. And those in the heritage business see them as a happy synergy."A good shop and cafe greatly enhance the overall experience," says Matthew Tanner, chairman of the Association of Independent Museums. "No visit is complete without an interesting shop, a fine cup of tea, and not forgetting a good loo too."The argument for spending money on an extensive cafe is twofold - visitors have come to expect them, and the revenue raised helps subsidise the attraction.One place where this takes place is RHS Wisley in Surrey where the gift shop and cafe are the gatekeepers to the gardens people come to see. Nigel Eaton manages the shop and says it is part of the whole experience."We've got three kinds of customers - we have the RHS members who visit on a regular basis, the gardeners who come just for the plants and then we've got what we call the payers, who come on coaches for a nice day out. Every penny that is spent in the shop goes back into the RHS, so the shop is very important to us."Some 1.1 million people visit Wisley every year. The results of a customer survey revealed that 22% of those visitors came just for the "retail experience". Last year the shop - including one of the world's biggest gardening bookshops - made £3.8m and they expect to make an even bigger profit this year.As a Lonely Planet author, David Else has visited a lot of tourist attractions and has no problem with visitor centres. In fact he rather likes them."In the case of Stonehenge, a good visitor centre is going to tell you so much more about the history of what is essentially a group of old stones. I've got no problem with cafes, either - I like a good cup of tea after a visit and don't mind if they want to make a few bob to help preserve the site."In the heritage and art business it's all about making attractions "sustainable".Getting the shop and cafe right at an attraction is a win-win situation, says Jane Temperley from the Association for Cultural Enterprises. "Sure it is about generating income - everyone is looking at how to make their sites more sustainable. But research says visitors enjoy cafes and shops, happy visitors spend more and tend to become repeat visitors or members, which generates more income."About 80% of visitors to Wisley are RHS members so they come back to visit time and time again. Thirty-two staff work in the Wisley Shop and 60 staff work in the cafes and restaurants - that's over 25% of the total site staff of 350.And the staff at attraction are at pains to point out that the food has got better and better. Laurent Trenga is the chef responsible for the planning of menus at Wisley. He points out that a burger and chips at Wisley is no ordinary burger and chips. "Our burger is made from locally sourced quality pork and apples grown in our own orchards, even the bun is made fresh on site."The plants are rather nice too.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>An unusual thank you for WWII Spitfires</title>
      <description>To say thank you to the African countries that donated Spitfires to the war effort, branches of the Samaritans are being set up across the continent.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24399641</url>
      <date>1380906962</date>
      <body>To say thank you to the African countries that donated Spitfires during World War II, a former development worker from the UK is setting up branches of the Samaritans across the continent."Suicide is still a taboo here because it's seen as something like a curse," says Merab Mulindi, one of the founding members of Samaritans Kenya.Launched in 2003, it offers support to distressed citizens over the phone and in person from its office in Nairobi."People do not like to talk about it and the families face a lot of stigma, which only deepens the problem," she says.The project was initiated by John Hurst, who spent more than two decades working in Africa for the British government and another 10 years volunteering for the Samaritans in the UK. He aims to found similar organisations in all the African nations that donated money to the RAF during WWII.He highlights what he believes is a common pattern, in which poorer families struggle to send their eldest child to university."The hope of the family is that the child will take them out of poverty through their education," he says. "But the stresses of university, or worries over money, can trigger a suicide which decimates the whole family."The problem is compounded by the perception of the wider community and is often reflected in the way the bodies are treated after death, particularly in East Africa. Traditional burial services for victims of suicide are rare, says Hurst."There are no reading of the Bible. In some instances the families have even been locked in their houses while the body is taken into the bush and abandoned."It is difficult to know how many people commit suicide in the country each year, says Mulindi, who's convinced that many cases go unreported. "The statistics are minimal because people do not talk about it."Hurst thinks many of the lessons learned by the Samaritans - and similar organisations in the West - can be transferred to Africa. Problems securing employment and marital difficulties seem to be common factors across the globe."We know that the majority of people who commit suicide in the UK do so at night. That's the time of greatest stress and they usually want to speak to someone just before they do it."By providing a helpline, he is confident the service can save lives. So far about 70 people have been trained as volunteers and 20 are on duty on a regular basis. The group has no shortage of committed volunteers, but funding its phone bills has proved more difficult."We do not have a toll-free line so people have to have enough credit to be able to call us. Sometimes they expect us to call them back, which is not always possible," says Mulindi.The biggest problem has been getting people to engage with the issue. It took three years to gain approval as an official NGO. "Having the government finally register the charity was probably the greatest challenge," says Hurst.Hence his innovative way to explain his motivation. "When you say suicide, people switch off. The moment you say the word Spitfire, or talk about Spitfires, it engages people," he says. By talking about the Samaritans project as a way to say thank you to the countries involved, he has been able to gain more attention for its efforts."Kenya donated six Spitfires at a cost of £5,000 each," he explains, adding that his next focus is Lesotho, which helped purchase more than 20 of the iconic fighter planes for the war effort.In Kenya, awareness does seem to be building slowly, particularly after the finance minister's son took his own life last year. The issue received more media coverage on Kenya's annual suicide prevention day, held each September."In that sense there's some opening up of the possibility of people talking about it," says Mulindi.Video produced by Thomas Amter and John Galliver.

      <title>Tory MP pushes for early EU vote</title>
      <description>A prominent Conservative backbench MP says he will try to force the government to hold an early referendum on whether the UK should leave the EU.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24417670</url>
      <date>1381073991</date>
      <body>Prominent Conservative backbencher Adam Afriyie has said he will try to force the government to hold an early vote on whether the UK should leave the EU.The prime minister has promised to hold an in/out referendum in 2017 if he wins the next general election, but Mr Afriyie said voters were "not convinced" that it would happen.He said he would push for a vote in October 2014 instead.But Home Secretary Theresa May warned that Mr Afriyie had "got it wrong".And a Downing Street spokesman said of Mr Afriyie's plan: "The PM will not let it stand."Mr Afriyie - who has denied newspaper claims he is being groomed to replace party leader David Cameron - said he would table an amendment to the European Union (Referendum) Bill on Monday.Mr Cameron has pledged to renegotiate the UK's relationship with the EU before an in/out referendum in 2017.But, speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics programme, Mr Afriyie said there would be "ample time" to conduct this renegotiation by as early as next year."By having a referendum in 2014, it gives us 12 months to renegotiate," he said. "But more than that, it kick-starts negotiations."EU member states would need to "accommodate" British demands for reforms "if they wish us to remain", he added.He argued: "I think it strengthens the prime minister's hand."The MP said 80% of people wanted a referendum, and more than 50% of people wanted a referendum this side of the election."British businesses need certainty," he said, adding he had struggled with his conscience over the matter."I don't want to cause any trouble over it, but I think it's absolutely essential that Parliament and MPs have the opportunity to search their souls and to give people a referendum this side of the election."In an article for the Mail on Sunday, he predicted that, without a referendum before 2015, "large numbers of people will continue to vote UKIP whatever happens, and if they do, there is a distinct danger that Labour will gain a majority and we will never see a referendum at all".UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he would be "absolutely delighted" if the nation could have a referendum before 2015, adding it would benefit British business.He told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme: "Adam Afriyie has put his finger on the real problem - and that's that four years ago, Mr Cameron gave us a cast-iron guarantee that there would be a referendum."This time last year, he was saying there would not be a referendum, and he is now saying there should be a referendum. People are not quite sure what to believe."But Mrs May told the BBC: "We need to be negotiating that settlement with the European Union and then put to the British people the Europe of the future - not the Europe of the past - and give them that opportunity to say in or out."What is crucial is that we have, at the next election, a Conservative party that will be offering people that renegotiation of a new settlement with Europe, looking to the future and then putting that to the British people in an in/out referendum."Backbench Conservative MP James Wharton is attempting to enshrine his party leadership's referendum pledge in law - without the support of coalition partners the Liberal Democrats - with his European Union (Referendum) Bill.As a private member's bill, it is vulnerable to being delayed by procedural tactics from MPs who oppose it, and will only become law if the government allocates enough parliamentary time for its proponents to overcome any such hurdles.Mrs May warned Mr Afriyie's amendment to the bill could "jeopardise" its prospects entirely.And Mr Wharton told BBC Radio 5 live the amendment could "kill" it."My concern is that any amendment, no matter how well-meaning it might be, is going to make the progress of the bill more difficult and it'll make it easier for those MPs who want to use procedural techniques to slow it down and stop it... that bit more possible."I don't want to see that. I'd like to see my bill go through and I think this harms the chances of that happening."Liberal Democrat deputy leader Simon Hughes, whose party opposes a referendum on the EU unless further powers are handed from Westminster to Brussels, said a 2014 referendum would be a "barmy" distraction from attempts to boost UK economic growth.Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said the Conservative leadership had scheduled a referendum in 2017 due to "internal party management as much as anything else".The PM's promise of a "grand, unilateral renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU" was "deeply flawed and bound to unravel", he added, in pre-released extracts of a speech to be delivered in London on Tuesday.Labour Party vice-chair, Michael Dugher MP, said "the Tories are back to obsessing about the European Union"."We need a prime minister and a government that will make dealing with the cost of living the number one priority. Instead David Cameron is too weak and out of touch to stop this latest outbreak of Tory infighting."The European Union (Referendum) Bill is due to return to the House of Commons for further debate on 8 November.</body>

      <title>Burnham acts on 'cover-up slurs'</title>
      <description>Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham will not accept "slurs on his character" from his Conservative counterpart Jeremy Hunt, a Labour spokesman says.</description>

      <date>1381073754</date>
      <body>Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham will not accept "slurs on his character" from his Conservative counterpart Jeremy Hunt, a Labour spokesman has said.Mr Hunt had suggested on Twitter that Mr Burnham attempted to "cover up" NHS failings when he was in government.As a result, the Labour MP instructed his lawyers to write to the health secretary, the spokesman confirmed.A Conservative spokesman described Mr Burnham's move as "astonishing".Labour believes that Mr Hunt's tweet was "a step too far" and is seeking a retraction and apology unless Mr Hunt can provide evidence to substantiate his allegation, BBC political correspondent Alan Soady said.The Labour spokesman said: "Instead of focusing on what he should be doing and tackling the AandE crisis, Jeremy Hunt has spent all year orchestrating a smear campaign against Andy Burnham. On Friday, he went a step too far."This is behaviour unbecoming of a secretary of state. Andy Burnham is not prepared to accept these unfounded slurs on his character and the last government. He has therefore instructed lawyers to act on his behalf."In response, a Conservative source told our correspondent: "It's astonishing that Labour are still trying to deny the clear link between [England's health watchdog] the CQC's decision not to expose poor hospital care under the last government and the political pressure applied to the CQC by Labour ministers."Mr Hunt's tweet is understood to relate to a CQC investigation into Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which was placed in "special measures" in July after recording above-average death rates.Conservative MP Steve Barclay has said a series of emails - which he obtained and published on Friday after making a freedom of information request to the CQC - showed that Mr Burnham had put "pressure on the regulator to water down its concerns" about the trust when he was health secretary under Labour.</body>

      <title>Is 'addiction' an excuse to overeat?</title>
      <description>Is it helpful to label 'food addiction' an illness?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24402163</url>
      <date>1381109365</date>
      <body>"Food addiction" is becoming a popular term to explain overeating. But in this Scrubbing Up, Professor John Blundell from the Institute of Psychological Sciences at the University of Leeds warns the term is being used far too freely.Some have likened food addiction to drug addiction, and then used this term to associate it with overeating, and as a clinical explanation for the obesity epidemic, implicating millions of people.The use of the term food addiction is a step towards medicalisation and implies that normal human social behaviour is pathological.Forms of eating therefore become an illness. This attitude is not helpful and has huge implications for the way in which people view their own behaviour and their lives.The concept of food addiction comes from a combination of experimental data, anecdotal observations, scientific claims, personal opinions, deductions and beliefs.It is an over-simplification of a very complex set of behaviours.The existing evidence fails to define the precise characteristics of the actual foods concerned or the eating environment that underlies the assumed addiction risk.This is in contrast to drug addiction, where the molecule is identified and its pharmacological effect on the brain is characterised.Animal studies have shown changes to specific the brain in those given a sugary diet - and human brain scans show activation of reward systems in the same part of the brain when sweet tastes are consumed.Therefore, it is not surprising that reward centres are activated when sweet foods are consumed, as we know that the reward circuits in the brain have been established through evolution as signalling systems that control our appetite.Many stimuli influence these areas of the brain and, in addition, there is an intrinsic drive to consume carbohydrate-rich foods to satisfy a basic metabolic need of the brain.Sweetness is a major signal for such foods but the science has not yet assessed this fully and much more work is needed before we could say that food is addictive.Attributing food addiction as the single cause underlying the development of obesity, despite the existence of numerous other very plausible explanations, is unhelpful, particularly for those trying to live more healthy lives.I am concerned that many people may potentially latch on to the concept of food addiction as an excuse to explain their overeating - the premise that it's "not my fault" and therefore, "I can't help it".This removes the personal responsibility they should feel and could act on - and they infer that their eating is a form of disease.Food addiction may offer an appealing explanation for some people but the concept could seriously hinder an individual's capacity for personal control.Binge eating disorder does exist - but it is a rare clinical condition affecting fewer than 3% of obese people.Sufferers have a strong compulsion to eat, which persists alongside the sense of a loss of control.Addiction-like food behaviour may be a component of the severe and compulsive form of binge eating disorder.But this condition does not explain the huge rise in obesity we have seen across the population.Binge eating is not a key cause of obesity and, therefore, in the context of mass public health, is not a major concern.What we need is a calm and composed analysis of what the words food addiction really mean so that people can make informed deductions about the causes of their own behaviour.</body>

      <title>Partner's 415 miles for Army captain</title>
      <description>Running 415 miles to remember her dead partner</description>

      <body>When Thea Davies finishes the Chester marathon on Sunday it will not be the end of a race so much as a labour of love.It is her 10th marathon to raise funds in memory of her partner, Stephen Healey from Cardiff.Capt Healey was the 415th UK serviceman to die in Afghanistan, killed by a roadside bomb in Helmand in 2012.Ms Davies, from Pembrokeshire, vowed to run 415 miles, a goal she will achieve.Capt Healey, a former Swansea City apprentice, was commanding his platoon in the 1st Battalion, The Royal Welsh (Royal Welch Fusiliers). from a lead vehicle when it ran over and detonated a the bomb in May 2012."For the first couple of months after Steve died I didn't know what to do. I just moped around," said Ms Davies."Eventually the padre who repatriated Steve - who co-incidentally is also Steve - took me to watch the Olympics, completely reluctantly at the time."I already knew I wanted to do some sort of fund-raising for Steve's favourite charity,"And I knew it had to have a symbolic significance. But it wasn't until I watched the Brownlees winning gold and bronze in the triathlon that the idea of running 415 miles came to me."Capt Healey raised money for Blind Veterans UK because it supported soldiers who had lost their sight through explosions in Afghanistan.Before his last tour he organised a blindfolded sponsored walk to its rehabilitation and training centre in Llandudno, Conwy.Ms Davies' year of running has seen her raise about £14,000 for the charity.Chief executive Robert Leader said her support had been inspirational."At a time of enormous personal tragedy for her she chose to take up Stephen's mantle and continue the amazing work that he had done to support ex-servicemen and women, blinded both in action and later life."We owe both her and Stephen a huge debt of gratitude and what they have done for our people will never be forgotten".Her feat has seen her compete in 20 races - 10Ks, half and full-length marathons, triathlons, and even a half-iron man event.Completing the challenge in Chester will also be highly significant."I hadn't planned it all the way along that the challenge would finish in Chester, but I'm extremely glad that it's worked out that way."As well as Steve's regiment being based here in the Dale Barracks, two years ago Chester was the first marathon Steve dragged me around, just over six months before he died."With the end of this challenge, she is already planning her next project."It suddenly struck me a few weeks ago that it's nearly all over. That panicked me a bit - it certainly made me very emotional because the running has been my way of coping with it all I suppose.""I'm so grateful to everyone who's supported me throughout. Not just my family, but also Blind Veterans UK, and particularly the thousands of ordinary people who've donated and given me such a sense of purpose.""This was for Steve, but the next challenge is for myself. I'm off to New Zealand next year to take part in an ultra iron man event," she said.</body>

      <title>The state school sixth formers twinned with Eton</title>
      <description>State and public school sixth formers twinned</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24289105</url>
      <date>1381016264</date>
      <body>From a busy junction at Stratford High Street in East London, there is a great view of a symbol of one of the UK's most glittering recent successes - the Olympic Park - and the modern station created to go with it.And close by is an unusual school which is striving to bring together the old and the new traditions of England - much like the spectacular opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics.The London Academy of Excellence is a government-funded sixth-form serving the East End of the capital which is trying to bridge the gap between private and state schools.It opened its doors as London basked in the glow of the Olympics last year.In an unusual partnership, pupils there share lessons, sport and teachers with a local community school and several independent fee-paying schools including Eton, Brighton College and Highgate.It is easy to miss the London Academy of Excellence. Its modern building looks like any other shiny office block, perched on the edge of a busy road.It is as far from the green playing fields and quads of Eton and Brighton College as you could imagine - but pupils at these and the other schools involved are sharing more than lessons and aspirations.Through a buddy system, they are getting to know each other during visits and getting a window on each other's lives.Yousef, 17, was one of the first group of sixth-formers to join the academy."I was attracted by the links with Eton and the other schools," he said."This has built a bridge between us and independent schools. It's taught us a lot. It's illustrated that we have far more in common than difference."I get to visit Eton House boys with tailcoats. That was a bit of an experience, out of the ordinary, but behind that we saw a lot of similarities between us."Do the teenagers feel envious when they see the very different surroundings of pupils at the other schools?Curtis, 17, says no."One buddy took us on a tour and I studied a lesson of history with them. There was a similar-sized classroom, a similar way of teaching and talking. I felt at home there," he said."I did not feel envious. I am not that kind of individual. But who would not want to study at Eton?"Some of the sixth-formers say they feel lucky, because they do not have to pay for their education."We have this free. They are paying vast amounts to go to a college similar to ours", says Clinton.Ellie says the students at the other schools seemed really pleased to meet them."They were just as interested in us as we were in them. My buddy was asking so many questions about what we do."Most of their education takes place in the bright modern, business-like surroundings of their academy, in a converted office block.Their "uniform" is a "smart, professional dress code".The walls are white, the furniture bright. Big bold canvases with faces of famous intellectuals, scientists, artists and writers decorate the walls, dotted with their words of inspiration.In front of one of them is the academy's headmaster Robert Wilne, an energetic man, who bubbles over with enthusiasm for his pupils' success, their futures - and the aims of this experimental school."There are many schools doing interesting partnerships," he said."But this is a third way for independent schools, aside from giving bursaries or sponsoring academies."It is an experiment. I would love another city to look at it."It's a genuine, deep-seated partnership between eight schools that are woven in to the DNA of this academy."It's not window dressing or surface gloss."It is an experiment praised by the head of England's schools inspectorate Sir Michael Wilshaw, who in the summer accused many independent schools of living in "splendid isolation" from the state sector.He drew criticism from some in the private school sector this week too, for saying some schools' links with state schools were small, like crumbs from their tables.Some responded angrily, saying that their schools saved taxpayers money by educating children outside of the state sector.Both Labour and coalition governments have called for more links between private and state sector schools.All the academy's funding is from the government, says Mr Wilne and there is no direct funding from private schools.But there is support "in kind" and through links. Some of the governors are from the independent schools in the partnership."We draw on their various expertise and resources," says the headmaster."So if I want a scheme of work [curriculum plan] for maths, I go to to Highgate and ask for that. The head of economics at Brighton College is de facto head of economics here."They have been down and given feedback and mentoring support."Mr Wilne hopes the school will help social mobility."Education is the fuel of social mobility, education changes lives," he says."This 360 degree education we are offering here should fuel that mobility. Students will get the grades that will unlock doors to top universities and they are taking up extra-curricular activities and sports."They are interested in meeting others and they are not going to be daunted by meeting Etonians in the future."Sport, it seems, has also proved to be a good ice-breaker between students at the various schools."We enjoy visiting them as much as the sport," says Yousef.Curtis says he is enjoying trying out new sports."There is so much sport available. We do rowing. In my secondary school, we did rowing on a rowing machine, now we get to go on the water."With the first full exam season under its belt, the academy is now into its second year. The pioneer year looks to be a hard act to follow, having achieved 70% of their AS-levels at grades of A or B.Three students, including Ellie, spent part of the summer in the USA on a summer school after being encouraged to apply."I always wanted to go to university but did not aspire to the top ones," she said.The students say the school has widened their horizons, with encouragement to do so often coming in the shape of one of the many emails pumped out by their headmaster telling them of various opportunities."I get worried if I don't get an email from the head," one teenager says.They are getting help with their university applications and personal statements from one of the visiting teachers from the private sector.Student Harmanpreet says: "Our old head was always saying it's not about where you come from but where you are going."We know we are from a deprived area but LAE has shown us where we want to go."</body>

      <body>Robin van Persie has made world-class quality his trademark - so it was no surprise he headed straight to Manchester United's precocious teenager Adnan Januzaj amid the celebrations at the Stadium of Light.Van Persie's relatively brief United career has been sprinkled with match-winning moments and he will have recognised something of himself in the manner of 18-year-old Januzaj's spectacular contribution to a vital 2-1 win against Sunderland.And while there have been whispers about Januzaj's quality around Old Trafford for some time, they turned to a scream once he had produced the decisive contribution and announced the arrival of a special talent.United - despite manager David Moyes' fanciful claims that they more or less dominated the whole game against the Black Cats - were only in the process of exerting their superiority when Januzaj ensured some of the clouds gathering over the Premier League champions and their new manager rolled away into the Wearside night.Januzaj, who had already impressed with his passing and subtle attacking play, showed composure to send a thumping side-footed shot past Keiren Westwood from Patrice Evra's cross after 55 minutes - but it was his winning goal six minutes later that carried the real hallmark of all outstanding players.Yes, there was a danger when John O'Shea half-cleared a cross, but the punishment was heavy as Januzaj adopted the perfect position and faultless technique to send a low left-foot volley into the bottom corner and snuff out all the resilience that had given Sunderland's interim head coach Kevin Ball so much encouragement.It was the sort of finish Van Persie has delivered countless times in his career and his appreciation was clear as he embraced Januzaj in front of United's joyous supporters after the final whistle.Moyes, who gave Wayne Rooney his debut at 16 at Everton and already places Januzaj in the same bracket at that stage of his career, also came across to offer his own words after the final whistle.And various items are now on the Manchester United manager's agenda.Moyes must judge how to develop and nurture Januzaj, whose performance loudly demanded a place in the United starting line-up - certainly when placed alongside another fitful performance from Nani.He must also do it while Januzaj wrestles with pressing issues regarding his future for club and country.The boy prodigy who was signed by Anderlecht at 10 and moved to Manchester United in March 2011 will be in high demand, even more so after lacing his first Premier League start with such brilliance.Moyes' main concern will be tying Januzaj to a new contract once his present Old Trafford deal expires at the end of this season. He made all the right noises about Manchester United's pedigree and track record of promoting young players - but their efforts to secure his signature must now take on added urgency.For all Moyes' optimism, it does not take a huge leap of the imagination to suspect forces from Europe's other footballing superpowers will be at work while there is the slightest chance of prising him away from Old Trafford.Securing the new contract must now be near the top of United's priorities after watching the way in which Januzaj was the catalyst for a victory that at least goes some way to banishing the bitter memories of Premier League losses to Manchester City and West Bromwich Albion.Januzaj's background makes him eligible for Albania, Kosovo, Turkey and Belgium. It is believed the player's family have advised him against making a commitment until he has secured a first-team place at club level.He has now done that at United - and Moyes revealed the Football Association has already made inquiries about Januzaj's eventual availability for England based on residency.It sounds like a desperate shot in the dark by the FA but it cannot be blamed for trying - even though there are serious factors weighing against them.A player of such quality and ambition is unlikely to wait to qualify for England when there is the opportunity to play for Belgium, emerging so quickly as a force with a new generation of players capable of making an impact at next summer's World Cup in Brazil.Not great timing for England's declaration of interest.For now, United can celebrate the addition of such a gifted new star to their ranks and how they needed him.The graceful Januzaj illustrated a wide range of passing, a willingness to take players on and also a determination to shoot when the opportunity arose. He did it with deadly effect despite the fact that close Old Trafford observers report his finishing as one of the weak elements of an almost-complete attacking game.If Januzaj, understandably, claims the headlines, goalkeeper David de Gea was not far behind because Moyes could have been discussing an entirely different story had it not been for a magnificent save with United trailing to Craig Gardner's early goal.Emanuele Giaccherini was turning away to celebrate when De Gea flew away to his right to show outstanding athleticism and anticipation to turn his header away. It kept United in the game and enabled Januzaj to shape later events so spectacularly.This was not a flowing United but victory was all that mattered.And, even though the season is in its infancy, it was clear they needed a spark from somewhere to act as ignition.Januzaj, the bright new star of Old Trafford, may just have provided it.</body>

      <body>US special forces' mixed fortunes in Libya and Somalia dominate Monday's papers.Commandos captured Anas al-Liby, a leading al-Qaeda suspect in Libya, but failed to track down a senior al-Shabab militant in southern Somalia.The Daily Telegraph describes how MPs plan to question Home Secretary Theresa May over why al-Liby was given political asylum in Britain in the 1990s and was allowed to live here.The Times believes the mission in Somalia ultimately failed because it was planned in just a week and a half.But the Guardian takes a different perspective, warning that the US raids could invite further retaliation and escalation.Another story dominating the papers is what the Times calls the cruel short visits which deprive the elderly of dignity and care.The Daily Mail and Express describe how in many cases, time is so tight during visits by carers that some of the most vulnerable people are forced to choose between having a cup of tea or being helped to the lavatory.The Independent argues it will be be hard to resolve the crisis without more money.Several papers have delved into the private papers of former Prime Minister Lady Thatcher.And they have all picked up on her plan to anoint Cecil, now Lord, Parkinson as her successor.The plot was only scuppered when he informed her his secretary was pregnant with his love child.According to the Financial Times the archives also show the Iron Lady was capable not just of intimidating colleagues and opponents, but could leave male admirers looking like love-struck teenagers.One such man, it seems, was Sir John Nott who, on his resignation said in a letter to the PM: "I actually admire you as a woman - your good looks, charm and bearing have always attracted me."As the Daily Mail points out, Sir John never received a reply.There's good news and bad news for people hoping to buy a stake in Royal Mail when it's partially sold-off by the government this week.The Telegraph says that with the sale heavily oversubscribed, investors are predicted to enjoy an instant profit of up to 40%.But the Mail warns that thousands of small investors risk losing out to the "City Big Boys" in what the paper calls a "shares gold rush".Housing remains popular topic for a number of today's titles.The Guardian reports on banks and building societies that are "braced for a stampede" as thousands of potential home-owners try to take advantage of the latest phase of the government-backed Help to Buy mortgage scheme.However, the Times says there are doubts about the affordability of the programme with buyers possibly having to pay rates of up to 6%.The Telegraph says the housing problem needs addressing but asks whether the government is undermining its own ambitions by creating a new bubble.Meanwhile, the Daily Mirror claims police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann are poised to make arrests amid hopes that the "net is closing in on her kidnappers".The Sun says it has investigated Britain's mental health system and reports that 1,200 people have been killed by high-risk patients in ten years - a "catastrophe" it says in an editorial.</body>

      <body>Tens of thousands of lives could be saved each year in the UK if people got off the sofa and stretched their legs more, say charities.The "Walking Works" report by the Ramblers and Macmillan Cancer Support said walking was a free activity which could transform people's health.Being physically active decreases the odds of heart problems and stroke.But it also makes a difference in other conditions such as type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and many cancers.Last week a British Medical Journal study showed that exercise was as good a medicine as pills for some conditions including heart diseases and another study showed walking at least an hour a day significantly cut the risk of breast cancer.The latest report said that if everyone, in England alone, did the recommended 150 minutes of moderate physical exercise every week it would:The two charities run the Walking for Health programme in an attempt to get more people up on their feet.Benedict Southworth, chief executive of the Ramblers, said: "We're facing a serious crisis of inactivity, but there is a simple solution,"We need to see greater investment in initiatives which support and promote walking as the most accessible and affordable way for people to get active."Ciarán Devane, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: "For cancer patients, being active can help manage some of the debilitating consequences of treatment and can even help reduce the chance of some cancers returning."Inactivity is a nationwide epidemic that must be tackled now before it is too late."Public Health England said inactivity had "life threatening consequences".Its director of health and wellbeing Prof Kevin Fenton said: "Inactivity increases the risk of serious illnesses like type 2 diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers."It makes it more likely that people will be overweight or obese. Supporting people to get active through walking can be a major part of the solution."</body>

      <description>Short care visits mean disabled people must choose between staying thirsty or using the toilet, a charity warns, amid claims the practice is rising in England.</description>

      <body>Short care visits to elderly and disabled people are "disgraceful" and on the rise, a charity has claimed.In England, 60% of councils use 15-minute visits, which are not long enough to provide adequate care Leonard Cheshire Disability says.The charity says such visits can "force disabled people to choose whether to go thirsty or to go to the toilet".But care managers insisted some short visits could be "fully justified and fully adequate".Leonard Cheshire is pushing for a ban on what it calls the "scandal of flying 15-minute visits", lobbying the government to outlaw the practice in England.A report published by the charity said short visits "simply do not allow enough time to deliver good-quality care".It said data from 63 local authorities pointed to a 15% rise in such visits in the last five years, and said some in councils more than 75% of care visits were carried out in less than 15 minutes.Chief executive Clare Pelham said visits should be at least 30 minutes long."It is disgraceful to force disabled people to choose whether to go thirsty or to go to the toilet by providing care visits as short as 15 minutes long," she said.Ms Pelham said most people need 40 minutes to get up, washed, dressed and have breakfast."We are treating disabled and older people as if they are robots to be serviced, rather than real people who deserve to be treated with kindness and consideration," she added.But the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass), which represents care managers, argued it was "totally wrong" to suggest all caring tasks require more than 15 minutes.Sandie Keene, the association's president, said some short visits were "fully justified and fully adequate".It was "frankly naive to believe that simply by abolishing 15-minute slots a magic wand will have been waved, and improvements automatically achieved in our care services," she added."It doesn't work like that."Ms Keene said social workers and their managers had to make "horrendously difficult choices" every day to give the best possible care with limited resources.Leonard Cheshire wants peers to back a ban on short visits by amending the government's Care Bill when it is debated in the House of Lords on Wednesday.The Local Government Association (LGA), pointed to a "substantially underfunded" social care service which was putting councillors under increasing pressure."Significant cuts to council funding mean local authorities are struggling to meet the rising demand for home care visits," said Katie Hall, chairwoman of the LGA's community and wellbeing board.She said 15-minute visits "should never be the sole basis for care", but added: "In some circumstances such as administering medication they can be appropriate, but only as part of a wider comprehensive care plan involving longer one-to-one visits."Leonard Cheshire Disability said a survey of 2,025 people found 93% of those who expressed an opinion agreed 15 minutes was "not long enough to support a disabled or older person to do everyday things like wash, dress and get out of bed in the morning".</body>

      <title>Burnham acts on 'cover-up slurs'</title>

      <body>Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham will not accept "slurs on his character" from his Conservative counterpart Jeremy Hunt, a Labour spokesman has said.Mr Hunt had suggested on Twitter that Mr Burnham attempted to "cover up" NHS failings when he was in government.As a result, the Labour MP instructed his lawyers to write to the health secretary, the spokesman confirmed.A Conservative spokesman described Mr Burnham's move as "astonishing".Labour believes that Mr Hunt's tweet was "a step too far" and is seeking a retraction and apology unless Mr Hunt can provide evidence to substantiate his allegation, BBC political correspondent Alan Soady said.The Labour spokesman said: "Instead of focusing on what he should be doing and tackling the AandE crisis, Jeremy Hunt has spent all year orchestrating a smear campaign against Andy Burnham. On Friday, he went a step too far."This is behaviour unbecoming of a secretary of state. Andy Burnham is not prepared to accept these unfounded slurs on his character and the last government. He has therefore instructed lawyers to act on his behalf."In response, a Conservative source told our correspondent: "It's astonishing that Labour are still trying to deny the clear link between [England's health watchdog] the CQC's decision not to expose poor hospital care under the last government and the political pressure applied to the CQC by Labour ministers."Mr Hunt's tweet is understood to relate to a CQC investigation into Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which was placed in "special measures" in July after recording above-average death rates.Conservative MP Steve Barclay has said a series of emails - which he obtained and published on Friday after making a freedom of information request to the CQC - showed that Mr Burnham had put "pressure on the regulator to water down its concerns" about the trust when he was health secretary under Labour.</body>

      <body>The NHS should not be there to "pick up the pieces" after people fall ill because of their lifestyle choices, said the Welsh health minister.Mark Drakeford said people needed to understand the consequences of becoming obese or drinking too much.He backed one Welsh health board's policy of making overweight people attend health courses before being put on treatment waiting lists.A BBC Wales poll found 82% people thought the policy should be extended.The survey of 502 people marks the start of a new season of BBC Wales programmes called Live Longer Wales about people's lifestyles.In one programme, Mr Drakeford denied claims of a "nanny state" claiming that "what the state does when it helps people to understand the consequences of their action is not nannying at all, it is acting as one responsible adult would to another".In July, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board launched its weight management programme saying improving weight before an operation gives a better outcome.Under the new policy, anyone who wants elective surgery with a body-mass index (BMI) above 40 must have been "offered, accepted and completed weight management support" before being added to the waiting list.The National Obesity Forum, an independent group looking at the treatment and management of obesity issues, has criticised the weight management programme warning the drop-out rate could be high.But Mr Drakeford said overweight people were less likely to benefit clinically from some operations.He added: "If you don't put yourself in a position where that treatment will be effective then that treatment won't be available to you."He said he was "not in favour of penalising people", adding it is "more than education - it is about motivation"."And it is about persuading people that if they want to live longer and they want to live healthily then that means eating better, moving more and drinking less," he said.Live Longer Wales is a new season of programmes from BBC Wales throughout October.</body>

      <title>Union anger at health pay proposal</title>
      <description>Unions criticise government moves to halt a 1% pay rise for all NHS staff in England, arguing they deserve to be rewarded for holding the health service together.</description>

      <body>Unions have criticised government moves to halt a 1% pay rise for all NHS staff in England.The Department of Health said the increase was unaffordable alongside the current system which sees many staff automatically receive incremental annual rises.It has urged the NHS pay review body to withhold the rise for 1.3m staff.Rachael Maskell, of the Unite trade union, said staff deserved the pay reward for "holding the NHS together".Health trusts are currently under pressure to make savings and the NHS wage bill accounts for around 40% of its budget.All public sector pay increases are capped at 1%.The Department of Health (DoH) proposes using the funding intended for the rise to "modernise" pay structures.It says automatic increments - linked to length of service and satisfactory performance - add £900m to salary costs.The DoH has stressed no decisions on changes to pay have been taken, insisting independent bodies will make their recommendations in February or March next year.But the plans, outlined in the DoH's submission to two independent pay review bodies, have been criticised by Unite and Labour.Ms Maskell, of Unite, said: "The Department of Health have got other choices. They're entering into a reorganisation which is costing £3bn, which nobody asked for and isn't adding anything to patient care."It is about choices and the NHS staff have already had two years of a pay freeze - 1% last year - and, quite frankly, are really falling behind inflation now with their wages."Staff moraleShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme motivation and morale was down among frontline health workers "at this very difficult time".However, in its submission the DoH points to a staff survey suggesting high levels of motivation and morale and says there should only be basic pay increases if there is "strong evidence" recruitment, retention, morale or motivation issues require this.Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the NHS reorganisation had taken money out of front-line services."There has to be pay restraint in the NHS as well as other public services... but the NHS has been through some very difficult years - so have NHS staff - and this was a modest increase to recognise the pressure that all families are under."To take it away, to break that promise, is just another kick in the teeth."Staff representatives have also reacted angrily to the plans."What they have done is inflammatory," said Christina McAnea, head of health at Unison and joint chairwoman of the NHS Staff Council."We are not going to negotiate while a gun is held to our head for a paltry 1% pay rise - our members will not react well to that."Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association council said this would not result in staff leaving in their "droves".However he added: "We're going to find it increasingly hard to recruit, partly for the specialist skills and partly for the numbers of staff that we'd need to bring into the health service to implement the safe minimum staffing levels."Health minister Anna Soubry defended the government 's stance telling the BBC: "This is about making sure we pay our NHS staff well and we reward their improvement in skills."This system works in other public sectors and the private sector. People want to make sure that they are getting good quality, first class services especially at a time when the NHS faces challenges."Earlier a DoH spokeswoman said: "Many NHS staff have continued to receive pay rises of up to 3.5% and we want to keep working with the trade unions and employers on affordable pay."The measures we are proposing will help increase quality for patients and help us realise our vision of an affordable seven-day service."In June Chancellor George Osborne said ministers were working to "remove automatic pay rises" for teachers, health professionals, prison and police staff.The DoH drew attention to Mr Osborne's comments and confirmed it wanted NHS pay to have "stronger links to performance, quality and productivity".</body>

      <title>Call for early bone cancer diagnosis</title>
      <description>A charity is urging GPs to do more to diagnose bone cancers early in order to help to improve the survival rate.</description>

      <body>A charity is urging GPs to do more to diagnose bone cancers early in order to help to improve the survival rateThe Bone Cancer Research Trust says the survival rate of 54% has barely changed in the last 25 years.It says early diagnosis is key to spotting the condition, which mainly affects young people.Symptoms include painful bones or swollen joints, which can be misdiagnosed as sporting injuries or "growing pains".Primary bone cancer is cancer which starts in the bones rather than spreads there.The two most common types are osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma.The condition is rare - there were just 531 new cases in the UK in 2010.But it is an aggressive cancer, and those who survive are often left with significant disabilities.The trust has teamed up with the Royal College of GPs to launch a specialist e-learning module to help doctors spot the symptoms and diagnose patients earlier.Prof Andy Hall, chairman of BCRT's independent scientific advisory panel, said: "Primary bone cancer is, thankfully, very rare but it is vital that it is diagnosed early to give patients the best chance of survival."He added: "The average length of time it takes for a patient to receive a correct diagnosis is 16 weeks from the time when the patient first noticed their symptoms."A simple X-ray, performed early, can make all the difference."Callum Flynn, 18, from Leigh in Greater Manchester, experienced knee pain for 18 months before being diagnosed with osteosarcoma - on his 14th birthday."I would wake up with my knee locked. I couldn't stand up. That would last for about two weeks at a time - and it happened five or six times over an 18-month period."We kept going to the walk-in centre, because it seemed to be something that just happened overnight, and they thought it was a virus each time."But eventually I went to my GP who felt behind my knee and obviously felt the tumour, though I wasn't told then. I had an X-ray and a biopsy in the space of a week and a half."His diagnosis came as a shock. "I'd never heard of it. I didn't think you could get cancer when you were young."Callum had to have chemotherapy and a full knee replacement at the time, and has recently had to have a further operation on his knee.He cannot play all the sports he used to, although he is part of the England physical disabilities cricket squad, and toured with them in Dubai last year.Callum also works to raise awareness of bone cancer and funds for research.He says his experience of going undiagnosed for 18 months means he feels it is vital to raise awareness about early diagnosis.And in the end, he says, it is simple to check: "It just took one X-ray."</body>

      <title>New measles case prompts concerns</title>
      <description>Pupils are being offered MMR jabs at a Neath Port Talbo school after a case of measles was confirmed three months after outbreak in area ended.</description>

      <body>More than 200 children are being offered MMR vaccinations at a Neath Port Talbot high school after a fresh case of measles there.Public Health Wales (PHW) said it has received two notifications of measles in pupils at Cwmtawe School with one case laboratory confirmed.It comes three months after Wales' biggest measles outbreak ended.The first cases in Swansea were reported last November before spreading to mid Wales.More than 75,000 were vaccinated during the outbreak throughout Wales.But experts say more than 30,000 children in the 10 to 18 age group still remain unvaccinated.Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board is arranging for MMR vaccinations to be offered next week to all pupils at the school who are not fully vaccinated.Of 1,260 pupils, 62 are recorded as having received no doses of the MMR vaccine and 142 have received only one dose.Two doses are needed to provide the maximum 99% protection against measles, say experts.PHW communicable disease control consultant Dr Jorg Hoffmann said: "This case of measles comes only three months after the end of Wales' biggest ever measles outbreak... so we are obviously concerned and want to act quickly."Although we vaccinated more than 75,000 people during the outbreak, we are aware of more than 30,000 children in the 10 to 18 age group who remain unvaccinated in Wales and have always warned that this could lead to another outbreak."We have written today to all parents of unvaccinated children in Cwmtawe School to urge them to arrange for their children to be vaccinated."In the meantime, to prevent the spread of infection, we would urge parents of any children who become unwell with measles-like symptoms over the weekend to keep them at home and seek medical advice, and not to allow them to attend events where other children will be present."The symptoms of measles include a fever, fatigue, runny nose, conjunctivitis and a distinctive red rash.By the time the outbreak was declared over after six months, it had resulted in 1,219 notifications of measles cases in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, Hywel Dda and Powys health board areas.Some 88 people visited a hospital due to measles during the outbreak.Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, from Swansea, died from pneumonia after contracting measles at the height of the epidemic.</body>

      <title>Walking 'cuts breast cancer risk'</title>

      <body>Post-menopausal women who walk for an hour a day can cut their chance of breast cancer significantly, a study has suggested.The report, which followed 73,000 women for 17 years, found walking for at least seven hours a week lowered the risk of the disease.The American Cancer Society team said this was the first time reduced risk was specifically linked to walking.UK experts said it was more evidence that lifestyle influenced cancer risk.A recent poll for the charity Ramblers found a quarter of adults walk for no more than an hour a week - but being active is known to reduce the risk of a number of cancers.This study, published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention followed 73,615 women out of 97,785 aged 50-74 who had been recruited by the American Cancer Society between 1992 and 1993 so it could monitor the incidence of cancer in the group.They were asked to complete questionnaires on their health and on how much time they were active and participating in activities such as walking, swimming and aerobics and how much time they spent sitting watching television or reading.They completed the same questionnaires at two-year intervals between 1997 and 2009.Of the women, 47% said walking was their only recreational activity.Those who walked for at least seven hours per week had a 14% lower risk of breast cancer compared to those who walked three or fewer hours per week.Dr Alpa Patel, a senior epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society in Atlanta Georgia, who led the study, said: "Given that more than 60% of women report some daily walking, promoting walking as a healthy leisure-time activity could be an effective strategy for increasing physical activity amongst post-menopausal women."We were pleased to find that without any other recreational activity, just walking one hour a day was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer in these women."More strenuous and longer activities lowered the risk even more."Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breast Cancer Campaign, said: "This study adds further evidence that our lifestyle choices can play a part in influencing the risk of breast cancer and even small changes incorporated into our normal day-to-day activity can make a difference.She added: "We know that the best weapon to overcoming breast cancer is the ability to stop it occurring in the first place."The challenge now is how we turn these findings into action and identify other sustainable lifestyle changes that will help us prevent breast cancer."</body>

      <title>'Digital baby' screen for sperm donors</title>
      <description>A service that digitally weaves together the DNA of prospective parents to check for potential disease in thousands of "virtual babies" is set to launch in the US by December.</description>

      <date>1380885044</date>
      <body>A service that digitally weaves together the DNA of prospective parents to check for potential disease in thousands of "virtual babies" is set to launch in the US by December.New York start-up Genepeeks will initially focus on donor sperm, simulating before pregnancy how the genetic sequence of a female client might combine with those of different males.Donors that more often produce "digital children" with a higher risk of inherited disorders will be filtered out, leaving those who are better genetic matches.Everything happens in a computer, but experts have raised ethical questions."We are just in the business right now of giving prospective mothers, who are using donor sperm to conceive, a filtered catalogue of donors based on their own underlying genetic profile," Genepeeks co-founder Anne Morriss told BBC News."We are filtering out the donor matches with an elevated risk of rare recessive paediatric conditions."Ms Morriss, an entrepreneur, gave a presentation on the company at the Consumer Genetics Conference in Boston last week.She was motivated in part by her own experience of starting a family. Her son was conceived with a sperm donor who happened to share with Morriss the gene for an inherited disorder called MCADD.MCADD (medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency) prevents those affected from converting fats to sugar. It can be fatal if it is not diagnosed early. Luckily, in Ms Morriss's case, the condition was picked up in newborn screening tests."My son has a pretty normal life," Ms Morriss said, "but about 30% of children with rare genetic diseases don't make it past the age of five."Genepeeks has formalised a partnership with a sperm bank - the Manhattan Cryobank - and has a patent pending on the DNA screening technology.The start-up benefits from the rapid pace of change in genetic technology.Indeed, six months ago, Genepeeks' founders decided it was able to use a superior system for DNA analysis (called "targeted exon sequencing") than the one originally envisaged - a result, says Anne Morriss, of falling costs and increased flexibility.For couples planning babies, other companies already screen one or both partners for genes that could cause disease if combined with a similar variant - so-called "carrier screening".One academic who studies the use of genetic technology commented: "This is like that, but ramped up 100,000 times."Ms Morriss's business partner, Prof Lee Silver, a geneticist and expert on bioethics at Princeton University, New Jersey, told BBC News: "We get the DNA sequence from two prospective parents. We simulate the process of reproduction, forming virtual sperm and virtual eggs. We put them together to form a hypothetical child genome."Then we can look at that hypothetical genome and - with all the tools of modern genetics - determine the risk that the genome will result in a child with disease. We're looking directly for disease and not carrier status. For each pair of people that we're going to analyse, we make 10,000 hypothetical children."The process will be run for the client and each potential donor one by one, scanning for some 600 known single-gene recessive conditions. In this way, the highest-risk pairings can be filtered out.Anne Morriss added: "At this stage our clients won't be receiving any genetic information back. We're very much focused on the practical utility of helping prospective parents who want to protect their future kids, giving them the option of additional analysis to what is currently being offered in the industry."But the company's founders have plans to expand the screening beyond single-gene recessive disorders to more complex conditions in which multiple genes play a part.Indeed, going to the trouble of simulating thousands of digital children deliberately lays the ground for this: "[It's] impossible to get towards an accurate risk calculation in any other way," said Anne Morriss.And in a video produced by the company, Prof Silver says: "My hope for the future is that any people who want to have a baby can use this technology to greatly reduce the risk of disease being expressed in their child."To some, such a prospect might appear like a step towards designer babies - until now the preserve of science fiction literature and films such as Gattaca, which envisaged a future of genetic "haves" and "have-nots".Bio-ethicists approached by the BBC said Genepeeks was a logical outcome of the increasing demand for more information when making reproductive decisions.However, some raised potential concerns about risk communication and the expansion of screening beyond rare single-gene disorders. But they suggested there were few, if any, regulatory barriers.One ethicist told BBC News: "The biggest question for me, just from the outset, is the understanding of uncertainty. Even people who have been doing genomics for years still have a hard time figuring out exactly what a risk for a particular genetic predisposition really means for a family."Gene-environment interactions can lead to people either having disease or not having disease."Dr Ewan Birney, associate director of the European Bioinformatics Institute in Hinxton, UK, echoed the point: "It's good that they're focusing on the carrier status of these rare Mendelian disorders where it's potentially more clear-cut. That said, these things are more complex than they first seem," he said."I'm sure the scientists appreciate that complexity. But when transmitting that complexity to everyday people, these things can sound more absolute than they really are."He added: "The thing I would want to stress here is just how complex this is. It's great that people are thinking of using this technology in lots of different ways, but our knowledge gap is very large."Risk communication to clients was, said Anne Morriss, "absolutely critical to anyone in this industry"."We have to be crystal clear about what we're testing for, what risks we're helping to reduce; that there's no guarantee you won't give birth to a sick child," she said.Prof Mildred Cho, associate director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics in California, raised questions over whether the sperm donor should also receive information about their genome gleaned from the screening process."Unlike hair colour, occupation or family history - those are things, presumably, the donor already knows - the thing that's different about this that I see is it could create information that the donor doesn't already have. It also has implications for the donor's other biological family members," Prof Cho told BBC News.This week it also emerged that California-based consumer genetics company 23andMe had submitted the patent on a DNA analysis tool for planning a child.Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter</body>

      <title>Mentally ill crime victims 'ignored'</title>
      <description>Crime victims with mental illnesses are more likely to feel let down, dismissed or treated without respect by the police, new research suggests.</description>

      <date>1381104401</date>
      <body>Crime victims with mental illnesses are more likely to feel let down, dismissed or treated without respect by the police, new research suggests.Many of the 361 people questioned said they were often disbelieved when they sought help after a crime.This was despite the fact that those with severe mental illness were three times more likely to be crime victims.The findings come from a three-year study involving academics and the charities Victim Support and Mind.The report, co-authored by Kings College London, Kingston University and St George’s University of London - in collaboration with University College London - is the first British survey into crime victims which compared those with mental illness against the general population.The study said that almost half of people with some form of mental illness had experienced a crime in the last year.It said people with severe mental illness were five times more likely to experience assault, while severely mentally ill women were 10 times more likely to be assaulted.Six out of 10 women in this group reported being victims of sexual violence as adults, the study said.But interviewees said that when they sought help, they often found they were treated unfairly by the police and other agencies. Victims said they found it difficult to convince police to take their reports seriously.In the worst examples, victims said police left them with the impression that they themselves were to blame. Others refused to report crimes out of fear of being detained under mental health legislation.Victims whose cases went to court reported a range of problems which had an impact on their mental health. One interviewee reported meeting the offender while at court, an incident which triggered an episode of self-harming.The authors called for police and other agencies to be better trained to help mentally-ill victims of crime and said responses to incidents should be properly monitored and assessed.Javed Khan, chief executive of Victim Support, said: “It is nothing short of a national scandal that some of the most vulnerable people in our society become victims of crime so often and yet when they seek help they are met with disbelief or even blame.“It is unacceptable that the criminal justice system fails to meet the needs of people with mental health problems when this report shows all too clearly the terrible impact of crime on them.”And Paul Farmer, Mind’s chief executive, said: “Being a victim of crime is a horrible experience for anyone to cope with but when you have a mental health problem the impact on your life can be even worse.“People with mental health problems have an equal right to justice, yet this report reveals that this is not the reality for far too many of us.”Commander Christine Jones of the Association of Chief Police Officers said it had supported the research because senior officers recognised that the experiences of people with mental illnesses were not widely understood.“Anyone reporting a crime against them expects to be listened to, taken seriously and treated with respect,” she said.“Policing and mental health is high on the agenda for chief constables. We support the recommendations in this report, which will further that work.”The research team interviewed a random sample of 361 people in London who have severe mental illness and the results were compared with official data in the Crime Survey for England and Wales. Further in-depth interviews were conducted with 81 people with mental health problems who had been victims of crime during the last three years.</body>

      <title>Cosmetic surgery study centre opens</title>
      <description>Cosmetic manufacturers asked to donate one pound from implant sales to research centre</description>

      <body>A new centre for cosmetic surgery research, partly funded by the industry, is being set up in the UK.The National Institute for Aesthetic Research is a response to the scandal over PIP breast implants in 2010.But women affected by the faulty devices say it has taken too long to establish the facility.The launch follows a review of plastic surgery by the NHS Medical Director Sir Bruce Keogh, who criticised the absence of data surrounding operations.The centre is being set up by the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) and the charity The Healing Foundation.Kate Ward from Leeds had breast enlargement surgery with PIP implants in 2004.She paid £9,000 to have the implants removed and replaced with new ones.Ms Ward told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours: "The cynic in me just sees this as very reactive. The management of the people still affected by this scandal remains very inconsistent and in some cases non-existent."She believes the three years it has taken to establish the centre suggests the women affected have not been a priority, adding: "It's difficult to not feel as though you are stigmatised as someone who has elected to have this surgery in the first place."But it is good that lessons are being learnt and changes are being made. I hope by setting up this institute it will stop women being placed in the situation thousands are in at the moment."Rajiv Grover, president of the BAAPS, agreed it was embarrassing that this was the world's first institute related to aesthetic research.He said: "We have been campaigning for this institute for 10 years but there is now a willingness to endorse this."Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS medical director, believes it will make a difference.He said: "This joint initiative is the first recommendation of my review to be implemented and I know it will provide a major contribution to patient safety."The institute will be partly funded by manufacturers who are being asked to donate a pound from the sale of every breast implant.So far two have signed up, Nagor (the UK's only manufacturer of implants), and Eurosurgical, distributors for Silimed based in South Africa.BAAPS says this will raise a minimum of £25,00 to £30,000 a year. Women affected by PIP implants say all the manufacturers should sign up to the institute.</body>

      <title>Over-50s men 'not symptom aware'</title>

      <body>Men aged over 50 are less likely to know the symptoms of serious diseases than women, suggests a survey by Saga, a company focused on that age group.Fifty-five per cent of men said they were aware of the symptoms of bowel cancer, compared with 72% of women.More than 11,000 UK men and women were asked about their knowledge of diseases and what makes them go to their GP.Men whose partners or children put pressure on them to get a check-up were more likely to see a doctor.From a survey of 11,729 men and women aged 50 and over, 41% of men surveyed said they were unaware of the symptoms of prostate cancer.Men were also less likely than women to know the symptoms of lung cancer, skin cancer, arthritis and dementia while 82% of women surveyed said they knew the symptoms of breast cancer.When asked how they knew about the signs of different diseases, government health campaigns were cited as the main way of learning about symptoms, particularly those of cancers.People who were aware of the symptoms of dementia and arthritis, however, were more likely to have learned about the condition through family members who had been affected.The survey found that men were most likely to go and see their GP when they found blood in their urine (82%) or in their stool (78%) and when they felt severe pain (74%). These were all important triggers for women to see their doctor too.But men (59%) were much less likely than women (80%) to go to the GP when they found a new lump in their body.If men over 50 needed encouragement to see a medical professional, they were more likely than women to go for a check-up when faced with pressure from their partner or children.A recent study by Cancer Research UK found that bowel cancer rates among men have increased by more than a quarter in the last 35 years.This contrasts with a rise of just 6% in the rate for women over the same time.At the same time, bowel cancer survival rates are improving with half of all patients living for at least 10 years after being diagnosed.Deborah Alsina, chief executive of charity Bowel Cancer UK said: "It is deeply worrying that men remain less aware of the symptoms of bowel cancer and are less likely to take part in the NHS bowel cancer screening programme than women."Bowel cancer is preventable, treatable and curable and should not be the UK's second biggest cancer killer, yet currently only around 50% of people are living longer than five years."She added that targeted campaigns were the key to raising awareness among men.</body>

      <description>The prospect of drugs to rapidly reset the body clock to avoid jet lag and the pains of shift work has moved a step close after research in Japan.</description>

      <body>Drugs that rapidly tweak the body clock in order to avoid jet lag and the pains of shift work have moved a step closer after research in Japan.The team at Kyoto University has found the clock's 'reset button' inside the brain.Their study, published in the journal Science, showed the button could be used to switch the clock to a new time zone in a single day.Experts said the team was "close to the money" in the hunt for a jet lag cure.There are clocks throughout the body and a "master clock" in the brain, keeping the body in sync with the world around it to make people sleepy at night.Anyone who has ever done shift work or a long-haul flight has experienced the disrupted sleep and hunger patterns of a body clock which is out of tune with the rising and setting of the sun.The clock uses light to help keep track of time, but it is naturally stubborn and adjusts slowly.The rough rule is that for every time zone crossed it takes a full day for the body to catch up. Fly from London to Beijing and it would take a week for the body clock to fully adapt.The team in Japan have come up with a way to get the master clock to be a bit more flexible.It is a group of 10,000 brain cells - about the same size as a grain of rice - which constantly talk to each other to keep a strict control over the time.The scientists found that interfering with the vasopressin receptors, essentially a brain cell's ears that allow it to keep in touch with its neighbours, let the clock shift rapidly.Genetically modified mice which had no vasopressin receptors were able to adjust to the clocks being put back eight hours within a single day, while normal mice took six days.When the clocks were put forward eight hours then it took normal mice eight days to adapt, but those without vasopressin receptors adjusted in two.Similar results were then achieved in normal mice using a drug.The study's authors concluded: "Studies have shown that chronic jet lag and rotating shift work can increase an individual's risk of developing hypertension, obesity, and other metabolic disorders."Our results identify vasopressin signalling as a possible therapeutic target for the management of circadian rhythm [body clock] misalignment."Dr Michael Hastings, a Medical Research Council body clock researcher, told the BBC's Science in Action programme: "It's a remarkable study, it really is very exciting for our field."There's been many false dawns when it comes to a cure for jet lag, but I think this time they're close to the money."However, he cautioned that vasopressin receptors were also heavily involved in kidney function so any drug developed would need to be designed carefully to target the body clock without disrupting the kidneys.Dr Hastings added that with an increasingly 24-7 society a drug which can adjust the body clock could, in theory, improve the health of shift workers."The issue here in terms of public health is rotational shift work, the epidemiological evidence that we have now shows that if a worker has spent a working life doing rotational shift work they're at higher risk of contracting certain forms of cancer, cardiovascular disease or metabolic syndrome like diabetes."</body>

      <body>Legionella bacteria appears to be "common" in many compost brands sold in the UK, a study has found.A team from Strathclyde University in Glasgow tested 22 different brands of compost and found that 14 contained a variety of Legionella species.It says a larger survey is needed to determine the extent of the issue.The study, "Legionella spp. in UK composts - a potential public health issue", is published by Clinical Microbiology and Infection.Dr Beattie, one of those who conducted the study, said: "Disease causing micro-organisms are widespread in the environment, and therefore it is not too surprising that species of Legionella that can cause human disease are present in compost."Any environment where you have pathogenic bacteria could be a source of infection, and we already know that compost has been linked to human Legionella infection in countries such as Australia and New Zealand."Dr Beattie said European produced composts have traditionally been composed of peat, whereas those from Australia and New Zealand had more often used sawdust and bark."It may be that the change in composition of composts in the UK, moving away from peat-based products, could be resulting in species such as Legionella longbeachae being present in compost and therefore more cases of infection could occur," she said.Dr Beattie wants a larger scale survey, covering a wider range of compost products, to be carried out to see if Legionella bacteria are as widespread in composts as her study suggests.She added: "It should be emphasised though, that although Legionella seem to be common in compost, human infection is very rare, especially if you consider the volume of compost sold and used."But with any potential source of infection precautions should always be taken."The occurrence of these bacteria in composts in Australia and New Zealand, and the cases of infection that have been traced to compost has resulted in hygiene warnings on compost packaging in these countries, and this is something manufacturers in the UK may wish to consider."The study was conducted by Dr Tara Beattie, fellow academic Dr Charles Knapp, Strathclyde PhD student Sandra Currie and Dr Diane Lindsay of the Scottish Haemophilus, Legionella, Meningococcus and Pneumococcus Reference Laboratory.</body>

      <title>Does reality TV help the NHS?</title>
      <description>Fly-on-the wall TV programmes may not be showing us the real National Health Service, warns Dr Johnny Marshall, of the NHS Confederation.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-23687320</url>
      <date>1376622383</date>
      <body>Reality TV finds its way into all areas of our lives - including our hospitals. In this week's Scrubbing Up column, Dr Johnny Marshall, of the NHS Confederation, asks if the picture it reflects is distorting our idea of how the NHS works.There has been an increasing range of reality shows focusing on NHS services in recent years: One Born Every Minute, 24 Hours in AandE, Keeping Britain Alive, and Junior Doctors, to name just a few.These programmes provide amazing insights into the tireless work of NHS staff and the joys and heartaches of patients and their families.They show a health service that many of us as professionals are proud to work in and are determined to improve despite the increasing pressures on it, a service that is a source of great pride.But as more NHS reality shows appear on our screens, do they really give us a representative view of everything that the health service can and does do?In particular, is there too much fixation on the hospital model, the wonder services and miracle drugs breaking new barriers, and not enough on the care outside hospitals that provides just as essential a purpose?And does this bias the public's view of what we think the "right" kind of healthcare looks like, and inhibit our acceptance of change?The NHS is a complex system, and most of us would agree that many modern treatments are unrecognisable from the original service set up in 1948.Yet the very success of improving health outcomes for the postwar big killers is resulting in a new challenge - people living longer but developing more long-term diseases in older age.To meet these challenges we need to move the emphasis away from hospitals and towards community services.I fear that reality shows, as great as they are, may inadvertently reinforce the public view that hospitals, regardless of their standards, are best, without considering the alternatives.The reality is that hospitals are only one part of the modern NHS story.Many core health services may not have the TV wow factor of pioneering treatment carried out by our big teaching hospitals, or be as thrilling as the trauma care that saves lives in the most horrific of situations.But many community-based services are life-saving - such as falls services, which have been shown to reduce death rates by as much as by 50%.And although they are not glamorous they do save lives and, importantly, allow people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. After all, there is no place like home.Services such as these are a critical part of ensuring that people receive the right care.They relieve pressure on hospitals so those who do need treatment can be seen more quickly.And they reduce the likelihood of people having to stay in hospital because the support they need to be cared for at home or in the community is not there.We have seen how the pressures grow on our AandE departments when these other services are not available.Like any other industry, if the NHS is to retain its core purpose and principle - to meet the needs of everyone and remain free at the point of delivery - and in a safe affordable and sustainable way, it has to move with the times. And we need to let it do so.We have seen many improvements across a wide range of areas, with people spending less time in hospital, so it makes sense to have fewer hospital beds and more support in the community.Similarly, by concentrating the skill and expertise needed to deliver round-the-clock specialist care for patients, we are reducing the number of places it is allocated.By improving stroke services in London, care is now located at eight sites rather than 30 sites, with hundreds of lives - and money - saved each year.These changes may seem daunting, and I have no doubt the NHS needs to do more to engage the public in debate.Often we have not explained the benefits of change well enough.Instead, we have tended to engage with communities after we have come up with a preferred solution, and so have found ourselves in long, drawn-out battles over proposals deemed to be without proper foundation or evidence.So what, you might ask, does reality TV have to do with this?TV shows are there to entertain us, and we should not knock the opportunity to improve our knowledge and insight of various aspects of medicine.But TV also provides a useful mirror that reflects society - our prejudices, fears and hopes.And if our hope is to care for everyone in the right way and in the right place, TV needs to start reflecting that.The future I describe is already a reality in many parts of the NHS, but not evenly distributed.So how about a reality series looking at the amazing work that goes on in the community?After all, that is where life really happens. Is reality TV a help or hindrance to the NHS?</body>

      <title>App aims to improve death records</title>
      <description>How mobile phones are helping register deaths</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24164824</url>
      <date>1379723133</date>
      <body>Two thirds of deaths worldwide go completely unrecorded, making it impossible to know if public health money is being spent in the right places. But could a mobile phone app be the answer?Birth and death are perhaps the most significant moments of any human life - worth writing down for posterity.But in many countries around the world, the systems set up to collect vital data about citizens have such low coverage that many deaths slip through the net.Not knowing who has died, and what they have died of, makes it impossible to build an accurate picture of a nation's health.Now technology - in the form of a specialist mobile phone app - could make all the difference.Using a technique known as "verbal autopsy", field workers visit relatives to ask them about the circumstances of a family death.By collecting the information digitally from currently hard-to-reach places, it has the potential to revolutionise our understanding of global health.In Malawi, any death that occurs outside a medical facility is not recorded.Dr Carina King, a fellow at University College London, is overseeing the implementation of the mobile phone autopsies in the Malawian district of Mchinji."We found everyone surprisingly open, and I think they find the phone quite an interesting thing when we go for interviews," she told the BBC.Verbal autopsies have been in use for about 20 years but the information was traditionally recorded on a paper questionnaire.These often lengthy documents were supposed to be analysed by two doctors, who would use the answers to deduce the likely cause of death.However the sheer scale of the task was often too great, meaning that many of the questionnaires ending up languishing in dusty rooms, completely unread."The mobile phone has been very good and means we don't have lots of paper forms," says Dr King."We have very quick access to the data and we can analyse it quickly to get the causes of death."The phone software, known as MIVA, presents a series of questions that a trained field worker uses to find out information from the family.Each question has a range of possible answers and the software intelligently skips to the next relevant question depending on the response.Most important of all is that it is designed to quickly compute the most likely cause of death.The result is stored in the phone and can be sent to a central database either by text message or internet upload.Dr Jon Bird of City University, London, who was part of the team involved in creating the software, says mobile phones provide a particularly convenient way of collecting data."Mobile phones are probably one the most widespread technologies in the world. They're cheap, they're robust and everyone knows how to use one," he told the BBC."The everyday nature of mobile phones also makes them really valuable because the people that are being interviewed don't find them intrusive."In Malawi, mobile phone autopsies are currently being used to record the cause of death in children.The project is called MaiMwana, meaning mother and child in the local Chichewa language, and it focuses on children who died before their fifth birthday.The under-five mortality rate in Malawi is 71 per 1,000 live births according to 2012 figures from the World Bank - compared to just five per 1,000 live births in the UK.Lazaro Cypriano lives in the village of Mzangawa in Mchinji district, central Malawi with his wife Magdalena and their toddler.The couple lost their first two children.Their second child died about a year ago, after a series of hospital visits due to fever. It is this death that will be the subject of the verbal autopsy.Outside urban areas, one of the main problems for collecting data is finding out when a death has occurred.To get around this, field reporters from the local community take on the responsibility of alerting the MaiMwana team of people who have died in their area.This is how Lazaro's family was identified, and the visit now affords him his first opportunity to narrate what happened to his son and have that information recorded.The interviewer asks the couple standard questions and matches their answers to the choices provided in the application's template.It's a highly sensitive and skilled job - and one which field interviewer Nicholas Mbwana can see is made easier by using a mobile phone."We go to the households, ask about the causes of death - what really happened - and we also record the GPS in order to trace the household in future," he told the BBC.Dr King says the system is key to the success of the project."GPS gives us the location of every household in the district so we can actually plot out on a map where people are dying of what, which means that you could design more sophisticated programs for targeting specific interventions."Mobile phone autopsies are being used on a limited scale at present. But the long term aim is to roll out the technique much more widely."The beauty of the system is that it's standardised and can be translated into any language you want," says Dr Bird."It's important when you're collecting data on a large scale that everyone is answering the same question, so that you know that the results are directly comparable from town to town and country to country."The World Health Organization (WHO) is already supporting the initiative and is working with institutions from the UK to Sweden to develop the technology further.The data is currently being collected in a range of databases that can be accessed by researchers interested in public health.As the project grows, researchers from the University of Umea in Sweden will co-ordinate the growing number of translations and the distribution of the technology around the world.The government in Malawi is already keen to see the results of the project."It is important for us as a ministry to know what is killing Malawians out there so that we can plan ahead and put appropriate interventions in place to prevent that - and also to put out health messages," says Dr Charles Mwansambo, Malawi's Health Secretary.The Ministry of Health has so far only been using information collected from medical facilities, which the health secretary concedes is biased data."We need comprehensive data from the hospitals and the community to plan well. We find ourselves planning for the small community that comes to hospital, not realising there is a bigger community out there that we need to budget for," he adds.Dr Mwansambo also acknowledges that a cultural practice of burying health documents with the dead makes it difficult to collect important information about deaths."When somebody dies people want to forget everything about them - those memories that will remind them of their loved ones. So unfortunately they bury the health passport along with their clothes and other possessions and we lose vital information in the process," he explains.The health passports are documents issued to parents, which record the birth weight of the baby and its gain over time, as well as which immunizations were administered and when.An elder at Mzangawa village, Kangkwamba Piri, is already talking to members of his community to drop that cultural practice."We've been doing this for a long time but it is wrong. What needs to be done is not to bury the documents and that's what we're encouraging people to do," he says.For now, it is likely that millions of deaths will still go unnoticed by official figures. But verbal autopsies recorded on mobile phones are making small but significant inroads into solving the problem.And for and his wife Magdalena, the chance to give information about what killed their child to an official is important.Magdalena says: "What I have learnt from this interview will help me take care of my third baby so he can be healthy and live long."</body>

      <title>Is 'addiction' an excuse to overeat?</title>
      <description>Is it helpful to label 'food addiction' an illness?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24402163</url>
      <date>1381109365</date>
      <body>"Food addiction" is becoming a popular term to explain overeating. But in this Scrubbing Up, Professor John Blundell from the Institute of Psychological Sciences at the University of Leeds warns the term is being used far too freely.Some have likened food addiction to drug addiction, and then used this term to associate it with overeating, and as a clinical explanation for the obesity epidemic, implicating millions of people.The use of the term food addiction is a step towards medicalisation and implies that normal human social behaviour is pathological.Forms of eating therefore become an illness. This attitude is not helpful and has huge implications for the way in which people view their own behaviour and their lives.The concept of food addiction comes from a combination of experimental data, anecdotal observations, scientific claims, personal opinions, deductions and beliefs.It is an over-simplification of a very complex set of behaviours.The existing evidence fails to define the precise characteristics of the actual foods concerned or the eating environment that underlies the assumed addiction risk.This is in contrast to drug addiction, where the molecule is identified and its pharmacological effect on the brain is characterised.Animal studies have shown changes to specific the brain in those given a sugary diet - and human brain scans show activation of reward systems in the same part of the brain when sweet tastes are consumed.Therefore, it is not surprising that reward centres are activated when sweet foods are consumed, as we know that the reward circuits in the brain have been established through evolution as signalling systems that control our appetite.Many stimuli influence these areas of the brain and, in addition, there is an intrinsic drive to consume carbohydrate-rich foods to satisfy a basic metabolic need of the brain.Sweetness is a major signal for such foods but the science has not yet assessed this fully and much more work is needed before we could say that food is addictive.Attributing food addiction as the single cause underlying the development of obesity, despite the existence of numerous other very plausible explanations, is unhelpful, particularly for those trying to live more healthy lives.I am concerned that many people may potentially latch on to the concept of food addiction as an excuse to explain their overeating - the premise that it's "not my fault" and therefore, "I can't help it".This removes the personal responsibility they should feel and could act on - and they infer that their eating is a form of disease.Food addiction may offer an appealing explanation for some people but the concept could seriously hinder an individual's capacity for personal control.Binge eating disorder does exist - but it is a rare clinical condition affecting fewer than 3% of obese people.Sufferers have a strong compulsion to eat, which persists alongside the sense of a loss of control.Addiction-like food behaviour may be a component of the severe and compulsive form of binge eating disorder.But this condition does not explain the huge rise in obesity we have seen across the population.Binge eating is not a key cause of obesity and, therefore, in the context of mass public health, is not a major concern.What we need is a calm and composed analysis of what the words food addiction really mean so that people can make informed deductions about the causes of their own behaviour.</body>

      <title>Face blindness: Seeing but not seeing</title>
      <description>What is it like to live with face blindness?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24385650</url>
      <date>1381047931</date>
      <body>Imagine that suddenly you cannot recognise your mother, your partner, your child. You can see them but your brain cannot process the information - you don't know whether they are smiling, or understand their emotions.That is what happened to David Bromley, after he suffered a brain injury that left him with face blindness.David has prosopagnosia. People with this condition can see the eyes, the nose, and the mouth, what is known as the context - but they cannot see them as a whole. They do not recognise gestures or emotions."I can even recognise my wife if I walk into the house and know that she is there," says David."But if I'm in the street and she passes by and I don't know that she is going to be there, I wouldn't recognise her."David, who lives in Essex, had unknowingly been living with eye damage since birth - the arteries and veins were mixed up. This eventually caused a partial loss of sight and damage in the brain which caused the prosopagnosia.Perhaps the most difficult aspect of this condition is that people do not notice right away that something is wrong with them.He remembers when he realised there was a problem."I went to a reunion where I saw friends that I hadn't seen for 30 years. We were pretty close but we went our separate ways."On the way home, he told his brother-in-law: "'Fran and Mickey haven't changed a bit, they are exactly the same!'. And then I said 'hold on, were they wearing tank tops?'"What David was seeing was his memory of their friends back then. "My brain was telling me that there they were and what they looked like, but that wasn't the reality".After that, he discovered he was face blind.There are two main forms of prosopagnosia; developmental - where people fail to develop face processing abilities which is thought to affect around 2% of the population, and acquired, which develops after some form of brain injury and is much rarer.Dr Ashok Jansari, a cognitive neuropsychology expert from the University of East London said: "Acquired prosopagnosia is extremely rare because the type of brain damage is very specific,."It can be caused by damage to the back of the brain on the right-hand side in an area known generally as the right occipito-temporal region."David said: "I don't know what's worse - not being able to ever recognise people or at 56 years old - as it happened to me - suddenly not being able to recognise anybody".He added that the worst part is the social embarrassment."We were on holiday in Cuba and I'd been snorkelling in the sea. I was talking with this guy from Denmark, when this woman swam up and said 'buenos dias' and I went 'hello, pleased to meet you', thinking it was his wife, but it was actually my wife and I hadn't recognised her."David can see people perfectly well - but 10 or 15 minutes later he cannot recognise them.He now tells clients: "If I ignore you, I'm not being rude, it is just that I can't recognise you."Sandra, from London, who only wants to give her first name, is also afraid of social embarrassment.She had encephalitis - inflammation of the brain - 14 years ago, which left her with face blindness.Even though her prosopagnosia is mild - she can recognise people she knew before her illness - she would rather not let people know because she does not want anyone to think she has some sort of incapacity."Life with prosopagnosia is very shameful," she says.She is teacher and at work almost nobody knows that she is face blind."If I see someone every day, I can recognise them. But if one of the children says hi to me on the street, I would know it is a student from the school, but I wouldn't know who."I don't say anything to the children, I just work every day to learn their faces."But she says: "Perhaps the reason why I don't mention it is because I don't want them to think that I cannot do my job, because that's not true. I don't want to feel ashamed or that people think that there is something wrong with me."Dr Jansari understands the feelings and fears of David and Sandra.He knows of cases in which people have lost their jobs because of the condition - including a teacher who had difficulty recognising pupils, causing problems when parents came to pick up their children at the end of the day,Even though prosopagnosia is not recognised as a disability, Dr Jansari thinks it should be treated as such in some cases.This condition has no cure. "In the case of acquired prosopagnosia, once a part of the brain is damaged it is not going to 'grow' back, so it is impossible to fix the problem," he said."With developmental prosopagnosia, we don't know what causes it, but hypothetically in the future if they find that there is a genetic cause, that could be corrected - but that would be a very long way off."Even though people develop strategies to cope - because people change their appearance, they are not foolproof.Dr Jansari says: "Once David thought that a photograph he saw was of George Michael but it was of me, from a time when I used to have a goatee beard and a gold earring!"</body>

      <title>Awake under the knife</title>
      <description>Can you be conscious but feel no pain under the knife?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24357476</url>
      <date>1380930754</date>
      <body>Having a general anaesthetic is a routine part of many operations. But what happens if you are still conscious after you close your eyes?You are in the operating theatre. Anaesthetic has been administered and the countdown to unconsciousness begins.For most people, the next thing they will remember is being roused from a deep sleep.But in a small minority of cases, complete unconsciousness never comes.Being awake during surgery and not being able to do anything about it is every patient's worst nightmare.But according to one of the country's leading anaesthetists, it may not be as simple as saying that someone is either asleep or awake.Prof Jaideep Pandit, consultant anaesthetist at the Oxford University Hospitals, believes there is an alternative "third state" of consciousness somewhere between sleeping and waking that patients under general anaesthetic can and do experience."I call it dysanaesthesia," he explains. "A type of awareness where the patient is aware of the surgery but is neither conscious nor unconscious."Despite being used around the world on a daily basis, no-one is exactly sure how a general anaesthetic acts upon the body.Anaesthesia is a complicated business requiring many years of training and a proper understanding of which drugs to give, and how much.However in general, a patient can be expected to receive an anaesthetic to make them unconscious and a painkiller to numb the pain.A specialist doctor will then monitor a whole host of measurements throughout the operation to make sure that the patient really is out for the count.Even so, in an estimated 1 in 15,000 surgeries patients experience what is known as accidental awareness where they remember aspects of their surgery after waking. Around a third of those will feel pain.The question whether someone is conscious or not is mind-bogglingly complex.But Professor Pandit is investigating something that goes one step further - a twilight state that lies between conscious and unconscious states - and one that his experiments show happens much more frequently than accidental awareness.He has been able to show this through the use of something known as the Isolated Forearm Technique.Before the advent of carefully calibrated monitoring equipment, anaesthetists were able to use this technique during surgery to check whether someone was fully unconscious.The method uses a tourniquet to prevent any muscle relaxants from paralysing the forearm. This means that if the patient becomes conscious during surgery, they can move their arm to alert the surgeon.Professor Pandit has used the technique to show some fascinating aspects to human awareness.In repeated tests, one third of patients who are seemingly unconscious are able to squeeze the experimenter's fingers on command using their non-paralysed forearm. But none of them will move spontaneously to show that they are awake or in pain during surgery."To all extents and purposes, these patients are unconscious," says Prof Pandit. "But they are clearly in a state where they can respond to some stimuli like verbal commands but not to others like the surgery, possibly because they are not distressed by it."According to Prof Pandit, this suggests there is a third level of consciousness.But analysing the concept remains extremely difficult."Mainly when patients come round they will have no recall of the event or if they do they do it's just vague memories. They're unable to remember anything with clarity," he told the BBC.One way doctors frequently explain general anaesthesia to patients is to compare it to being asleep. But that is technically inaccurate says Dr Emory Brown, a professor of anaesthesia at Harvard Medical School."What we need to do to safely and humanely operate on you - to perform a procedure which is indeed, very invasive and certainly traumatic - is to put you in a state which is a coma that we can readily reverse," he told the BBC.This coma-like condition potentially protects the patient from pain and memory of the surgery. But it also helps the surgeons to operate by keeping the patient still and maintaining bodily functions at a stable level.However, what's happening in the brain as it slips from conscious into unconsciousness is still uncertain.In 2011, a research team at Manchester University were able to watch for the first time the effects on a human brain as it lost consciousness under anaesthetic.Using a novel method of brain imaging, they were able to construct real-time 3D images of the brain - rather than the 2D slices of standard brain scans.It enabled them to see how electrical activity in the brain changed as the patients went under.Interestingly, activity in the brain appeared to hot up as the patient became unconscious. This suggests that rather than switching off, the brain works hard to dampen down or inhibit consciousness while they are under the influence of anaesthetic.But scientists are still a long way off from understanding the impact on the brain as unconsciousness occurs."We are still unable at this time to define what human consciousness is, so trying to find a box of tricks that's going to monitor its absence is difficult," says Dr Kevin Fong, a consultant in anaesthesia at University College London Hospitals."But awareness during anaesthesia is something we've learnt to guard against through layers and layers of monitoring. We check surrogates of awareness such as heart rate, blood pressure and rates of respiration, and also constantly monitor the exact concentration of drugs in the blood."Indeed having memory of your surgery is one of the most important complications that both anaesthetists and patients wish to avoid.Although a national survey this year found the risk of waking up under the knife was extremely low, the effects for patients who do experience it can be acutely traumatic.For Prof Pandit, the ultimate aim of understanding human unconsciousness is to prevent such episodes from occurring."The risk of experiencing pain or distress during accidental awareness is very low at around 1 in 45,000," he explains. "But when it does happen it can have a very bad effect on the individual.""So it's not just the numbers that are driving us to research dysanaesthesia, but also the impact."</body>

      <title>Girl, 2, to go home for first time</title>
      <description>The two-year-old to leave hospital for the first time</description>

      <body>A two-year-old girl born with a condition which means her brain forgets to tell her to breathe is about to leave hospital for the first time.Maisie Harris from Gillingham, Kent has been at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London since being transferred from Medway Maritime at three months old.She has congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), also known as Ondine's Curse.A new, portable ventilator has enabled Maisie to go home.The machine knows when she is able to take her own breaths and when she is likely to have a CCHS episode and require support.It has batteries and a carry case, so Maisie, who is three on 23 October, will be able to go on outings with her family and go to school when she is older.Staff on Great Ormond Street's Miffy Ward held a party for her on Friday, before she leaves hospital on Monday."We cannot wait to bring Maisie home and enjoy being a normal family," said her mother Rachel Bridger, 23."It's felt as though we have been in hospital for a lifetime."Everyone here has become like a second family to us - they know Maisie inside out."She knows her own mind but she is a really happy little girl - she's hardly ever upset."I don't think it will take her long to get used to playing with her toys at home and sleeping in her own bed for the first time."Maisie, who featured in BBC2's Great Ormond Street series last year, also has malacia of the airways, so her airways are floppy like the top of a balloon and do not hold their shape properly.Consultant Colin Wallis said: "We have been working on ways to allow a greater number of long-term ventilated children to go home."The family home is the best place for a young child to grow and develop, and Maisie will now be able to go out and about with her family, make new friends and experience everything the outside world has to offer."Dr Wallis treated Ms Bridger when she was younger. She also has CCHS, although her condition is less complex.She and Maisie's father Andrew Harris, 26, have been trained on how to use her ventilator and will be supported by a team of local carers.</body>

      <title>Can a drug make you tell the truth?</title>
      <description>Did powerful drug make Michael Mosley tell the truth?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24371140</url>
      <date>1380759219</date>
      <body>In movies and TV dramas, sodium thiopental is shown as a sinister truth serum used to get information out of captured people. Michael Mosley tried it out.One of the great challenges of living in our society is knowing when people are telling the truth or not. We lie all the time and are remarkably bad at detecting when other people are deliberately deceiving us.There are lots of urban myths about lie detecting, such as the claim that liars tend to look away, twitch their feet or touch their noses when lying (the so-called Pinocchio effect).In study after study, it has been shown that professionals such as policemen are no more reliable at detecting liars than the rest of us. So it's not surprising that for many years scientists have been working to develop "truth drugs" - drugs that will make you open up and tell all you know to an interrogator.One of the oldest and best known of these truth drugs is sodium thiopental. Although it was first developed in the 1930s, it is still used today in a range of settings, including, in some countries, by the police and the military.I was intrigued but also extremely sceptical about the claims that sodium thiopental, originally developed as an anaesthetic, could make people speak the truth if they chose not to. So I decided, as part of a series I've been making on the extraordinary history of pharmaceuticals, to try it out.Sodium thiopental is part of a group of drugs called barbiturates, drugs widely used in the 1950s and 60s to help people sleep better. They are no longer used for that purpose because they are extremely addictive and potentially lethal - Marilyn Monroe famously died from a barbiturate overdose.I decided to take a low dose of sodium thiopental under proper medical supervision, with anaesthetist Dr Austin Leach monitoring my vital signs throughout. Barbiturates work by slowing down the rate at which messages travel through the brain and spinal column. The more barbiturates there are, the harder it is for chemical messages to cross the gaps between one neuron and the next.Your whole thinking process slows down until you fall asleep. With thiopental, that happens very quickly indeed.Although it was originally developed as an anaesthetic, it was soon noticed that when patients were in that twilight zone halfway between consciousness and unconsciousness, they became more chatty and disinhibited. After the drug had worn off, the patients forgot what they had been talking about.It was decided that sodium thiopental might form the basis for a truth drug, an interrogation tool. But does it really work?I decided that I would have a go at trying to maintain the fiction that rather than being Michael Mosley, science journalist, I would be Michael Mosley, famous heart surgeon. We started with a very low dose. Immediately I felt extremely light-headed, intoxicated. But would this make me more inclined to speak the truth?There is an expression, "in vino veritas" (in wine there is truth). Alcohol is an anaesthetic and it depresses some of our higher centres, areas like the cerebral cortex where a lot of thought processing occurs. It reduces inhibitions but also slows thought processes, making it difficult to think clearly. The Roman historian Tacitus claimed that Germanic tribes held their important councils while drunk, as they thought it made effective lying harder.One theory about sodium thiopental is that it works in much the same way. Because lying is generally more difficult and complicated than telling the truth, if you suppress higher cortical functions you are more likely to speak the truth, simply because it's easier.I'm not sure if I lied effectively while under the influence of low dose thiopental, but I found that I could still lie."I am a cardiac - ha ha ha! - cardiac surgeon, a world famous cardiac surgeon," I shouted out when Dr Leach asked me what I did for a living."Would you like to tell me what the last operation you carried out was?" he enquired, politely."It was a heart bypass," I improvised. "They survived, yeah, I was awesome."Not convincing, but I had just about managed to stick to my fictional story. But what would happen when the dose was upped?At this point I felt some trepidation. There was a risk that I might say something that I really didn't want the world to know, but, confident in my ability to keep on lying, I told Dr Leach to go ahead.I was given another slightly larger dose of sodium thiopental and this time I actually felt more sober, more in control. So what happened next was a complete surprise.Again Dr Leech asked me my name and my profession. This time there was no hesitation."I'm a television producer. Well, executive producer, well, presenter, some, mix of the three of them.""So you don't have any history of performing cardiac surgery?" he asked gently."None whatsoever. None whatsoever"I'm still confused about what happened because one effect of the drug is to distort short-term memory. But I think the reason that I spoke the truth on this occasion is because the thought of lying never occurred to me.So does it work? Well my conclusion after trying it out and speaking to experts is that it will certainly make you more inclined to talk, but that when you are under the influence you are also in an extremely suggestible state. The reason you become more suggestible is probably because the drug is interfering with your higher centres, like your cortex, where a lot of decision making goes on. There is a serious risk you will say what your interrogator wants to hear rather than the truth.The truth is we don't have a reliable truth drug yet. Or if there is one out there, nobody's telling.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>How many redheads are there in the world?</title>
      <description>Can it be true that a fifth of the world's redheads are Scottish?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24331615</url>
      <date>1380669889</date>
      <body>About 200 people took part in the UK's first Ginger Pride march in August, and the world record for the largest gathering of natural redheads was broken last month when 1,600 attended the Redhead Day Festival in the Dutch town of Breda. But how many redheads are there in the world - and where do they live?Scotland is thought by some to have the highest concentration of redheads in the world, so maybe it was an appropriate location for the Ginger Pride march, led by Canadian comedian Shawn Hitchins.While they marched through the streets of Edinburgh, he made a startling claim."It's a great opportunity to bring together all the redheads in the country that holds 19% of the world's population of redheads," he told BBC Radio.The claim was initially reported on BBC News too. But can it really be true that Scotland is home to almost a fifth of the world's redheads?"I can't really believe that figure," says Jonathan Rees, professor of dermatology at the University of Edinburgh and one of a team of scientists to identify the gene responsible for red hair - the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R).So where did Hitchins get the figure from? It turns out it was a mistake."It must have been in confusion," he says. "I was walking through Edinburgh with 200 redheads behind me and I was mostly trying not to lead people into traffic. Nobody really knows the exact [number]. There was someone from Glasgow saying it was 19% in just the population of Scotland."In the heat of the moment, it seems, he simply got his words muddled, and that proportion of redheads in Scotland became something very different."I am very sorry. This is what happens when you let comedians be spokespeople," says Hitchins. "Also, I'm a ginger so I'm 10 times more likely to make up a statistic."So if we can now confidently say that a fifth of the world's redheads do not live in Scotland, do we know what proportion actually do?"It's fair to say we don't have very detailed information about what the frequency of people with red hair is throughout the world," says Rees."I wouldn't say there are no reliable estimates, but the ideal way to do this would of course be like the census, where everybody's examined at various ages and you have robust data."We don't have that sort of data, but many different researchers have carried out smaller studies where the selection has not been entirely random in the way you would like."It is often said that between 1% and 2%, or 70 to 140 million people around the world, have red hair.In purely numerical terms, it is highly likely that the US has the highest number of people with red hair, because of the size of its population. If just 1% had red hair, for example, that would mean it had three million redheads.According to Rees, the figure for the UK is about 10%.If that was the case in Scotland, that would suggest that the country with its population of 5.3 million was home to just over half a million redheads - less than 1% of the global total.The prevalence of red hair may be slightly higher in Scotland than in England, Rees says, adding that it may be even higher in the Republic of Ireland.Overall, Northern European countries have a greater proportion of redheads than anywhere else in the world."If you're in northern Europe, you get used to seeing people with different hair colour," says Rees."But most of the people on this planet don't live in Europe and if you just think about Asia, it's very, very rare to see somebody with red hair. And in most of Africa it is exceedingly rare to see somebody with red hair. It is an unusual trait globally."To explain this, you have to go back tens of thousands of years, says Rees."When humans moved out of Africa… skin lightened and people developed hair with different colours. There seems to be some advantage in having pale skin if you live in parts of the world where there isn't much sunshine," he says."The probable reason for that is that we make vitamin D in our skin. We rely on sunshine to make vitamin D and if you have very dark skin, it's harder to make that vitamin D."Being pale, redheads are more efficient at making vitamin D and do not need so much sunlight in order to get the amount they need, he says.So, in certain places in the world at least, there's a big advantage to being in this minority.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>'Why bomb us while we're at school?'</title>
      <description>BBC's Panorama returns to Syria to visit school attack burns victims</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-24288698</url>
      <date>1380502493</date>
      <body>Footage of a napalm-like attack on a school in Syria filmed by a team working for Panorama shocked the world. Now the BBC has returned to find out what happened to the children who suffered horrific burns.We had travelled to Syria to film two British doctors from the UK charity Hand in Hand for Syria providing care to parts of the country where the medical system is barely functioning.The British medics had stopped off at a hospital in Aleppo Province. It was set up by the charity to provide general medical care, but in a climate of war it is just as likely to be casualties of the conflict who are carried through the door.Within an hour of being there we received the first sign of what was to come.A seven-month old baby boy arrived, his pink face was blistered and raw. His father was also burnt and sat helplessly on a stretcher clutching his son as the staff rushed to help.The British doctors were hearing rumours that there were more cases on the way.Soon, dozens of people, mostly teenagers, were being rushed in on stretchers with napalm-like burns. Their clothes were burnt, their bodies charred and in some cases their hair had melted.Their faces were brutally disfigured with huge blisters forming over their bodies. Almost in slow motion they lumbered in; shocked and in pain. The smell of burnt flesh was overpowering.Within minutes the hospital was overwhelmed. Dr Rola Hallam and Dr Saleyha Ahsam began treating the casualties.There were no shrapnel injuries or loss of blood typical of most aerial bombs.We did not know for sure what the device contained but it caused appalling burns consistent with an incendiary device, containing a substance like napalm or thermite.The pressure group Human Rights Watch has documented the use of similar bombs elsewhere in Syria.All of this unravelled in a climate of fear. It happened just days after the chemical attack in the eastern suburbs of Damascus that killed hundreds of people and many were terrified that the same had just happened here.Doctors ripped open packets of saline fluid and poured the liquid over the victims. The few beds in the emergency room quickly filled up and many of the teenagers were writhing in agony on the floor.Thick white cream was applied to their bodies to treat the burns, while yet more patients were brought in.Outside in the hospital courtyard, a water tanker sprayed the crowd so they could clean themselves - terrified that this had been a chemical attack.Fathers and mothers desperate for news fought to be allowed into the hospital, cursing their president, Bashar al-Assad.Eyewitnesses described the same thing - a fighter-jet circling overhead, apparently looking for targets. A large crowd had gathered at the school where the incendiary bomb was dropped.Eighteen-year-old Siham Kanbari had terrible burns to much of her body.She had been in a maths class when the blast ripped through the window.One of the youngest victims was 13-year-old Ahmed Darwish.When he arrived at the hospital he was shaking uncontrollably. The emergency ward was so full he was told to wait in the corridor.Dr Saleyha described the scene."Out of all the war zones I have ever been to, today has been by far the worst," she said."I have never seen anything like that - the fact that they were children, teenagers, same ages as my nieces and nephews."The hospital admitted 30 patients that day.Most had more than 50% burns - which meant their chances of survival were less than half.The injured needed intensive care therapy but none was available in Aleppo's field hospital.By dusk the chaos began to subside as patients were rushed across the border to Turkey for treatment. Some died on the way."I thought it was never going to end," Dr Rola said. "We lost a gentlemen on transfer to Bab-al-Hawa, he had extensive third degree burns."We tried to stabilise him and refer him as soon as possible but we weren't able to rescue him. I've never seen a burn that bad."I think his face is going to stay with me for quite a long time."Two days after the attack we went to the school.It had been one of the few to remain open in this part of northern Syria. But when we visited the classrooms were empty.The smell at the scene and the debris suggest it was an incendiary bomb. It is not a chemical weapon but is classed as a conventional one.More than 100 countries have banned their use against civilians but Syria has not signed the treaty.The air at the scene was still thick with the smell of whatever was dropped that day; it is hard to imagine or to describe the horrors of what the pilot did.The headmaster said he felt helpless. He was too afraid to give his name."The worst thing in life is for someone to die before our eyes."People burning in front of you. People dying. People running. But where will they run to?"They're not safe anywhere. This is the fate of the Syrian people."Ten children died in the attack and many more have been left struggling to survive terrible burns.We visited Ahmed, in a Turkish hospital, a few weeks after the incident. Described as a hard working boy with a smiley face, he now has 40% burns to his body."I'm in a lot of pain," he said. "I had a fever all last night. I'm in pain on my neck and my shoulder."Why bomb us while we are at school. Why?"When we last saw Siham, in the Aleppo hospital, she was screaming in pain. She is now in a ward alongside Ahmed, in Turkey. She told us the day we visited that her body still feels like it is burning.She was in her final year of school. Described as one of the smartest in her class she is now suffering with 70% burns."Please let it be over now", she said. "We need to find a way out. We've had all we can take."As the controversy over chemical weapons dies down, the world's attention will once again move on from Syria.But for those whose lives are being torn apart by war, the suffering continues.Panorama: Saving Syria's Children, is available in the UK on the BBC iPlayer. It will be broadcast on BBC World News on 5 October at 0910 and 2110 GMT, and on 6 October at 0210 and 1510 GMT.</body>

      <title>'My mum had dementia at 29'</title>
      <description>The teenage fundraiser whose mother had dementia at 29</description>

      <body>When Louise was three, her mother Zoe, who was then 29, was diagnosed with dementia. She is now 42, and living in a care home unable to walk or talk.Zoe is one of the 17,000 people in the UK living with "early-onset dementia", which is defined as cases diagnosed before the age of 65.For Zoe's family, the first signs something was wrong came when Louise and her sister were on holiday with their grandmother.While they were away, another relative noticed Zoe - clearly confused - out in the park searching for her children.Louise's grandmother, Julie, says she still misses the everyday moments she can no longer share with her daughter - going shopping or a day at the beach."It's one of the worst diseases going," she says. "It's all been wiped away."After being in and out of hospital for some time, Zoe was eventually diagnosed with early onset dementia.Doctors could not say why it had happened to someone so young."Right at the outset, when she was first diagnosed, they said unfortunately sometimes these things happen," says Julie."They're like a one-off and Zoe's the one-off."Zoe managed to live with her daughters at the start of her illness, but soon became too ill to cope.She now lives in a care home in Ashford, and is on a special early onset ward, where she is by far the youngest person.Louise was only a baby when Zoe became ill, so has few memories of living with her mother.But she now raises funds for the Alzheimer's Society, and recently took part in one of the charity's Memory Walks. She hopes research will help prevent the same thing happening to another family."I can't help my mum now it's too late - there's nothing anybody can do to help her. But if it means I can help other people then it's worth it."It's also to raise awareness. When I meet new people and I tell them how my life is, and I explain my mum's got dementia, no-one I've met has ever really known what it is and how it affects people."The family is also having to cope with dementia striking again.Julie's mother Ruby, 85, was found to have Alzheimer's five years ago, and is now in a care home.She was diagnosed after slipping out of the house at night and walking several miles along the local canal.Julie - who has therefore seen both her daughter and her mother battle the disease - now focuses on supporting her granddaughters."The miracle we've been waiting for, hoping to happen hasn't happened," says Julie."When the girls were little and asking, 'Why is mum ill and when will she get better?' we just had to say, 'We're hoping for a miracle'."We haven't got our miracle, so perhaps we can help in other ways."</body>

      <title>School maths results 'disappointing'</title>
      <description>"Disappointing" standards in maths among 14 to 16-year-olds in Wales must be tackled, says an education watchdog.</description>

      <date>1381129541</date>
      <body>"Disappointing" standards in maths among 14 to 16-year-olds in Wales must be tackled, says an education watchdog.Estyn's report said maths was the lowest performing core subject at key stage four - when pupils work towards GCSEs - and the lowest in the UK.Last year the proportion of students in Wales achieving C grade and above at GCSE lagged well behind England.The Welsh government said the report had highlighted both successes and areas that could be improved.Estyn said schools must work hard to raise standards. It is due to publish its report on its website on Monday.Chief inspector Ann Keane said some employers were having to invest in numeracy skills training for school and college leavers."Many Welsh employers are concerned at the lack of mathematical skills demonstrated by employees," she said.The Estyn report by inspectors said there was a lack of support for the professional development of mathematics teachers.The findings and recommendations were drawn from visits to 18 secondary schools around Wales.The report recommended more support, advice and professional development opportunities should be provided for schools.It highlighted best practice at some schools such as Bishop Gore Comprehensive School in Swansea where it said 20% of pupils gained A* or A grades in GCSE maths in 2012.But the report found there was an 11 percentage point gap between England and Wales in the number of students getting a C grade and above last year.Its author Rob Davies told BBC Radio Wales: "Inspectors are noting that schools are setting their sights too low and and focusing too much on just doing enough to reach grade C and not stretching pupils enough."He pointed to various factors affecting results in Wales."I think there are question marks over whether key stage three [age 11-14] is preparing pupils suitably in Wales," he said."The inspectors have noted that pupils lack confidence in key aspects such as number work and algebra skills."They are the foundations of mathematics and they give pupils the skills to solve problems."Mr Davies said the weaker results were a combination of low expectations, poor teaching in some cases and the current set up of the GCSE, which allows schools not to enter pupils for higher grade material which Mr Davies said too many schools in Wales were doing.He also said too many weaker students were being entered early for the exam, and that there needed to be more consistency across Wales about networking between schools and sharing good practice.Last year the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) published a survey saying there was a "disconnect" between what employers needed and the basic skills of young job seekers.In July, the Welsh government revealed plans to introduce at least four new GCSE exams from September 2015, including two in numeracy and mathematics.It followed a qualifications review in Wales for pupils aged between 14 and 19 also affecting English language and Welsh exams.A Welsh government spokesperson said: "This report shows where we have been successful in developing mathematics in our schools at key stage four, and where we need to sharpen our performance."We welcome its findings and want to congratulate the schools highlighted in the report for their diligence and commitment to improving standards."We have clear evidence that, at an operational level, the best results in mathematics teaching at key stage four are achieved where schools and regional consortia work together, and where teachers have opportunities to share best practice and benefit from appropriate professional development and regular network opportunities."</body>

      <body>The NHS should not be there to "pick up the pieces" after people fall ill because of their lifestyle choices, said the Welsh health minister.Mark Drakeford said people needed to understand the consequences of becoming obese or drinking too much.He backed one Welsh health board's policy of making overweight people attend health courses before being put on treatment waiting lists.A BBC Wales poll found 82% people thought the policy should be extended.The survey of 502 people marks the start of a new season of BBC Wales programmes called Live Longer Wales about people's lifestyles.In one programme, Mr Drakeford denied claims of a "nanny state" claiming that "what the state does when it helps people to understand the consequences of their action is not nannying at all, it is acting as one responsible adult would to another".In July, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board launched its weight management programme saying improving weight before an operation gives a better outcome.Under the new policy, anyone who wants elective surgery with a body-mass index (BMI) above 40 must have been "offered, accepted and completed weight management support" before being added to the waiting list.The National Obesity Forum, an independent group looking at the treatment and management of obesity issues, has criticised the weight management programme warning the drop-out rate could be high.But Mr Drakeford said overweight people were less likely to benefit clinically from some operations.He added: "If you don't put yourself in a position where that treatment will be effective then that treatment won't be available to you."He said he was "not in favour of penalising people", adding it is "more than education - it is about motivation"."And it is about persuading people that if they want to live longer and they want to live healthily then that means eating better, moving more and drinking less," he said.Live Longer Wales is a new season of programmes from BBC Wales throughout October.</body>

      <title>Lewis' warning for Welsh regions</title>
      <description>WRU chief executive Roger Lewis warns of dire consequences for Welsh rugby in Euro row, and reveals conditions for £1m player fund.</description>

      <body>Welsh Rugby Union chief Roger Lewis has warned of dire consequences for the game in Wales unless the future of European rugby is resolved.English and French clubs will quit the Heineken Cup next year, and BBC Wales understands the Welsh regions want to know the likely outcome before they enter a new agreement with the WRU.But a new contract is due to be signed by both parties before the end of 2014."Without that there's no certainty for the regions and... ourselves," he said.Lewis also confirmed that £1m extra money promised by the WRU to help try to keep top players in Wales was conditional on the four regions - Cardiff Blues, Ospreys, Scarlets and NG Dragons - signing a new participation agreement.The agreement is a contract which sets out - among other things - which tournaments the regions play in, how many foreign players they are allowed and the amount of money they will be paid by the WRU.Speaking on Scrum V, Lewis said the regions and the WRU had agreed the timetable and felt that both parties ultimately want a new deal and would agree the contract.However, he warned that if the contract was not signed then it could, in extreme circumstances, mean the end of regional rugby.Lewis also said he understood the regions' position on needing to know what tournaments would be available next year before committing to a new agreement."Everyone needs to model their businesses and manage their risk accordingly," he said."Risk has been taken as I say, the Cardiff Blues have signed Gethin Jenkins in this context, they have laid a new pitch and I think the negotiation for certain players needs to be concluded as quickly as possible."And yes, a million pounds is available and we want that to be spent as quickly as possible."Asked what was causing the delay, Lewis confirmed the regions had not yet agreed the way forward."At the moment we are waiting to hear back from the four regions, we met with them last week, we outlined our joint views on players and those views were arrived at between discussions with the regions and the Welsh Rugby Union coaching staff."And we've also expressed the clear terms and conditions, and one of them... is the participation agreement."We agreed with the regions in 2009 that the new agreement going forward would be signed between July of this year and December of this year, and it would continue on the same terms and conditions from next year, 2014 through to 2019."We now await that, because without that there's no certainty for the regions, and no certainty for ourselves."The four regions and the Welsh Rugby Union agreed this timescale. And together the four regions and the WRU agreed the process going forward and we all know that if one doesn't sign an agreement well there is no region, and that is the consequence of not signing an agreement."I don't want that to happen, I don't think the four regions want that to happen, but if that's the case we then have to think what is the future for professional rugby in Wales."Questioned about what that would mean in practical terms for the regions, Lewis gave a stark assessment."Well, that means they would not be playing in Europe, they would not be playing in Rabo [Pro12]."They'd not be receiving the monies off the Welsh Rugby Union, they would not have insurance off the Welsh Rugby Union for their players and they would not have any referees."Regional Rugby Wales, the body which represents the four Welsh regions, is understood to be seeking clarification on how the WRU will fund the regions if the English and French clubs' breakaway goes ahead.It also has concerns over WRU proposals to centrally contract Welsh international players.</body>

      <body>Early morning and evening train services between Harlech and Porthmadog in Gwynedd are being suspended from Monday for repairs on an unsafe pylon.National Grid engineers need to stabilise the pylon in the estuary of the River Dwyryd near Porthmadog.The Cambrian Coast Line railway is at risk from the overhead cables falling and a precautionary 100m exclusion zone has been set up.Daytime services should not be affected, Arriva Trains Wales said.Engineers will monitor the situation between 07.20 to 18.45 BST to ensure it is safe to operate a train service under the cables, the train operator said in a statement.Day time services, including school train services, are not expected to be affected by the repair work however they may be subject to last minute delays or cancelations.One of the foundations which supports the pylon at Llandecwyn has eroded, causing it to list slightly and National Grid engineers are due to work on it.Trains will run at booked times between Machynlleth and Harlech, and Porthmadog and Pwllheli with replacement road transport operating between Harlech and Porthmadog.The unsafe pylon has also led to road closures and local diversions which means the replacement road transport is unable to call at Llandecwyn station.A spokesman said customers were advised to check their website for service updates before travelling.</body>

      <body>Trading standards are investigating a company which promised customers free boilers but failed to deliver them.ECO Green Deal Solutions, in Cardiff Bay, made the offer under a UK government scheme designed to help people with heating bills, then charged up to £249 for its services.It is run by shopkeeper Kris Patel, from Pontypool, Torfaen. He has refused to comment.The scheme is free if customers call a government helpline.BBC Wales' consumer watchdog programme X-Ray found some customers were not eligible for the scheme but still charged.Those who were eligible did not receive the boilers promised to them.Pensioner Noreen Riley, from Brackla near Bridgend, who was not eligible for the scheme because she did not receive benefits, said: "He told me they'd had a grant from the government and there was X-amount of money to be spent and this was part of it."Mrs Riley said she was sold the scheme personally by Mr Patel."I thought he was really a nice chap... but I don't think so now. I think I have been ripped off big time."Marenda Morgan, from Maesteg and who was also not eligible for the free services, said she waited months just to have an assessment but ECO Green Deal Solutions did not get in touch."I paid the man £249 and he said an assessor will come in a fortnight and after that it will take about six weeks and everything will be done," she said.But four months later, Ms Morgan has only received an assessment which was not necessary for help under the Affordable Warmth scheme."They haven't got in touch with me," she said."I can't get through to any of the numbers I have for them."X-Ray attempted to contact ECO Green Deal Solutions but its phone lines were dead and receptionists at its former offices at Caspian Point have said the company has moved.The company remains registered as an active company and is not officially insolvent.Mr Patel, who runs Reliance General Stores in Sebastopol, Pontypool, has refused to answer questions about the way his company operated but said he did try to keep customers informed.Another company operating from the same offices, called Diversity Network Ltd, has provided refunds to two customers, including Mrs Riley, which it described as a "gesture of goodwill".Cardiff trading standards said the company has ceased trading and that officers are investigating its business practices.X-Ray is on BBC One Wales at 19:30 BST on Monday, 7 October.</body>

      <title>Military honours for female winchman</title>
      <description>Two servicemen from Port Talbot and Swansea, including one who helped in a a daring sea rescue off Milford Haven, recognised.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24418036</url>
      <date>1381047815</date>
      <body>The only female winchman in the RAF has been named in a list of military honours for her part in a daring sea rescue.Sgt Rachael Robinson, 37, from Devon, is among 117 servicemen and women recognised in the latest Operational Honours and Awards List.She saved a fisherman's life in a Force 8 gale in March, 50 nautical miles west of Milford Haven.Her Queen's Gallantry Medal is awarded "for exemplary acts of bravery."The Queen will present the medals at an Investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace later this year.Sgt Robinson was repeatedly smashed against the deck of a French fishing vessel as she dangled from an RAF Sea King helicopter on March 21.She and her pilot and handler Flt Lt Christian Wilkins, 28, from Port Talbot - who received the Air Force Cross for his part in the rescue - tried six times to reach a Portuguese crew member, who had cut his head open on a door and needed urgent help.A lifeboat was unable to reach the 25 metre fishing vessel because of the terrible weather conditions, but after three further attempts Sgt Robinson was able to get onboard."It was like running into a wall," she said.Her citation said that despite being "repeatedly battered against the boat", causing her "great pain", Sgt Robinson - who said she sometimes attracts quizzical looks doing such a tough "man's job" - "never once gave up".Also among those honoured is Sgt Michael Catarall, who dodged Taliban bullets to run across 100 metres of open ground to save an injured Afghan.Sgt Catarall, 32, of The Mercian Regiment, was a Fire Support Group commander in Kopak, central Helmand province, on November 5 last year when he risked his life to save a seriously wounded Afghan National Army (ANA) soldier.The ANA soldier had been shot in the leg, clipping his artery, and was trapped with gunfire all around him.Sgt Catarall, from Stockport, commanded his driver to drive through a suspected mine field to reach him before running the last 100 metres "with rounds landing at their feet and flashing past their heads"."The first 10 metres we were just laughing our heads off at each other saying 'this is horrendous'," he said."We got to him and didn't have a translator and he just looked at us to say 'what happens now?' We put an arm under his legs but the small arms contact [gun attacks]continued. The casualty suddenly got the urge to hop."Sgt Catarall, who was commended for showing "complete disregard for his own safety", was mentioned in despatches.Twenty-five-year-old Capt Owen Davis, from Swansea, a marine who spent a year learning Pashto so he could accompany the Afghan Local Police (ALP) as they took over from international troops in Afghanistan Helmand province, was also honoured for his service.Capt Davis, who speaks six languages, was awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross - one of the highest military honours.He worked as a cultural advisor in a fragile stretch of Nahri Saraj and the upper Gereshk Valley, which was being targeted by Taliban fighters.He was recognised for feats of leadership in battle and overcoming cultural boundaries which saw him live and work with his Afghan officers for several months - even sharing a bed with them for weeks at a time."I went a bit Lawrence of Arabia," Capt Davis said, as he described how the men listened to Pashto poetry and music together.Capt Davis was blown off his feet by a grenade in a raid on a Taliban stronghold on June 13 last year, just seconds after an Afghan colleague was shot next to him.He managed to jump backwards over the compound wall and continue the assault, in which all insurgents were killed."During the incident you don't really think," he said. "You want to get the job done and prevent anyone else from getting hurt and all get out in one piece. Because any time you lose a friend or colleague it is the worst feeling on earth."The names of military personnel from all three services are included in the latest operational honours list, published in the London Gazette.Men and women are nominated by their commanding officers every six months in recognition of their bravery.Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: "As we enter the final phases of combat operations in Afghanistan, British forces deserve our recognition and gratitude for their role in helping to keep us safe in the UK."</body>

      <description>British and Irish Lions prop Gethin Jenkins returns after four months out injured in the Cardiff Blues' win over Edinburgh.</description>

      <body>Wales prop Gethin Jenkins returned for the Cardiff Blues in this comfortable home Pro12 win over Edinburgh.Jenkins, 32, had been out of action for four months with a calf injury following the British and Irish Lions' tour of Australia.Wing Alex Cuthbert scored two tries to give the hosts a second win of the season.Leigh halfpenny registered the rest of the Blues points, while captain Grieg Laidlaw scored Edinburgh's points.Jenkins played for 60 minutes and his return to action, with the autumn internationals looming in November, will have been welcomed by Wales coach Warren Gatland.This was a confidence-boosting win for a young Blues side which had won just one of their previous four Pro12 games.The return of prop Jenkins and lock Bradley Davies, who was back after serving a suspension, added some much-needed experience and power to the Blues.But this was a scrappy performance by the home side, dominated by too many unforced errors and too many loose kicks.They were in control in the opening passages of the game but had little to show for all their territory and possession against an Edinburgh side who find themselves bottom of the Pro12.Halfpenny proved a great comfort in the early part of this game and the Lions man of the series finished with a personal tally of 19 points.He and Laidlaw swapped early penalties before the Blues finally crossed for wing Cuthbert's first try.Centre Owen Williams' grubber kick was snapped up by Harry Robinson before he put Williams away with his inside pass.Williams was tackled on the visitors' 22m line but a simple passing movement saw Cuthbert finish off the move in the right hand corner with a try.Halfpenny converted Cuthbert's try before Laidlaw replied with his third and fourth penalty to claw his side back to within a point of their hosts to make it 13-12 at the break.Laidlaw missed a chance to give Edinburgh the lead straight after half-time when his fifth penalty hit the post.The Scots did think they had scored a try when flanker Tomas Leonardi claimed he had scored after Edinburgh had been held up on the Blues try line.But the video referee ruled that he had made a double movement and ruled out the score and the home side cleared their line.Halfpenny replied with three quick penalties to give his side a 10-point cushion midway through the second half with a 22-12 lead.The Blues then took full advantage of Edinburgh being a man down after they lost replacement Cornell du Preez for 10 minutes as he was show a yellow card.Cuthbert finished the Blues' second try when fly half Rhys Patchell launched an attack from deep inside his own half, with centre Cory Allen, Halfpenny and Sam Warburton all combining to put the big wing in under the posts.Cuthbert thought he had scored a hat-track for the Blues five minutes from time but the video referee ruled he had been held up over the line.Cardiff Blues: Leigh Halfpenny; Alex Cuthbert, Owen Williams, Cory Allen, Harry Robinson; Rhys Patchell, Lloyd Williams; Gethin Jenkins, Matthew Rees (capt), Taufa'ao Filise, Bradley Davies, Filo Paulo, Josh Navidi, Sam Warburton, Andries Pretorius.Replacements: Kristian Dacey, Scott Andrews, Sam Hobbs, Lou Reed, Robin Copeland, Lewis Jones, Gareth Davies, Dafydd Hewitt.Edinburgh: Jack Cuthbert, Dougie Fife, Joaquin Dominguez, Ben Atiga, Tim Visser, Harry Leonard, Greig Laidlaw (capt), Alasdair Dickinson, Ross Ford, Willem Nel, Sean Cox, Izak van der Westhuizen, Dimitri Basilaia, Tomas Leonardi, David Denton.Replacements: James Hilterbrand, Wicus Blaauw, Geoff Cross, Ollie Atkins, Cornell Du Preez, Sean Kennedy, Matt Scott, Sam Hidalgo-Clyne.Referee: George Clancy (IRFU)Assistant Referees: Neil Hennessy, Neil Perkins (both WRU)Citing Commissioner: Denis Jones (WRU)TMO: Gareth Simmonds (WRU)</body>

      <body>Demolition work has started on the next phase of a project to regenerate a Denbighshire seaside town.The county council secured over £8m to buy and flatten run some down properties in Rhyl and create a new green space as part of its plans.The work at Gronant Street comes amid news the council failed to secure £12m to revamp another part of the resort.The council said it was "bitterly disappointed" but regeneration of the town centre was still its priority.The demolition work began in 2011 with the clearing of some properties just away from the town centre at Aquarium Street.Last year emergency action was taken to start the process to demolish the former Honey Club nightclub over concerns about safety of the building.Work has since started on developing that site into a hotel.Last month, the council was informed it had lost a bid to be shortlisted for a share of the Welsh government's £90m Vibrant and Viable Places fund which it hoped to use to "change the face of Rhyl town centre".The council wanted £12m over three years for its regeneration as work continues on other projects around the resort, including a multi-million pound overhaul of Rhyl Harbour.In a statement, Denbighshire leader Councillor Hugh Evans said the council was making "urgent enquiries" to seek money from other sources, including a £5m Welsh government fund for smaller projects.He added: "We believe that our proposals for investment in the town centre would have been the final piece in the jigsaw that Rhyl needed to return to its rightful place as a prosperous, successful and attractive seaside town."</body>

      <body>An Oxford University music student has won the Bryn Terfel Scholarship at the Urdd Gobaith Cymru youth competition in Aberystwyth.Flautist Chloe Angharad-Bradshaw from Hengoed, Caerphilly county, took the £4,000 prize following a concert at the Great Hall in Aberystwyth Arts Centre.Judges called her a "master at creating the fine sound of the flute".Ms Angharad-Bradshaw plans to use the money to pay for travel expenses to overseas auditions for further study.As well as her studies at Oxford, she is also president of the university's music society and a member of the orchestra and sinfonietta.She said of the win: "I really enjoyed performing tonight, even though I was very nervous before performing my first piece."The other competitors were very professional, friendly and it was great to get a chance to share a stage with them."When they announced my name as the winner, I could not believe my ears and I just couldn't stop smiling."With the scholarship money, I am going to use it towards a masters degree. I've seen a few courses that appeal in Europe and the USA and this money will enable me to pay for flights to auditions abroad."Judge Eirian Owen praised all six competitors, adding: "They were all experienced in their field and mature performers but the winner did stand out."Even though it was close, we were unanimous that Chloe was the winner."Chloe's technique on the flute is excellent. She is obviously a master at creating the fine sound of the flute and I'm sure that she will go far."The prize was established by opera singer Bryn Terfel in 1999 to nurture young singing talent in Wales and is open to winners of eight specified competitions at the Urdd National Eisteddfod, an annual Welsh-language youth festival of literature, music and performing arts.</body>

      <body>Swansea City defender Ben Davies is likely to miss Wales' World Cup qualifiers against Macedonia and Belgium.Davies, 20, appears to have suffered a hamstring injury in the 2-0 defeat at Southampton.Swansea manager Michael Laudrup says Davies will have a scan on Monday on an injury he picked up towards the end of the game at St Mary's Stadium."It seems like Ben Davies got injured in the last ten minutes," said Laudrup."It's his hamstring and we are hoping it's just a strain, so he will be out for two or three weeks."I hope not, but we will see tomorrow. He will miss them (Wales qualifiers) and maybe one or two games for us."He will have a scan and then we will know."Wales manager Chris Coleman is already without Real Madrid striker Gareth Bale, Liverpool's Joe Allen, Brighton's Andrew Crofts and Celtic's Joe Ledley.Wales host Macedonia on 11 October and then play in Belgium four days later.Laudrup saw his Swansea side go 1-0 down to an early goal to Southampton on the 18th minute strike by Adam LallanaThe Swans manager saw his side dominate proceedings with Saints keeper Artur Boruc saving brilliantly from Michu while Nathan Dyer struck the post.Jay Rodriguez's late volley sealed the win for the home side and Swansea have now won only one in four and slip to 14th in the Premier LeagueLaudrup admitted he was at a loss at how his Swans side had lost top Southampton but did admit they are being punished for any mistake they make."We dominated part of the game and the negative part is the loss," said Laudrup"We have been severely punished lately. Against Arsenal they had four chances and scored two goals. We saw three chance and two goals today."At the other end we created but in some games we are not convincing with the last shot or pass. We had the chances we just had to take them."We had chances in the first half but dominated the second half. It seemed like they were looking at the watch the whole time and we kept coming at them."They were under pressure and every time we lost the ball we got it back."We didn't create as much in the second half as we did in the first, but I still expected an equalising goal. It didn't arrive and then they counter-attack and it was 2-0 and game over."</body>

      <title>Church seeks visibility with revamp</title>
      <description>A south Wales valleys' church with a landmark spire needs to become "more visible" in the community after a proposed £1.2m revamp, says its warden.</description>

      <body>A south Wales valleys' church with a landmark spire needs to become "more visible" in the community after a proposed £1.2m revamp, says its warden.The plans for St Elvan's Church in Aberdare, Rhondda Cynon Taf, include a cafe, a mezzanine floor and a gallery in the bell tower.The altar would be moved to the church's centre to allow "interactive" services with the congregation.Warden David Lewis said the church must be more welcoming.The Grade II*-listed church was built in 1852. Its 180ft (55m) spire is a dominant local landmark.It is part of the Diocese of Llandaff and the proposals before the diocesan advisory committee include an arts and craft centre inside and an exhibition area.A mezzanine level above the proposed cafe would be for community use while more room would be created on a galley level in the bell tower.The church also aims to cater for theatre groups, concerts and town celebrations by removing pews on those occasions.Its north door would have a glass fronted foyer entrance, possibly housing a tourist information centre.Church leaders have bid for £500,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund for the improvements which they say aims to make it "fit for the 21st Century".Mr Lewis said: "Despite our central position on the mound and the huge tower, we have become invisible to the town and that is what we want to overcome by making this building more welcoming."We need to be more visible."This church, with its 180ft spire, towers above Aberdare and was central to its development. We want to ensure that it is central to the continuing life of this town."Christina Davies, the wife of Aberdare's vicar, the Reverend Robert Davies, said parishioners backed the plans as a way of rejuvenating worship."There is an opportunity to have an altar in the centre of the church and interactive services which will particularly make a difference for the young people," she said.A report into the future of the Church in Wales last July looked into how the church could adapt to cope with the decline in clergy, falling congregations, a surplus number of churches and a large repair bill for its buildings.A Church in Wales spokeswoman said: "Local parishes are responsible for running their churches - paying bills, maintaining buildings and raising money for initiatives to enhance their use."As many of our churches are listed buildings, grants from Cadw or the Heritage Lottery Fund are sometimes available for improvement schemes that can assure their future."</body>

      <body>A new course record has been set at Cardiff's annual half marathon, with Kenyan Loitarakwai Lengurisi completing the 13.1 mile (21km) race in sub 62 minutes.His official time was 61 minutes and 51 seconds, running 4 minute and 44 second miles.The women's race was won by Kenyan Purity Kimetto in 1 hour 14 minutes and 22 seconds.First Welshman Dewi Griffiths finished in 65 minutes and two seconds.The race, in its 11th year, attracted 19,000 runners on Sunday.The course's personal best comes as Cardiff Council bids to hold the IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in 2016.The Welsh government, UK Athletics and the council have agreed a funding package of £910,000 to host the biennial event.Proposals will go before the council, which said the event could boost the city's economy by £1m, next week.Another £2m would be raised for charities and good causes through race sponsorship, the council said.UK Athletics and the Welsh government will jointly provide up to £360,000, with the Welsh government giving a further £400,000 contingency for the successful delivery of the race.The council will contribute £150,000 from its corporate initiatives fund if the bid is successful.Councillor Ramesh Patel, cabinet member for sport, said: "The Lloyds Bank Cardiff Half Marathon is now a major event for Wales and shows the city has the capacity, infrastructure and draw to be able to host the World Half Marathon Championships."It would be hugely exciting for Cardiff to host this event which further compliments the city's vast sporting event portfolio, promoting it to an international audience."Before the start of the marathon, there was a minute's applause in tribute to Paralympian wheelchair athlete Chris Hallam, who died in August.Hallam, from Pontypool, won medals at three Paralympic Games as well as twice winning the London Marathon.</body>

      <body>The north Wales police and crime panel has agreed to appoint a former senior police officer as a temporary deputy commissioner.Julian Sandham will work as deputy to the elected police and crime commissioner, Winston Roddick.The decision was taken to appoint the former chief superintendent in the acting role after earlier attempts to recruit a suitable candidate failed.The full-time post was re-advertised last week."The panel have previously agreed that there is an urgent need for a deputy to fulfil my statutory duties, such as commissioning and preparing for the review of the police and crime plan," said the commissioner, Mr Roddick."I am delighted that Mr Sandham will be assisting me in my role until the recruitment process to appoint a permanent deputy commissioner has been completed."I am very fortunate to have secured the service of such an experienced and professional person of high intellectual and practical ability."Mr Sandham, who lives in Penrhyn Bay near Llandudno, was in charge of North Wales Police's corporate services before retiring.His appointment to the temporary role was a unanimous decision of the police and crime panel."I am looking forward enormously to working with the commissioner and his team," said Mr Sandham after the announcement."I have a strong understanding of the role and I will bring considerable experience of policing which will now be used as part of an independent function."</body>

      <body>Plans to turn an empty warehouse in a "fantastic" location on the banks of the Menai Strait into a heritage centre have received a funding boost.The Prince's Pier building in Menai Bridge will also host office space as part of the £195,000 scheme.It is one of four projects in Gwynedd and Anglesey to receive grants from the Welsh government.An environmental scheme in Caernarfon, a heritage centre in Amlwch and several town centres will also benefit."The building at Menai Bridge is basically an empty 19th Century warehouse which Menter Mon bought from Anglesey Council years ago, but there's been no budget to do it up until now," said Neil Johnstone, the heritage manager with regeneration body Menter Mon."It'll be a joint enterprise between us and the Menai Bridge Heritage Trust which will use part of the space to display the history of the two bridges."The location really is fantastic as you can see the Telford bridge from the building."To enable the centre to generate an income two office units will also be developed.In Amlwch, a £160,000 grant will be used to refurbish the Sail Loft heritage centre in the town's port, improving access and moving the cafe and exhibition space around.It is a joint venture with the Amlwch Industrial Heritage Trust.Cartrefi Cymunedol Gwynedd plan to use £120,000 to improve the area around the Bro Seiont housing estate in Caernarfon, including upgrading street lighting.Across Gwynedd and Anglesey £500,000 will go towards the continuation of town centre improvements.Councillor John Wynn Jones, Gwynedd Council cabinet member for the economy, said: "We are delighted to be able to secure additional funding to support Gwynedd's town improvement grant."The scheme that has been in place for a number of years is open to town centre shops and businesses to improve the front exterior of their properties."Grants of 50% up to £70,000 are available for eligible businesses."The housing and regeneration minister Carl Sargeant said the grants demonstrated the "commitment" of the Welsh government to local projects and local communities.</body>

      <body>Two goals in three minutes by Dan Fitchett and Angus MacDonald earned a good home win for Salisbury.Wrexham had led at half time after Joe Anyinsah lifted the ball into the top of the net from Brett Ormerod's quick throw-in.But Fitchett's 79th-minute header was followed by a cheeky back-heeled finish by MacDonald three minutes later.And MacDonald denied Wrexham an equaliser when he cleared Robert Ogleby's shot off the line.Salisbury City manager Mikey Harris told BBC Wiltshire:"I'm absolutely delighted with our resolve from being 1-0 down against the run of play. I felt like we could come back and I made a couple of changes at half-time."In the second half we showed that bit of quality and we got our rewards."Angus's goal was something pretty special that would grace any league."Really delighted with the way the lads have worked for each other and put their bodies on the line."Wrexham manager Andy Morrell told BBC Radio Wales: "There's so many positives to take from the game today, but we just keep conceding goals. One today was a back-heel which was an unbelievable goal really when you watch it back again."We were comfortable for 70 minutes, no problems, no issues, then one sloppy back pass and they're in behind us and they've headed in our net and then we're under pressure. Everything that can go wrong is going wrong."</body>

      <body>Land used by fly-tippers has been turned into a community fishery and recreation area in Denbighshire.The £170,000 project saw 40,000 tonnes of material excavated at Rhyl Cut to create a pool and the earth used to build a mountain bike trail and traffic-free route for walkers.The land had become an official dumping ground for years before the clean-up began in March.Now the plan is to extend it as a "green corridor" through Rhyl.Denbighshire council countryside officer Garry Davies said the transformed site has been well received by residents, leading to a community fishing club being set up.There is now a five-year plan being drawn up to try to secure funds to cut a green route through the town to provide a traffic-free route."Because of the work started here we think we can do it," he said.In order to create the fishing area thousands of tonnes of material was removed from the Cut's flood alleviation channel to improve drainage.It has since been used to create a near two-mile (3km) mountain bike course at the former tip at Glan Morfa at nearby Marsh Road.ScottishPower relocated a high power electricity cable which was in the excavation area.And the adjacent landowner at Marine Holiday Park allowed a path to be laid across the site.The land falls within a Communities First area regarded as deprived.Natural Resources Wales (NRW) is stocking the pool with roach, bream and rudd.Local school children are due to help with their release next week.Tim Jones from NRW said: "This project will enable the community and especially young people to enjoy the natural environment."It has transformed what was once an eyesore and a hazard to the public into an asset the people of Rhyl South West can be proud of."The Federation of Welsh Anglers has agreed to show local people how to fish when the Cut is officially opened on 11 October.</body>

      <body>The Bishop of St Asaph led a ceremony to mark the opening of an extension at a Flintshire town cemetery that was years in the planning.With just six plots remaining, work began in May to level land on a sloping section adjoining Mold Cemetery.The town council had spent years trying to find an alternative site for a new cemetery before deciding to extend the site off Alexandra Road.The space is expected to add an extra 15 years to the life of the cemetery.It will be able to accommodate 360 new burial plots.Bishop of St Asaph the Right Reverend Gregory Cameron consecrated the site at a special ceremony on Thursday.He said: "When you think about consecrating a bit of land, it seems like a very straightforward, ordinary thing to do."But when you think of all the people that go to be buried there, of all the love and life and experience as well as those who remember and mourn, it actually becomes a very significant thing to be doing."A report by consultants said it was one of the few places left in the area for burials, with churchyards mostly full.The cemetery, which opened in 1877, has more than 4,000 plots which house two or even three burials. There are also more than 200 sites for cremated remains.A cemetery costing almost £1m opened in neighbouring Connah's Quay in 2010 to address an "urgent need" for local burial space.Woodland burials promising a "return to nature" have just been approved to take place at the cemetery on Kelsterton Lane.</body>

      <body>Language campaigners say they will start a campaign of non-violent direct action unless government policies to protect Welsh are put in place.The motion with a deadline of February 2014 was passed at the Welsh Language Society's (Cymdeithas Yr Iaith's) annual meeting in Carno, Powys.The 2011 census figures showed a drop in the number of Welsh speakers.The Welsh government said it was committed to seeing the language prosper.A Welsh government spokesperson said: "Cymdeithas must understand that those in government are as committed to growing the Welsh language and increasing the number of Welsh speakers as they are."This is not the 1960s or 70s."Welsh Language Society chairman Robin Farrar said: "Nearly a year has passed since we saw the results of the census, and since then there has been a lot of talk and discussion about the situation regarding the language."There is by now a consensus that the Welsh language is facing an emergency and that we need big policy changes."We have said since the publication of the census results that we can't sit back and accept the consequences, with positive campaigning and political will we can change our destiny and the destinies of our Welsh language communities."If the government refuses to act on the six points we have outlined we will take direct but non-violent action."We have drawn up a list of people who are willing to act - campaigns like this have worked in the past and we're ready to do it again."The Welsh government spokesperson added: "We are committed to promoting the Welsh language and since the census results we have been taking action. "He said measures included a national conversation on the language, which gave everyone a chance to have their say on how best to secure its future."We have commissioned a number of reviews and studies, and will be receiving their reports soon. This autumn we will also be launching an information campaign for Welsh medium education."Meanwhile, we will be working with all those with an interest in the language to ensure it continues to thrive throughout Wales."</body>

      <body>Students are staging a protest over the future of Aberystwyth University's Welsh-medium hall of residence, Pantycelyn.The university is currently developing new halls at Penglais Farm, which means Pantycelyn may be redeveloped.The hall has been traditionally where Welsh-speaking students stay, and where Prince Charles spent a term in 1969.The Welsh-language students' union claimed the new halls would harm the Welsh-speaking student community."The new student village is completely unsuitable," said the president of Undeb Myfyrwyr Cymraeg Aberystwyth (UMCA), Mared Ifan.She said the new £45m Penglais Farm development would not have an office for the union or a canteen.She said it would also lack sufficient space for the Pantycelyn eisteddfod group to meet and practice."These are elements that are absolutely essential in maintaining our community of Welsh students," she said."After the lack of consultation on these plans, students have completely lost faith in the university."University officials have insisted that the college is investing in "high standard" accommodation at Penglais Farm, with en suite self-catering flats featuring between six and eight bedrooms each."As part of the development there will be a dedicated area for Welsh language students with a particular social area for Welsh speakers," said a spokesperson."The university will continue its discussions with Welsh-medium students, the Pantycelyn Hall committee and UMCA about the Penglais Farm facilities and how to build and develop the Welsh language ethos there."The college said Pantycelyn would remain in use as Welsh-medium hall until at least the end of the 2014-2015 academic year.Officials said a business exercise was now under way to explore options for the site beyond those dates.</body>

      <body>Police officers who investigated the disappearance and murder of schoolgirl April Jones have been honoured for their "truly outstanding work".Dyfed-Powys Police won the policing excellence award at the Police Federation National Detectives Forum (PDNDF).The force was praised for its work that led to the arrest and conviction of killer Mark Bridger.Five-year-old April, from Machynlleth, Powys, was snatched in October 2012.Paul Ford, secretary of the PDNDF forum, which was set up to represent detectives in Wales and England, said: "This investigation brought out the very best in true team working to deliver justice for April, her family and the local community."PDNDF wish to recognise the truly outstanding policing excellence displayed by Dyfed-Powys Police, the wider police family and those who supported this investigation and helped in the delivery of justice."Det Supt Andy John, who led the investigation, said: "We are delighted as a team to have been presented with this award."Our focus was always to secure justice for April and her family, and we could not have achieved this without the support and assistance of so many officers and staff in Dyfed-Powys but also all the other forces and agencies throughout the UK, it was a huge team effort."April went missing while playing outside her home on the Bryn y Gog estate but was never found despite the largest search in UK police history.The hunt took in 2,000 hours of CCTV evidence and nearly 5,000 calls and messages from the public.The investigation was unprecedented in the UK, in terms of its scale and the terrain covered.Neighbouring forces and specialist teams helped focus on more than 20 locations around Machynlleth.Around 200 local volunteers gathered at a leisure centre to join the search after news of April's disappearance spread on social media.The operation led to 600 messages from the public to police, and the search involved 100 mountain rescue volunteers, 100 police specialist searchers, 20 dog handlers, as well as coastguards and two RNLI craft.Bridger, 47, from Ceinws, near Machynlleth, was convicted of April's abduction and murder at the end of a four-week trial at Mold Crown Court in May.He will never be released from prison.Last week hundreds of people attended April's funeral in her home town, almost a year after she was abducted and murdered.About 200 people walked behind the funeral cortege as it travelled from her home to a nearby church.</body>

      <body>Swansea City striker Michu has been called into the Spain squad for the first time for the decisive World Cup qualifiers against Belarus and Georgia.He replaces David Villa after the Atletico Madrid forward injured his ankle in a 2-1 win against Celta Vigo.Michu joined the Swans for £2m in 2012 and hit 22 goals in his debut season.The 27-year-old was selected by Spain boss Vicente del Bosque ahead of Tottenham's Roberto Soldado and Juventus forward Fernando Llorente.Spain are guaranteed to finish in the top two of their group, along with France, but the 2010 winners need four points from their remaining two home games to be certain of qualifying.Belarus visit Palma on Friday night with Albacete hosting the game against Georgia four days later.La Rioja have already replaced Napoli defender Raul Albiol with Real Sociedad's Inigo Martinez and are without injured Chelsea striker Fernando Torres.Atletico Madrid's Brazil-born frontman Diego Costa has switched allegiance to Spain, but they are yet to receive clearance to play him.Del Bosque had suggested Michu would feature in Spain's friendly against Uruguay earlier this year but did not call him up.The former Rayo Vallecano striker helped Swansea win the League Cup success last season and the goal he scored at Crystal Palace in a 2-0 win last month was his fifth of the season.Spain squad:Goalkeepers: Iker Casillas (Real Madrid), Victor Valdes (Barcelona), Pepe Reina (Napoli).Defenders: Alvaro Arbeloa (Real Madrid), Sergio Ramos (Real Madrid), Gerard Pique (Barcelona), Inigo Martinez (Real Sociedad), Nacho Monreal (Arsenal), Juanfran (Atletico Madrid), Alberto Moreno (Sevilla).Midfielders: Andres Iniesta (Barcelona), Isco (Real Madrid), Koke (Atletico Madrid), Xavi (Barcelona), Mario Suarez (Atletico Madrid), Sergio Busquets (Barcelona), Cesc Fabregas (Barcelona), Juan Mata (Chelsea), David Silva (Manchester City).Forwards: Jesus Navas (Manchester City), Alvaro Negredo (Manchester City), Pedro (Barcelona), Michu (Swansea).</body>

But with brand names leaving, there are a number of empty units."The closure of the magistrates' court, we're also losing our post office and the citizens advice bureau has gone - it's one thing after another.""The town will be massively enhanced by these new facilities."</body>

      <body>More than 200 children are being offered MMR vaccinations at a Neath Port Talbot high school after a fresh case of measles there.Public Health Wales (PHW) said it has received two notifications of measles in pupils at Cwmtawe School with one case laboratory confirmed.It comes three months after Wales' biggest measles outbreak ended.The first cases in Swansea were reported last November before spreading to mid Wales.More than 75,000 were vaccinated during the outbreak throughout Wales.But experts say more than 30,000 children in the 10 to 18 age group still remain unvaccinated.Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board is arranging for MMR vaccinations to be offered next week to all pupils at the school who are not fully vaccinated.Of 1,260 pupils, 62 are recorded as having received no doses of the MMR vaccine and 142 have received only one dose.Two doses are needed to provide the maximum 99% protection against measles, say experts.PHW communicable disease control consultant Dr Jorg Hoffmann said: "This case of measles comes only three months after the end of Wales' biggest ever measles outbreak... so we are obviously concerned and want to act quickly."Although we vaccinated more than 75,000 people during the outbreak, we are aware of more than 30,000 children in the 10 to 18 age group who remain unvaccinated in Wales and have always warned that this could lead to another outbreak."We have written today to all parents of unvaccinated children in Cwmtawe School to urge them to arrange for their children to be vaccinated."In the meantime, to prevent the spread of infection, we would urge parents of any children who become unwell with measles-like symptoms over the weekend to keep them at home and seek medical advice, and not to allow them to attend events where other children will be present."The symptoms of measles include a fever, fatigue, runny nose, conjunctivitis and a distinctive red rash.By the time the outbreak was declared over after six months, it had resulted in 1,219 notifications of measles cases in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, Hywel Dda and Powys health board areas.Some 88 people visited a hospital due to measles during the outbreak.Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, from Swansea, died from pneumonia after contracting measles at the height of the epidemic.</body>

      <date>1381004630</date>
      <body>Manager Malky Mackay says Cardiff's lacklustre performance in the first half was the reason for the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle.The Bluebirds found themselves 2-0 at half-time to Newcastle thanks to two goals by striker Loic Remy,But Cardiff mounted a spirited comeback with striker Peter Odemwingie scoring his first goal."We started really slowly and you cannot give good teams and players time and space on the ball," said Mackay."You end up being punished, and we were in the first half. We made a couple of changes at half-time and had a few words."In the second half, we saw the team that I know and that is the way we have been playing during the last few weeks."We know the players are good enough and I know the players have got it in them to play the way they did in the second half to pen Newcastle in."We have to make sure we play, because in this league, you are punished if you don't."Without the heroics of goalkeeper David Marshall, the home side would have been dead and buried at half-time. He produced a string of outstanding saves to keep his side in the game.The Bluebird may have left themselves too much to do after a poor first 45 minutes, but dominated the second half as Newcastle tried to defend their lead.The introduction of Jordan Mutch changed the game for Cardiff as he created Odemwingie's first goal for the club and missed a chance to level the scores in the dying moments.Mackay, who saw his Cardiff side slump to their second successive home defeat in the Premier League, says he believed his side were capable of salvaging a point against Newcastle."We had great momentum and had balls flashing across their box," said Mackay."We had three or four (chances) which did not break properly for us."I thought at one point the second goal was definitely coming, because we played really well in the second half."</body>

      <title>200 at demolished mural protest</title>
      <description>About 200 campaigners protest at the site of a demolished mural of the 1839 Chartist uprising after failing to have it preserved.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-24400028</url>
      <date>1380986900</date>
      <body>About 200 campaigners have protested at the site of a demolished mural after failing to have it preserved.The artwork depicted the 1839 Chartist uprising in a subway off John Frost Square in Newport was created in the 1978.But Newport council removed the 35m (115ft) mosaic as part of a £100m shopping centre development.It said it would cost £600,000 to save and move the mural.The diggers moved in on Thursday, a fortnight after heritage body Cadw declined to list the 1970s mosaic which was in a city centre subway off John Frost Square.Pippa Bartolotti from the Wales Green Party said the council demolishing the mural has "woken a sleeping giant"."It's just a pile of rubbish on the floor," she said."I managed to retrieve some. There's likely to be a couple of hundred (at the protest). I think people have had enough, this has upset a lot of people."Peter Rawcliffe, chair of Save Our Mural, told BBC Radio Wales people are "incandescent" at the council's actions."It's in bits, and we're hoping to be able to make a memorial out of the bits for the people of Newport," he said."We're asking the city council to make a decision to let us have the rest of the mural."On Thursday protesters shouted at workers as the demolition started, before barriers were pulled down and some people rushed through.The mural was created in 1978 by artist Kenneth Budd who used 200,000 pieces of tile and glass.It celebrated the bloody rebellion led by the Chartist leader John Frost, a magistrate and mayor of Newport who was forced out of office for his radical views.A champion of universal suffrage, he led a march of around 3,000 people in to the town and a confrontation with troops positioned at the Westgate Hotel which left many protesters dead.Frost was convicted of treason and sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered but this was commuted to transportation.He survived and later returned to Britain, where he continued to campaign for political reform until his death aged 93.Around 4,000 people signed a petition calling for the artwork to be saved.Wales' heritage body Cadw said the artwork did not meet its "special architectural interest" criteria for listing.Previously, the artwork faced demolition in 2009 under a development proposal that was later scrapped.The council called in consultants who advised that moving the art work would cost at least £600,000.A report to the council said there were "real risks that the mural would not survive such a move".A spokeswoman for Newport Council said it would consult with the public on a replacement to mark the Chartists.</body>

      <body>The felling of diseased trees across an area the size of around 300 football pitches is taking place at Wales' largest ancient woodland.Larch trees at Wentwood Forest, near Newport, have become infected with the fungal disease Phytophthora ramorum.The infection can kill trees and has spread across the UK after being found in south west England four years ago.The Woodland Trust, which owns most of the forest, said the felling of the trees was essential."This is the most serious and devastating action we've had to take on our estate," said the trust's head of woodland management, Andrew Sharkey."It again highlights both the need to tackle tree disease and the importance of restoring as much of our damaged ancient woodland to make it more resilient in decades to come."Felling the infected conifers across an area of 200 hectares (500 acres) will leave the Woodland Trust with a £35,000 bill for replanting in the forest.It also hits restoration work that has been taking place since the trust bought 352 hectares (869 acres) of Wentwood in 2006."Our aim was to prevent clear felling at Wentwood from happening. However, there is no alternative," explained Rory Francis, also from the trust."We are hoping that the action will slow down the spread of the infection or perhaps halt it."Wentwood Forest is the remains of the ancient tree cover that stretched from the River Wye to the River Usk.Conifers were first introduced to the wood in 1880, and much of the forest cleared to provide timber for trenches in World War I.When it was replanted in the 1950s and 1960s, the once abundant broadleaf trees were replaced with imported conifers, ultimately damaging the forest floor and its natural formation.The forest is spread out over 400 hectares (1,000 acres) and is home to 75 species of birds, including turtle doves, nightjars and spotted flycatchers, and is a habitat for dormice, otters, and pipistrelle bats.It is also a home to wild bluebells, wood sorrel and wild daffodils."Every time you have to clear-fell, the risk is that the shock of the sudden change in conditions stresses some of the native species and they could be lost," said Mr Francis."So in the short term, it will have a negative impact. We don't want to do it but it is a legal requirement."Natural Resources Wales (NRW), which manages most of the remaining forest, said it had already invested £500,000 across Wales to halt the spread of the infection, and was setting aside another £2m to tackle the problem.The disease has recently been discovered at Bwlch Nant-yr-Arian near Aberystwyth and at Cwmcarn Forest Drive in Caerphilly county borough.The infection has also spread to parts of north Wales, at Coed Maentwrog near Porthmadog, and at Coed Cymerau near Blaenau Ffestiniog.It has also affected larches across south west England, Northern Ireland and the west of Scotland."The felling in Wentwood Forest is very sad but this prompt action by the Woodland Trust is essential to try to slow the spread of this devastating disease," said John Browne, from NRW."Our ultimate aim is to make our forests more resilient to pests and diseases and we are heartened that the Woodland Trust is to seize this opportunity to undertake change of structure and species within Wentwood Forest by planting native broadleaves."The felled larch trees will be replaced with a mix of oak and cherry trees, and other broadleaf native trees."In some ways it will actually accelerate the work to plant native trees, but it is not in the circumstances we would have preferred," added the trust's Mr Francis.</body>

      <title>School maths results 'disappointing'</title>
      <description>"Disappointing" standards in maths among 14 to 16-year-olds in Wales must be tackled, says an education watchdog.</description>

      <body>"Disappointing" standards in maths among 14 to 16-year-olds in Wales must be tackled, says an education watchdog.Estyn's report said maths was the lowest performing core subject at key stage four - when pupils work towards GCSEs - and the lowest in the UK.Last year the proportion of students in Wales achieving C grade and above at GCSE lagged well behind England.The Welsh government said the report had highlighted both successes and areas that could be improved.Estyn said schools must work hard to raise standards. It is due to publish its report on its website on Monday.Chief inspector Ann Keane said some employers were having to invest in numeracy skills training for school and college leavers."Many Welsh employers are concerned at the lack of mathematical skills demonstrated by employees," she said.The Estyn report by inspectors said there was a lack of support for the professional development of mathematics teachers.The findings and recommendations were drawn from visits to 18 secondary schools around Wales.The report recommended more support, advice and professional development opportunities should be provided for schools.It highlighted best practice at some schools such as Bishop Gore Comprehensive School in Swansea where it said 20% of pupils gained A* or A grades in GCSE maths in 2012.But the report found there was an 11 percentage point gap between England and Wales in the number of students getting a C grade and above last year.Its author Rob Davies told BBC Radio Wales: "Inspectors are noting that schools are setting their sights too low and and focusing too much on just doing enough to reach grade C and not stretching pupils enough."He pointed to various factors affecting results in Wales."I think there are question marks over whether key stage three [age 11-14] is preparing pupils suitably in Wales," he said."The inspectors have noted that pupils lack confidence in key aspects such as number work and algebra skills."They are the foundations of mathematics and they give pupils the skills to solve problems."Mr Davies said the weaker results were a combination of low expectations, poor teaching in some cases and the current set up of the GCSE, which allows schools not to enter pupils for higher grade material which Mr Davies said too many schools in Wales were doing.He also said too many weaker students were being entered early for the exam, and that there needed to be more consistency across Wales about networking between schools and sharing good practice.Last year the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) published a survey saying there was a "disconnect" between what employers needed and the basic skills of young job seekers.In July, the Welsh government revealed plans to introduce at least four new GCSE exams from September 2015, including two in numeracy and mathematics.It followed a qualifications review in Wales for pupils aged between 14 and 19 also affecting English language and Welsh exams.A Welsh government spokesperson said: "This report shows where we have been successful in developing mathematics in our schools at key stage four, and where we need to sharpen our performance."We welcome its findings and want to congratulate the schools highlighted in the report for their diligence and commitment to improving standards."We have clear evidence that, at an operational level, the best results in mathematics teaching at key stage four are achieved where schools and regional consortia work together, and where teachers have opportunities to share best practice and benefit from appropriate professional development and regular network opportunities."</body>

      <title>Pleas to schools over early GCSEs</title>
      <description>Schools will not be blocked from entering pupils early for their GCSE exams, Wales' education minister says.</description>

      <body>Schools will not be blocked from entering pupils early for their GCSE exams, Wales' education minister has said.But Huw Lewis warned he would intervene to prevent schools "gaming the system" in the future if they did not stop voluntarily.In the meantime, Mr Lewis appealed to head teachers to "do the right thing".The UK government has said it will stop schools in England from entering teenagers for their GCSEs early.Schools have been accused of entering pupils early so they can bank good grades and sit re-takes if they fail.Under the changes in England, only pupils' first attempts will count towards league tables which rank schools according to how many pupils get good GCSE grades.There are no league tables in Wales. Instead, secondary schools are placed into performance bands which are based on a number of factors, including GCSE grades.Mr Lewis said a review of the way schools are banded will look at the impact of early entry for GCSEs. The review will begin after the next set of banding data are published in December.In a speech to the NAHT teaching union, Mr Lewis said: "I am not proposing to take immediate action, of the type proposed in England, I want schools to do the right thing by their pupils without direction from me."But, if we have to act to stop inappropriate gaming of the system in the future, then we will do so."Any school that puts forward a pupil for early entry, for any other reason than their academic best interests, is gaming. Where it is improperly used, early entry can cheat pupils of the opportunity to fulfil their potential."He said a Welsh government-commissioned review of qualifications had found that sitting GCSEs early allowed high-achievers to start their A-levels sooner.However, in general, early entry "was likely to disadvantage most learners".Robin Hughes, secretary of the ASCL Cymru union, encouraged Mr Lewis to take a "more measured approach" than Mr Gove.He said: "When pupils and teachers are given hoops to jump through, they can be forgiven for using ladders to help get them there."And these ladders, early and multiple entry, give some of our most disadvantaged pupils a leg up."</body>

      <title>Call to revamp IT studies in schools</title>
      <description>A subject called "computing" should be created to replace information and communications technology (ICT) in school, a report suggests.</description>

      <body>A subject called "computing" should be created to replace information and communications technology (ICT) in school, a report suggests.ICT is no longer regarded as relevant for the future, the report by a steering group says.It said its replacement should encourage creativity, develop real-life problem solving and be flexible enough to evolve to stay current.Education Minister Huw Lewis called the report detailed and thorough.The report also suggested grouping computing with the three main science subjects."A career in IT typically involves some degree of logic, creativity, com­munication and collaboration, managing uncertainty, and problem solving," the report said."This is at odds with the current ICT curriculum that is prescriptive, outdated and documentation heavy, focusing on the consumption rather than cre­ation of software and digital content."It added: "We feel strongly that ICT has lost its meaning and become synonymous with word processing and spreadsheets."By renaming and rebranding it as computing as part of a new curriculum we will have an opportunity to improve these perceptions."The new subject would be broken down into two areas - computer science and information technology.Computer science would include the academic side and encompass programming, while information technology would focus on the use of computers in industry, commerce, arts and elsewhere.The report, prepared by an independent steering group chaired by Stuart Arthur from software experts Box UK, recommended computing should be designed with input from the industry and have an online assessment tool.It also added that digital literacy - the general ability to use computers - should start in primary school when pupils are five years old."We should equip children with the skills and empower them with the knowl­edge and confidence to become innovative digital creators, effective digital citizens and successful entrepreneurs so they can take advantage of the global growth opportunities that exist in the digital economy and beyond," the authors said."We have a unique opportunity to learn from the challenges identified in this report and aspire to become truly world class, not just by delivering a digital Wales but by becoming a world leader in computing and digital skills."It is essential to empower our children by giving them the skills required to con­tribute to the rapidly growing digital economy."Education Minister Huw Lewis said: "ICT in Wales is global and dynamic and I want Welsh learners to be given opportunities to develop the skills required to work in and contribute to the sector."We have concerns that fewer Welsh learners are seeing the value in pursuing a career in ICT and that many learners, as well as the wider public, perceive learning about computing in a negative way."It's therefore of great importance what is currently being taught is relevant to the global economy of the future."We will now take time to consider the report's findings in the context of our wider review of assessment and the national curriculum."</body>

      <body>Celtic expect defender Adam Matthews to learn on Monday whether he needs an operation that could put him out of action for two months.The 21-year-old Wales international suffered a suspected broken collarbone in Saturday's 2-0 win over Motherwell ."Adam Matthews will see a specialist on Monday," said a statement on Celtic's official website."However, there is the possibility of surgery and Adam could be out for a couple of months."If Matthews does miss the next two months, it would mean he will not be involved for the remainder of Celtic's Champions League Group H campaign.More immediately, it will mean he will miss Wales' two remaining Group A World Cup qualifiers, against Macedonia on Friday and Belgium next Tuesday .Wales also have a friendly at home to Finland on 16 November.Matthews was injured after only 13 minutes of the game at Celtic Park after a sliding challenge by Keith Lasley.The versatile Welshman was stretchered off, to be replaced with James Forrest.</body>

      <title>Mutch is a player to watch - Mackay</title>
      <description>Manager Malky Mackay says Cardiff's super-sub Jordan Mutch is still learning his trade but will be a top player.</description>

      <date>1381126821</date>
      <body>Cardiff boss Malky Mackay has praised the impact that Jordan Mutch has made as a substitute this season.Mutch came on at half-time on Saturday with Cardiff trailing Newcastle 2-0 and although the Bluebirds lost 2-1 he created Peter Odemwingie's goal and had a good chance to equalise late on."He is a top young talent and he is only 21 years old," said Mackay of the England Under-21 midfielder."We have been bringing him through gently and he's learning all the time."Mutch has made an immediate impact for Cardiff when he has come off the bench in the last two games.He scored the winner in Cardiff's 2-1 victory over Fulham and played a key role in hauling his side back to 2-1 against Newcastle."He came off the bench last week and scored a good goal, but I thought he really took this game by the scruff off the neck," said Mackay."I know the potential he has got and he is going to be a top, top player."He is learning and is learning all the facets of the game."The Bluebirds boss did not hide his disappointment at his side's first-half performance against Newcastle but he dismissed any suggestion that he made any major tactical changes.Mackay also warned his side that they cannot afford to rest on their laurels and have to be at their best for every game in the Premier League."If we don't start the way we know, we struggle," said Mackay."It has only happened on four or five occasions in the time I have been here."It was something my staff and I recognised at half-time, and it wasn't anything tactical we changed."But it was about players stepping about and getting to the ball, picking up runners and that is what we did."</body>

      <body>Celtic manager Neil Lennon is concerned full-back Adam Matthews may have fractured his collarbone in the 2-0 home win against Motherwell.Matthews found himself on the wrong end of a sliding challenge by Motherwell captain Keith Lasley and was stretchered off early in the match."First and foremost, I think it was a penalty," said Lennon."He landed badly on his shoulder, it could be a fractured collarbone, which could see him out for quite some time."The victory against Stuart McCall's side sent Celtic back to the top of the Scottish Premiership table and maintains their undefeated run in the league.However, Lennon was upset to lose a player who has been a Champions League starter.Welsh international Matthews was stretchered off and replaced by James Forrest, with the home manager taking a dim view of the challenge from Lasley."He got his leg in first and got the ball on the follow-through," said Lennon."He's at the hospital at the moment and we're just waiting on the result, but early signs are not good."Despite the injury to Matthews, Celtic won comfortably, with impressive strikes in either half from Anthony Stokes and Kris Commons.And Lennon was satisfied with the response to Tuesday's home defeat by Barcelona in the Champions League."I'm more delighted with the performance of the team today," he explained"Against a very good Motherwell team, it's an exceptional performance."Looking at the players yesterday, you could see they were all in good condition, and I think they were just looking forward to getting out there and playing again."We controlled the game and some of the chances we created were great."I think the fans got good value for money. It could have been more, but I'm thrilled with a clean sheet too."He singled out the afternoon's two goalscorers for their contribution to the win, and remarked that Commons had demonstrated a moment of inspiration."I thought they were the two best players on the pitch, although Virgil van Dijk and Efe Ambrose would run them close," said Lennon."Stokes is playing very well and when Kris gets into those little pockets, he's a supremely intelligent, tactical player."His goal was a flash of genius. I really enjoyed watching it, I could watch it again and again."</body>

      <title>Export to new markets, firms told</title>
      <description>Could companies in Wales do more to find new markets?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-24422536</url>
      <date>1381076228</date>
      <body>Companies in Wales could do more to export goods to new markets, according to the South Wales Chamber of Commerce.Director Graham Morgan said businesses should create more opportunities to tap into emerging markets.Wales exported £633m worth of goods to the Middle East in 2012, making it the fourth most popular destination.The Welsh government said international trade remains a priority. A Royal Bank of Scotland report said firms could use markets like Mexico and Brazil more.Mr Morgan told BBC Wales Today: "There are certainly a range of mechanisms in place to move into new markets."I think there's probably a shortfall in the number of businesses that have fantastic products and fantastic services but don't appreciate that they can now be sold in overseas markets."And the more we can get business proprietors to think in terms of where they can be making headway in what has been a difficult economic market, the better for Wales."Chris Howarth, managing director of confectionery company Bon Bon Buddies in Blackwood, Caerphilly county, said it was challenging trading across different parts of world.He said: "You have to get it right in a completely different cultural environment so you have to be committed to learning a different set of rules of the game... every single market is different."The Welsh government said they have a programme of trade missions and exhibitions in place which will take in markets including China, India, Brazil and Russia.</body>

      <title>Partner's 415 miles for Army captain</title>

      <body>When Thea Davies finishes the Chester marathon on Sunday it will not be the end of a race so much as a labour of love.It is her 10th marathon to raise funds in memory of her partner, Stephen Healey from Cardiff.Capt Healey was the 415th UK serviceman to die in Afghanistan, killed by a roadside bomb in Helmand in 2012.Ms Davies, from Pembrokeshire, vowed to run 415 miles, a goal she will achieve.Capt Healey, a former Swansea City apprentice, was commanding his platoon in the 1st Battalion, The Royal Welsh (Royal Welch Fusiliers). from a lead vehicle when it ran over and detonated a the bomb in May 2012."For the first couple of months after Steve died I didn't know what to do. I just moped around," said Ms Davies."Eventually the padre who repatriated Steve - who co-incidentally is also Steve - took me to watch the Olympics, completely reluctantly at the time."I already knew I wanted to do some sort of fund-raising for Steve's favourite charity,"And I knew it had to have a symbolic significance. But it wasn't until I watched the Brownlees winning gold and bronze in the triathlon that the idea of running 415 miles came to me."Capt Healey raised money for Blind Veterans UK because it supported soldiers who had lost their sight through explosions in Afghanistan.Before his last tour he organised a blindfolded sponsored walk to its rehabilitation and training centre in Llandudno, Conwy.Ms Davies' year of running has seen her raise about £14,000 for the charity.Chief executive Robert Leader said her support had been inspirational."At a time of enormous personal tragedy for her she chose to take up Stephen's mantle and continue the amazing work that he had done to support ex-servicemen and women, blinded both in action and later life."We owe both her and Stephen a huge debt of gratitude and what they have done for our people will never be forgotten".Her feat has seen her compete in 20 races - 10Ks, half and full-length marathons, triathlons, and even a half-iron man event.Completing the challenge in Chester will also be highly significant."I hadn't planned it all the way along that the challenge would finish in Chester, but I'm extremely glad that it's worked out that way."As well as Steve's regiment being based here in the Dale Barracks, two years ago Chester was the first marathon Steve dragged me around, just over six months before he died."With the end of this challenge, she is already planning her next project."It suddenly struck me a few weeks ago that it's nearly all over. That panicked me a bit - it certainly made me very emotional because the running has been my way of coping with it all I suppose.""I'm so grateful to everyone who's supported me throughout. Not just my family, but also Blind Veterans UK, and particularly the thousands of ordinary people who've donated and given me such a sense of purpose.""This was for Steve, but the next challenge is for myself. I'm off to New Zealand next year to take part in an ultra iron man event," she said.</body>

      <body>Three RNLI crew members who saved a woman trapped in flood waters in Devon will be honoured for heroism at a national awards ceremony.Paul Eastment and Chris Missen, from Porthcawl in Bridgend county, along with Poole-based crewman Martin Blaker-Rowe, rescued Vanessa Glover when water swept her from her car.The crew will be presented with the Pride of Britain Emergency Services Award in London on Monday.They were nominated by Mrs Glover.She told the ITV programme Daybreak: "They know how proud of them I am and how very grateful I am to be alive."I'm so grateful for this showcasing and nomination. They are volunteers and... risked their own lives."The rescue took place in the early hours of 23 December last year when the River Taw had reached 3.5 metres (11ft) above its normal range.Mrs Glover, a mother of one, had been swept from her car in Umberleigh after it was forced off a road by flood water, leaving her husband and seven-year-old son holding onto the car roof.She was left clinging to a branch.At 01:51 GMT the RNLI's flood rescue team launched its boat with Mr Missen at the helm.Boat team leader Mr Eastment and crew member Mr Blaker-Rowe guided Mr Missen along the safest route to reach Mrs Glover with only head torches for light.They reached her and at 01:57 GMT she was in the rescue boat, very cold and receiving treatment.The men previously won the RNLI bronze medal for gallantry - one of the institution's highest accolades - for the rescue.</body>

      <title>Two Tories quit government posts</title>
      <description>Deputy Chief Whip John Randall and Cabinet Office Minister Chloe Smith resign from the government amid speculation of an imminent reshuffle.</description>

      <body>Two Conservative members of the government have quit amid speculation of an imminent ministerial reshuffle.Deputy Chief Whip John Randall and Cabinet Office Minister Chloe Smith stepped down late on Sunday.Mr Randall, 58, has been Conservative MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip since 1997, while Chloe Smith has represented Norwich North since 2009.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said a government reshuffle could take place as soon as Monday.He said it was likely to focus on "mid-ranking ministers below Cabinet level".As deputy chief whip, Mr Randall was partly responsible for ensuring party discipline among fellow Tory MPs.He offered to quit at the end of last year, his resignation letter said.Ms Smith, 31, served in the Treasury before being moved to the Cabinet Office last September.Stepping down, she wrote to the prime minister pointing out she had been "only 27" when she became an MP and said she now wanted to "develop other ways of giving public service".She was thrust into the limelight last summer when she appeared on BBC Two's Newsnight to defend the government's fuel duty policy.The widely-viewed interview with Jeremy Paxman prompted one Tory MP to label Chancellor George Osborne a "coward" for putting her forward in his place.Mr Randall had worked in the whips' office, either in government or opposition, for 13 years.In his resignation letter he paid tribute to David Cameron said it had been "a great privilege and honour" to serve the party.The departures come after Transport Minister Simon Burns quit his post on Friday to launch a bid to become a deputy commons speaker.Our political editor said: "The prime minister is known to be keen to promote women and those representing northern constituencies ahead of the general election and a wider Cabinet reshuffle which may take place next spring."BBC political correspondent Vicky Young says the Tories have a lot of talented women in junior roles who could be candidates for promotion.It is thought that Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will also make changes to the Liberal Democrat ministerial line-up and Labour leader Ed Miliband is expected to reshuffle his shadow ministerial team.</body>

      <title>'Flying' care visits 'disgraceful'</title>
      <description>Short care visits mean disabled people must choose between staying thirsty or using the toilet, a charity warns, amid claims the practice is rising in England.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24424785</url>
      <date>1381128188</date>
      <body>Short care visits to elderly and disabled people are "disgraceful" and on the rise, a charity has claimed.In England, 60% of councils use 15-minute visits, which are not long enough to provide adequate care Leonard Cheshire Disability says.The charity says such visits can "force disabled people to choose whether to go thirsty or to go to the toilet".But care managers insisted some short visits could be "fully justified and fully adequate".Leonard Cheshire is pushing for a ban on what it calls the "scandal of flying 15-minute visits", lobbying the government to outlaw the practice in England.A report published by the charity said short visits "simply do not allow enough time to deliver good-quality care".It said data from 63 local authorities pointed to a 15% rise in such visits in the last five years, and said some in councils more than 75% of care visits were carried out in less than 15 minutes.Chief executive Clare Pelham said visits should be at least 30 minutes long."It is disgraceful to force disabled people to choose whether to go thirsty or to go to the toilet by providing care visits as short as 15 minutes long," she said.Ms Pelham said most people need 40 minutes to get up, washed, dressed and have breakfast."We are treating disabled and older people as if they are robots to be serviced, rather than real people who deserve to be treated with kindness and consideration," she added.But the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass), which represents care managers, argued it was "totally wrong" to suggest all caring tasks require more than 15 minutes.Sandie Keene, the association's president, said some short visits were "fully justified and fully adequate".It was "frankly naive to believe that simply by abolishing 15-minute slots a magic wand will have been waved, and improvements automatically achieved in our care services," she added."It doesn't work like that."Ms Keene said social workers and their managers had to make "horrendously difficult choices" every day to give the best possible care with limited resources.Leonard Cheshire wants peers to back a ban on short visits by amending the government's Care Bill when it is debated in the House of Lords on Wednesday.The Local Government Association (LGA), pointed to a "substantially underfunded" social care service which was putting councillors under increasing pressure."Significant cuts to council funding mean local authorities are struggling to meet the rising demand for home care visits," said Katie Hall, chairwoman of the LGA's community and wellbeing board.She said 15-minute visits "should never be the sole basis for care", but added: "In some circumstances such as administering medication they can be appropriate, but only as part of a wider comprehensive care plan involving longer one-to-one visits."Leonard Cheshire Disability said a survey of 2,025 people found 93% of those who expressed an opinion agreed 15 minutes was "not long enough to support a disabled or older person to do everyday things like wash, dress and get out of bed in the morning".</body>

      <title>Royal Mail undervalued, says Labour</title>
      <description>The shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, says the government's privatisation of Royal Mail has "undervalued" the firm by as much as £1bn.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24426116</url>
      <date>1381133307</date>
      <body>The privatisation of Royal Mail undervalues the company by as much as a £1bn, with City investors and hedge funds being the biggest beneficiaries of the share offering, says shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Umunna said that the sale is "short changing" taxpayers.The government said it was following "normal commercial practice".Members of the public can apply for the shares online until 8 October.Shares will begin trading in full on 15 October.62% of the business will be sold, with the rest remaining state-owned.Under the terms of the share sale, a 10% stake in the business has been reserved for Royal Mail employees.There is a £750 minimum amount for members of the public wishing to purchase Royal Mail shares, with the threshold falling to £500 for Royal Mail employees.Mr Umunna said that the £750 minimum application was too high."That is a lot of money for most people - it is out of reach for many. Most of the people benefiting from this will be the speculators and the hedge funds".The government may also sell an additional 15% of its stake in what is called an "over-allotment" option, if the demand for shares was very high.Labour has already said that it would not renationalise Royal Mail after it is privatised.In response to Mr Umunna's comments, the Department for Business said: "This is a commercial transaction and government is following normal commercial practice in setting and publicising the share price and delivering value for the taxpayer. The value of Royal Mail will depend on a number of factors, notably the company's on-going financial performance, its future prospects and the level of investor interest."On Friday it was reported that demand for shares is outstripping supply, and they are to be sold at the top end of the government's suggested range.Initially the government priced the shares at 260-330p, however, they are to be sold between 300-330p. Shares will begin trading in full on the London Stock Exchange on 15 October.BBC business editor Robert Peston said applications for the shares are a "few times" the value of those on offer.Members of the Communication Workers Union are currently being balloted on a potential strike over the planned privatisation, and other pay issues.The strike vote closes on 16 October, and the earliest a strike could be held is seven days after that.</body>

      <title>Tory MP pushes for early EU vote</title>
      <description>A prominent Conservative backbench MP says he will try to force the government to hold an early referendum on whether the UK should leave the EU.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24417670</url>
      <date>1381073991</date>
      <body>Prominent Conservative backbencher Adam Afriyie has said he will try to force the government to hold an early vote on whether the UK should leave the EU.The prime minister has promised to hold an in/out referendum in 2017 if he wins the next general election, but Mr Afriyie said voters were "not convinced" that it would happen.He said he would push for a vote in October 2014 instead.But Home Secretary Theresa May warned that Mr Afriyie had "got it wrong".And a Downing Street spokesman said of Mr Afriyie's plan: "The PM will not let it stand."Mr Afriyie - who has denied newspaper claims he is being groomed to replace party leader David Cameron - said he would table an amendment to the European Union (Referendum) Bill on Monday.Mr Cameron has pledged to renegotiate the UK's relationship with the EU before an in/out referendum in 2017.But, speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics programme, Mr Afriyie said there would be "ample time" to conduct this renegotiation by as early as next year."By having a referendum in 2014, it gives us 12 months to renegotiate," he said. "But more than that, it kick-starts negotiations."EU member states would need to "accommodate" British demands for reforms "if they wish us to remain", he added.He argued: "I think it strengthens the prime minister's hand."The MP said 80% of people wanted a referendum, and more than 50% of people wanted a referendum this side of the election."British businesses need certainty," he said, adding he had struggled with his conscience over the matter."I don't want to cause any trouble over it, but I think it's absolutely essential that Parliament and MPs have the opportunity to search their souls and to give people a referendum this side of the election."In an article for the Mail on Sunday, he predicted that, without a referendum before 2015, "large numbers of people will continue to vote UKIP whatever happens, and if they do, there is a distinct danger that Labour will gain a majority and we will never see a referendum at all".UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he would be "absolutely delighted" if the nation could have a referendum before 2015, adding it would benefit British business.He told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme: "Adam Afriyie has put his finger on the real problem - and that's that four years ago, Mr Cameron gave us a cast-iron guarantee that there would be a referendum."This time last year, he was saying there would not be a referendum, and he is now saying there should be a referendum. People are not quite sure what to believe."But Mrs May told the BBC: "We need to be negotiating that settlement with the European Union and then put to the British people the Europe of the future - not the Europe of the past - and give them that opportunity to say in or out."What is crucial is that we have, at the next election, a Conservative party that will be offering people that renegotiation of a new settlement with Europe, looking to the future and then putting that to the British people in an in/out referendum."Backbench Conservative MP James Wharton is attempting to enshrine his party leadership's referendum pledge in law - without the support of coalition partners the Liberal Democrats - with his European Union (Referendum) Bill.As a private member's bill, it is vulnerable to being delayed by procedural tactics from MPs who oppose it, and will only become law if the government allocates enough parliamentary time for its proponents to overcome any such hurdles.Mrs May warned Mr Afriyie's amendment to the bill could "jeopardise" its prospects entirely.And Mr Wharton told BBC Radio 5 live the amendment could "kill" it."My concern is that any amendment, no matter how well-meaning it might be, is going to make the progress of the bill more difficult and it'll make it easier for those MPs who want to use procedural techniques to slow it down and stop it... that bit more possible."I don't want to see that. I'd like to see my bill go through and I think this harms the chances of that happening."Liberal Democrat deputy leader Simon Hughes, whose party opposes a referendum on the EU unless further powers are handed from Westminster to Brussels, said a 2014 referendum would be a "barmy" distraction from attempts to boost UK economic growth.Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said the Conservative leadership had scheduled a referendum in 2017 due to "internal party management as much as anything else".The PM's promise of a "grand, unilateral renegotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU" was "deeply flawed and bound to unravel", he added, in pre-released extracts of a speech to be delivered in London on Tuesday.Labour Party vice-chair, Michael Dugher MP, said "the Tories are back to obsessing about the European Union"."We need a prime minister and a government that will make dealing with the cost of living the number one priority. Instead David Cameron is too weak and out of touch to stop this latest outbreak of Tory infighting."The European Union (Referendum) Bill is due to return to the House of Commons for further debate on 8 November.</body>

      <title>Burnham acts on 'cover-up slurs'</title>
      <description>Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham will not accept "slurs on his character" from his Conservative counterpart Jeremy Hunt, a Labour spokesman says.</description>

      <date>1381073754</date>
      <body>Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham will not accept "slurs on his character" from his Conservative counterpart Jeremy Hunt, a Labour spokesman has said.Mr Hunt had suggested on Twitter that Mr Burnham attempted to "cover up" NHS failings when he was in government.As a result, the Labour MP instructed his lawyers to write to the health secretary, the spokesman confirmed.A Conservative spokesman described Mr Burnham's move as "astonishing".Labour believes that Mr Hunt's tweet was "a step too far" and is seeking a retraction and apology unless Mr Hunt can provide evidence to substantiate his allegation, BBC political correspondent Alan Soady said.The Labour spokesman said: "Instead of focusing on what he should be doing and tackling the AandE crisis, Jeremy Hunt has spent all year orchestrating a smear campaign against Andy Burnham. On Friday, he went a step too far."This is behaviour unbecoming of a secretary of state. Andy Burnham is not prepared to accept these unfounded slurs on his character and the last government. He has therefore instructed lawyers to act on his behalf."In response, a Conservative source told our correspondent: "It's astonishing that Labour are still trying to deny the clear link between [England's health watchdog] the CQC's decision not to expose poor hospital care under the last government and the political pressure applied to the CQC by Labour ministers."Mr Hunt's tweet is understood to relate to a CQC investigation into Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which was placed in "special measures" in July after recording above-average death rates.Conservative MP Steve Barclay has said a series of emails - which he obtained and published on Friday after making a freedom of information request to the CQC - showed that Mr Burnham had put "pressure on the regulator to water down its concerns" about the trust when he was health secretary under Labour.</body>

      <title>Farage: I will stand as MP in 2015</title>
      <description>UKIP leader Nigel Farage confirms he is planning to stand as an MP at the next general election, due in 2015 - but does not say where.</description>

      <body>UKIP leader Nigel Farage has confirmed he is planning to stand as an MP at the next general election, due in 2015.Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, he insisted that the 2014 elections to the European Parliament were his main priority.But the UKIP leader revealed he had been considering a bid to become MP for Folkestone and Hythe.He also said he thought PM David Cameron and his cabinet colleagues regarded UKIP as "the lower orders".Mr Farage refused to be drawn on speculation that he would stand in another Kent constituency, South Thanet."I was thinking about Folkestone," he replied."But it doesn't really matter. I'm not going say where I'm standing. I'm not even going to think about where I'm standing."I am going to stand, but let's get the European elections out the way first."On the subject of whether there was likely to be any deal between UKIP and the Conservatives at the next general election, he said: "It's perfectly clear that Mr Cameron and the cabinet view us as being part of the lower orders, and we're really not good enough for them."He said he was "perfectly relaxed" about his party co-operating with the Conservatives at the local level, but he added: "I don't think it will happen."The current MP for Folkestone and Hythe, the Conservatives' Damian Collins won a 10,122-vote majority at the general election in 2010 on nearly 50% of the vote.The UKIP candidate won 4.6% of the vote, but in the May 2013 county council elections three UKIP members were voted in to represent Folkestone.Mr Farage explained his party's general election strategy: "We will target our resources where we won county council seats, where we won district council seats following the model that the Lib Dems used under Paddy Ashdown building on local strength."If you can win at council level, you can win at parliamentary level."Mr Collins took to Twitter to comment: "Nigel Farage says 'it doesn't really matter' whether he commits to stand to be an MP in Folkestone or Thanet."He's got no commitment."</body>

      <body>Former cabinet minister Liam Fox successfully claimed 3p of taxpayers' money for a car journey of about 100 metres, expenses documents show.Mr Fox's office made the claim after he travelled a distance recorded as 0.06 miles in October 2012.He had visited a concrete firm before heading within his north Somerset base to a constituency surgery in Yatton.The ex-defence secretary made another 15 claims of under £1 for car travel approved in 2012-13, the files showed.These included 24p for a 0.54-mile journey from a constituency surgery to a school competition in Clevedon, and 44p for a 0.98-mile journey from a local politics event at Winford Manor to Winford School.Under the current system, MPs can claim 45p per mile.MPs claimed a total of £23m in personal expenses in the year to April.Paperwork from the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) shows Mr Fox claimed £3,866.31 in travel expenses - including rail fares - in the last financial year.The claim for the car journey to Yatton was paid last December, according to the notes.Mr Fox told the Sunday People: "I don't do my expenses. My office does them. But they are all done according to the rules for travel distances."Last year, the Conservative MP had to repay £3,000 of expenses after it was found he had allowed his friend Adam Werritty to live at his taxpayer-funded second home for a year rent-free.He was also criticised for allowing their Atlantic Bridge think tank to be run from his parliamentary offices.Mr Fox resigned from his cabinet position in October 2011 over his relationship with Mr Werritty.</body>

      <title>Gove pressed over Muslim free school</title>
      <description>Labour asks the education secretary to explain what checks his department have carried out on the Al-Madinah Muslim free school.</description>

      <date>1381015587</date>
      <body>Michael Gove is coming under pressure to explain what checks his department carried out on a Muslim free school which has been closed since Tuesday.Al-Madinah, in Derby, cited "health and safety concerns" when it shut last week. It is due to reopen on Monday.But Labour called on the education secretary to "reassure the public" amid persistent concerns over the school.The Department for Education was already investigating allegations against the school, a spokesman said.Free schools - which can be opened by anyone - are state-funded but not overseen by the local authority.Al-Madinah says it has a "strong Muslim ethos" and when it opened last year claimed to be the first such school in the country for pupils from reception age to 16.Preliminary findings from an Ofsted inspection into the school gave it the lowest possible rating.The Department for Education had asked Ofsted to bring their inspection forward. Allegations had been made by parents and staff that pupils at Al-Madinah had been told to follow strict Islamic practices.Former staff have claimed non-Muslim female teachers came under pressure to wear the hijab head-scarf.It has also been reported that girls were made to sit at the back of class.The school denies pupils have been segregated and says its dress code was made clear to anyone wanting to work at the school.Sources have told the BBC the closure was due to incomplete records of child protection checks being done on all staff.But ahead of the school re-opening to pupils on Monday, shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said the situation must be "urgently clarified in order to reassure the public".In a letter to Mr Gove the Labour MP said: "This is, of course, not the first time that there have been questions surrounding your department's oversight of a free school."While I understand that there is an ongoing investigation, the reports concerning this school are of extreme concern to parents and the wider community."Given the confusion as to why the school has closed, and that pupils may be returning to the school on Monday, I would ask that these matters be clarified urgently in order to reassure the public."He called on the department to say what "due diligence" was carried out when the school was approved.And he asked whether there had been "appropriate vetting" of staff and what oversight ministers had had since it opened.Interim principal Stuart Wilson closed the school after Ofsted inspectors shared their preliminary findings with him."While unfortunate, my decision to close the school related to a short-term health and safety issue that has now been completely resolved and will not reoccur," a statement on the school's website read.The school "will be open as normal on Monday," Mr Wilson added.A Department for Education spokesman said: "We were already investigating this school before the allegations became public."We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection. We are waiting for Ofsted's final report and considering all legal options."Mr Twigg also questioned what would happen to children at the school if it did not reopen on Monday or had to close again.</body>

      <title>Union anger at health pay proposal</title>
      <description>Unions criticise government moves to halt a 1% pay rise for all NHS staff in England, arguing they deserve to be rewarded for holding the health service together.</description>

      <date>1380991958</date>
      <body>Unions have criticised government moves to halt a 1% pay rise for all NHS staff in England.The Department of Health said the increase was unaffordable alongside the current system which sees many staff automatically receive incremental annual rises.It has urged the NHS pay review body to withhold the rise for 1.3m staff.Rachael Maskell, of the Unite trade union, said staff deserved the pay reward for "holding the NHS together".Health trusts are currently under pressure to make savings and the NHS wage bill accounts for around 40% of its budget.All public sector pay increases are capped at 1%.The Department of Health (DoH) proposes using the funding intended for the rise to "modernise" pay structures.It says automatic increments - linked to length of service and satisfactory performance - add £900m to salary costs.The DoH has stressed no decisions on changes to pay have been taken, insisting independent bodies will make their recommendations in February or March next year.But the plans, outlined in the DoH's submission to two independent pay review bodies, have been criticised by Unite and Labour.Ms Maskell, of Unite, said: "The Department of Health have got other choices. They're entering into a reorganisation which is costing £3bn, which nobody asked for and isn't adding anything to patient care."It is about choices and the NHS staff have already had two years of a pay freeze - 1% last year - and, quite frankly, are really falling behind inflation now with their wages."Staff moraleShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme motivation and morale was down among frontline health workers "at this very difficult time".However, in its submission the DoH points to a staff survey suggesting high levels of motivation and morale and says there should only be basic pay increases if there is "strong evidence" recruitment, retention, morale or motivation issues require this.Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the NHS reorganisation had taken money out of front-line services."There has to be pay restraint in the NHS as well as other public services... but the NHS has been through some very difficult years - so have NHS staff - and this was a modest increase to recognise the pressure that all families are under."To take it away, to break that promise, is just another kick in the teeth."Staff representatives have also reacted angrily to the plans."What they have done is inflammatory," said Christina McAnea, head of health at Unison and joint chairwoman of the NHS Staff Council."We are not going to negotiate while a gun is held to our head for a paltry 1% pay rise - our members will not react well to that."Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association council said this would not result in staff leaving in their "droves".However he added: "We're going to find it increasingly hard to recruit, partly for the specialist skills and partly for the numbers of staff that we'd need to bring into the health service to implement the safe minimum staffing levels."Health minister Anna Soubry defended the government 's stance telling the BBC: "This is about making sure we pay our NHS staff well and we reward their improvement in skills."This system works in other public sectors and the private sector. People want to make sure that they are getting good quality, first class services especially at a time when the NHS faces challenges."Earlier a DoH spokeswoman said: "Many NHS staff have continued to receive pay rises of up to 3.5% and we want to keep working with the trade unions and employers on affordable pay."The measures we are proposing will help increase quality for patients and help us realise our vision of an affordable seven-day service."In June Chancellor George Osborne said ministers were working to "remove automatic pay rises" for teachers, health professionals, prison and police staff.The DoH drew attention to Mr Osborne's comments and confirmed it wanted NHS pay to have "stronger links to performance, quality and productivity".</body>

      <title>Rail minister Burns stands down</title>
      <description>Transport Minister Simon Burns resigns from the government to run for the position of deputy Commons Speaker.</description>

      <date>1380897834</date>
      <body>Transport Minister Simon Burns has resigned from the government to run for the position of deputy Commons Speaker.The MP for Chelmsford has been responsible for the controversial HS2 rail link during the past year, having previously been a health minister.One of the three deputy Speaker positions is vacant after previous incumbent Nigel Evans stood down to fight sexual assault charges.Mr Burns has clashed with Speaker John Bercow several times in the past.On one occasion, Mr Burns described the man under whom he now seeks to serve as a "stupid sanctimonious dwarf".BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said the Conservative MP had apologised afterwards - but only to groups of people who felt insulted, not necessarily to the Speaker himself.Were he to be elected, relations between the pair would not be altogether comfortable, our correspondent added.There are plenty of Conservatives who do not support Mr Bercow and might vote for Mr Burns just to irritate him, he continued.MPs are elected to the role of deputy Speaker, under reforms proposed by Mr Bercow shortly after he took on his role in 2009.To stand for election, MPs need to be sponsored by at least six other MPs.One of the other candidates for the role is Nadine Dorries, who in 2009 described the Speaker as "oily" and suggested he was "mistrusted by up to half of the House".Conservative backbenchers Eleanor Laing and Brian Binley have also been named as potential candidates.The successful applicant will join existing deputies, former Labour MPs Dawn Primarolo and Lindsay Hoyle, in helping to chair Commons business.Mr Burns' decision comes ahead of an expected reshuffle of middle-ranking Conservative ministerial ranks in coming weeks.In his resignation letter to Prime Minister David Cameron, he wrote: "It has been a privilege to serve in your administration for the past three and a quarter years and I will be forever grateful to you for giving me that opportunity in both the Departments of Health and Transport."You can rest assured that I will continue to support your leadership of both the Conservative Party and the government."The PM's response described the MP as a "loyal, dedicated and committed colleague".Mr Cameron said: "I know that this will not have been an easy decision for you to make, and one you will have given a huge amount of thought to."After serving the government so ably for over three years, you will certainly be missed, but I completely understand and respect your decision."</body>

      <title>Child benefit deadline day looms</title>
      <description>A tax boss says nearly 200,000 parents must "get off their backsides" and register with the UK tax authority amid changes to child benefit.</description>

      <body>A tax boss has said nearly 200,000 parents must "get off their backsides" and register with the UK tax authority amid changes to child benefit.Saturday marks the first deadline for better-off families to sign up with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).They will need to register for self-assessment so the HMRC can claw some or all of the benefit back.Families where one parent has a taxable income of more than £50,000 are affected.They will lose some of the benefit, following the introduction of the new rules in January 2013, while child benefit has been withdrawn entirely if one parent earns more than £60,000.Eligible families receive £20.30 per week in child benefit for their first child and £13.40 a week for any further children.The new rules meant that this payment is reduced gradually for families where one parent is earning between £50,000 and £60,000.HMRC has written to people who it believes have a taxable income of more than £50,000 and so need to take some action. Taxable income is earnings from employment, as well as other income such as from savings and shares, but may not include some pension contributions.Lin Homer, HMRC chief executive, told BBC Radio 5 Live: "We think there is about 200,000 people who need to get off their backsides and do something."Some 350,000 people have opted out of receiving child benefit altogether, generally because they earn and will continue to earn a taxable income of more than £60,000 and therefore would not be entitled to the payment.HMRC says another 425,000 people were already in self-assessment, some 140,000 people have registered for self-assessment, and another 185,000 people have still to register.In theory, the deadline to register and avoid a possible penalty is 5 October. The penalty would be between 10% and 100% of the child benefit paid.However, HMRC says it is unlikely that anyone who registers and pays the tax by 31 January would be penalised."HMRC is committed to helping people pay the right amount of tax and urges parents who have been affected by the changes to child benefit to register for self-assessment," said Ms Homer."We know that lots of people leave it until the last minute."Anita Monteith, of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, said: "This adds considerable complication to the tax system for ordinary people, particularly for those brought into the self-assessment system for the first time."I would urge those affected to register for self-assessment as soon as they can."</body>

      <title>Mail's position unravelling - Labour</title>
      <description>Labour says the Daily Mail's stance is unravelling after a senior journalist said an article about Ed Miliband's father was "wrongly labelled".</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24395790</url>
      <date>1380915514</date>
      <body>Labour has said the Daily Mail's stance is unravelling after a top journalist said an article about Ed Miliband's father was "wrongly labelled".Alex Brummer, the Mail's City editor, told Channel 4 News it should have been made clearer it was a comment article.The paper has refused to apologise for a piece calling Marxist academic Ralph Miliband "The man who hated Britain" - and said its position had not changed.A Labour spokesman said the Daily Mail's defence was "crumbling".Mr Brummer's comments are the first time anyone from the Mail has suggested there might be a problem with the article.He said: "Sometimes articles which are comment should be labelled and made clear that they are comment."So perhaps it should have said 'comment' on it to make clear absolutely it was comment instead of a special report."But I think people understood that it wasn't just reporting; there was an element of commentary to it. Just maybe the labelling wasn't quite what it should have been."Labour said it showed that the Mail's strategy was unravelling piece by piece."Six days on from their original article, the Daily Mail's defence is crumbling," said the spokesman."For the first time, they have been forced to admit significant problems in the way they dealt with the article 'The man who hated Britain'."They should now finally have the good grace and decency to acknowledge their grotesque error of judgment and apologise."Earlier Mr Brummer told the BBC the Daily Mail would not say sorry to the Labour leader - and said the paper was owed an apology over claims that its Ralph Miliband articles were motivated by anti-Semitism.Mr Miliband sought to distance himself from the anti-Semitism claims.But he renewed his demand for the paper's owner Lord Rothermere to investigate its culture and practices.Lord Rothermere has apologised to Mr Miliband for a Mail on Sunday reporter intruding on a family memorial service.But he stopped short of saying sorry for the Ralph Miliband article or agreeing to a wider inquiry into the way his newspapers operate.Appearing on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Brummer strongly defended the Daily Mail's original article which questioned how far Ralph Miliband's left-wing views had influenced his son.He said: "I don't think we need to apologise for anything. This was a piece which examined somebody's views very carefully."He hit out at suggestions from the Jewish Chronicle, some Labour figures and others that there may have been "a whiff of anti-Semitism" about the coverage."I think there are people out there who need to apologise to us because there have been vicious accusations in the last couple of days, from (former Labour leader) Neil Kinnock among others, that somehow this was an anti-Semitic attack," he said.Mr Miliband told BBC Radio 5Live he was not suggesting the paper was anti-Semitic."I'm always incredibly careful about throwing around the idea that the paper or somebody is anti-Semitic or racist unless there is real evidence for that," he said."I don't believe that of the Mail; that's not been my issue."He said that while the newspaper was entitled to hold him to account for his views, the way it had attacked his father was unacceptable."They'll criticise me, they'll say my policies are wrong, that's absolutely fine. But when it comes to my dad, and saying my dad hated Britain, I'm afraid they're crossing a line," he said."In all of this, they've never apologised for the fact they said my dad hated Britain - an idea without any foundation."While acknowledging the Daily Mail - which has a circulation of more than 1.8 million - was a "popular" newspaper, he suggested many of its readers agreed with him that it had "overstepped the mark".Mail on Sunday editor Geordie Greig said a reporter had been sent to a memorial service for Mr Miliband's uncle without his knowledge and an investigation was being held into "a decision which was wrong".Mr Miliband told 5Live he had met the Daily Mail's editor Paul Dacre "two or three times" since becoming Labour leader.Mr Brummer defended the Mail's journalistic methods, saying it was "extraordinarily careful" about how it pursued a story.He said: "I hear the editor, I hear the deputy editor almost every day saying to reporters, saying to editors of their sections 'be careful how you go about getting a particular story'."That's a practice which goes to the core of the paper, and I do think there are some good ethical roots in the paper and this is the exception rather than the rule."The row comes ahead of a crucial meeting of MPs next Wednesday on press regulation.They will consider rival proposals for a new regulator to replace the Press Complaints Commission.Mr Miliband, along with the three main political parties and press intrusion victims campaign group Hacked Off, supports a form of press regulation backed by royal charter.The newspaper industry, among them the country's largest newspaper groups, including Mail publisher DMG Media, News UK, owner of the Sun and the Times, Telegraph Media Group and Trinity Mirror, have put forward a rival plan rejecting "state-sponsored regulation".A member of Lord Justice Leveson's inquiry team into press practices expressed concern that Mr Miliband's row with the Mail could be used as "a cudgel to try to beat the press" and push through tighter regulation.Former Daily Telegraph political editor George Jones said: "We were quite clear in those discussions that we did not want to get into the question of taste, we didn't want to be arbiters of what was in good taste and what was in bad taste."In my view, once you go down that road you do seriously compromise freedom of speech."</body>

      <title>Tories may cut under-25s' benefits</title>
      <description>David Cameron suggests that out-of-work benefits paid to people under the age of 25 could be cut so all of them are either "earning or learning".</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24369514</url>
      <date>1380745590</date>
      <body>David Cameron has suggested benefits paid to people under the age of 25 could be cut in an effort to reduce long-term worklessness.In his speech to the Conservative conference, the prime minister promised to "nag and push and guide" young people away from a life on the dole.It was later confirmed that the government is reviewing policies for 16 to 25-year-olds.But Labour accused the Conservatives of a "desperate" lack of ideas.In his speech, Mr Cameron promised to create a "land of opportunity" by boosting business and reducing reliance on benefits.He also vowed to improve the education system and told party activists that there was still much work to do to fix the economic "mess" left by Labour.The latest figures from the Department of Work and Pensions showed 1.09 million people between the ages of 16 and 24 were not in work, education or training.The problem has proved stubbornly hard to tackle across Europe, with rates of youth unemployment soaring above 50% in Spain.Mr Cameron argued that action was needed in the UK, saying: "There are still over a million young people not in education, employment, or training."Today it is still possible to leave school, sign on, find a flat, start claiming housing benefit and opt for a life on benefits. It's time for bold action here."He promised the Conservatives would consider, as they write their manifesto for the 2015 general election, whether "that option should really exist at all".A Conservative source has told the BBC the manifesto will definitely contain a commitment to end the automatic entitlement to housing benefit for the under-25s, as suggested previously by Mr Cameron.In his speech, the prime minister criticised reliance on benefits, saying: "Instead we should give young people a clear, positive choice: Go to school. Go to college. Do an apprenticeship. Get a job."But just choose the dole? We've got to offer them something better than that."He added: "And let no one paint ideas like this as callous. Think about it: with your children, would you dream of just leaving them to their own devices, not getting a job, not training, nothing?"No - you'd nag and push and guide and do anything to get them on their way… and so must we. So this is what we want to see: everyone under 25 - earning or learning."During the week-long conference in Manchester, the Conservatives have announced plans to make the long-term unemployed undertake work placements if they want to continue receiving benefits.Mr Cameron did not set out any specific changes regarding under-25s during his 50-minute speech, but Education Secretary Michael Gove offered more detail when questioned on BBC Radio 4's The World at One.He announced that Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood was already reviewing the policies in place. He is expected to report his findings by the end of the year.Mr Gove said: "It is always going to be the case that there are some people for whom you need not so much a nudge as a dunt (a firm blow or stroke) towards the workplace."It's important also that we all recognise that welfare is there explicitly to help those people through hard times that it shouldn't become habituated."He said he would not pre-empt the policy review, adding: "I don't think any of us would want to take away any form of necessary support to young or old vulnerable people."However, unions warned that any cut in benefits would hurt the worst-off.TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: "Given the government's awful track record of helping young people find jobs, the prime minister's threat to ban the dole for under-25s will simply push hundreds of thousands of young people, including those with young families, even deeper into poverty."Young people suffered most in the recession. Today the prime minister has pledged that they will suffer most during the recovery too."The general secretary of the University and College Union, Sally Hunt, said: "What we need is a real plan at local and national level which provides sustainable and secure employment opportunities for young people and access to education which is useful and mind-broadening."Cheap headlines about lazy youngsters or cutting their benefits are no substitute for a strategy which is on the side of young people and allows them to realise their potential."A Labour spokesperson said: "This is an empty and a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that there was absolutely nothing in David Cameron's speech to deal with the cost-of-living crisis facing families."If the Conservatives really wanted to get young people off benefits, they'd be backing Labour's youth jobs guarantee, giving young people who've been out of work for over a year a job they must take or lose benefits."</body>

      <body>David Cameron vowed to get behind business to create a "land of opportunity for all", in his big speech to close the Conservative conference.His 50-minute address sought to set out dividing lines with "the 1970s-style socialism" he said Labour now offered.He claimed the economy was "turning the corner" and the "land of hope is Tory", while "the land of despair was Labour".Mr Cameron also hinted that benefits for under-25s could be cut in an effort to get more young people into work.But Labour said the prime minister had failed to address the "cost-of-living crisis" and offered a land of opportunity "for just a privileged few".During the 50-minute speech, Mr Cameron contrasted his own party's philosophy with that of the opposition, saying: "If Labour's plan for jobs is to attack business, ours is to back business."He criticised Labour leader Ed Miliband, who promised in his end-of-conference address last week to freeze energy prices and increase corporate tax on big firms, telling Tory activists that "profits, tax cuts and enterprise... are not dirty, elitist words".Mr Cameron argued that adding more state borrowing and spending to ease the "cost-of-living crisis" would risk putting the UK on the economic trajectory of Greece."It's all sticking plasters and quick fixes cobbled together for the TV cameras - Red Ed and his Blue Peter economy, " said the prime minister.Earlier in the week, Chancellor George Osborne announced plans to make the long-term unemployed undertake work placements if they want to continue receiving benefits.In his speech, Mr Cameron did not make any specific policy announcements, but suggested his party was looking at further changes to the welfare system to include in its manifesto for the 2015 general election.It was wrong that young people could "choose the dole" and right to "offer them something better".Mr Cameron added: "And let no one paint ideas like this as callous."Think about it: with your children, would you dream of just leaving them to their own devices, not getting a job, not training, nothing?"No - you'd nag and push and guide and do anything to get them on their way… and so must we. So this is what we want to see: everyone under 25 - earning or learning."Mr Cameron, who did not repeat previous no-notes speeches, often looked straight into the lens of the TV camera to address directly the audience outside the Manchester conference centre.The BBC's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said it was a surprisingly sober speech in parts, with Mr Cameron stressing there was still much work to do to fix Britain's economy.It was not enough just to clean up Labour's "mess" and pay off the deficit, he wanted to "build something better in its place".He added: "In place of the casino economy, one where people who work hard can actually get on; in place of the welfare society, one where no individual is written off; in place of the broken education system, one that gives every child the chance to rise up and succeed."Mr Cameron invoked the spirit of his predecessor Margaret Thatcher, the winner of three general elections, who died earlier this year, saying she had "made our country stand tall again, at home and abroad".He also made efforts to distance his party, and himself, from the Liberal Democrats, with whom the Tories have ruled in coalition for more than three years.He promised: "When the election comes, we won't be campaigning for a coalition, we will be fighting heart and soul for a majority Conservative government - because that is what our country needs..."This party at its heart is about big people, strong communities, responsible businesses, a bigger society - not a bigger state."To cheers, Mr Cameron attacked the Lib Dems for "trying to take all the credit" for lowering the minimum earnings threshold at which people start paying income tax.He joked: "Well, memo to the Lib Dems: you lecturing us on low taxes is like us lecturing you on pointless constitutional tinkering."We are Tories, we believe in low taxes and, believe me, we will keep on cutting the taxes of hard-working people in our country."Mr Cameron received a standing ovation after the speech, his ninth to conference since becoming leader in 2005.But, afterwards, Labour leader Ed Miliband said the prime minister had offered nothing to address "the cost-of-living crisis facing Britain's hard-working families".The Lib Dems said they, not the Conservatives, had made a manifesto commitment in 2010 to raise the level at which people start paying tax to £10,000.And UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the pro-business message conflicted with the reality that membership of the EU was costing the UK "billions in red tape and direct payments from high taxes".But there was a more favourable response from business groups, with CBI director-general John Cridland saying the prime minister had "sent out a strong message about how vital British business is to the future prosperity of people across the UK".Simon Walker, director-general of the Institute of Directors also welcomed the speech, but warned that firms would "be looking for him to match the sentiment with action - if tax cuts aren't dirty, let's have a few more of them".</body>

      <title>Miliband: We'll freeze energy prices</title>
      <description>Ed Miliband tells his party conference Labour will freeze energy prices if they get into power - but energy firms criticise the plan.</description>

      <body>Labour would freeze gas and electricity bills for every home and business in the UK for 20 months if it wins the 2015 election, Ed Miliband has said.The big energy firms would be split up and governed by a new tougher regulator to give people "a fairer deal".Labour says the move will save average households £120 and businesses £1,800 - but cost the energy giants £4.5bn.But energy companies said the policy could lead to power shortages, and jeopardise investment and jobs.The Labour leader said firms had been overcharging "for too long" and it was time to "reset" the energy market.The Tories accused him of a "sleight of hand", saying people would have to "pay more for their electricity" under the plans.Speaking for more than hour without notes at his party's annual conference in Brighton, Mr Miliband set out his vision of how "Britain can do better" under Labour, with an economy that works for "ordinary people once again".In other developments at Labour's conference:Mr Miliband used his speech to pledge action on what he has called Britain's "cost of living crisis", setting out an alternative vision of Britain's economy to that pursued by the Conservatives, with higher skills and wages."David Cameron talks about Britain being in a global race. But what he doesn't tell you is that he thinks the only way Britain can win is for you to lose."Mr Miliband said that means "the lowest wages, the worst terms and conditions, and the fewest rights at work - a race to the bottom", adding: "The only way we can win is in a race to the top."In an upbeat speech peppered with swipes at David Cameron and George Osborne for being out touch and lacking aspiration for the country, Mr Miliband repeatedly used the phrase "We're Britain, we're better than this" to cheers and applause from Labour activists.He received standing ovations for defending the NHS and promising to axe "the bedroom tax" - and tackled Tory criticism that he lacks leadership skills head-on, saying: "If they want to have a debate about leadership and character - be my guest."Unlike David Cameron, he told the party faithful, he had stood up to vested interests on media regulation and the tobacco lobby and made the right call on Syria. There was no mention in the speech of Mr Cameron's coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats.Explaining what he believes has gone wrong with the economy under the coalition, he said: "Too many of the jobs we're creating in this country are just too low paid, too many of the gains in our economy are just scooped up by the privileged few, including those big bonuses, and too often you are left being charged over the odds."They used to say 'a rising tide lifts all boats'. Now the rising tide just seems to lift yachts."The Labour leader has used his week in Brighton to set out some of the policies on which he will fight the next election but saved what is likely to be one of the centrepieces of the manifesto for his big speech.He vowed to abolish energy watchdog Ofgem and replace it with a new regulatory regime that ensures customers get a "fair deal"."We will legislate for this in our first Queen's Speech and it will come into effect in 2017," the Labour leader told activists."But in the meantime I am not willing to just stand by. So the next Labour government will freeze gas and electricity prices until the start of 2017."Your bills will be frozen, benefitting millions of families and millions of businesses. That's what I mean by a government that fights for you, that's what I mean when I say: Britain can do better than this."The companies won't like it because it will cost them money. But they have been overcharging people for too long because of a market that doesn't work. It is time to reset the market."Labour says the energy giants have been overcharging customers to the tune of £3.9bn since 2010 by not passing on reductions in wholesale prices to consumers.The party denies that the policy is a return to discredited "price controls" of the 1970s, arguing it is a temporary measure aimed at helping consumers while the party sets up a new regulator, which would force firms to openly sell their wholesale energy in a pooled market.But RWE npower, one of the big six energy firms targeted by Labour, criticised what it said were "easy", "simple solutions"."In reality, there are three main factors that influence prices - fixing inefficient housing stock, the investment required to replace the UK's energy infrastructure, and the cost of the buying energy on the global market," said chief executive Paul Massara.Another firm, SSE, said bills were rising because of "well-intentioned" government initiatives, not fuel costs.Chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said: "Instead of price freezes which will lead to unsustainable loss-making retail businesses, the Labour Party should put policy costs into general taxation, taking them off energy bills."Angela Knight, of industry body Energy UK, said freezing prices could hit the sector, making "energy shortages a reality, pushing up the prices for everyone".In his speech Mr Miliband also pledged to help small firms by freezing business rates in England, paid for by halting a planned increase in UK-wide corporation tax for large companies.And he said that by 2020 under Labour 200,000 houses would be built a year, with a fresh generation of new towns and "garden cities".An incoming Labour government would also scrap the £1,3bn Energy Companies Obligation, launched earlier this year to make the energy giants improve efficiency, and replace it with a more "cost-effective" regime.Unite union general secretary Len McCluskey said he was "pleased" with some of the issues raised by Mr Miliband."The most important thing was he highlighted the problems with the minimum wage and low pay and that fact that wage depression is something that needs to be tackled," he added.But John Longworth, from the British Chambers of Commerce, said talking about "controlling prices and wages sends a very bad signal" to businesses.John Cridland, from the CBI, said the plan "will deter much-needed investment" and would be viewed by business as "a setback for Labour's pro-enterprise credentials".Every Labour activist in the hall was given a copy of a book called One Nation Economy after the leader's speech.</body>

      <title>We must stay in government - Clegg</title>
      <description>The Lib Dems must be part of a coalition government after the next election to stop the Tories or Labour "messing up", Nick Clegg tells his party conference.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24137394</url>
      <date>1379527774</date>
      <body>Nick Clegg has urged the British people to put the Liberal Democrats back in government in 2015 to curb the excesses of the Tories or Labour."We are the only party that can finish the job of economic recovery, but finish it fairly," he told the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow.After three years of coalition Britain was now a "step closer" to the death of single party government, he claimed.He also spoke at length about his family and personal values.The BBC News Channel's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said Mr Clegg stuck to the argument he has been making all week - namely that coalition government works and the Lib Dems want another go at it.In a 51-minute speech aimed at preventing the Conservatives from claiming all the credit for the economic upturn, Mr Clegg said Lib Dem policies such as infrastructure spending and more apprenticeships had made all the difference."The big question mark that has always hung over the Liberal Democrats - could we handle government? And handle it when the going got tough? - that question mark is now gone."This recovery wouldn't be happening without us."He said Lib Dems had proved wrong the critics who said coalition would never work - but he also looked ahead to the next election, saying that "left to their own devices" Labour or the Tories would "mess it up".Speaking openly about forming a power sharing deal with the two bigger parties - something he avoided doing before the last election - he said: "Labour would wreck the recovery. The Conservatives would give us the wrong kind of recovery."He listed a series of Conservative policies which he claimed the Lib Dems had blocked, including "inheritance tax cuts for millionaires, profit-making in schools, firing workers at will, regional pay for public sector workers, scrapping housing benefit for young people, ditching the human rights act and closing down the debate on Trident".But he stressed that the Lib Dems were "no-one's little brother", adding: "We have our own values and beliefs."The speech contained no new policies, following Tuesday's headline-grabbing announcement on free lunches for all children in their first three years at school in England.Saying Lib Dems would extend the scheme to all primary school children, he said: "Their (the Conservatives) priority is to help some families over others, with a tax break for married couples."That tells you everything you need to know about their values."By contrast, he said his party was helping "young children get the best possible start in life, and that tells you everything about ours".The Lib Dem leadership have seen off challenges from activists to its nuclear weapons and economic policies, although delegates voted for a review of housing benefit rules - what critics call the "bedroom tax".And he scoffed at suggestions that coalition was all about personal chemistry between the party leaders, saying any coalition depended on the result of the election.In what will be seen as a hint that he is thinking of stepping down after the next election, he told activists in Glasgow that he "will not be in politics forever".But he used the speech to set out how his liberal values came to be formed, his "privileged" childhood and his "internationalist" outlook.He said the Lib Dems had always backed "home rule" for Scotland but would be urging a "no" vote in next year's independence referendum to keep the UK together.But he hoped the cross-party consensus would continue after the referendum to push for "the next advance in Scottish devolution".And he said the Lib Dems would be the party of "in" when it came to an EU referendum.Summing up what his pitch would be at the next election, he said: "In the past the Liberal Democrats would eke out an existence on the margins of British politics."Now we hold the liberal centre while our opponents head left and right. I have spent my entire life watching the other two mess it up. We cannot stand idly by and let them do it all over again."Lib Dem colleagues praised Mr Clegg's "intensely personal speech" but Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman said that, far from restraining the Conservatives, the Lib Dems had backed them all the way."He didn't mention the million young people out of work on his watch, the tax cuts for millionaires his party helped to introduce, or the cost of living crisis that means that since he became deputy prime minister wages are down an average of £1,500 a year," she added."Nothing he said today made any difference to the fact that Nick Clegg is propping up a Tory-led government that's making things worse for ordinary families."</body>

      <title>We want Britain back, says Farage</title>
      <description>UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage calls for an immediate EU exit, telling his party's conference the UK could go it alone.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24163335</url>
      <date>1379689172</date>
      <body>Britain would flourish outside the EU, Nigel Farage has said, predicting UKIP will cause a "political earthquake" in European elections next year.Addressing the party's annual conference, he said leaving the union would "open a door to the world".He described his party as the "true Europeans" as he claimed credit for shifting the terms of the debate on immigration and holding a referendum.But the speech was overshadowed by a row over remarks by MEP Godfrey Bloom.Mr Bloom has had the whip removed after he referred to a group of female activists as "sluts" - although he maintained that it was meant and taken as a joke.UKIP has reached unprecedented heights in the opinion polls under Mr Farage, coming second in the European elections in 2009 and winning hundreds of seats in the May local elections.Mr Farage has refused to predict how the party's Westminster candidates would fare in an election in 2015 but said he wants to turn the next European elections "into a referendum on EU membership"."My ambition and my conviction is that we can come first across the United Kingdom," he told activists."Let us send an earthquake through Westminster politics and let's say we want our country back."The party has sought to broaden its appeal beyond its core message of EU withdrawal, announcing policies in recent days on energy and welfare.But, in a speech dominated by Europe, Mr Farage said the European Commission had "hijacked" the EU's original ideals and the UK would begin a process of "national renewal" by going its own way.Those who warn that British trade would be harmed by a UK exit were the "true voices of Little England", he told party members."Those 10,000 trucks a day coming in from the Continent bringing goods into this country. They won't stop coming," he said."The idea that the EU will start a trade war with Britain is simply not credible. The real reason the EU won't be able or willing to stop trading with us is that the German car industry won't allow it."UKIP was growing in strength and, by the time of the next election, Mr Farage said it would be the third largest party in the country in terms of membership, overtaking the Liberal Democrats.The party is meeting just days after one of its former deputy leaders quit the organisation, frustrated by what he had described as its "totalitarian" leadership.Mike Nattrass, West Midlands MEP and a member for 15 years, accused Mr Farage of silencing dissent and surrounding himself with "cronies".But Mr Farage, by far the party's best-known figure, outlined his popularity with voters, saying in his speech: "They are fed up to the back teeth with the cardboard cut-out careerists in Westminster, the spot-the-difference politicians... the politicians who daren't say what they really mean."While there was no mention of the members who quit in protest at his leadership, he acknowledged internal clashes.Mr Farage told party members he had a "blistering row" with Godfrey Bloom, the UKIP MEP who courted controversy recently by claiming British foreign aid goes to "bongo-bongo land".Alluding to the comments, he referred to "public pronouncements that I would not always choose myself" and urged those with passionate views to focus on the "big messages".Immigration was the "biggest single issue facing" the UK, he said, as he warned of an "even darker side to the opening of the door".He claimed London had been gripped by a "Romanian crime wave"."This gets to the heart of immigration," he said. "We should not be opening our doors on 1 January to Romanian criminal gangs."The "Establishment" had dismissed anyone wanting to debate immigration as "bad and racist", he claimed.UKIP gained 16.5% of the popular vote, second only to the Conservatives, in the 2009 European elections and returned 13 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs).But, at the 2010 general election, support dwindled to 3.1% and UKIP did not win a Westminster seat.Earlier on Friday, the party's energy spokesman Roger Helmer announced it would invest profits from shale gas extraction in a sovereign wealth fund.The two-day conference is also set to discuss plans to ensure migrants have private health insurance and for social housing to be prioritised for people whose parents or grandparents were born locally.</body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: 2013 Party conferences</title>
      <description>A guide to what goes on at the political parties' autumn conferences.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24052129</url>
      <date>1379521029</date>
      <body>The autumn political party conference season is upon us. Here is our guide to them.What are party conferences?They are annual events where MPs, local councillors and ordinary party members gather to hear speeches, debate policy and socialise with like-minded souls.Why do they have them?Party conferences used to be all about policy debates and votes on the conference floor. These days the emphasis is more on big set piece speeches and policy announcements. It is a chance for the party leadership to dominate news coverage for a few days and boost the morale of their supporters. Or, if it doesn't go to plan, fend off leadership challenges and plots. There have been proposals over the years to reduce them in size, or only hold them in the year before an election, but they are popular with the membership and a useful source of income for cash-strapped parties.So what actually happens?They are four or five day festivals of democracy. Like Glastonbury for political obsessives. At any one time there will be dozens of speeches and debates taking place - some in the main hall in the full glare of the TV cameras, but many more in stuffy hotel conference rooms and lecture theatres on the conference "fringe". The whole thing takes place within a security cordon, giving it a slightly unreal atmosphere. There is also a thriving social scene based around the bars and restaurants of the main conference hotels. Drinks receptions and dinners go on late into the night. It is the only chance grassroots members get to rub shoulders with the big names at the top of their party.Where are this year's big three conferences?The Liberal Democrats were first up, gathering in Glasgow for five days from Saturday, 14 September. Labour start their four day event on Sunday, 22 September, in Brighton. The Conservatives meet for four days from Sunday, 29 September in Manchester.Who goes to them?It is more than just politicians and party members. At each conference there is a large exhibition hall where businesses, charities, local authorities and other groups hire stalls in the hope of catching the attention of a passing decision maker. There are also mini-shopping malls, with book, food and even clothes shops. Hundreds of journalists also attend, from the Westminster press pack to local paper and trade journalists and bloggers. The big party conferences also attract visiting dignitaries from abroad and the occasional TV celebrity.Can anyone attend?No. Security is very tight and you must apply weeks in advance for a pass.How big are the events?Huge. Conservative and Labour conferences regularly attract upwards of 10,000 attendees while the Lib Dems have seen a big jump in attendance since they entered government in 2010.Aren't they normally at the seaside?They used to be. But the trend now is to hold them in one of Britain's major metropolitan cities. However, Brighton came back on to the roster in 2012 after a couple of years' absence.What difference can the conferences make?The days when conferences decided what went in the next general election manifesto are, for the most part, gone, although the amount of say ordinary members get varies between parties. Labour and the Lib Dems still hold votes on policy motions. For the big parties it is largely all about media coverage but a conference speech can still make or break a party leader or act as a springboard to a fledgling career. With so many journalists and politicians in close proximity they are also a great chance to plot and often set the tone for the next few months at Westminster.What's particularly on the agenda this year?With a general election less than two years away, the talk will be all about winning votes in 2015. Labour leader Ed Miliband is under pressure to unveil the results of a long-awaited policy review and will also be keen to prepare the ground for a special conference next year to debate his trade union reforms. The Lib Dems and Tories were expected to announce new government policies to prove the coalition has not run out of steam - but,as seen with the Lib Dems, they have also begun the process of uncoupling themselves in the minds of voters by setting out a few of their own distinctive policies.What about other parties' conferences?The UK Independence Party meets at the Westminster Central Hall, in London, for two days starting on Friday, 20 September. Plaid Cymru meets in Aberystwyth for two days, from Friday, 11 October. The Scottish National Party's annual conference is from 17 to 20 October in Perth. The Green Party of England and Wales conference was the first, being held for two days from Friday 13 September.</body>

      <title>Crime agency block 'burdens police'</title>
      <description>The fact a new UK-wide policing agency has only limited powers in Northern Ireland, places an extra burden on the PSNI, the justice minister says.</description>

      <date>1381133905</date>
      <body>The fact a new UK-wide policing agency has only limited powers in Northern Ireland, places an extra burden on the PSNI, the justice minister has said.The National Crime Agency (NCA), which comes into operation on Monday, will not operate in Northern Ireland in the same way as the rest of the UK.Sinn Féin and the SDLP blocked a move to give it powers to carry out police operations and recruit agents.Justice Minister David Ford said blocking the legislation was a mistake."I haven't lost hope that we will get full political agreement, that we will be able to see the NCA operational and discussions are ongoing to see if we can get that political agreement," Mr Ford said."In the meantime, the key problem is that in certain issues like child exploitation, like human trafficking, like serious organised crime which is operating in the devolved area, there will be no powers for the NCA and this will place an additional burden on the PSNI."Mr Ford said the PSNI was already facing pressure with the threat from dissident republicans and loyalist street violence."In the face of that the police do not need extra burdens placed on them when there's a fully equipped national agency able to carry out those duties," he said."I visited the Serious Organised Crime Agency last week and I know that some of their staff have already been diverted in support of operations in England and Wales because in effect there's less for them to do because the PSNI is having to take over issues here."Phil Gormley, deputy director of the National Crime Agency, said it was a disappointment that it would not have the same powers in Northern Ireland as in the rest of the UK."We're determined to do all that we can within the limitations placed upon us to better protect the people of Northern Ireland and cut serious and organised crime," he said."It is a disappointment on a professional level that we don't have the powers of constable and can't operate in quite the same way that we can in the rest of the UK."The principal difference is that the NCA officers won't have the powers of the constable and through that will have limited ability to deploy asset recovery powers. We will still have the ability to cover reserved and accepted matters including customs, immigration and national security."SDLP justice spokesman Alban Maginness said they were working to find a way where the NCA's operations would come under the jurisdiction of the PSNI chief constable."We fought long and hard to create the PSNI and we should not undermine its authority or that of the chief constable," he said."Given our history - the meddling and malign interference of British intelligence agencies in the past, particularly in relation to the RUC - it is little wonder that we have grave reservations."The NCA would want to run their own agents in Northern Ireland and conduct their own covert surveillance operations - we do not want that to happen."The NCA will target crime gangs across local, national and international borders.Its head is Keith Bristow.He will be directly accountable to Home Secretary Theresa May for the agency's actions - not to the chief constable of the PSNI, the Policing Board or the Police Ombudsman.Many of the policing powers being given to the NCA have been devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly; therefore it has to agree to give Westminster authority to exercise those powers.These include NCA officers being given:- the powers of a police constable in Northern Ireland;- the authority to carry out searches and make arrests;- the ability to conduct surveillance operations;- the ability to recruit and run informers and agents.The agency would also be responsible for recovering assets from criminals.However, Sinn Féin and the SDLP have refused to support the move - which means the powers will not be extended to Northern Ireland.The police are understood to share the justice minister's concerns about the potential implications of the decision.The PSNI has repeatedly warned that Northern Ireland is increasingly being targeted by international crime gangs operating on a global scale. They believe that cooperation with the NCA is essential.</body>

      <title>School maths results 'disappointing'</title>
      <description>"Disappointing" standards in maths among 14 to 16-year-olds in Wales must be tackled, says an education watchdog.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-24419852</url>
      <date>1381129541</date>
      <body>"Disappointing" standards in maths among 14 to 16-year-olds in Wales must be tackled, says an education watchdog.Estyn's report said maths was the lowest performing core subject at key stage four - when pupils work towards GCSEs - and the lowest in the UK.Last year the proportion of students in Wales achieving C grade and above at GCSE lagged well behind England.The Welsh government said the report had highlighted both successes and areas that could be improved.Estyn said schools must work hard to raise standards. It is due to publish its report on its website on Monday.Chief inspector Ann Keane said some employers were having to invest in numeracy skills training for school and college leavers."Many Welsh employers are concerned at the lack of mathematical skills demonstrated by employees," she said.The Estyn report by inspectors said there was a lack of support for the professional development of mathematics teachers.The findings and recommendations were drawn from visits to 18 secondary schools around Wales.The report recommended more support, advice and professional development opportunities should be provided for schools.It highlighted best practice at some schools such as Bishop Gore Comprehensive School in Swansea where it said 20% of pupils gained A* or A grades in GCSE maths in 2012.But the report found there was an 11 percentage point gap between England and Wales in the number of students getting a C grade and above last year.Its author Rob Davies told BBC Radio Wales: "Inspectors are noting that schools are setting their sights too low and and focusing too much on just doing enough to reach grade C and not stretching pupils enough."He pointed to various factors affecting results in Wales."I think there are question marks over whether key stage three [age 11-14] is preparing pupils suitably in Wales," he said."The inspectors have noted that pupils lack confidence in key aspects such as number work and algebra skills."They are the foundations of mathematics and they give pupils the skills to solve problems."Mr Davies said the weaker results were a combination of low expectations, poor teaching in some cases and the current set up of the GCSE, which allows schools not to enter pupils for higher grade material which Mr Davies said too many schools in Wales were doing.He also said too many weaker students were being entered early for the exam, and that there needed to be more consistency across Wales about networking between schools and sharing good practice.Last year the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) published a survey saying there was a "disconnect" between what employers needed and the basic skills of young job seekers.In July, the Welsh government revealed plans to introduce at least four new GCSE exams from September 2015, including two in numeracy and mathematics.It followed a qualifications review in Wales for pupils aged between 14 and 19 also affecting English language and Welsh exams.A Welsh government spokesperson said: "This report shows where we have been successful in developing mathematics in our schools at key stage four, and where we need to sharpen our performance."We welcome its findings and want to congratulate the schools highlighted in the report for their diligence and commitment to improving standards."We have clear evidence that, at an operational level, the best results in mathematics teaching at key stage four are achieved where schools and regional consortia work together, and where teachers have opportunities to share best practice and benefit from appropriate professional development and regular network opportunities."</body>

      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant?What has happened?Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning.Why the big deal about the speech?Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech.So what did Cameron say?Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech.What sorts of powers does the UK want back?The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK."Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders?The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK.So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU?David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market."What has been the reaction in the UK?Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement.Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party.The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts.What about the reaction around Europe?The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction.What about the reaction from business?A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".Where can I get more detail on the speech?If you click on the link below you can read the whole text, with key bits picked out and analysed by BBC expertsAnnotated transcipt: Key excerpts</body>

      <description>The details of Labour leader Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet following the recent reshuffle.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11494915</url>
      <date>1337253895</date>
      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his wide-ranging reshuffle.The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction.Launched a two year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. Faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to phone hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire.The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton.As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later became schools secretary and narrowly held onto his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper.Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children.The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign.Best known for his stunning victory over Michael Portillo - then Defence Secretary and potential future Tory leader - in the 1997 general election. Mr Twigg himself was ousted from Enfield Southgate by a Conservative in 2005, but returned to Parliament in 2010, parachuted into the very safe Labour seat of Liverpool West Derby. Served as minister for school standards under Tony Blair and shadow Foreign Office minister in Ed Miliband's first opposition front bench, he was the first openly gay MP in the Commons. In a previous life, he was head of the National Union of Students. The then 44-year-old was promoted to the shadow cabinet in October 2011.Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. Rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. Keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet, he returned to his previous love, health in 2011.Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development.Probably best known for leaving a note to his successor as chief secretary to the Treasury before the 2010 election saying "I'm afraid there is no money left". The then 39-year-old was forced to apologise, saying he did not want to appear "flippant" about the deficit. This was an uncharacteristic slip from someone who rose smoothly through the ministerial ranks after being elected in 2004, taking on the high-profile immigration brief after the foreign prisoners scandal in 2006. One of few senior Labour figures with a business background, he was a merchant banker before launching his own technology firm. Interests include half marathons, church architecture and astronomy.A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader.As the son of former Labour cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest.One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending, but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress.A Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign, he has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football.The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing". Like many leading female MPs, the former union worker entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide. Responsible for the controversial eco-town project as housing minister before becoming Europe minister in 2008. Supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011.One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. A keen chess player, she supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leaders of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.At a youthful 31, the MP for Leeds West was elected to Parliament in 2010 and appointed shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament.Sister of Angela but chose to support Ed Miliband in the leadership contest. Ms Eagle was a solicitor in Liverpool before entering Parliament in 1997. Held a series of ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including children's minister and equalities minister. Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player.When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before. The Wakefield MP worked for the European Parliament and in academia before entering Parliament in 2005. A keen Europhile, she is fluent in French and Italian. Worked as parliamentary private secretary to Andy Burnham but voted for David Miliband in the leadership contest.Former charity worker and chief executive of the Manchester Jewish Federation, Mr Lewis held a string of junior ministerial posts in the Labour government after becoming an MP in 1997 at the age of 31. He started out as a parliamentary private secretary to then trade secretary Stephen Byers, before going on to be an education minister, Treasury minister, health minister and international development minister. Most recently, he was minister of state at the Foreign Office. His previous shadow cabinet role was as culture spokesman in which he was a vocal campaigner on phone hacking.Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. But when that constituency was torn up in boundary changes she made the move to Westminster in 2010. Under her, Labour took back Glasgow East having lost it in a stunning by-election defeat by the SNP in 2008. In Holyrood, she held various posts, including Minister for Communities, overseeing the executive's flagship anti-social behaviour laws. Before entering politics she was a lecturer in community education. The then 52-year-old took up her first full shadow cabinet role in October 2011.The West Bromwich MP rose to prominence with his dogged pursuit of the phone-hacking issue, becoming the number one thorn in News International's side. He has used his position on the influential culture select committee - something he has maintained despite his party post - to grill newspaper representatives. He has also raised the matter time and again in the House of Commons, demanding more action from police and Parliament. Mr Watson was a defence minister under Tony Blair but resigned in 2006, calling for Mr Blair to step down. That personal stand saw him accused of conspiring with Gordon Brown. An avid Tweeter and blogger, the then 41-year-old returned to government when Mr Brown became PM as digital enhancement minister.Gordon Brown's former parliamentary aide, who previously attended shadow cabinet as a junior minister, became a full member as shadow Cabinet Office minister in Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle. The then 61-year-old MP for Hemsworth took on the role from Tessa Jowell.One of Labour's true stalwarts, Ms Jowell, born in 1947, held ministerial office throughout the Blair and Brown years, holding briefs in the health and education departments.

He supported Ed Miliband for the leadership and was given a role in his shadow team five months after entering the House, first as shadow Wales minister and then in the shadow Treasury team. This is his first shadow cabinet role.The MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted smoking cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip.The then 52-year-old was elected unopposed in a ballot for chief whip in 2010.

      <body>The long-term unemployed may have to undertake work placements in return for their benefits, under changes being unveiled by Chancellor George Osborne.From April 2014, people who are jobless after being on the work programme for two years will face three options - a community work placement; taking part in training; or visiting a job centre every day - or face losing benefits.Although the UK unemployment rate has fallen in recent months, the number of long-term unemployed has not fallen.How should long-term unemployment be tackled?Most would agree that people with the misfortune to be long-term unemployed need intensive, personalised help to get back into a job.International evidence shows that a full package of support and the right kind of work experience - ideally with pay and the prospect of a proper job at the end of it - is crucial.Forcing people into jobs at threat of financial sanction risks pushing them out of the system entirely and doesn't help them get a real job, which is not cost-effective.Neither can we ignore the extent of poor-quality jobs in the UK labour market. Getting on the ladder is vital but we need better and wider routes upwards out of poverty.There is nothing wrong with expecting the long-term unemployed to undertake work experience or an intensive job search, in fact it can really help.When done right, they give people the work habits and employability skills that employers are looking for.What's crucial is that schemes are designed to make people more likely to get a job, not less.Today's announcement builds on an earlier "mandatory work activity" pilot, which was found to have had no impact on future job prospects, only short-term breaks in JSA claims, and increased the numbers on disability benefit.Instead, drawing on the successful Future Jobs Fund, the government should guarantee a real job, created by the charitable sector and paid at the minimum wage, to anyone who has been out of work for a year.And insist that they take the job or lose their benefits - limiting the time someone can be unemployed.The social and economic consequences of long-term unemployment are well known.For individuals, it can mean detachment from the norms of work, skills losing currency and loss of confidence due to multiple knock-backs.Mechanisms that re-build labour market attachment are valuable but there is a need to recognise the multiple barriers faced, including the uneven geographic dispersion of work, which poses the challenge of economic regeneration.Long-term unemployment among young people is particularly problematic, and it is crucial that they receive interventions that help them to achieve traction in the labour market, which may include skills development as well as workplace experience.The longer someone is out of work the more challenging it becomes to find a job.Their skills and experience become out of date and their confidence is dented.Specialist help should kick in quickly, but currently the Work Programme is targeted at people who have been unemployed for a full 12 months.The benefits trap is also a real problem.People can be reluctant to take a temporary or part-time job even though it would be a great first step back into the workforce because they are worried that when it ends they might lose their benefits.Welfare reforms must tackle this perceived barrier.The government should tap into the expertise of professional recruiters.It's their job to have good relationships with employers and to understand their local labour markets.This can make them better placed than Jobcentre staff to provide advice about local opportunities.They can also give free, personal advice to jobseekers about how to perform well in interviews and how to make the most of themselves on their CVs.Very long-term unemployment (2+ years) is strongly cyclical, almost disappearing from 1998 to 2009, but has returned with the protracted period of poor economic performance.It is thus not a new phenomenon and a large range of policies have been tried before. We have a very good idea of what does and does not work.The effect of requiring people to go into work placements depends a lot on the quality of the work experience offered.They have three elements: first, some people leave benefits ahead of the required employment.This is called the deterrent effect and is stronger the more unpleasant and low paid (eg work for the dole) the placement is.Then, whilst on the placement, job search and job entry tend to fall off as the person's time is absorbed by working.Finally, the gaining of work experience raises job search success.This is stronger for high-quality job placement in terms of the experience gained and being with a regular employer who can give a good reference if the person has worked well.The net effect of many such programmes, including work for the dole, has often been little or even negative.But the best effects come where job search is actively required and supported when on a work placement, where the placement is with a regular employer rather than a "make work" scheme and where the placement provider is incentivised to care about the employment outcomes of the unemployed person after the work placement ends.Long-term unemployment is a major problem for many jobseekers, as those who have been out of work for a long time can lose confidence and feel that they have become unattractive to employers.George Osborne does sound as though he is unfairly trying to shift the onus onto the unemployed, when the government aren't really doing enough to generate new jobs.Despite this, the work placements outlined should help the long-term unemployed in theory, by giving them the chance to develop work-related skills and so on.The most important thing for those out of work is the development of new skills and experience, whether this is through work placements, free courses or taking on new responsibilities, along with maintaining their confidence and believing in their ability to get a job.</body>

      <title>EU law and budget: a video guide</title>
      <description>Matthew Price explains EU laws and budget</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23782683</url>
      <date>1377100903</date>
      <body>The EU has a reputation for being slow and cumbersome - largely because of the difficulty of getting agreement among 28 member states with different languages and traditions.Here BBC Europe correspondent Matthew Price gives a video guide to the complex bargaining that results in new EU laws and the EU budget.The right to initiate legislation in the EU belongs to the European Commission - the union's civil service and rule-enforcer.Usually Commission proposals go through many amendments before becoming law - a process that takes years.In most policy areas the Council of Ministers - representing EU governments - and the European Parliament reach joint decisions through negotiation. Their role is called "the ordinary legislative procedure". During their negotiations they come under pressure from lobby groups, for example industrial firms or environmentalists.Often EU laws arise because national governments and MEPs tell the Commission that there is a need for them. Public consultations, scientific research and impact assessments also feed into the legislation.Once a measure becomes EU law the member states have two years to adopt it nationally - "transpose" it, in the jargon. The Commission can fine them for failure to do so.The budget is one of the most contentious policy areas among the member states, whose priorities differ greatly. The 2013 EU budget is 132.8bn euros (£113bn; $178bn).The size of the budget has to be decided annually, but there is also a seven-year budget framework, agreed in advance so that money can be set aside for long-term projects.This year for the first time EU leaders agreed to cut the multi-year budget (for 2014-2020), under pressure from the UK and some other countries, including the Netherlands and Sweden.The eurozone crisis has exacerbated tensions in the budget negotiations. Net contributors to the budget - the richer countries including the UK - argue that it should reflect the tough austerity policies adopted nationally. But net beneficiaries, such as the new member states in Central and Eastern Europe, oppose EU cuts to key areas like agriculture and infrastructure projects.EU spending is a small fraction of what the national governments spend in total, but those governments have to pay for big public sector areas like education and health, which are largely outside the EU's remit.</body>

      <description>A six-week pilot cull of thousands of badgers in west Somerset is believed to have ended.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-24425842</url>
      <date>1381132471</date>
      <body>A six-week cull of badgers in west Somerset is believed to have ended.The controversial pilot, which has been heavily fought by campaigners, was overseen by Defra in an attempt to stop the spread of TB in cattle.A similar pilot in west Gloucestershire is thought to still be under way. Marksman in both counties are aiming to kill a total of 5,000 badgers.Defra has refused to comment on the success of the cull and neither it nor the NFU could confirm it has ended.Jay Tiernan, spokesman for Stop the Cull, said protesters had "totally destroyed" the pilot.Every night for six weeks, volunteers held patrols of both cull zones to monitor badger setts and worked to disrupt the marksman from shooting.Avon and Somerset Police said just three arrests had been made during the six-week period. In Gloucestershire, 18 people were arrested.Mr Tiernan highlighted the campaigners' two main problems with the cull."The methodology isn't sound, he said."There's a group of badgers, you start shooting them and they disperse. Secondly the shooters can't get at the badgers to shoot them because we're there."The government licensed the shooting to test whether culling can be carried out in a safe, humane and effective way.It will analyse the results from both pilots to decide whether to extend the culling of badgers to other parts of the country.Supporters say it is the only way to eradicate the spread of TB to livestock.James Small, the Somerset chairman of the National Farmers' Union, said: "These are only two pilots and just represent a small step in trying to combat this disease, but I think there is a sense, at least, that a step has been taken."No details on the total number of badgers shot have yet been released despite requests from the BBC for details.</body>

      <title>MP claims 3p for 100m car trip</title>

      <date>1381072099</date>
      <body>Former cabinet minister Liam Fox successfully claimed 3p of taxpayers' money for a car journey of about 100 metres, expenses documents show.Mr Fox's office made the claim after he travelled a distance recorded as 0.06 miles in October 2012.He had visited a concrete firm before heading within his north Somerset base to a constituency surgery in Yatton.The ex-defence secretary made another 15 claims of under £1 for car travel approved in 2012-13, the files showed.These included 24p for a 0.54-mile journey from a constituency surgery to a school competition in Clevedon, and 44p for a 0.98-mile journey from a local politics event at Winford Manor to Winford School.Under the current system, MPs can claim 45p per mile.MPs claimed a total of £23m in personal expenses in the year to April.Paperwork from the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) shows Mr Fox claimed £3,866.31 in travel expenses - including rail fares - in the last financial year.The claim for the car journey to Yatton was paid last December, according to the notes.Mr Fox told the Sunday People: "I don't do my expenses. My office does them. But they are all done according to the rules for travel distances."Last year, the Conservative MP had to repay £3,000 of expenses after it was found he had allowed his friend Adam Werritty to live at his taxpayer-funded second home for a year rent-free.He was also criticised for allowing their Atlantic Bridge think tank to be run from his parliamentary offices.Mr Fox resigned from his cabinet position in October 2011 over his relationship with Mr Werritty.</body>

      <title>'Flying' care visits 'disgraceful'</title>
      <description>Short care visits mean disabled people must choose between staying thirsty or using the toilet, a charity warns, amid claims the practice is rising in England.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24424785</url>
      <date>1381128188</date>
      <body>Short care visits to elderly and disabled people are "disgraceful" and on the rise, a charity has claimed.In England, 60% of councils use 15-minute visits, which are not long enough to provide adequate care Leonard Cheshire Disability says.The charity says such visits can "force disabled people to choose whether to go thirsty or to go to the toilet".But care managers insisted some short visits could be "fully justified and fully adequate".Leonard Cheshire is pushing for a ban on what it calls the "scandal of flying 15-minute visits", lobbying the government to outlaw the practice in England.A report published by the charity said short visits "simply do not allow enough time to deliver good-quality care".It said data from 63 local authorities pointed to a 15% rise in such visits in the last five years, and said some in councils more than 75% of care visits were carried out in less than 15 minutes.Chief executive Clare Pelham said visits should be at least 30 minutes long."It is disgraceful to force disabled people to choose whether to go thirsty or to go to the toilet by providing care visits as short as 15 minutes long," she said.Ms Pelham said most people need 40 minutes to get up, washed, dressed and have breakfast."We are treating disabled and older people as if they are robots to be serviced, rather than real people who deserve to be treated with kindness and consideration," she added.But the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass), which represents care managers, argued it was "totally wrong" to suggest all caring tasks require more than 15 minutes.Sandie Keene, the association's president, said some short visits were "fully justified and fully adequate".It was "frankly naive to believe that simply by abolishing 15-minute slots a magic wand will have been waved, and improvements automatically achieved in our care services," she added."It doesn't work like that."Ms Keene said social workers and their managers had to make "horrendously difficult choices" every day to give the best possible care with limited resources.Leonard Cheshire wants peers to back a ban on short visits by amending the government's Care Bill when it is debated in the House of Lords on Wednesday.The Local Government Association (LGA), pointed to a "substantially underfunded" social care service which was putting councillors under increasing pressure."Significant cuts to council funding mean local authorities are struggling to meet the rising demand for home care visits," said Katie Hall, chairwoman of the LGA's community and wellbeing board.She said 15-minute visits "should never be the sole basis for care", but added: "In some circumstances such as administering medication they can be appropriate, but only as part of a wider comprehensive care plan involving longer one-to-one visits."Leonard Cheshire Disability said a survey of 2,025 people found 93% of those who expressed an opinion agreed 15 minutes was "not long enough to support a disabled or older person to do everyday things like wash, dress and get out of bed in the morning".</body>

      <title>'Nuclear implications' of power loss</title>
      <description>A loss of power for more than 90 minutes at Devonport Dockyard had potential nuclear implications, a Ministry of Defence report says.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-24421402</url>
      <date>1381079044</date>
      <body>A loss of power at a city dockyard had "potential nuclear implications", a Ministry of Defence (MoD) report said.The 90-minute power-loss, at Devonport in Plymouth, could have been "catastrophic", a nuclear analyst said.Caused by a central nuclear switchboard fault at the yard, it was the most potentially dangerous of 50 "events" recorded in 2012.The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) has now issued an improvement notice on the dockyard.Power is essential at the dockyard to ensure reactors on the nuclear submarines are kept cool.The incident, in July 2012, was regarded as code-B on the sliding scale of "severity" - code A being the most severe.John Large, an engineer and independent nuclear analyst, said: "The loss of power was a catastrophic event, which is what happened before the Fukushima meltdown."According to the improvement notice the dockyard, which is operated by Babcock Marine, has until 31 March 2014 to meet its own operating rules and instructions.No-one from the operating firm has been available for comment.However, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said it took all safety concerns "extremely seriously" and was aware of the ONR improvement notice.In a statement issued to BBC News, the MoD said it understood Babcock Marine had agreed an improvement programme with the ONR to "enable the identified issues to be addressed in a timely manner"."We will continue to work with Babcock Marine and safety regulators to ensure that safety is managed effectively across the wider Devonport site," a spokesperson said.The ONR said Devonport Royal Dockyard Limited had taken action to remedy some of the problems identified and it was satisfied there was "no immediate impact on safety", but it believed the improvement notice was "necessary".In the "site event" report for HM Naval Base Devonport, the MoD said 50 events in 2012 was higher number than the two previous years, but "broadly similar" to the number recorded in 2008 and 2009.The report said it was "reasonable" to expect a rise in the number of events as there had been a corresponding increase in the number of "submarine" days in specially-designed nuclear dockyard berths."With more routine and non-routine nuclear activity, it is reasonable to expect an associated increase in the number of events," the report said.The report said previously unidentified faults in standby diesel generators meant the secondary power source was unable to re-supply power for more than 90 minutes."Through a combination of factors and additional unidentified defects, this defect was revealed, and resulted in an event with potential nuclear implications," the report said.An earthquake and tsunami off the coast of Japan in March 2011 knocked out cooling systems to reactors at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, three of which melted down.Devonport resident Ian Avent, who is also the organiser of the Campaign Against Nuclear Storage and Radiation, described the loss of power as "scary".Oliver Colvile, the Conservative MP for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, said he was very concerned about the situation and intended to speak to Babcock Marine about the actions it was taking.He said he expected the "highest levels of safety" to be maintained at the dockyard.</body>

      <body>A hospital patient whose death has prompted a murder inquiry was a "really brilliant man", say neighbours.Police are investigating whether James May, 76, had been given a drugs overdose before he died at the James Paget Hospital, in Norfolk.A hospital worker was arrested on suspicion of murder on Saturday and has been bailed until November.Neighbours of Mr May, who died on 20 September, described the Great Yarmouth man as "humble and welcoming".Paying tribute to him, Matthew Palmer, 21, also said Mr May was a "good neighbour", "enthusiastic" and a "really brilliant man."Mr May, a retired driving instructor, moved to Great Yarmouth about 10 years ago from London, in search of a quieter pace of life.Diane Halliday, 67, also of Great Yarmouth, had known Mr May since he retired to the town and said he was a "genuinely nice chap"."It was so sad to think that he'd died, but to have all this [the investigation] as well is just unbelievable.""He could have had a good few more years left... it knocks you back a bit to think this could have happened... you can't take it all in."The James Paget University Hospital reported an allegation of medical malpractice in connection with Mr May's death, 10 days after the incident in September.Det Ch Insp Paul Durham, from the Norfolk and Suffolk Major Investigation Team, said: "We are investigating an allegation that a drugs overdose was administered to a patient, leading to his death."A Home Office post-mortem, carried out earlier this week, determined the cause of Mr May's death as heart failure and we now await the results of further toxicology tests which will help inform our inquiry."Mr May lived with his terrier-cross dog Polly and was a keen member of the Hemsby short mat bowls club.

      <body>Cutting the opening hours of police stations across Dorset could save around £500,000, the force has claimed.A savings review also proposes withdrawing some officers from manning front counters at stations.Chief Constable Debbie Simpson stressed "no final decisions" had been made about front desk staffing.Dorset's Police Federation chairman Clive Chamberlain fears people in rural areas will suffer if their services are cut.The force said its review identified station front desks as "an under-utilised resource" and claimed some in the county received just a few visits a day.Chief Con Simpson said: "We have to meet a very challenging budgetary situation and we are committed to providing the best possible service while reflecting true demand and value for money."The potential closure of police station desks does not mean the closure of the stations themselves."The force is trying to achieve budget savings of £10m by March 2015.The public is being asked to give its views on the proposals in a consultation.Police Federation chairman Mr Chamberlain urged people to make their views known on the issue."I don't think people would wish to see the withdrawal of police station counters or indeed the closure of stations," he said.Earlier this month, Dorset Police announced a four-month trial of out-sourcing the guarding of major crime scenes to private company Securitas.It said the move would allow officers to concentrate on front line services.Police and Crime Commissioner Martyn Underhill recently revealed the potential for securing sponsorship for the police and highlighted Dorset as the fourth lowest spending force in England and Wales.A Dorset Police survey last year showed 77% of people preferred to contact the force by phone, with 75% of those calls made to the non-emergency 101 number.Mr Chamberlain added: "So many counter services have already been withdrawn that people are forced to use other means of contact."If stations do close and are made unavailable, smaller communities in rural areas are likely to suffer, meaning people will have to travel further if they wish to speak to an officer."</body>

      <title>Local bank for Hampshire planned</title>
      <description>A group of finance experts is to set up a community bank in Hampshire aimed lending to local people and reinvigorating the county's economy.</description>

      <body>A group of finance experts is to set up a community bank in the hope of reinvigorating Hampshire's economy.Working together as Local First, a community interest group, they intend to set up a locally-owned and run bank for the benefit of local people.Eastleigh Borough Council has already said it would invest in the business, to be called Hampshire Community Bank.Depending on the level of customer deposits, the bank hopes to lend at least £100m in its first year.One of the Winchester-based team leading the project, banking expert Prof Richard Werner, said: "It's exactly what is missing in the UK banking landscape."The idea is, you gather deposits locally and you lend locally and I think people will like that."Banking is actually a highly profitable business and it is really a no-brainer for a local authority to invest in setting up a local bank."The group intends to raise £7m and hopes the government will match it to create a total £14m.Deposits up to £85,000 will be protected under the government protection scheme.Prof Werner's banking vision is shared by Local First colleague Mike Battersby, who has 25 years corporate finance experience with Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland.He said a local bank would be more in touch with the customers it serves."I would have about 50 customers and I got to know those businesses really, really well," he said."They would phone me up and say, 'Look, I've got a bit of a problem this month, I need an extra £25,000 for a couple of weeks, would that be okay?'"And I knew enough about what was going on in that business to say 'yes'."In addition to its lending pledge, Local First says the bank will also be able to undercut high street rivals, offering better interest rates.Mr Battersby added: "You will not be coming to work for our bank if you are expecting to walk away with a multimillion-pound bonus based on highly speculative leveraged lending which could go wrong."Eastleigh borough councillor Keith House said the regulatory process meant the council would not be able to begin funding the bank for at least another year.The bank itself must also undergo regulatory approval and Local First hopes it will be up and running in two years.</body>

      <body>A hot-air balloon pilot has landed in Norfolk to win the UK's oldest sporting trophy.Richard Parry, from Stroud, flew a total of 199 miles (321km) from Queen's Square in Bristol to a site near Great Yarmouth.Thirteen teams set off on Saturday to compete in the Queen's Cup balloon race. Pilots had to be on the ground to finish the race by 16:00 BST on Sunday.Mr Parry was presented with the Queen's Air Race Challenge Cup afterwards."This is a wonderful race which tests not only balloonist's long distance flying capabilities but also their tactical skill," said event director Don Cameron."Working out everything from air traffic, weather changes to refuelling and crew logistics it is, I suppose, similar to the Olympics but for hot-air balloon teams," he added.The Queen's Cup, which is made of Irish silver, was donated by The Queen to The Royal Aero Club of the United Kingdom in 2010.Since 2011, it has been awarded by the club to different air sport competitions.</body>

      <title>Morrison showing touches of 'genius'</title>
      <description>West Ham boss Sam Allardyce says he is starting to see the best of Ravel Morrison, describing his goal against Tottenham as "a bit of genius".</description>

      <date>1381088613</date>
      <body>West Ham manager Sam Allardyce said Ravel Morrison has "sorted himself out", describing his goal in a 3-0 win at Tottenham as "a bit of genius".Morrison, 20, joined West Ham last year after off-field problems hindered his progress at Manchester United.Allardyce said: "Sir Alex Ferguson told me 'I hope you sort him out because you will have a top-class player'."I'm not sure I've sorted him out, he's sorted himself out. He's begun to enjoy his football which he loves so much."The manager added: "He enjoys being with the lads and listens to what the experienced players say, and can do something that nobody else can do in our side and you saw that today."Attacking midfielder Morrison was called into the England Under-21 squad for the first time earlier this week and he crowned his international selection with a fine solo goal, running from his own half to take on the Spurs defence and chip goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.It was his fourth goal in eight appearances this term, which Allardyce also thought was "goal of the season" so far, and it lifted his side out of the bottom three.The victory came after Allardyce decided not to name any recognised strikers in his side, with Morrison the furthest forward.Morrison joined Manchester United as a schoolboy but only made three first-team appearances before moving to the Hammers in January 2012, spending last season on loan at Birmingham.In 2011, he was fined £600 by a court for throwing his girlfriend's mobile phone through a window during an argument and in 2008 was cautioned for common assault.Ferguson said at the time of his move to the capital: "In the case of Ravel it's been quite well documented. I think he's better out of Manchester."He's got a great talent but it's how to deal with it that is important."West Ham skipper Kevin Nolan revealed that even after Morrison arrived at West Ham, there were still problems with his conduct away from the pitch.And after praising Allardyce's tactics, Nolan told BBC Sport that the loan spell at Birmingham had made Morrison mature.Nolan, 31, said: "Ravel has been fantastic since he came back [to West Ham]. Last year we had a lot of problems with his lifestyle off the pitch as well as on it, but he went to Birmingham [on loan] and worked really hard, and got back in the team at the end of last season and it was like he was a new man. He is one now. He needs to stand up."Me and Mark Noble speak to him and have had big long chats with him all last season, we try to protect him and take him under our wing and we will continue to do that. Obviously we are going to be excited by his talent, it's frightening and I think if you ask anyone at Manchester United they will tell you the same."But it's about nurturing him and making sure he does the right things on and off the field - you are now starting to see the player that Manchester United saw in him when he was younger."Allardyce added: "He's learnt so much in a short period of time. That's the beauty. The penny has dropped."</body>

      <body>British number two Heather Watson's defence of her Japan Open title ended with a first-round defeat by Puerto Rica's Monica Puig in Osaka.Watson, 92nd in the world, has struggled in 2013 and lost 6-4 6-4 to Puig, who is 48th in the rankings.The 21-year-old's serve was under constant pressure and she was broken five times during the match.Watson overcame the Puig serve three times and was 3-1 up in the second set but ended up losing in 93 minutes.The victory for Watson at the Japan Open last year was her maiden title win and she moved up to number 39 in the rankings early in 2013.But a bout of glandular fever halted her progress and, since her return, she suffered first-round exits at the French Open, Wimbledon and US Open.She has also changed her coach but it has so far failed to produce an upturn in fortunes.</body>

      <title>FA do not have a clue - Redknapp</title>
      <description>Harry Redknapp says senior Football Association officials do not have the knowledge to choose the best England manager.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24425709</url>
      <date>1381133465</date>
      <body>Harry Redknapp says that Football Association senior officials do not have the knowledge required to choose the best England manager.The QPR boss was overlooked for the role when Roy Hodgson succeeded former coach Fabio Capello in May 2012."I wouldn't trust the FA to show me a good manager if their lives depended on it," he wrote in his autobiography, serialised in the Daily Mail. Redknapp, 66, says he holds no grudge against Hodgson after the decision.But he insists he was the leading choice with England fans and players, claiming senior players texted him to offer him their support."This isn't about them giving the England job to me or Roy Hodgson, but English football being run by people who really haven't got a clue - and they get to pick the England manager," he said."Everyone said I was the people's choice, the only choice. All the senior players seemed to be up for me to get the job."I got quite a few text messages at the time from players saying they would love me to manage England: Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand, John Terry."But the FA went for Roy Hodgson to be the England manager - a man who is more their cup of tea."Redknapp, who was manager of Tottenham when the decision was made, said he wanted Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers - then with Swansea City - to be his assistant."My thinking on Brendan was this: if he can do it with players from the lower leagues at Swansea what can he do with Rio and Terry or Rooney and Gerrard?" he added."So when Tottenham played Swansea on 1 April, 2012 I pulled Brendan after the game and said that if all the speculation about me and England was true would he consider coming to the European Championships in the summer as my part-time coach?"I told him I wanted England to play with as much technical ambition as Swansea. He was up for it."Some Tottenham fans might think I was distracted from my club job, but I can assure you the conversation took five minutes. And we beat Swansea 3-1 that day."Redknapp's side won just twice in 10 matches following Capello's resignation as Spurs failed to qualify for the Champions League.He was sacked in June 2012 before taking over at QPR the following November.</body>

      <body>A couple from Norfolk whose house was badly damaged in a fire caused by a faulty dishwasher said the blaze could "easily have been avoided".Marga Kampenaar and Derek Boughtflower, of Mulbarton, were rescued after their Bosch appliance caught fire in March.The couple, whose four dogs were killed, told BBC Inside Out they were aware their dishwasher was faulty but had not been told it was unsafe to use.Manufacturer BSH Homes Appliances said recall notices had been publicised.The Milton Keynes-based company said it had advertised the recall in newspapers, set up a dedicated website and there was also a TV report to alert people to the risk of fire.The couple said they heard their product had been recalled and phoned the company, which told them an engineer would visit in two weeks.The fire, on 28 March, happened days before the dishwasher was due to be repaired."The whole of the upstairs was filled with this black acrid thick smoke and you could not breathe," said Ms Kampenaar."I got to an open window and they [firefighters] put me out over the conservatory and you could hear it melting."We've since learnt that we had another couple of minutes and then they don't think they could have got us out."It is all so pointless, to have lost so much for something that could so easily have been avoided."BSH Homes Appliances said the fault concerned "a limited number" of dishwashers manufactured between 1999 and 2005 and that "800,000 letters were sent to potentially affected customers".In a statement they said: "It is our standard practice to advise customers at the point of booking the engineers they should not use the dishwasher unattended."Graham Crisp, from Suffolk Trading Standards, said there were "potentially millions" of faulty goods in homes as just 10 to 20% of recalled items were returned."The law could be more explicit in requiring a duration of the message because often a recall will go out and fizzle away after a few weeks," he said."The law could and should be changed to keep an onus on manufacturers to make sure messages are prominent and continuous."In the last six years there have been nearly 270 recalls of electrical goods.Barry Mulcahy, co-founder of not-for-profit website Recall UK, said manufacturers should be required to publicise the success rates of their recall campaigns."There were two recalls started about six months ago for tumble driers," said Mr Mulcahy."During that time one manufacturer has managed to find 88% of effective recalls and the other has only found 10%."The reason is they took completely different strategies on how to communicate that information."For more on this story, watch Inside Out East, Monday at 19:30 BST on BBC One</body>

      <title>Ace cafe with quite a nice ancient monument attached?</title>
      <description>Have historic sites become all about the cafe and gift shop?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24335517</url>
      <date>1381130932</date>
      <body>English Heritage has announced that it is building a £27m visitor centre at Stonehenge, with what looks like a very large eating area. Is the cafe and gift shop almost as important as the attraction itself these days?Almost 50% of the shiny new visitor centre at Stonehenge will be taken up with a new "bright and spacious" cafe for up to 260 people and a bigger shop.It almost harks back to a memorable ad campaign by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. In 1988, the museum commissioned a poster with the slogan: "Where else do they give you £100,000,000 worth of objets d'art free with every egg salad?"The poster was one of six, all describing the VandA as: "An ace caff, with quite a nice museum attached."It's a premise that won't surprise anyone who has visited a stately home or garden run by the National Trust recently. Some 19.2 million people made a trip last year. Many of those will have dutifully queued for a flapjack and a cup of tea. Or even a substantial meal.Food writer Giles Coren recalls visiting London Zoo as a child and caring more about the gift shop than the animals: "Thousands of school children, coachloads of them have to visit these places, and all they care about is the shop."He associates past visits to stately homes with rock-hard scones but thinks for many people it's increasingly all about the food. "It's like the Colosseum in Rome, people go all that way to see it only to discover it's a lot of boring old stones, but at least you can get an excellent pizza."Visitors now demand a nice place to eat, having put up with poor facilities for far too long, Coren suggests. "Everything in Britain has been rubbish for years and people won't put up with it anymore."There is scepticism among some about the new generation of visitor centres.TripAdvisor is full of reviews from people who are unimpressed. One reviewer was very upset when changes were made at a cathedral in East Anglia. "I love this cathedral, have been taking visitors to it for over 20 years… but it was so much nicer when you could walk in at the front. Now you have to go through a new visitors' centre, which adds nothing to your experience of visiting the cathedral, but does direct you past a desk for collecting your 'optional' entrance fee."Another visitor to a major modern art museum in London recalled: "We ordered their vegetable soup - a small bowl with watery soup containing some vegetables and a small hard roll (and we had to ask for some butter!) - 6.50 each! For us that's a rip-off and we were not impressed."But generally the trend is for the cafes in museums, galleries and castles to get better and better. And those in the heritage business see them as a happy synergy."A good shop and cafe greatly enhance the overall experience," says Matthew Tanner, chairman of the Association of Independent Museums. "No visit is complete without an interesting shop, a fine cup of tea, and not forgetting a good loo too."The argument for spending money on an extensive cafe is twofold - visitors have come to expect them, and the revenue raised helps subsidise the attraction.One place where this takes place is RHS Wisley in Surrey where the gift shop and cafe are the gatekeepers to the gardens people come to see. Nigel Eaton manages the shop and says it is part of the whole experience."We've got three kinds of customers - we have the RHS members who visit on a regular basis, the gardeners who come just for the plants and then we've got what we call the payers, who come on coaches for a nice day out. Every penny that is spent in the shop goes back into the RHS, so the shop is very important to us."Some 1.1 million people visit Wisley every year. The results of a customer survey revealed that 22% of those visitors came just for the "retail experience". Last year the shop - including one of the world's biggest gardening bookshops - made £3.8m and they expect to make an even bigger profit this year.As a Lonely Planet author, David Else has visited a lot of tourist attractions and has no problem with visitor centres. In fact he rather likes them."In the case of Stonehenge, a good visitor centre is going to tell you so much more about the history of what is essentially a group of old stones. I've got no problem with cafes, either - I like a good cup of tea after a visit and don't mind if they want to make a few bob to help preserve the site."In the heritage and art business it's all about making attractions "sustainable".Getting the shop and cafe right at an attraction is a win-win situation, says Jane Temperley from the Association for Cultural Enterprises. "Sure it is about generating income - everyone is looking at how to make their sites more sustainable. But research says visitors enjoy cafes and shops, happy visitors spend more and tend to become repeat visitors or members, which generates more income."About 80% of visitors to Wisley are RHS members so they come back to visit time and time again. Thirty-two staff work in the Wisley Shop and 60 staff work in the cafes and restaurants - that's over 25% of the total site staff of 350.And the staff at attraction are at pains to point out that the food has got better and better. Laurent Trenga is the chef responsible for the planning of menus at Wisley. He points out that a burger and chips at Wisley is no ordinary burger and chips. "Our burger is made from locally sourced quality pork and apples grown in our own orchards, even the bun is made fresh on site."The plants are rather nice too.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Statue plans for author scaled down</title>
      <description>Memorial for author Alan Sillitoe hit by fundraising difficulties</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-24369101</url>
      <date>1381056929</date>
      <body>Plans for a memorial in Nottingham to late author Alan Sillitoe have been scaled down because of difficulties in raising the money.A life-size statue of the Saturday Night and Sunday Morning writer was proposed in October 2010 and would have cost about £80,000.David Sillitoe, the novelist's son, said however, the expense has left the project unfeasible.Mr Sillitoe said a bust of his father had been planned instead.The Alan Sillitoe Statue Fund was set up following the death of the writer in April 2010.Sillitoe, who also penned The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, was born in the Lenton Abbey area of Nottingham, in 1928.The memorial was originally planned for his birthplace, but Old Market Square in the city centre later became its preferred location.David Sillitoe, who is on the committee, said: "We wanted to raise enough money to make a permanent memorial in Nottingham to Alan, [and] the obvious thing was a statue."[But] we had to measure our and other people's expectations and it's proven very hard to get that kind of money."The more we thought about it the less feasible the statue project was proving to be and that's why we moved sideways to the bust on a plinth."The group are still short of the money required, and a location for the bust has yet to be decided, he added.During the last three years an undisclosed amount of money has been collected through special events celebrating Sillitoe's life and work.Money through other sources has also been sought, and according to the fund the city council has pledged to support the tribute at the right time.However, Mr Sillitoe said he was disappointed the Arctic Monkeys, who are fans of his father's work, had not contributed.The band used a line uttered by anti-hero Arthur Seaton in the 1958 novel Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, for the title of their debut album - Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not.Mr Sillitoe said: "The Arctic Monkeys haven't been any help and of course they took, for the title of that album, one of Alan's immortal lines, so we'd like to hear from them."[Alan Sillitoe] was acknowledged as an influence and I'm not necessarily saying there's a quid pro quo (this for that), but we contacted the management and in the great tradition of rock and roll their offer of help was to send us a CD, which never arrived."Despite attempts to contact the band's management, the BBC has been unable to get a comment.Nottingham's last high-profile statue was for the late Brian Clough, which was unveiled in the Old Market Square, in 2008, after £70,000 was raised by volunteers within 18 months."They worked really hard to get the money," said Mr Sillitoe. "It was a great piece of fundraising."We're doing our best and we're grateful for anything. We're not asking for a lot [but] we need a leg up."</body>

      <body>From a busy junction at Stratford High Street in East London, there is a great view of a symbol of one of the UK's most glittering recent successes - the Olympic Park - and the modern station created to go with it.And close by is an unusual school which is striving to bring together the old and the new traditions of England - much like the spectacular opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics.The London Academy of Excellence is a government-funded sixth-form serving the East End of the capital which is trying to bridge the gap between private and state schools.It opened its doors as London basked in the glow of the Olympics last year.In an unusual partnership, pupils there share lessons, sport and teachers with a local community school and several independent fee-paying schools including Eton, Brighton College and Highgate.It is easy to miss the London Academy of Excellence. Its modern building looks like any other shiny office block, perched on the edge of a busy road.It is as far from the green playing fields and quads of Eton and Brighton College as you could imagine - but pupils at these and the other schools involved are sharing more than lessons and aspirations.Through a buddy system, they are getting to know each other during visits and getting a window on each other's lives.Yousef, 17, was one of the first group of sixth-formers to join the academy."I was attracted by the links with Eton and the other schools," he said."This has built a bridge between us and independent schools. It's taught us a lot. It's illustrated that we have far more in common than difference."I get to visit Eton House boys with tailcoats. That was a bit of an experience, out of the ordinary, but behind that we saw a lot of similarities between us."Do the teenagers feel envious when they see the very different surroundings of pupils at the other schools?Curtis, 17, says no."One buddy took us on a tour and I studied a lesson of history with them. There was a similar-sized classroom, a similar way of teaching and talking. I felt at home there," he said."I did not feel envious. I am not that kind of individual. But who would not want to study at Eton?"Some of the sixth-formers say they feel lucky, because they do not have to pay for their education."We have this free. They are paying vast amounts to go to a college similar to ours", says Clinton.Ellie says the students at the other schools seemed really pleased to meet them."They were just as interested in us as we were in them. My buddy was asking so many questions about what we do."Most of their education takes place in the bright modern, business-like surroundings of their academy, in a converted office block.Their "uniform" is a "smart, professional dress code".The walls are white, the furniture bright. Big bold canvases with faces of famous intellectuals, scientists, artists and writers decorate the walls, dotted with their words of inspiration.In front of one of them is the academy's headmaster Robert Wilne, an energetic man, who bubbles over with enthusiasm for his pupils' success, their futures - and the aims of this experimental school."There are many schools doing interesting partnerships," he said."But this is a third way for independent schools, aside from giving bursaries or sponsoring academies."It is an experiment. I would love another city to look at it."It's a genuine, deep-seated partnership between eight schools that are woven in to the DNA of this academy."It's not window dressing or surface gloss."It is an experiment praised by the head of England's schools inspectorate Sir Michael Wilshaw, who in the summer accused many independent schools of living in "splendid isolation" from the state sector.He drew criticism from some in the private school sector this week too, for saying some schools' links with state schools were small, like crumbs from their tables.Some responded angrily, saying that their schools saved taxpayers money by educating children outside of the state sector.Both Labour and coalition governments have called for more links between private and state sector schools.All the academy's funding is from the government, says Mr Wilne and there is no direct funding from private schools.But there is support "in kind" and through links. Some of the governors are from the independent schools in the partnership."We draw on their various expertise and resources," says the headmaster."So if I want a scheme of work [curriculum plan] for maths, I go to to Highgate and ask for that. The head of economics at Brighton College is de facto head of economics here."They have been down and given feedback and mentoring support."Mr Wilne hopes the school will help social mobility."Education is the fuel of social mobility, education changes lives," he says."This 360 degree education we are offering here should fuel that mobility. Students will get the grades that will unlock doors to top universities and they are taking up extra-curricular activities and sports."They are interested in meeting others and they are not going to be daunted by meeting Etonians in the future."Sport, it seems, has also proved to be a good ice-breaker between students at the various schools."We enjoy visiting them as much as the sport," says Yousef.Curtis says he is enjoying trying out new sports."There is so much sport available. We do rowing. In my secondary school, we did rowing on a rowing machine, now we get to go on the water."With the first full exam season under its belt, the academy is now into its second year. The pioneer year looks to be a hard act to follow, having achieved 70% of their AS-levels at grades of A or B.Three students, including Ellie, spent part of the summer in the USA on a summer school after being encouraged to apply."I always wanted to go to university but did not aspire to the top ones," she said.The students say the school has widened their horizons, with encouragement to do so often coming in the shape of one of the many emails pumped out by their headmaster telling them of various opportunities."I get worried if I don't get an email from the head," one teenager says.They are getting help with their university applications and personal statements from one of the visiting teachers from the private sector.Student Harmanpreet says: "Our old head was always saying it's not about where you come from but where you are going."We know we are from a deprived area but LAE has shown us where we want to go."</body>
