      <description>Kenya's military names four men shown in new CCTV footage who it says were killed as they took part in the Nairobi mall attack last month.</description>

      <body>Four men believed to have been involved in the deadly shopping centre attack in Nairobi last month have been named.The Kenyan military said Abu Baara al-Sudani, Omar Nabhan, Khattab al-Kene and Umayr - shown in new CCTV footage - were killed during the standoff.Kenya said previously 10-15 militants had been involved, but the police chief says the figure may now be four to six.The al-Shabab group said it carried out the attack on the Westgate mall on 21 September, leaving at least 67 dead.The al-Qaeda-linked group said the attack was in retaliation for Kenya's military involvement in Somalia.The naming of the men came as CCTV footage was aired showing four attackers calmly walking through a room in the mall holding machine guns.Kenya Defence Forces spokesman Maj Emmanuel Chirchir told Reuters news agency: "I confirm these were the terrorists; they all died in the raid."Reuters quoted Maj Chirchir as saying that al-Sudani was an "experienced fighter" from Sudan and was believed to be the leader of the group.Maj Chirchir said Nabhan was a Kenyan of Arab origin and al-Kene a Somali linked to al-Shabab. Further details about Umayr had not yet been verified, he said.A Kenyan security analyst told the BBC that at least two of the names would be familiar to the Kenyan intelligence services.Kenyan police chief David Kimaiyo told Kenya's KTN television station it was now believed that four to six gunmen had carried out the attack, not 10 to 15."None of them managed to escape from the building after the attack," he said.Mr Kimaiyo also said that wanted British woman Samantha Lewthwaite had not been involved."We have also established that she was not part of the attackers in the building. There was no woman," he said.Ms Lewthwaite, 29, is the widow of one of the four suicide bombers who attacked London on 7 July 2005.Kenya had earlier said five attackers were killed in the security operation and that nine people were in custody.The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse in Nairobi says the latest CCTV footage is from a limited part of the complex and, with some eyewitnesses reporting a two-pronged attack, it is too early to say definitively how many gunmen were in the building.In addition to the 67 people killed in the attack, a further 39 are still missing, according to the Kenyan Red Cross.Al-Shabab is banned as a terrorist group by both the US and the UK and is believed to have between 7,000 and 9,000 fighters.Its members are fighting to create an Islamic state in Somalia.About 4,000 Kenyan troops were sent to Somalia in October 2011 to help pro-government forces end two decades of violence, with clan-based warlords and Islamist militants all battling for control of the country.On Saturday, Islamist fighters in southern Somalia said Western forces had launched a night-time raid on one of their bases.No-one has admitted the attack. US and French special forces have carried out raids in Somalia in recent years.It is not clear whether the raid was linked to Westgate.</body>

      <title>Union anger at health pay proposal</title>
      <description>Unions criticise government moves to halt a 1% pay rise for all NHS staff in England, arguing they deserve to be rewarded for holding the health service together.</description>

      <body>Unions have criticised government moves to halt a 1% pay rise for all NHS staff in England.The Department of Health said the increase was unaffordable alongside the current system which sees many staff automatically receive incremental annual rises.It has urged the NHS pay review body to withhold the rise for 1.3m staff.Rachael Maskell, of the Unite trade union, said staff deserved the pay reward for "holding the NHS together".Health trusts are currently under pressure to make savings and the NHS wage bill accounts for around 40% of its budget.All public sector pay increases are capped at 1%.The Department of Health (DoH) proposes using the funding intended for the rise to "modernise" pay structures.It says automatic increments - linked to length of service and satisfactory performance - add £900m to salary costs.The DoH has stressed no decisions on changes to pay have been taken, insisting independent bodies will make their recommendations in February or March next year.But the plans, outlined in the DoH's submission to two independent pay review bodies, have been criticised by Unite and Labour.Ms Maskell, of Unite, said: "The Department of Health have got other choices. They're entering into a reorganisation which is costing £3bn, which nobody asked for and isn't adding anything to patient care."It is about choices and the NHS staff have already had two years of a pay freeze - 1% last year - and, quite frankly, are really falling behind inflation now with their wages."Staff moraleShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme motivation and morale was down among frontline health workers "at this very difficult time".However, in its submission the DoH points to a staff survey suggesting high levels of motivation and morale and says there should only be basic pay increases if there is "strong evidence" recruitment, retention, morale or motivation issues require this.Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the NHS reorganisation had taken money out of front-line services."There has to be pay restraint in the NHS as well as other public services... but the NHS has been through some very difficult years - so have NHS staff - and this was a modest increase to recognise the pressure that all families are under."To take it away, to break that promise, is just another kick in the teeth."Staff representatives have also reacted angrily to the plans."What they have done is inflammatory," said Christina McAnea, head of health at Unison and joint chairwoman of the NHS Staff Council."We are not going to negotiate while a gun is held to our head for a paltry 1% pay rise - our members will not react well to that."Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association council said this would not result in staff leaving in their "droves".However he added: "We're going to find it increasingly hard to recruit, partly for the specialist skills and partly for the numbers of staff that we'd need to bring into the health service to implement the safe minimum staffing levels."Health minister Anna Soubry defended the government 's stance telling the BBC: "This is about making sure we pay our NHS staff well and we reward their improvement in skills."This system works in other public sectors and the private sector. People want to make sure that they are getting good quality, first class services especially at a time when the NHS faces challenges."Earlier a DoH spokeswoman said: "Many NHS staff have continued to receive pay rises of up to 3.5% and we want to keep working with the trade unions and employers on affordable pay."The measures we are proposing will help increase quality for patients and help us realise our vision of an affordable seven-day service."In June Chancellor George Osborne said ministers were working to "remove automatic pay rises" for teachers, health professionals, prison and police staff.The DoH drew attention to Mr Osborne's comments and confirmed it wanted NHS pay to have "stronger links to performance, quality and productivity".</body>

      <body>Prince Harry has begun his first official trip to Australia by joining centenary celebrations to mark its navy's arrival at Sydney Harbour.He was greeted by huge crowds as he embarked on survey ship HMAS Leeuwin at the city's Garden Island naval base, before inspecting the flotilla.The International Fleet Review involves some 40 warships from 17 countries.The event is the only scheduled public appearance for the prince, who is representing the Queen.A 100-gun salute marked the start of the celebrations, and Prince Harry was joined by Australia's Governor-General Quentin Bryce on board the Leeuwin to officially review the fleet.Some 16 tall ships and 8,000 sailors from around the world have been taking part in the event, with warships from countries including the US, China, France and India. Britain sent one of its largest ships, the Type 45 destroyer HMS Daring, to represent the Royal Navy.An estimated 1.4 million spectators were expected to line the banks of Sydney harbour for the celebrations, which finished with a light show and display involving 7.7 tonnes of fireworks.After the fleet review, Prince Harry posed for photographs with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, his wife Margie, and two of their three daughters, Frances and Bridget.The prince changed from his white army dress uniform to a grey suit and blue tie to meet the public and there were shouts of "give us a wave Harry" from the crowd.One spectator, Sinead Kirrane, 23, originally from Ireland, said: "He (Prince Harry) seems fun, I'm a big fan."We are excited to see him and maybe get a smile from him."Giving a speech to an audience that included disabled war veterans, Paralympians and young entrepreneurs, Mr Abbott broached Australian republicanism and said: "Prince Harry, I regret to say not every Australian is a monarchist."But today everyone feels like a monarchist today."You grace us as your family has graced our nation from its beginning, as the Crown is a symbol of our stability, continuity and decency in public life."The prince, whose short Australian tour features a one-day trip to Sydney ahead of a brief visit to the Western Australia capital of Perth on Sunday, is not the only British Harry causing excitement in the country.Singer Harry Styles is currently in Sydney with his band, One Direction.After he leaves Australia, Prince Harry will head to Dubai to attend a fundraising event for the aids charity, Sentebale.</body>

      <title>US defence staff to return to work</title>
      <description>Most of the 400,000 US defence department staff sent home amid a government shutdown are told to return to work after a legal interpretation.</description>

      <date>1381000015</date>
      <body>Most of the 400,000 US defence department staff sent home amid the US government shutdown have been told to return to work next week.Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said the decision was based on an interpretation of the Pay Our Military Act.A budget row between Republicans and Democrats has forced the closure of federal services for five days now.But the sides have now voted to approve back-pay for the 800,000 federal workers sent home without salaries.In a rare moment of bipartisan co-operation, the House of Representatives approved by 407-0 a bill to pay the federal workers once the shutdown ends.There remains no sign of any deal on the federal budget, however.The Republicans are demanding changes to President Barack Obama's healthcare law, but the Democrats insist there will be no such concessions.The Pay Our Military Act had been passed by Congress shortly before the shutdown.Mr Hagel said earlier in the week he wanted to find a way to get his civilian staff back to work.Secretary of State John Kerry on Saturday warned that any prolonged shutdown could affect the US internationally.But, speaking at a meeting of Asian leaders in Indonesia, he said any impact was "momentary" and Washington's commitment to the region was "undiminished".President Barack Obama cancelled his Asia visit because of the shutdown.In his weekly radio address, Mr Obama urged the Republicans to "end this farce".The next key deadline will be 17 October.Unless Congress agrees to raise the $16.7 trillion (£10.4 trillion) statutory borrowing limit by then, the US could default on its debts for the first time in its history.Mr Obama said: "For as reckless as a government shutdown is, an economic shutdown that comes with default would be dramatically worse."</body>

      <title>Row over Italy migrant boat deaths</title>
      <description>Italy's coast guard denies that it was slow to respond to the sinking of a boat carrying African migrants off the island of Lampedusa on Thursday.</description>

      <date>1380986585</date>
      <body>Italy's coast guard has denied that it was slow to respond to the sinking of a boat carrying African migrants off the island of Lampedusa on Thursday.The accusations were made by a fisherman who took part in the rescue and a local newspaper.So far, 111 bodies have been recovered, and 155 people survived, but about 200 are still unaccounted for.High winds have prevented divers from reaching the boat, restricting rescuers to an aerial search.France has called for an urgent meeting of EU states following the tragedy."European political officials must talk, and soon," said French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault."It is up to them to meet to find a proper solution; compassion is not enough."Tens of thousands of migrants attempt the perilous crossing from North Africa to Sicily and other Italian islands each year, and accidents are common - but this week's shipwreck was among the deadliest on record.The survivors are to be placed under investigation for "clandestine immigration", as provided for by a controversial immigration law pushed through by right-wing parties in 2002.Italy has said it will amend immigration laws and has called for European help.Italian members of parliament have complained that some of its provisions discourage people from helping migrants in distress.The fisherman who arrived first at the site of the accident, Vito Fiorino, has accused the coast guard of wasting time by filming footage of rescue efforts."They refused to take on board some people we'd already saved because they said protocol forbade it," he was quoted as saying by Ansa news agency.A report in local newspaper La Sicilia said two boats belonging to Italy's Financial Guard, which carries out a range of police and rescue duties, had remained in port.The coast guard denied that there was any delay in its rescue effort."After we received the alarm by radio at 07:00 we immediately intervened with out boats, arriving on at the site of the shipwreck at 07:20," it said in a statement.Judicial authorities said they had no evidence of delays.The head of a fishermen's association, Toto Martello, denied in turn reports that three fishermen drove straight past the scene of the accident."The fishermen save lives," he told Ansa. "We rebut the accusations that we didn't help people who were dying at sea."Other fishermen said there were so many migrant boat wrecks near Lampedusa that they damaged their nets every time they went out."Only now they become aware of this situation?" said Salvatore D'Ancona. "It's been 20 years that this is happening."The fishermen laid a wreath of flowers at sea, with some 10 fishing vessels blowing their horns for the victims.The 20m (66ft) boat carrying some 500 people - mostly from Eritrea and Somalia - was approaching Lampedusa early on Thursday when it began taking on water its motor stopped working.Some of those on board then reportedly set fire to a piece of material to try to attract the attention of passing ships, only to have the fire spread to the rest of the boat.The boat - which set sail from the Libyan port of Misrata - is thought to have capsized when everyone moved to one side.Of the bodies recovered so far 58 were men, 49 were women and two were children of one and six years old.</body>

      <title>Public vote to retain Irish senate</title>
      <description>Voters in the Republic of Ireland have rejected a government proposal to abolish the Irish Seanad (upper house of parliament).</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24404157</url>
      <date>1380997420</date>
      <body>Voters in the Republic of Ireland have rejected a government proposal to abolish Seanad Éireann (upper house of the Irish parliament).The Fine Gael Labour coalition government proposal was supported by Sinn Féin and was lost by a narrow margin, with 48.3% voting in favour of abolition, with 51.7% against.Total turnout in the election was higher than expected at nearly 40%.The Seanad has existed for more than 90 years.The current Irish government had argued it cost too much to run and that its abolition could have saved Irish taxpayers as much as 20m euros (£16.92m) a year.Opponents wanted it retained and reformed, saying it played an essential role in holding governments to account.More than three million people were eligible to vote on whether or not to abolish the Seanad.Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Enda Kenny had claimed the abolition of the Seanad would create a leaner, more effective and more accountable system of government.After the result, he said: "Sometimes in politics you get a wallop in the electoral process."I accept the verdict of the people. But I also say in humility in accepting that verdict, that there is a virtue in actually being able to stand before the people and say: 'I did say four years ago I would ask you this question. We've honoured that commitment in full and so have you'."You've given your verdict and decision and I accept it fully."Opponents, led by the largest opposition party Fianna Fáil, said the Seanad was necessary to serve as a government watchdog and to hold cabinet ministers to account.BBC Dublin correspondent Shane Harrison said the result would be a disappointment for Enda Kenny."Abolition was very much the Taoiseach, Enda Kenny's idea and he has been criticised by Sinn Féin - his temporary ally during the campaign - for his failure to debate the issue with opponents on radio and television," he said."Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams and his colleagues will not be happy that voters in party strongholds in Dublin, rejected their recommendation."The vote was much better news for Fianna Fáil, the only major party to oppose abolition and suggest the Seanad should be reformed."Independent senator Katherine Zappone said it was important that senators now held a meeting with the prime minister to come up with a way of ensuring that the upper house was reformed.Meanwhile, the referendum to establish a Court of Appeal has been passed by a majority of almost two to one.The official result shows just over 65% of voters were in favour of establishing the court.The new court is expected to be operating by this time next year</body>

      <title>MoD to examine US base attack report</title>
      <description>The Ministry of Defence is to examine a US review into a Taliban attack on Camp Bastion in Afghanistan which criticised Britain for the way it handled security.</description>

      <body>The Ministry of Defence is to examine a US review into a Taliban attack on Camp Bastion in Afghanistan which criticises the British military for the way it handled security at the base.Two US marines were killed and over $200m (£124m) worth of aircraft destroyed in the September 2012 attack.This week, two US generals were forced to retire after an investigation.The MoD said it would "consider" the US findings to confirm its own assessment that no further UK action was required.The UK's own inquiry into the attack has not been released.But the US investigation was partially declassified and has been published online.It looks into the actions of US personnel but points out security was the responsibility of British officers.Up to 28,000 troops and contractors worked at Camp Bastion at the time of the attack, but the US investigation found only half of the guard towers on Camp Bastion were manned, including including the one closest to the breach.A similar proportion at the US Marines' Camp Leatherneck section were also left unguarded.A concertina wire, a ditch, obstacle and a 30ft (10m) high boundary chain link fence were in place around Camp Bastion.One of the US generals who was forced to retire, Major General Gregg Sturdevant, said in his statement that his impression had been that some of the enhanced security which commanders had asked for had been refused on cost grounds both in the UK and US.In a statement to investigators, he said it was only after the attack that he found out there were unmanned towers at the base, because he said the "information flow was slow and the Brits were embarrassed".He added that after the attack, "the Brits desperately wanted" to continue to be in charge of security, "but I told them that we were no longer willing to accept not being in charge of overall security. The attack definitely changed the environment. They knew that they had screwed up".The conclusion of the American investigation was that, while the US commanders had correctly delegated their responsibilities, in the end, they alone were accountable.But an MoD spokesman pointed out that the US review found a separate internal perimeter fence would likely not have presented "any serious challenge, barrier or impediment to the enemy" on the day of the attack.He added: "Force protection measures at Camp Bastion have been reviewed and are appropriate to current threat levels."The insurgents were repelled by US Marines and Royal Air Force Regiment personnel whose courageous actions prevented greater loss of life and equipment."While the US review was intended to examine US actions only and not those of coalition forces, the UK will consider its findings in detail to confirm our earlier assessment that no further UK action is required."</body>

      <body>A hospital worker has been arrested on suspicion of murder by officers investigating the death of a patient at a Norfolk hospital.James May, 76, from Great Yarmouth, died at the James Paget University Hospital in Gorleston, on 20 September.Ten days later, the hospital reported an allegation of medical malpractice in connection with his death.A middle-aged member of the hospital's medical staff has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is in custody.Det Ch Insp Paul Durham, from the Norfolk and Suffolk Major Investigation Team, said: "We are investigating an allegation that a drugs overdose was administered to a patient, leading to his death."A Home Office post-mortem, carried out earlier this week, determined the cause of Mr May's death as heart failure and we now await the results of further toxicology tests which will help inform our inquiry."In a statement, the hospital said: "The James Paget University Hospital has called in the police following the suspicious death of a 76-year-old man."This follows an allegation of medical malpractice made by a member of staff after the patient's death. This matter was investigated internally and subsequently referred to the police."Christine Allen, the hospital's chief executive, said: "Our priority is patient safety and we understand that this news will cause concern."At this time, we believe it is an isolated incident and relates to the alleged action of a single member of staff."The member of staff against whom the allegation has been made is absent from the trust and will not return until the investigation is completed."She added: "Our thoughts are with the family of this patient at what is a very difficult time."</body>

      <body>Actor Jude Law and musician Damon Albarn have joined hundreds demonstrating in London over piracy charges brought by Russia against 30 Greenpeace activists.Six Britons were among those arrested last month as they protested against oil drilling in the Arctic at a rig owned by Russian firm, Gazprom.Relatives of the activists protested outside Russia's London embassy.It was one of a number of events being held in more than 40 countries.The entire crew of the ship, Arctic Sunrise, was arrested on 18 September after two activists tried to board the Russian state-controlled oil platform in the Pechora Sea.They have all been charged and are being held in the port of Murmansk, in northwest Russia, facing prison terms of up to 15 years.The Britons who have been charged include freelance video producer, Kieron Bryan, and logistics co-ordinator, Frank Hewetson - both from London.UK activists Anthony Perrett from Newport in Wales; Alexandra Harris, originally from Devon; Philip Ball from Chipping Norton; and Iain Rogers, from Exeter, have also been charged.In London, Saturday's protesters stood behind banners declaring, "Free the Climate Defenders", "Journalist and Not Pirate", and "Free The Arctic 30".Law, who knows Mr Hewetson, said he was "exercising my right to peacefully protest".He added: "I am just adding my face and body to the mass of support. What is ludicrous is that they have been charged with piracy."Actors Imelda Staunton and Jim Carter also turned up in front of the embassy in west London to show their support for the activists.Carter described the arrests as "a ludicrous situation" and urged Prime Minister David Cameron - along with the leaders of the other 18 countries which made up the nationalities of the 30 activists - to apply pressure on Russia.Foreign Secretary William Hague has raised the case with his Russian counterpart and said British officials would continue to raise specific concerns Greenpeace had about the legal process with Moscow.The Netherlands has also launched legal action to free the activists. Two of its citizens are among those charged, along with people from countries including Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, Russia, and the US.Other Greenpeace protests took place in cities including Madrid, Moscow, Mexico City, Sao Paulo and Istanbul.</body>

      <title>Clegg backs gender pay gap openness</title>
      <description>Women should "feel free" to ask their employers how much they earn in comparison to their male colleagues, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg says.</description>

      <body>Women should "feel free" to ask their employers how much they earn in comparison to their male colleagues, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg says.Mr Clegg told Elle UK Magazine he supported its campaign for more openness on the matter of equal pay.Women and Equalities Minister Jo Swinson also called on women to "confront" the issue.Firms have been warned they could be forced by law to reveal pay differences if voluntary measures to be open fail.The government's Think, Act, Report scheme encourages companies to publish as much information on pay as possible.Both Mr Clegg and Ms Swinson have spoken out in support of the Make Them Pay campaign - a joint project supported by Elle, The Feminist Times and advertising agency, Mother London.The project urges women to ask men about their salaries to ensure they are not being paid less to do the same job.In his interview, Mr Clegg told the magazine: "Women should feel free to ask male colleagues how much they earn in the same jobs and I'm sure most men would want to help."This is a simple step which could have a big impact. But the gender pay gap is a stubborn problem."The Liberal Democrat leader said men also needed to do more of the "heavy lifting" in childcare, so women were not forced to put their careers on hold.The government has not enacted plans, inherited from Labour, to make pay audits mandatory.However, it has given employment tribunals the power to force employers that break equal pay laws to carry out reviews.In a separate interview with Elle, Miss Swinson said the British reluctance to talk about money "holds women back".While being open about salaries could be uncomfortable, it could also be the "catalyst" for female workers to seek pay rises, she suggested."I would agree that while the pay gap is reducing a bit, it's not reducing enough," she said."We're 40 years on from the initial legislation to say that men and women ought to be paid equally."I think we need to recognise the government does have the power to impose equal pay audits, and it may well be that if we do not see success through Think, Act, Report, that might be the only way to make this happen."</body>

      <description>Islamist fighters in Somalia say Western forces have carried out a raid on a militant base in the southern town of Barawe.</description>

      <body>Islamist fighters in southern Somalia say Western forces have launched a night-time raid on one of their bases.The militant group al-Shabab told the BBC "white soldiers" had arrived by boat at the port of Barawe and rebels had repulsed them, losing a fighter.No-one has admitted the attack. US and French special forces have carried out raids in Somalia in recent years.It is not clear whether it is linked to last month's attack in neighbouring Kenya, which al-Shabab has claimed.At least 67 people were killed after militants stormed the Westgate shopping centre in the capital, Nairobi, on 21 September.Residents in Barawe, which is controlled by militants, say they were woken up by heavy fighting before dawn on Saturday."Gunfire broke out for about 10-15 minutes," an eyewitness told AFP news agency.It is not clear who the target of the raid was.Several residents are quoted as saying the soldiers tried to storm a house sheltering senior al-Shabab leaders.However, an unnamed Somali intelligence official told the Associated Press news agency that the targets had been "high-profile" foreigners.Local al-Shabab commander Mohamed Abu Suleiman said the raid had failed and the group remained in control of Barawe.Later, Reuters carried a statement by Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, al-Shabab's military operations spokesman, which said that British and Turkish special forces were involved.He said the commander of the British force was killed, and four SAS and a Turkish soldier were wounded.However, the UK's Ministry of Defence said there was "no British involvement", while a Turkish foreign ministry official told Reuters that Turkish special forces had also not taken any part.Western navies tasked with fighting piracy patrol the seas off Somalia, which has been beset by conflict for more than two decades.In 2009, US Navy commandos attacked and killed an al-Qaeda leader, Kenyan-born Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, in a daylight raid on Barawe.Washington has also used drones in Somalia to support the government and African Union forces in their battle against al-Shabab.France carried out an unsuccessful raid to free a French intelligence agent in January. Two French commandos were killed and al-Shabab later reported that it had killed the agent.</body>

      <body>The supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has endorsed overtures to the US made last month by President Hassan Rouhani in New York."We support the diplomatic initiative of the government and attach importance to its activities in this trip," he said on his website.But he added that some of what had occurred "was not appropriate".Mr Rouhani had spoken to US President Barack Obama by phone in a bid to ease tension over Iran's nuclear programme.They were the first talks between Iranian and US leaders in more than three decades.Iran wants the lifting of UN sanctions, which were imposed over concerns that it is seeking to build nuclear weapons clandestinely - an allegation Tehran denies.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the leading advocate of a hard line against Iran over its nuclear programme, has dismissed Mr Rouhani as a "wolf in sheep's clothing".When Mr Rouhani returned from New York he was greeted at Tehran airport by supporters but also met hardline protesters chanting "Death to America".In his comments on Saturday, Ayatollah Khamenei said that "some of what happened on the New York trip was not appropriate", without being specific."We are pessimistic towards the Americans and do not put any trust in them," he said."The American government is untrustworthy, supercilious and unreasonable, and breaks its promises."Substantive nuclear negotiations between Iran and international powers are due to take place on 15 October and Mr Rouhani has promised to bring a plan to the meeting.He said he wanted to reach a deal over the nuclear issue in three to six months.In an interview conducted on Friday, President Obama told the Associated Press that the US believed Iran was still "a year or more away" from building a nuclear weapon.He also expressed optimism about the current diplomacy."Rouhani has staked his position on the idea that he can improve relations with the rest of the world," Mr Obama said. "And so far he's been saying a lot of the right things. And the question now is, can he follow through?"Iran's key nuclear sites</body>

      <body>Police in the Siberian region of Irkutsk have rescued a couple after a bear broke into their holiday home, attracted by the smell of fresh soup.A patrol turned up at their dacha near Ust-Ilimsk in the early hours after a neighbour raised the alarm.They found the couple hiding in their bath-house as the bear digested the hot beetroot soup in their garden.A warning shot was sufficient to scare off the intruder. No-one was hurt, although there was damage to the house.According to a police statement, the couple said they had left the soup to cool when they went to bed.Because of decorating work inside the dacha, they were sleeping out in the bath-house, when they woke to "loud banging".Peering out, they saw a bear breaking the windows of their glassed-in porch. It then hauled itself inside and devoured "all of the borsch, which was still hot".After receiving the alert at 01:00 (16:00 GMT Friday), police sent a patrol to the scene. Officers found the bear padding around the snowy garden and fired a shot into the air."Startled, the unwelcome guest bounded off into the forest," the police statement said.Bears, it noted, had been known to come looking for food around dachas in the area before but happily no attacks had been reported.While splashes of the bright red soup were found at the scene, it could not be immediately confirmed whether the bear had indeed not used a spoon.</body>

      <title>Sunderland 1-2 Manchester United</title>
      <description>Adnan Januzaj scores twice on his full debut as Manchester United beat Sunderland for their first victory in three league games.</description>

      <date>1380999601</date>
      <body>Manchester United teenager Adnan Januzaj rescued manager David Moyes from another hazardous situation as he inspired a vital victory at Sunderland.Moyes knew three points were essential at the Stadium of Light after successive Premier League defeats by Manchester City and West Bromwich Albion - but Craig Gardner's early goal gave struggling Sunderland a deserved half-time lead.United could have been in deeper trouble had goalkeeper David De Gea not saved magnificently from Emanuele Giaccherini's header before 18-year-old Januzaj celebrated his first league start with a double strike to turn the game around.Januzaj demonstrated great composure to slide Patrice Evra's cross past Sunderland keeper Keiren Westwood 10 minutes after the break, then showed wonderful technique to score with a left-foot volley to put United in the ascendancy six minutes later.It was tough on Sunderland, who provided a glowing reference for interim head coach Kevin Ball's credentials to succeed the sacked Paolo Di Canio before they were deflated by Januzaj's brilliance and ran out of steam.The gifted youngster's goals and performance brought great relief for Moyes, who had been under the spotlight following United's indifferent start to the season and embarrassing defeats in the Manchester derby and at home to West Brom.It may not have been United at their most fluent but a win was the sole priority on Wearside and Moyes will now hope the reigning Premier League champions move towards top gear.For Sunderland, it was another defeat that leaves them rooted to the bottom of the Premier League with only one point from seven games - but they can take heart from many aspects of this performance and will look back on De Gea's brilliant save as the decisive moment.Moyes was able to pair the returning Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie in attack - but it was at the back where United had all the problems.And they were in evidence inside five minutes when Phil Jones and Nemanja Vidic failed miserably to deal with Giaccherini's cross and the loose ball was drilled low past De Gea by Gardner.There were ominous signs for United in their failure to cope with Jozy Altidore's physical approach, with even the usually formidable Vidic struggling to contain the powerful striker as he was brushed effortlessly off the ball in some fierce exchanges.United, wisely given the vulnerability of their defence, were attempting to keep Sunderland back - but that was no easy task against a side bristling with energy and making a complete nonsense of their early season struggles.Nani had the visitors' best first-half opportunity but volleyed carelessly across the face of goal from Evra's inviting cross.It took a world-class save from De Gea to stop Sunderland extending their lead when Adam Johnson crossed for Giaccherini. The diminutive forward was alone and was turning away to celebrate a headed goal when De Gea produced a quite magnificent flying save, one-handed and away to his right.Giaccherini could blame no-one but himself when he wasted another opportunity as half-time approached, scooping over from eight yards after Johnson weaved through more shambolic work from United's defenders.Januzaj had shown flashes of promise, though he was booked for a clear dive, and turned them into the finished product to put United level after 55 minutes when he timed his arrival perfectly to meet Evra's cross with a calm side-footed finish.His second goal to complete the turnaround six minutes later was even better, showing real class to send a low left-foot volley past Westwood when Sunderland defender John O'Shea could only partially clear a cross.Van Persie wasted an opportunity to make the scoreline more emphatic as he missed when clean through on Westwood - but Moyes looked a satisfied man as he celebrated at the final whistle.</body>

      <body>Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel beat Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton to pole position at the Korean Grand Prix.The German secured his third pole in a row to put himself in the best possible position to extend his 60-point championship lead over Fernando Alonso.The Ferrari driver qualified sixth but starts fifth as a result of a 10-place penalty for Red Bull's Mark Webber, who was third.Lotus's Romain Grosjean moves up to third ahead of Mercedes' Nico Rosberg.Webber drops back from third to 13th as automatic punishment for picking up his third reprimand of the season for accepting a lift back to the pits from Alonso in what stewards considered a dangerous manner at the last race in Singapore.Vettel's pole was his sixth of the season - more than anyone else - and had looked locked on after an impressive performance in Saturday's final practice session.The world champion's margin over Hamilton, who was fastest in both Friday practice sessions, was 0.218secs.Vettel's time came on his first run in the final part of qualifying. He went out again at the end of the session but aborted his lap when he was held up by Raikkonen in the last few corners."It was fairly close," Vettel said. "As expected, Mercedes was pretty strong, so it was a tight battle."Bit of a surprise this year we are very good in sector one, which is mainly straights and slow corners. That's good - it's the easiest place to make up time in the race. We improved the car - I wasn't that happy after Friday; that's why I was happy after qualifying."Hamilton added: "We did as good a job as we could. I feel I got the most out of the car. In general it's been a good weekend and I really hope tomorrow we're able to fight with them."Webber's penalty also drops him back behind Ferrari's Felipe Massa, who qualified sixth fastest, Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg and Esteban Gutierrez, Lotus's Kimi Raikkonen, the McLarens of Sergio Perez and Jenson Button and Daniel Ricciardo's Toro Rosso.Webber said: "We had to take a bit of pace out of the car for qually. Not much, but just looking at how we would compromise the car for qually looking to the race. It was a good little battle. I'm well and truly out of position but we'll fight and come back through."Scot Paul Di Resta starts 15th in his Force India, one place and 0.287secs behind team-mate Adrian Sutil.Marussia's Jules Bianchi was handed a three-place grid penalty and a reprimand for impeding Di Resta and will start last.Full qualifying results</body>

      <title>New Zealand win Rugby Championship</title>
      <description>New Zealand clinch the Rugby Championship title following an impressive victory over South Africa in Johannesburg.</description>

      <body>New Zealand secured the Rugby Championship with a pulsating 38-27 win over South Africa at Ellis Park.After Ben Smith's try put the All Blacks ahead, two Bryan Habana scores gave the Springboks hope only for two tries from Liam Messam to give the visitors a half-time lead.Tries from Willie le Roux and Jean de Villiers put South Africa in front.But scores from Beauden Barrett and Kieran Read earned a sixth win from six games for the All Blacks.South Africa went into the game needing a bonus point win by more than seven points to claim the trophy.But Kiwi coach Steve Hansen's team never looked interested in winning the title with damage limitation, producing a stylish display to win the tournament for the eighth time in 11 years.Barrett's try - New Zealand's fourth - guaranteed a bonus point and confirmed the trophy even with 20 minutes left."We had the belief to hit back when the momentum was against us," said New Zealand skipper Richie McCaw."As an All Black I relish these occasions and winning at this great stadium makes me so proud. We gave everything out there this evening."Springboks captain Jean de Villiers said: "To win rugby matches you have to attack and defend and our defence was not up to scratch in this match."Let us give credit to New Zealand - they deserved to win the match and the Championship after a great advertisement for rugby."Morne Steyn kicked an early penalty but the All Blacks moved ahead when a fine offload from Read was followed by Smith beating two defenders to score.But South Africa responded when Duane Vermeulen made space with a surging run and sent Habana over in the 18th minute.Two minutes later a fine one-handed pass from Francois Louw put Habana into space and the winger chipped over Smith and gathered before touching down in the corner.Habana limped off with what appeared to be a hamstring injury two minutes later and the hosts failed to build on their 15-7 advantage.Heavy pressure from New Zealand resulted in Messam, assisted by Brodie Retallick, bundling over from about a yard.And when South Africa attempted to run the ball out in first-half added time, Read turned the ball over and a slick passing move to the left ended with Messam stepping in to score his second try.Six minutes after the interval Messam was sent to the sin bin and within seconds the hosts took a penalty quickly and fed the ball right for Le Roux to cross, with Steyn's conversion making it 22-21.With 14 men, Ma'a Nonu denied a decisive try and after Barrett's penalty restored New Zealand's advantage, De Villiers barged through three tackles to score.The game swung again within two minutes when Barrett broke through to score a fourth try and end South Africa's chances of winning the trophy.New Zealand's Ben Franks was shown a yellow card but, even with a man down, the outstanding Read was sent over in the corner by Julian Savea.</body>

      <body>Great Britain's Max Whitlock had to settle for a silver medal in the men's pommel horse World Championships final.Whitlock - a double Olympic bronze medallist in 2012 - saw his score of 15.633 beaten by the 15.833 of Japan's Kohei Kameyama in Antwerp.The 20-year-old from Hemel Hempstead was looking to become Britain's first male gymnastics world champion.He told BBC Sport: "I am really happy with that, my routine was a big risk but to come out with a medal is good."Dan Purvis, the 2010 world bronze medallist in the floor event, narrowly missed repeating the feat as he came fourth.Japan's Kenzo Shirai, 17, became the first athlete to perform a quadruple twist at a major event as he won gold.Shirai's full routine included some two dozen twists. He kept the groundbreaking quadruple for last to score 16.000 for victory.Fellow countryman Kohei Uchimura, the all-around champion, took bronze with 15.500 behind American Jacob Dalton (15.600), while Purvis scored 15.400.The 22-year-old from Liverpool said: "Going into it I just wanted to enjoy it and then, as it progressed, I thought, 'I can get quite close here'."I've been strong all week and I'm really satisfied and proud of my World Championships."Whitlock had only tried his upgraded pommel-horse routine in competition once before - during Thursday's all-around final - and was relieved to come through it without falling."There were bits in the routine where I thought I could have fallen off but overall I am happy," he said."It was a little bit scruffy and there's room for improvement but I really can't complain with a World Championships silver medal to cap a great year for me."Kameyama, who had been seventh in qualifying, was the surprise winner of a final which took place without world and Olympic champion Krisztian Berki, who had fallen from the apparatus in qualifying. GB's European champion Daniel Keatings also suffered the same fate.Whitlock's score left him tied with Mexico's Daniel Corral Barron for second place with no bronze medal awarded, unlike the Olympics, where the rules dictate a gymnast's execution score must be used as a tie-breaker.China's Huang Huidan won an uneven bars final which featured only two of the London 2012 Olympic line-up, while Britain's Ruby Harrold and Rebecca Downie finished seventh and eighth respectively.Huang's 15.400 took her past all-around silver medallist Kyla Ross of the United States. Harrold scored 14.333 and Downie a frustrating 13.800, falling in the final stages of what had otherwise been an exceptional routine.Olympic silver medallist McKayla Maroney successfully defended her vault world title with a score of 15.724, edging out American compatriot and all-around champion Simone Biles (15.595).And Olympic rings champion Arthur Zanetti, of Brazil, won his first world title on the apparatus with a score of 15.800, ahead of Russia's Aleksandr Balandin.Kristian Thomas will be the final Briton to compete in the event when he takes part in Sunday's vault final.The men's parallel bars and high bar titles will also be decided, alongside the women's beam and floor competitions.</body>

      <title>Manchester City 3-1 Everton</title>
      <description>Manchester City come from a goal down to end Everton's unbeaten Premier League start in a gripping game.</description>

      <date>1380981807</date>
      <body>Manchester City ended Everton's unbeaten Premier League start with a stylish attacking victory that was the ideal response to the Champions League humbling against Bayern Munich.Everton led a gripping match when Romelu Lukaku slipped the ball past under-pressure City keeper Joe Hart.But Alvaro Negredo equalised with a cool finish from Yaya Toure's pass.Sergio Aguero's low strike made it 2-1 and his penalty, which went in off Tim Howard's head, sealed the win.The spot-kick, awarded after Seamus Coleman tangled with Pablo Zabaleta but hotly disputed by the visitors, was credited as an own goal to the unfortunate Howard as the ball hit the diving goalkeeper and crossed the line after it hit the post.It helped ensure City's fourth consecutive home league win, and the victory was a much-needed boost after the painful 3-1 defeat by Bayern on Wednesday and last week's shock league loss against Aston Villa.But, as impressive as they were in attack, the defensive display in a thrillingly open first half will once again be questioned.Vincent Kompany was the only player to keep his place in the starting back four from Wednesday and they also lost their inspirational captain to what looked like a leg muscle injury after 33 minutes.Everton had already looked a threat before then with the ever-impressive Ross Barkley, Steven Naismith and James McCarthy having the better of the midfield battle.But it was the pace, power and direct running of Lukaku that was the focal point for their attacks.England keeper Hart - so heavily criticised for his recent performances - did well to prevent Lukaku giving the visitors the lead with an early chance, but he was then beaten by the Belgian when the on-loan Chelsea striker nipped past Joleon Lescott and curled the ball home.Hart got a strong touch but concerns over his attempt were soon forgotten as the home side levelled within 60 seconds.Toure played a delightful pass behind Coleman and Negredo slipped the ball home via a big deflection off the scrambling figure of Howard.Gareth Barry's absence had deprived Everton of their defensive shield and City began to exploit it ruthlessly.A superb quick free-kick involving Toure and a beautiful first-time pass from David Silva should have seen City go ahead soon after, but Aguero placed his effort narrowly wide of the far post.Argentine striker Aguero then made a mess of a great opportunity to get through one-on-one with Howard when he hopelessly miscontrolled a simple pass.However, after the hugely impressive Lukaku had a strong shout for a penalty ignored, Aguero made amends by giving City the lead with seconds of the first half remaining.The excellent Silva, who was making his first league start since August, slid a perfectly weighted pass down the right-hand side of the box and Aguero struck a first-time shot across Howard and into the net.Everton were unlucky to be trailing at the interval but that goal changed the complexion of the match and City's defensive display improved considerably.The visitors would have gone up to second in the table with a win but barely threatened and it was the hosts who posed the far greater threat.Howard's own goal from Aguero's low penalty gave them breathing space and they could have added to their margin of victory had the keeper not made fine saves from Negredo and Samir Nasri during a relatively incident-free second period.Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini"I am very pleased by the character the team showed today. We really needed this victory because at the start of the game we five points behind Arsenal and it is important to continue wining here at home."Equalising immediately was important but more important was the character, playing against Everton - the only unbeaten team in the league."After a defeat on Wednesday it was important for me to see how the players reacted after that defeat."I don't think the score of this game was for a penalty kick or not a penalty kick. We had at least four or five clear chances to score and I don't remember Everton having too many chances to score, so I don't think the difference between the two teams was the penalty."Everton manager Roberto Martinez"We made it a really open game and to score the first goal was important. Then you have to be very superior when the calls are not going for you. Unfortunately, on the day, we didn't have that luck that we needed."I thought the penalty awarded is a football disaster. Jon Moss [referee] needs to watch it again and see why he gave it. Contact doesn't mean a penalty. If you are going to give a penalty for that it is going to make the game very difficult."Romelu's is more of a penalty."</body>

      <body>Demand for Royal Mail shares is high enough for the government to be able to sell them near the top of its hoped-for price band.The government had priced the shares at between 260-330p, but demand is outstripping supply and they will be sold for between 300-330p.BBC business editor Robert Peston says applications for the shares are a "few times" the value of those on offer.Labour says there is a danger the privatisation undervalues the business.Shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, expressed concern over the possible sale of Royal Mail sites after the privatisation."Royal Mail has a huge property portfolio in prime development sites in London and across Britain and there is nothing to stop the privatised company making a quick buck by flogging off these assets for development," he said.He also said that if sites are sold customers could face longer trips to collect their mail.The government is selling up to 62% of the business and will keep the rest.Under the terms of the share sale a 10% stake in the business has been reserved for Royal Mail employees.Members of the Communication Workers Union are currently voting on whether to strike over the government's privatisation plan.The ballot closes on 16 October. The earliest a strike could be held would be 23 October.Members of the public can apply for Royal Mail shares online until 8 October. Shares will begin trading in full on 15 October.The minimum application for the public wishing to purchase shares is £750, or £500 for eligible Royal Mail employees.The government said it might also sell an additional 15% of its stake in what is called an "over-allotment" option, if the demand for shares was very high.In the official prospectus for the share issuing, the Royal Mail warned that industrial action posed a potential risk for the share price.The statement said: "National industrial action, or the threat of national industrial action... could also have a material adverse effect on the success of the offer and, if it occurs after admission, could cause the price of ordinary shares to fall significantly."</body>

      <title>Rail minister Burns stands down</title>
      <description>Transport Minister Simon Burns resigns from the government to run for the position of deputy Commons Speaker.</description>

      <body>Transport Minister Simon Burns has resigned from the government to run for the position of deputy Commons Speaker.The MP for Chelmsford has been responsible for the controversial HS2 rail link during the past year, having previously been a health minister.One of the three deputy Speaker positions is vacant after previous incumbent Nigel Evans stood down to fight sexual assault charges.Mr Burns has clashed with Speaker John Bercow several times in the past.On one occasion, Mr Burns described the man under whom he now seeks to serve as a "stupid sanctimonious dwarf".BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said the Conservative MP had apologised afterwards - but only to groups of people who felt insulted, not necessarily to the Speaker himself.Were he to be elected, relations between the pair would not be altogether comfortable, our correspondent added.There are plenty of Conservatives who do not support Mr Bercow and might vote for Mr Burns just to irritate him, he continued.MPs are elected to the role of deputy Speaker, under reforms proposed by Mr Bercow shortly after he took on his role in 2009.To stand for election, MPs need to be sponsored by at least six other MPs.One of the other candidates for the role is Nadine Dorries, who in 2009 described the Speaker as "oily" and suggested he was "mistrusted by up to half of the House".Conservative backbenchers Eleanor Laing and Brian Binley have also been named as potential candidates.The successful applicant will join existing deputies, former Labour MPs Dawn Primarolo and Lindsay Hoyle, in helping to chair Commons business.Mr Burns' decision comes ahead of an expected reshuffle of middle-ranking Conservative ministerial ranks in coming weeks.In his resignation letter to Prime Minister David Cameron, he wrote: "It has been a privilege to serve in your administration for the past three and a quarter years and I will be forever grateful to you for giving me that opportunity in both the Departments of Health and Transport."You can rest assured that I will continue to support your leadership of both the Conservative Party and the government."The PM's response described the MP as a "loyal, dedicated and committed colleague".Mr Cameron said: "I know that this will not have been an easy decision for you to make, and one you will have given a huge amount of thought to."After serving the government so ably for over three years, you will certainly be missed, but I completely understand and respect your decision."</body>

      <title>Call for early bone cancer diagnosis</title>
      <description>A charity is urging GPs to do more to diagnose bone cancers early in order to help to improve the survival rate.</description>

      <body>A charity is urging GPs to do more to diagnose bone cancers early in order to help to improve the survival rateThe Bone Cancer Research Trust says the survival rate of 54% has barely changed in the last 25 years.It says early diagnosis is key to spotting the condition, which mainly affects young people.Symptoms include painful bones or swollen joints, which can be misdiagnosed as sporting injuries or "growing pains".Primary bone cancer is cancer which starts in the bones rather than spreads there.The two most common types are osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma.The condition is rare - there were just 531 new cases in the UK in 2010.But it is an aggressive cancer, and those who survive are often left with significant disabilities.The trust has teamed up with the Royal College of GPs to launch a specialist e-learning module to help doctors spot the symptoms and diagnose patients earlier.Prof Andy Hall, chairman of BCRT's independent scientific advisory panel, said: "Primary bone cancer is, thankfully, very rare but it is vital that it is diagnosed early to give patients the best chance of survival."He added: "The average length of time it takes for a patient to receive a correct diagnosis is 16 weeks from the time when the patient first noticed their symptoms."A simple X-ray, performed early, can make all the difference."Callum Flynn, 18, from Leigh in Greater Manchester, experienced knee pain for 18 months before being diagnosed with osteosarcoma - on his 14th birthday."I would wake up with my knee locked. I couldn't stand up. That would last for about two weeks at a time - and it happened five or six times over an 18-month period."We kept going to the walk-in centre, because it seemed to be something that just happened overnight, and they thought it was a virus each time."But eventually I went to my GP who felt behind my knee and obviously felt the tumour, though I wasn't told then. I had an X-ray and a biopsy in the space of a week and a half."His diagnosis came as a shock. "I'd never heard of it. I didn't think you could get cancer when you were young."Callum had to have chemotherapy and a full knee replacement at the time, and has recently had to have a further operation on his knee.He cannot play all the sports he used to, although he is part of the England physical disabilities cricket squad, and toured with them in Dubai last year.Callum also works to raise awareness of bone cancer and funds for research.He says his experience of going undiagnosed for 18 months means he feels it is vital to raise awareness about early diagnosis.And in the end, he says, it is simple to check: "It just took one X-ray."</body>

      <body>Students in England face a cost-of-living crisis as loans and grants fail to keep pace with rents and bills, claims the National Union of Students.The gap between income and expenditure for a typical student amounts to more than £7,600 according to NUS analysis.The union compared the cost of living and studying for the 39-week 2013-14 academic year with typical income from government grants and loans.The government said it was targeting support at those who needed it most.Rent, bills and other outgoings continue to rise year after year above the rate of inflation but grants and loan rates were frozen this year and will only rise by 1% next year, says the union.It estimates that a student living outside London will pay an average of £21,440 in tuition fees, books, equipment, rent, travel and other living expenses.Against this, they have a potential income of £13,747 composed of their tuition fee loan plus maintenance loans and the grants available to those on average and low incomes.This leaves a shortfall of £7,693.In London, higher rents mean students typically spend £23,187 says the union - but they are also eligible for a higher maintenance loan of £6,090 though this still leaves them with a shortfall of £7,654, says the union.The union adds that some students from less well-off families who are eligible for grants are facing an additional squeeze as the level at which they can claim maximum support has remained at a household income of £25,000 since 2008.NUS president Toni Pearce said: "Those who do not have the rare luxury of resorting to the 'bank of mum and dad' are increasingly being driven to work full-time alongside study where jobs can be found, or worse still, into the arms of predatory pay day lenders just to make ends meet."We need a financial support system that ensures students get what the support they need, when they need it."A spokeswoman for the Department for Business Innovation and Skills said the government's student finance package was designed to target support at students from the poorest households."This year, students from the lowest income households can access over £7,100 of living-cost support, of which over £3,350 does not have to be repaid."The government also provides additional, non-repayable support to students in specific circumstances, such as students with children and disabled students."Scholarships and bursaries are also available from most universities, and students in hardship can apply for additional support through the Access to Learning Fund."</body>

      <body>The alleged mastermind behind the online illegal drugs marketplace Silk Road is too dangerous to be bailed, US prosecutors have said.Ross Ulbricht, 29, was arrested this week and is charged with being the administrator of the site which has now been shut down.He is also accused of trying to arrange the killing of one of the site's users."We deny all charges and that is the end of the discussion at this point," Mr Ulbricht's lawyer said.Mr Ulbricht appeared in a San Francisco court on Friday wearing a green T-shirt under red jail clothes and had his ankles shackled.A request from his legal team for his bail hearing to be pushed back was granted - it will now take place on 9 October.Federal magistrate Joseph Spero asked Mr Ulbricht's lawyer Brandon LeBlanc whether seeing the criminal indictment that included a murder-for-hire charge had "changed his calculus" on whether he thought Mr Ulbricht would be granted bail.As part of its criminal complaint, the FBI alleged that Mr Ulbricht had sought to pay a Silk Road user to kill another user who had threatened to expose details of the site's users.Prosecutors opposed the delay, arguing that Mr Ulbricht represented a danger to the community, and that there was a high likelihood that he may attempt to flee.The Silk Road was a well-known destination on Tor, a so-called "dark web" service that anonymises users, making it much more difficult for authorities to track locations.The site sold a range of items, but was most famous for offering a host of illegal drugs, paid for using virtual currency Bitcoin.</body>

      <description>A service that digitally weaves together the DNA of prospective parents to check for potential disease in thousands of "virtual babies" is set to launch in the US by December.</description>

      <date>1380885044</date>
      <body>A service that digitally weaves together the DNA of prospective parents to check for potential disease in thousands of "virtual babies" is set to launch in the US by December.New York start-up Genepeeks will initially focus on donor sperm, simulating before pregnancy how the genetic sequence of a female client might combine with those of different males.Donors that more often produce "digital children" with a higher risk of inherited disorders will be filtered out, leaving those who are better genetic matches.Everything happens in a computer, but experts have raised ethical questions."We are just in the business right now of giving prospective mothers, who are using donor sperm to conceive, a filtered catalogue of donors based on their own underlying genetic profile," Genepeeks co-founder Anne Morriss told BBC News."We are filtering out the donor matches with an elevated risk of rare recessive paediatric conditions."Ms Morriss, an entrepreneur, gave a presentation on the company at the Consumer Genetics Conference in Boston last week.She was motivated in part by her own experience of starting a family. Her son was conceived with a sperm donor who happened to share with Morriss the gene for an inherited disorder called MCADD.MCADD (medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency) prevents those affected from converting fats to sugar. It can be fatal if it is not diagnosed early. Luckily, in Ms Morriss's case, the condition was picked up in newborn screening tests."My son has a pretty normal life," Ms Morriss said, "but about 30% of children with rare genetic diseases don't make it past the age of five."Genepeeks has formalised a partnership with a sperm bank - the Manhattan Cryobank - and has a patent pending on the DNA screening technology.The start-up benefits from the rapid pace of change in genetic technology.Indeed, six months ago, Genepeeks' founders decided it was able to use a superior system for DNA analysis (called "targeted exon sequencing") than the one originally envisaged - a result, says Anne Morriss, of falling costs and increased flexibility.For couples planning babies, other companies already screen one or both partners for genes that could cause disease if combined with a similar variant - so-called "carrier screening".One academic who studies the use of genetic technology commented: "This is like that, but ramped up 100,000 times."Ms Morriss's business partner, Prof Lee Silver, a geneticist and expert on bioethics at Princeton University, New Jersey, told BBC News: "We get the DNA sequence from two prospective parents. We simulate the process of reproduction, forming virtual sperm and virtual eggs. We put them together to form a hypothetical child genome."Then we can look at that hypothetical genome and - with all the tools of modern genetics - determine the risk that the genome will result in a child with disease. We're looking directly for disease and not carrier status. For each pair of people that we're going to analyse, we make 10,000 hypothetical children."The process will be run for the client and each potential donor one by one, scanning for some 600 known single-gene recessive conditions. In this way, the highest-risk pairings can be filtered out.Anne Morriss added: "At this stage our clients won't be receiving any genetic information back. We're very much focused on the practical utility of helping prospective parents who want to protect their future kids, giving them the option of additional analysis to what is currently being offered in the industry."But the company's founders have plans to expand the screening beyond single-gene recessive disorders to more complex conditions in which multiple genes play a part.Indeed, going to the trouble of simulating thousands of digital children deliberately lays the ground for this: "[It's] impossible to get towards an accurate risk calculation in any other way," said Anne Morriss.And in a video produced by the company, Prof Silver says: "My hope for the future is that any people who want to have a baby can use this technology to greatly reduce the risk of disease being expressed in their child."To some, such a prospect might appear like a step towards designer babies - until now the preserve of science fiction literature and films such as Gattaca, which envisaged a future of genetic "haves" and "have-nots".Bio-ethicists approached by the BBC said Genepeeks was a logical outcome of the increasing demand for more information when making reproductive decisions.However, some raised potential concerns about risk communication and the expansion of screening beyond rare single-gene disorders. But they suggested there were few, if any, regulatory barriers.One ethicist told BBC News: "The biggest question for me, just from the outset, is the understanding of uncertainty. Even people who have been doing genomics for years still have a hard time figuring out exactly what a risk for a particular genetic predisposition really means for a family."Gene-environment interactions can lead to people either having disease or not having disease."Dr Ewan Birney, associate director of the European Bioinformatics Institute in Hinxton, UK, echoed the point: "It's good that they're focusing on the carrier status of these rare Mendelian disorders where it's potentially more clear-cut. That said, these things are more complex than they first seem," he said."I'm sure the scientists appreciate that complexity. But when transmitting that complexity to everyday people, these things can sound more absolute than they really are."He added: "The thing I would want to stress here is just how complex this is. It's great that people are thinking of using this technology in lots of different ways, but our knowledge gap is very large."Risk communication to clients was, said Anne Morriss, "absolutely critical to anyone in this industry"."We have to be crystal clear about what we're testing for, what risks we're helping to reduce; that there's no guarantee you won't give birth to a sick child," she said.Prof Mildred Cho, associate director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics in California, raised questions over whether the sperm donor should also receive information about their genome gleaned from the screening process."Unlike hair colour, occupation or family history - those are things, presumably, the donor already knows - the thing that's different about this that I see is it could create information that the donor doesn't already have. It also has implications for the donor's other biological family members," Prof Cho told BBC News.This week it also emerged that California-based consumer genetics company 23andMe had submitted the patent on a DNA analysis tool for planning a child.Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter</body>

      <body>Sir Bruce Forsyth has dropped out of hosting Saturday's Strictly Come Dancing after falling ill with flu.The showbiz veteran, who fronts the show with Tess Daly, has hosted the series since it launched in 2004.Sir Bruce, 85, last missed a programme because of illness in 2009. He will be replaced by Claudia Winkleman.The BBC said: "Sir Bruce Forsyth has the flu and therefore isn't feeling well enough to present tomorrow's Strictly Come Dancing on BBC One."The show looks forward to his return next week."Winkleman usually hosts the Sunday evening results show with Daly, and and has stood in for Sir Bruce in the past.Saturday will see 15 celebrity couples, including Vanessa Feltz and Hairy Biker Dave Myers, take to the dance floor and face the public vote for the first time.Model Abbey Clancy and new professional dancer Aljaz Skorjanec topped the leader board last week, scoring 32 points from the judges for their waltz. TV chef Myers and golfer Tony Jacklin were bottom of the table, with just 16 points each.The points accrued last week will be carried over to this weekend, when one couple will leave the series.</body>

      <title>Why is a children's book about rabbits being read at weddings?</title>
      <description>More and more people are including children's books in their wedding readings. Why?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24379830</url>
      <date>1380845753</date>
      <body>More and more people are including children's books in their wedding readings. Why?When Hannah Larkin married her husband Jason, she had three readings, but one stood out - a reading from Guess How Much I Love You by Sam McBratney.In her late teens, Larkin had fallen in love with the story of Big Nutbrown Hare and Little Nutbrown Hare and their attempt to articulate their love. It remained one of her favourite books.Said hares try to outdo each other in their hyperbolic declarations of love for each other.A sample section runs: '"I love you all the way down the lane as far as the river," cried Little Nutbrown Hare. "I love you across the river and over the hills," said Big Nutbrown Hare.'It might seem saccharine stuff to a hardened cynic but many brides and grooms seem to feel differently."Although it's a children's book, it resonates with adult life because it's about the infinite nature of genuine love," says Larkin. At the wedding at a hotel in the New Forest, her sister read the entire book. Her husband's goddaughter Amelia looked up at her, mesmerised by the story.The "classic" Christian wedding reading is 1 Corinthians 13, with its ruminations on faith, hope and love (or charity), but modern couples are varying their readings, says Bernadette Chapman, director of the UK Alliance of Wedding Planners."That's the big thing with weddings now... it's about [the couple's] personalities," says Chapman. Children's literature has become so popular because it's inter-generational and everyone can relate to it."They're trying to choose readings that are easy to understand, that are fun to read and fun to listen to and just bring a smile to people's faces."Chapman says readings from children's books have become popular among remarrying couples who want to give children from previous relationships a key role by reading from a favourite story.One of the most popular readings is taken from The Velveteen Rabbit by Margery Williams. It tells the tale of a small stuffed rabbit and its longing to become real through the love of a human.When actress Drew Barrymore married Will Kopelman in 2012, Kopelman's sister read a passage from the book. Prince William and Prince Harry read alternate lines from it at the wedding of Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall.The growing popularity of wedding blogs has prompted more creativity in the choice of reading, Chapman says.But why does children's literature continue to have such resonance? Prof Maria Nikolajeva, director of the University of Cambridge-Homerton Research and Teaching Centre for Children's Literature, says that children's books give us a shared experience.Nikolajeva's daughter had a reading from The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery at her wedding and Nikolajeva read from The Velveteen Rabbit during the ceremony.She says children's books are adept at expressing profound thoughts and philosophy about life in a very concise manner, which makes them ideal for wedding readings.Books like The Velveteen Rabbit take on existential questions, such as what it means to be a human being, in a way that we can connect with."As we grow up we are exploring the world and we very often explore the world through the characters of literature because it offers us an experience that we cannot always find in the everyday world," says Nikolajeva.She says children love to revisit books as they grow older because as they change, they "interact with the text each time, understanding it more and getting involved with it more".Children's books can be harder to write than longer form fiction, the theory goes, because an author has to articulate a concept in a way that can be reinterpreted as we develop.Even as adults, we can find new meaning in children's literature.When Andrea Dell married her husband Robert at a hotel in Wigan, she opted for a reading from The Owl and the Pussycat by Edward Lear, a poem she remembered from childhood. For Dell, it took on new meaning with its references to getting married."It was just an opportunity to make everybody smile and something that was familiar to them and also was quite evocative with the imagery in it, and also I'm a huge cat fan," says Dell.She says it is something they can share with their children in years to come and might even be a reading her daughter chooses for her wedding."People are moving away from the traditional; they like to mix things up a bit. We had some music from Star Wars in our proceedings," says Dell, whose husband is a big Star Wars fan."I think there is so much variety in children's literature. I think people are looking a bit further afield to try and make it a bit more interesting and a bit more unique to them."You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>The man who dreamed of the atom bomb</title>
      <description>Lisa Jardine tells the story of Leo Szilard, physicist and key pioneer in the development of the atomic bomb.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24395740</url>
      <date>1380905125</date>
      <body>Leo Szilard was the man who first realised that nuclear power could be used to build a bomb of terrifying proportions. Lisa Jardine considers what his story has to say about the responsibilities of science.The figure of Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard loomed large in our house when I was a child. He was held up to me as an exemplary figure in science - a man who had made fundamental breakthroughs in nuclear physics, but whose acute sense of moral probity led him in the end to denounce the very advances he had helped make. Only later did I learn an alternative version of his story.Almost exactly 80 years ago, in early October 1933, Szilard was in London, in transit from Nazi Germany, when an idea came to him that would lead directly to the ultimate weapon of war - the atomic bomb.An article in the Times two weeks earlier had reported a lecture at the British Association by Lord Rutherford - the Nobel prize-winning British physicist and head of the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. Rutherford had described splitting the atom by bombarding it with protons, but had gone on to say that any suggestion that the energy released might be harnessed as a source of power was "talking moonshine".The report caught Szilard's attention. He pondered it obsessively. Surely Rutherford was wrong? Then, early on a dismal, grey morning, as he waited on foot at a traffic light to cross busy Southampton Row near his hotel, the answer came to him in a flash.If a neutron, fired at an atom, produces the release of (say) two neutrons, each of which hits another atom, which both in turn release two more neutrons, which each go on to collide with two further atoms, a nuclear chain reaction would take place, releasing unimaginable amounts of energy.Szilard tells this story twice, with slightly differing details. But the tale itself is consistent and delightfully vivid. The challenge of Rutherford's remark, the heavy cold that had prevented Szilard's attending the lecture, the days spent thinking about it and the flash of inspiration just as the traffic light changed.Szilard immediately recognised the importance of his idea. To ensure its security he patented it in the name of the British Admiralty. The patent included a clear description of "neutron induced chain reactions to create explosions".In August 1939, by which time Szilard had moved on to America, he wrote to President Franklin Roosevelt to inform him that "a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium" was undoubtedly possible, and could lead to the construction of "extremely powerful bombs of a new type". Germany, he warned, might even now be developing such a weapon. "A single bomb of this type," he wrote, "carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory."The letter was signed by Szilard and Albert Einstein. By the time it reached Roosevelt, Germany had invaded Poland. With war now a certainty, the urgency was not lost on the US president. A committee was set up to pursue the nuclear initiative, out of which emerged what came to be known as the Manhattan Project - the hugely ambitious and massively funded programme to develop a functioning atomic bomb in the shortest possible time.But less than six years later in 1945, Szilard campaigned with equal passion to persuade the American government not to use the atomic bomb against a civilian population. He understood better than anyone the enormity of the devastation such a weapon could cause. But his petition, although signed by a large number of nuclear physicists, never reached the president.So devastated was Szilard at his failure to avert the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (the story I was brought up on concluded) that he refused to do any further work in nuclear physics. Instead he moved research areas entirely, to molecular biology - a field concerned with the origins of life rather than its destruction. To my father this audacious step captured the essence of scientific moral responsibility. And I carried Szilard's story with me as I grew up.Today, however, I know that inspiring as it is, there are problems with this tale. As often happens with history, we have to treat with caution a narrative that fits so neatly the interests and preoccupations of the age in which it is written.At the time I was being told this story, Britain was in the depths of the Cold War. In the post-war years it turned out that Szilard (and indeed my own father) found it impossible to obtain work on any scientific project that involved nuclear physics. Though they were barely aware of the stigma themselves, the communist sympathies of their youth barred them from getting the necessary security clearance.So Szilard did not leave physics of his own accord. At the end of the war he was abruptly dismissed from the Manhattan Project by its military head, Gen Leslie Groves. Groves had always suspected him of having Russian sympathies, and now deemed him too high a security risk. Forced to change field, Szilard was indeed prescient in choosing molecular biology, which less than a decade later would uncover "the secret of life" in the form of the structure of DNA.My father's exemplary tale unravels further when we consider the way it presents the progress towards a functioning atomic bomb. It narrates a smooth development from Rutherford's lecture in London, through Szilard's (and his fellow-emigres') journey from Nazi Germany via London to the United States, and Szilard's single-minded preoccupation with the potential threat of nuclear weapons, to the Manhattan Project, and finally to its very American triumphant - or tragic - outcome.But actually Szilard the Hungarian had carried out the crucial early research with the Italian emigre Enrico Fermi, continuing it with him in the early years of the Manhattan Project, where the two of them succeeded in creating a controlled chain reaction - a prerequisite for a functioning bomb. Meanwhile, independently in Britain considerable progress was being made towards a nuclear weapon (a project code-named "Tube Alloys") with the direct encouragement of the prime minister Winston Churchill (who as Graham Farmelo tells us in a recent book, was surprisingly up-to-date himself in nuclear physics). In September 1940 the so-called Tizard mission delivered the top secret work of Tube Alloys to the Americans, to be developed with the greater manpower and financial resources available in the US. The British work made its own vital contribution to the project.Here is a much more fragmented, syncopated and international story, in which it is entirely unclear whether any one nation ultimately takes the credit or blame for the science and engineering behind the atomic bomb. Nor does it carry the clear didactic message of my original.There is one final twist to what started out as a simple story. Some of you will have noticed that I gave the date of Szilard's eureka moment at that traffic light on Southampton Row as October 1933. You may have had a date in September in your mind. The truth is, Szilard tells the story twice, as I mentioned. In one version he records reading the Times report and immediately having the idea of a chain reaction (on 12 September). In the other he recalls fretting over the problem for weeks in his hotel room and pacing the streets of London deep in thought, until the idea eventually came to him (in early October).So although the beginning of the story comes from the mouth of the man himself, we cannot be certain which version is correct. As a historian I have chosen the second as the more plausible, particularly in view of that heavy cold which Szilard tells us prevented his attending Rutherford's lecture on 11 September. But that remains surmise.Historical narratives are never without their agendas. My father's generation lived under the shadow of Hiroshima and Nagasaki - he had been sent to do reconnaissance there only a few months after the bombs were dropped and had seen the consequences all too close up. He told me a story which redeemed the scientist from the enormity of events brought about by fundamental research in physics. It was a story that held the scientist responsible for lethal applications of "pure" research, and proposed Szilard as an iconic figure, for recognising and taking that responsibility upon himself.My father's story of Leo Szilard may not have been the truth. But it taught me, as a child, a lasting, salutary lesson about science and human values.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <body>Demonstrators have staged events across England in opposition to planned changes to legal aid.Campaign group UK Uncut said hundreds had protested in town and cities such as London, Manchester and Northampton.It said plans aimed at saving £220m from the criminal legal aid bill in England and Wales would "block access to justice for millions of people".The Ministry of Justice says legal aid costs too much and can not be "immune" to efficiency commitments.Proposals for possible savings include stopping defendants with a disposable income of more than £37,500 from automatically receiving legal aid, and curbing prisoners' right to legal aid.Legal aid costs taxpayers about £2bn every year, with criminal defence making up more than half of the expenditure.The government says the situation is unsustainable and wants to see fewer, bigger organisations providing legal aid as part of a streamlined system.However, the Bar Council has argued this would result in the end of the long-standing right of a defendant to choose a legal aid solicitor, saying people would effectively be allocated a representative on the basis of cost.Some groups have also expressed fears that the changes could deny justice to the poorest in society.UK Uncut said protests had taken place in London, Manchester, Hull, Liverpool, Northampton, Cambridge and Norwich on Saturday.In London, demonstrators gathered on the Strand at about 12:00 BST to set up a roadblock.Many protesters sat on the road and others put their bicycles in the way of traffic.The area was reopened around two hours later when the demonstration was contained in a smaller area.Protesters also held a mock trial for Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, and attached a banner to the fence of the court building which warned: "No justice, no peace."The Metropolitan Police did not comment when asked about the number of protesters.But the City of London Police said it had warned the group they were stopping the emergency services from travelling around the capital.UK Uncut said roadblocks had also been set up in Manchester, Northampton and Cambridge.Spokesman David Conway said: "The government's plans will block access to justice for millions of people."We're blocking roads to make a stand against that and to make it clear how strongly people around the country oppose these outrageous plans."People will have to represent themselves in court and get compensation much later than they should."An MoJ spokesman said: "We have one of the best legal professions in the world, but cannot close our eyes to the fact that - at around £2bn - legal aid is costing too much."He said the government's planned reforms would create a sustainable legal aid system that would "still be one of the most generous in the world".The spokesman added: "At a time when major financial challenges are being felt by businesses and households across the country, the legal sector cannot be immune from the government's commitment to getting better value for every penny of taxpayers' money we spend."Plans to remove the right for defendants in criminal cases in England and Wales to choose their solicitor under the legal aid system were scrapped in July.The government had planned to put the onus on lawyers competing for contracts, but has said it now recognises that choice is seen as "fundamental".Send your pictures and videos to yourpics@bbc.co.uk or text them to 61124 (UK) or +44 7624 800 100 (International).

      <title>Sarwar pledge over Pakistan murder</title>
      <description>The new governor of the Punjab tells the family of an Inverclyde woman that he will do everything possible to have her killers brought to justice.</description>

      <body>The new governor of the Punjab, Mohammad Sarwar, has told the family of an Inverclyde woman that he will do everything possible to have her killers brought to justice.Mumtaz Sattar, 38, from Port Glasgow, was murdered just hours after arriving in Pakistan last month.Her relatives have petitioned the High Court in Lahore, naming a suspect.Her brother Sarfraz Ali and family solicitor Aamer Anwar met Mr Sarwar in Glasgow on Saturday.Mr Sarwar, who became Britain's first Muslim MP in 1997 when he won the Glasgow Govan seat, renounced his British citizenship in August ahead of his inauguration as governor of Pakistan's most populous province.Speaking after the meeting, he told BBC Scotland he had been in contact with the Punjab police almost every day since Mrs Sattar's murder, and had told them he wanted the case investigated by senior officers.He added: "I want to assure the family and the people of Scotland that justice will be done."Senior police officials are doing the investigations on the case and I have confidence in our police force in Punjab and the legal system that they will do their best to make sure that the person who has committed this heinous crime is brought to justice."Mr Anwar said the meeting with Mr Sarwar had been "extremely valuable".He added: "Mr Sarwar arranged a conference call with senior police officers and formal requests have now been made for the police to co-operate with Police Scotland and with ourselves in order that this murder inquiry can be solved."He has been able to cut through the bureaucracy. He has also put the spotlight on this case and said that every pressure must be brought to bear in order to bring the killers of Mumtaz Sattar to justice."Mrs Sattar's husband Abdul, 40, is in police custody.He told officers he and his wife were drugged and attacked by two men during a taxi ride on the way from the airport to see his parents in Punjab on Saturday 21 September.He said they were thrown out of a moving car and that his wife died from the head injuries she suffered.Scottish Police are helping Pakistani authorities with their investigation.On Friday, Mr Anwar told BBC Scotland Mrs Sattar's relatives had serious concerns about the Pakistani police investigation into Mrs Sattar's death.He said: "A serious allegation has been made of bribery of police officers that are involved in the case."At each and every turn the family appears to have been obstructed, as a result of which advocates lodged a petition at the High Court in Lahore yesterday in which they name one murder suspect and ask for the authorities to bring the police officers concerned to the High Court to answer questions."</body>

      <title>Greens 'key' to securing Yes vote</title>

      <body>The Scottish Greens could play a key role in convincing Scots to vote for independence in next year's referendum, the party's conference has been told.Co-convener Patrick Harvie said "canny" voters would not be persuaded into voting Yes next September with "flags, bribes or fearmongering".He said Scots could be won over with a "radical vision" of what the country could be like after leaving the UK.Mr Harvie was speaking as the two-day conference opened in Inverness.The people of Scotland will be asked the straight yes/no question "Should Scotland be an independent country?" when they vote in the independence referendum on 18 September 2014.At last year's conference members voted to endorse the cross-party Yes Scotland campaign for independence.At the same time the party agreed to form its own pro-independence campaign, designed to promote its distinct policies.Mr Harvie, one of the Greens' two MSPs at Holyrood, said: "Many Scots remain undecided on independence and they have every right to take their time, as creating a new country is undoubtedly a radical step."These canny voters won't be persuaded by flags, bribes or fearmongering but I believe they will respond to a radical vision for a better Scotland and the Scottish Greens are crucial to outlining that vision."Taking responsibility and bringing power closer to the people is a core Green principle, and our conference is a chance for us to galvanise our party and amplify our message."He added: "This is a big decision about Scotland's long-term future."As Greens we're used to thinking big and it's in our DNA to think ahead, so let's seize the day."Mr Harvie argued that at this time the "Green vision for Scotland has never been more important", adding that his party offered "the vision of a renewed economy that works for the many rather than the few and a sustainable society that cares about future generations".He said: "The clock is ticking on the need to tackle climate change and a Green Scotland would be better placed to develop the low-carbon society we need."</body>

      <body>Protests over a contentious Orange Order parade will be increased "right up to civil disobedience", according to a senior Orangeman in Belfast.William Mawhinney was speaking at a protest over restrictions to a 12 July parade in the north of the city.That parade was stopped returning along part of the Crumlin Road separating loyalist and nationalist communities. Several nights of violence ensued.Mr Mawhinney said any "civil disobedience" would be peaceful.The County Grand Secretary in Belfast was addressing a crowd of about 500 people on the Woodvale Road on Saturday.He said the parade protests will be "up-scaled... right up to civil disobedience if that's what it takes".He added: "The camp and the protests continue as strongly as they ever did from when they first began."Mr Mawhinney was flanked by a number of politicians, including Nelson McCausland of the Democratic Unionist Party.There is a large security operation in place on the Woodvale Road and at the interface between Twaddell Avenue and Ardoyne shops on the Crumlin Road.More than 40 police vehicles are in the area.The Orange Order has been staging a protest in the Woodvale area every Saturday since its parade was stopped earlier this year.</body>

      <body>A north Belfast man has appeared in court charged with firearms offences.Stephen Jones, 49, from Cliftonville Avenue, is charged with having a rifle magazine and 29 bullets under suspicious circumstances on 24 September.He was remanded into custody.Belfast Magistrates' Court was told on Saturday that it was not the first time the accused had faced a court and that he had been wrongfully remanded into jail two weeks ago.A police officer told the court he believed he could connect Mr Jones to the charges.Solicitor Philip Breen argued however that as Jones had initially been charged and remanded into jail on legislation that did not exist, "I have issues about the legality of this remand".He revealed that the police and PPS mistake was spotted on Friday and Mr Jones was released but then re-arrested.Mr Breen submitted there "would have to be some change" to permit the same charges to be brought before the court.District Judge Ken Nixon disagreed and said that the charge was "quite rightly before the court".He remanded Jones back into custody to appear again via video link on 1 November.</body>

      <title>Welsh language direct action warning</title>

      <body>Language campaigners say they will start a campaign of non-violent direct action unless government policies to protect Welsh are put in place.The motion with a deadline of February 2014 was passed at the Welsh Language Society's (Cymdeithas Yr Iaith's) annual meeting in Carno, Powys.The 2011 census figures showed a drop in the number of Welsh speakers.The Welsh government said it was committed to seeing the language prosper.A Welsh government spokesperson said: "Cymdeithas must understand that those in government are as committed to growing the Welsh language and increasing the number of Welsh speakers as they are."This is not the 1960s or 70s."Welsh Language Society chairman Robin Farrar said: "Nearly a year has passed since we saw the results of the census, and since then there has been a lot of talk and discussion about the situation regarding the language."There is by now a consensus that the Welsh language is facing an emergency and that we need big policy changes."We have said since the publication of the census results that we can't sit back and accept the consequences, with positive campaigning and political will we can change our destiny and the destinies of our Welsh language communities."If the government refuses to act on the six points we have outlined we will take direct but non-violent action."We have drawn up a list of people who are willing to act - campaigns like this have worked in the past and we're ready to do it again."The Welsh government spokesperson added: "We are committed to promoting the Welsh language and since the census results we have been taking action. "He said measures included a national conversation on the language, which gave everyone a chance to have their say on how best to secure its future."We have commissioned a number of reviews and studies, and will be receiving their reports soon. This autumn we will also be launching an information campaign for Welsh medium education."Meanwhile, we will be working with all those with an interest in the language to ensure it continues to thrive throughout Wales."</body>

      <title>Libyan gunmen kill 15 soldiers</title>
      <description>Gunmen attack military checkpoint south-east of the Libyan capital Tripoli killing 15 soldiers and injuring several others, officials say.</description>

      <date>1380981038</date>
      <body>Gunmen have attacked a military checkpoint south-east of the Libyan capital Tripoli killing 15 soldiers, the authorities say.A military official said the attack was near Bani Walid, a stronghold in 2011 of supporters of former leader, Muammar Gaddafi.Several more soldiers were injured in the incident.It is not clear who carried out the attack, but the government has struggled to control armed groups.The official, describing it as an ambush, said the attack took place on a road between Bani Walid city and the town of Tarhouna.The troops came under heavy fire from the gunmen who drove vehicles with mounted machine guns, the official said.The authorities say four soldiers were injured in the shootings in the Wishtata district.The main road to Bani Walid was closed while the incident was investigated. It was the single largest known killing of military personnel since the 2011 civil war.Six soldiers from an elite special forces unit were shot dead in June in the eastern city of Benghazi by masked gunmen. Another six soldiers were killed - also in June - at a checkpoint south of Sirte.The lack of central government control over large swathes of Libya has left room for armed groups linked to clans and Islamist militants to thrive, analysts say.Much of the recent violence has been blamed on groups which grew out of the rebel movement behind the overthrow of Col Gaddafi in 2011.Military officers and other members of the security apparatus are among those to have been targeted in recent weeks.The lack of security in Libya has also been highlighted this year by clashes in Benghazi as protesters demanded the disbandment of militias.Gunmen surrounded ministries in Tripoli earlier this year demanding the sacking of officials who worked during Gaddafi's rule.The army is seen as out-manned and out-gunned by a mix of armed groups seemingly pursuing different agendas, says the BBC's Rana Jawad in Tripoli.With the surge of attacks of this kind in recent months, many feel there is a sustained campaign to counter the formation of a strong army, our correspondent adds.</body>

      <title>Tunisia power transfer deal agreed</title>

      <date>1380987249</date>
      <body>Tunisia's governing Islamist Ennahda party and the opposition have agreed on the appointment of a caretaker government in the coming weeks.Under the deal signed after talks in Tunis, a cabinet of independent figures will be in power until fresh elections.Last month Ennahda agreed in principle to relinquish power, in an effort to end Tunisia's political deadlock.The crisis was triggered by the assassinations of two opposition leaders earlier this year.It has threatened to disrupt a democratic transition that began after Tunisians threw out their decades-old authoritarian government at the beginning of the 2011 uprisings, widely referred to as the Arab Spring.Talks between Ennahda and the National Salvation Front-led opposition are being mediated by the UGTT labour union.Under the agreement signed on Saturday, the two sides are to hold further negotiations on the formation of the new technocratic cabinet within three or four weeks.The caretaker government is to supervise new elections.Correspondents say the agreement represents a setback for the moderate Islamist Ennahda Party, which has run the country since winning elections in October 2011.The opposition has accused Ennahda of pushing an Islamist agenda on a traditionally secular nation.The rivalry intensified after the murders of prominent left-wing figure Chokri Belaid in February and opposition politician Mohammed Brahmi in July.Ennahda condemned the killings but the opposition accused it of failing to rein in radical Islamists.</body>

      <title>US commitment to Asia 'undiminished'</title>
      <description>The US remains committed to Asia despite the shutdown that forced President Obama to cancel planned trips, Secretary of State John Kerry says.</description>

      <body>The US commitment to Asia remains undiminished despite President Barack Obama's absence from regional summits, Secretary of State John Kerry has said.Mr Kerry was speaking at the start of the Apec summit in Indonesia.Mr Obama cancelled his Asia trip after the partial US government shutdown.The US government closed non-essential operations on Tuesday after Congress failed to agree a new budget. Thousands of federal employees have been sent home. Some are working but not paid.US-EU trade negotiations have also been postponed because of the shutdown.As world leaders began gathering for the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Bali, Mr Kerry sought to allay concerns that Washington was reducing its global engagement."None of what is happening in Washington diminishes one iota our commitment to our partners in Asia," he said.He said the dispute with the Republicans in the US Congress was "an example of the robustness of our democracy".But at the same time, he urged Congress to think about how the US was perceived internationally when "we can't get our own act together".Mr Kerry said areas where the shutdown was affecting US foreign policy funding included:Mr Obama had been due to begin a four-nation Asian trip on Saturday, heading to Bali and Brunei before travelling on to Malaysia and the Philippines.The White House said Mr Obama's decision to cancel his Asia trip was made due to the "difficulty in moving forward with foreign travel in the face of a shutdown".Republicans who control the House of Representatives refused to approve a budget, saying they would only do so if Mr Obama's healthcare reform law was delayed or stripped of funding.Mr Obama and the Democrats have refused, noting the law was passed in 2010, subsequently approved by the Supreme Court, and was a central issue in the 2012 election which Mr Obama won comfortably.On Friday, Democrats and Republicans appeared no closer to finding a way out of the impasse.Republican House Speaker John Boehner insisted Mr Obama and Democratic Senate leaders open negotiations on the shutdown."All we're asking for is to sit down and have a discussion," he said. "This isn't some damn game."Mr Obama later said he was happy to hold talks with the Republicans, "but we can't do it with a gun held to the head of the American people".The US also faces running out of money and defaulting on its debt if there is no agreement to raise government borrowing limits later this month.US officials had been due in Brussels next week to discuss a sweeping free trade pact designed to boost bilateral trade between the European Union and the US.On Friday, US trade representative Michael Froman informed the EU that financial and staffing constraints made it impossible to send a full negotiating team to Brussels.He stressed that Washington would continue working with the EU on drawing up the deal, but would have to wait until the shutdown was over.Reacting to the US announcement, European Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht said the delay was unfortunate."But let me underline that it in no way distracts us from our overall aim of achieving an ambitious trade and investment deal," he added.Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said warned earlier that a failure to raise the US debt ceiling would be a far worse threat to the global economy than the current shutdown.She said it was "mission critical" that the US agreed a new debt limit.</body>

      <body>A disabled Chinese activist whose imprisonment caused international concern has been released from prison.Ni Yulan, a lawyer who helped defend property rights, was freed after serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence for causing a public disturbance.She said her illness had not been treated during her detention and she was now in poor health.But the 54 year old insists she will fight on, and threatened to sue police and seek redress."If we don't fight for rights, we will just have to wait for our death," she told Reuters news agency."I want them to return my assets. They've torn down my home without giving any compensation, leaving us homeless."Ni was detained during a wave of arrests in 2011 and initially received a 32-month jail sentence.She says the charges were trumped up to stop her work defending people evicted from their homes.Last year an appeals court in China dismissed her fraud conviction, reducing her jail time by two months. However, she remained in jail on a separate disturbance charge.Her husband Dong Jiqin was also given a jail sentence.Both are known for providing legal help to people whose homes have been seized by the government.Ni uses a wheelchair - a consequence, she and her supporters say, of mistreatment by police over the years.</body>

      <body>Negotiations on a sweeping free trade pact between the US and the EU have been postponed because of a partial government shutdown in America.US officials had been due in Brussels next week to discuss the deal aimed at boosting bilateral ties.US President Barack Obama earlier cancelled his trip to Asia because of the shutdown.The US government closed non-essential operations on Tuesday after Congress failed to agree a new budget.Since then hundreds of thousands of government employees have not been working or paid.On Friday, US trade representative Michael Froman informed the EU that financial and staffing constraints made it impossible to send a full negotiating team to Brussels.But he stressed that Washington would continue working with the EU on drawing up the deal, but would have to wait until the shutdown was over.Reacting to the US announcement, European Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht said the delay was unfortunate."But let me underline that it in no way distracts us from our overall aim of achieving an ambitious trade and investment deal," he added.Meanwhile, the White House said that Mr Obama would miss two summits in Asia, including the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) meeting in Indonesia.It said the decision was made due to the "difficulty in moving forward with foreign travel in the face of a shutdown".Mr Obama called Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on Friday and expressed his regret over the cancellation, Indonesian presidential spokesman for foreign affairs Teuku Faizasyah told the BBC.The visit had not been rescheduled, the spokesman added.Secretary of State John Kerry will attend the Apec gathering and the East Asia summit in Brunei in Mr Obama's place, the White House said.President Obama had been due to begin a four-nation Asian trip on Saturday, heading to Bali and Brunei before travelling on to Malaysia and the Philippines.The US government partially shut down operations on Tuesday after Republicans who control the House of Representatives refused to approve a budget, saying they would only do so if Mr Obama's healthcare reform law was delayed or stripped of funding.Mr Obama and the Democrats have refused, noting the law was passed in 2010, subsequently approved by the Supreme Court, and was a central issue in the 2012 election which Mr Obama won comfortably.On Friday, Democrats and Republicans appeared no closer to finding a way out of the impasse.Republican House Speaker John Boehner insisted Mr Obama and Democratic Senate leaders open negotiations on the shutdown."All we're asking for is to sit down and have a discussion," he said.

"We know there are the votes for it in the House of Representatives. If Speaker Boehner will simply allow the vote to take place, we can end this shutdown."The US also faces running out of money and defaulting on its debt if there is no agreement to raise government borrowing limits later this month.Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said warned earlier that a failure to raise the US debt ceiling would be a far worse threat to the global economy than the current shutdown.She said it was "mission critical" that the US agreed a new debt limit.Ms Lagarde's comments were echoed by the US Treasury.It said a debt default could lead to a financial crisis as bad as 2008 or worse.Meanwhile, the impact of the shutdown was being felt across the country.The National Transportation Safety Board did not send investigators to a deadly church bus crash in Tennessee that killed eight people and injured 14 others.The labour department also postponed the release of the highly anticipated September jobs report.With Tropical Storm Karen bearing down on the Gulf states, the website of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), carried a message saying: "Due to the federal government shutdown, NOAA.gov and most associated web sites are unavailable."It referred visitors to the National Weather Service.However, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) recalled workers to help prepare for the storm.On Friday, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said the House would vote on a measure to re-open Fema as well as the National Weather Service to deal with the impending storm.</body>

      <body>Rafael Nadal will return to number one in the world rankings on Monday after reaching the final of the China Open.Nadal, 27, was leading fourth seed Tomas Berdych 4-2 in the first set of their semi-final when his Czech opponent retired with a back injury."This is a great year, one of the best of my career," said the Spaniard, who won the French Open and US Open and was last top of the rankings  in July 2011.Nadal will play current world number one Novak Djokovic in Sunday's final.The Serb breezed past France's Richard Gasquet 6-4 6-2 in his semi-final.Nadal broke serve in the fifth game and Berdych, who said he injured his back while reaching for a shot, retired a game later after receiving treatment."It is special to be back to the top position of the rankings after more than half a year without playing tennis," added Nadal."What makes me happy is everything I did to be back where I am."Berdych praised Nadal's achievement in regaining the top spot from Djokovic, who had taken over from the Spaniard more than two years ago.Nadal returned to action in February after seven months on the sidelines with knee problems and has won 10 of the 12 finals he has contested since making his comeback, taking his Grand Slam victories up to 13."With Rafa, well, just all the credit," said Berdych. "It is really incredibly well done in the short time that he has become a number one again. That's really an achievement for an athlete like him."Djokovic has spent 101 weeks as world number one.He was knocked off top spot in July 2012 by Roger Federer, after the Swiss player beat Andy Murray in the Wimbledon final, but returned to number one in November.Nadal had been assured of reclaiming the top spot if he reached the final in Beijing or Djokovic failed to defend his title.He has not lost a match since he was beaten by Belgian world number 135 Steve Darcis in the first round at Wimbledon in June. He has won his last 21 matches and 65 of the 68 he has played this season.</body>

      <body>Police in Mexico have arrested one of Guatemala's most wanted men - a drug lord suspected of masterminding the killing of eight policemen in June.Eduardo Villatoro Cano - also known as Guayo Cano - was detained in the southern Chiapas state and later handed over to Guatemala.Mr Cano and another 36 men are blamed for the attack on the police station in north-western Guatemala.President Otto Perez Molina said Mr Cano's gang had now been dismantled.Nine police officers were on night duty at the remote police station in Salcaja on 13 June when heavily armed men entered the building and shot at them at least 40 times, investigators said.The police station is located near the Pan-American highway, in Quetzaltenango department.Eight policemen were killed on the spot. Their commander was taken away by the gang and is presumed dead.The massacre had a big impact in Guatemala and angered the authorities, who have vowed to punish the perpetrators.The Central American nation is being increasingly used as a transit route for cocaine produced in Colombia and smuggled into Mexico and the United States.Guatemala has one of the world's highest homicide rates, says the the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), with 38.5 crimes per 100,000 population in 2011.</body>

      <title>Argentina seeks jail for de la Rua</title>
      <description>Prosecutors in Argentina request a six-year prison term for former President Fernando de la Rua over a bribery scandal.</description>

      <body>Prosecutors in Argentina have asked for a six-year prison term for former president Fernando de la Rua.He has been accused of paying some $5m (£3m) to a group of senators for them to vote in favour of a controversial labour reform bill in 2000.Five former opposition senators are also facing six-year prison sentences over the scandal.Mr de la Rua, 76, denies all the charges and says the accusations against him are politically motivated.The trial began in August and a verdict is not expected until next year.More than 300 witnesses are expected to testify, including President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who voted against the bill and is not accused of taking a bribe.A key witness is Mr de la Rua's former parliamentary secretary, Mario Pontaquarto, who pleaded guilty and agreed to collaborate with prosecutors.Prosecutors have asked for an 18-month suspended jail term for him.Mr Pontaquarto accused the president of giving him orders to offer the bribes to a group of senators to make sure the measure was approved.The legislation was controversial as it scrapped many rights of Argentine workers.It was eventually approved, but revoked two years later.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was at the time demanding public sector cuts from the government as a pre-condition to approve new loans.The crisis got worse as the end of 2001 approached. Angry protests took place on the streets after the banks refused to let customers withdraw their deposits.Mr de la Rua ended up encircled by angry protests at the presidential palace, the Casa Rosada.He resigned on 20 December 2001 and left the presidential palace in a helicopter.Last year, a high court in Argentina dismissed homicide charges against Mr de la Rua over the riots, in which more than 20 people were killed.The court ruled as legitimate his decision to declare a state of siege to deal with the protests.</body>

      <title>Four dead as Egyptian clashes erupt</title>
      <description>Four people have been killed in Egypt as supporters of ousted President Mohammed Morsi take to the streets in defiance of the army-backed government.</description>

      <body>Four people have been killed in Egypt as supporters of ousted President Mohammed Morsi clashed with opponents and security forces.Medical officials said at least 40 others were hurt as gunfire and explosions rocked the centre of Cairo.Troops used tear gas and live rounds to halt crowds heading to Tahrir Square.The square has since been sealed off to prevent pro-Morsi supporters occupying the symbolic heart of the 2011 uprising which ousted Hosni Mubarak.Reports said the four fatalities were all Brotherhood supporters who died amid fighting in two Cairo neighbourhoods.As clashes broke out in the capital, state TV reported further violence in the northern Sharqiya district and to the east in Giza, as well as in the northern port city of Alexandria.There were also reports of skirmishes between pro-Morsi demonstrators and civilian supporters of the military government.The BBC's correspondent in Cairo, Quentin Sommerville, said that by early evening all was quiet on the streets of Cairo, ahead of the early Friday curfew at 1900 local time (1700 GMT).A heavy security presence remained, he said.Hundreds of Islamist protesters have died in violence since the Egyptian military deposed Mr Morsi in July, 13 months after he was elected as president.Thousands of members of the Muslim Brotherhood have also been detained over the past two months.Several senior figures, including Mr Morsi and the movement's general guide Mohammed Badie, are being held on charges such as incitement to violence and murder.Egyptian authorities portray the crackdown as a struggle against "terrorism". They are preparing to seize Muslim Brotherhood assets after appeal courts upheld a recent ban on its activities.Our correspondent says the protesters in the capital's Agouza district were chanting "Rabaa, Rabaa", a reference to the square next to the Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque where a sit-in was cleared by force in August.Troops also took up positions on both sides of Qasr al-Nil Bridge, which leads to Tahrir Square.As protesters pushed towards Tahrir, police and security forces used teargas and warning shots fired overhead to disperse the crowds.Before Friday's clashes, soldiers and police tightened security around key sites in Cairo, including Tahrir.Morsi supporters have said they will be intensifying their demonstrations in the lead-up to Sunday's 40th anniversary of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.Opponents who back the army have also said they will take to the streets.In a statement issued on Thursday, the Brotherhood sharply criticised the officers behind the overthrow of Mr Morsi, comparing them to Adolf Hitler, the Roman emperor Nero and the Mongol conqueror Hulagu Khan.It urged Egyptian soldiers to rebel and said it hoped that Sunday would mark a "victory by the people over those who staged a coup against them for personal gain".On Thursday, the European Union's foreign policy chief, Baroness Catherine Ashton, held talks with armed forces chief Gen Abdul Fattah al-Sisi and interim President Adly Mansour, as well as with religious leaders."I got a real sense of everyone really trying to go forward in the right way," she told reporters afterwards.A day earlier, a 16-year-old boy was killed in clashes between Morsi supporters and opponents in the Red Sea city of Suez.Send your pictures and videos to yourpics@bbc.co.uk or text them to 61124 (UK) or +44 7624 800 100 (International).

      <title>Four weddings and a shutdown</title>
      <description>Four big days scuppered by US shutdown</description>

      <body>As disagreements in Congress mean that "closed" signs hang outside national parks across the US, four couples explain how they've coped with their wedding venues being suddenly out of bounds.When Natasha Juliao and Sean Coughlin walked on to Paramount Ranch just outside Los Angeles, they knew they had found their perfect wedding venue."The second that we stepped on the property, I knew it was where I was going to get married and we were jumping up and down and giddy," gushed bride-to-be Natasha.So when she found out that the bohemian ghost town would be closed for her big day, she was crushed. "I immediately had a nervous breakdown and started crying at work, it was awful. I had no idea what to do."With family and friends flying in from places as far as Taiwan, postponing the wedding was not an option. Unable to get a refund, Juliao and Coughlin, a nursing assistant and production co-ordinator, were nearly out of time and money to find an alternative. Then, through a stroke of fate and a stranger's kindness, Natasha managed to put together a new wedding in two days.The owner of Wooden Nickel Ranch, two hours away from their original venue, found out about the couple's story in local media and then discovered she had a cancellation for the same Sunday.Feeling for the couple's misfortune, she knocked down the starting price by 90%. Still a bit shaky from the entire ordeal, Natasha praised her wedding day hero: "She was really an angel for us."Hoping to create an intimate setting for their families' first encounter, Drake Lucas and Zach Kouwe spent more than a year poring over Pinterest, planning a low-key wedding in California's Yosemite National Park."Ironically," Drake noted, "we chose it because we thought it would be stress-free." But with the park closed, the Brooklyn couple are scrambling to put together a plan B wedding in San Francisco, a five-hour drive away.From the flowers to the venue, everything has to be found in less than a week, which means nothing will be quite as they envisaged.In the midst of her hectic attempts to salvage her big day, Lucas, a grant-writer at Human Rights Watch, has some words of wisdom for Congress."If I can just share a little of the advice I've been given during my engagement, I might be able to help us all out. It's called compromise."I hear you have to do a lot of it in marriage, and it seems to me that you should have to do a lot of it in your job, too. You can't just give up if you don't get your way."And you have to pay your bills on time. Because we are in this for the long haul and there are enough real problems we will have to weather - there is no need to create ones you can prevent.""I never thought I'd hike in a wedding dress."As an endurance athlete, Genevieve Jeuck knew how to push through in tough situations. But when she found out that her Grand Canyon dream wedding would be off limits, she stopped in her tracks."I got the call Thursday night. I cried. I was freaking out, and then I thought I was turning into a 'Bridezilla.'"Jeuck, a violinist, and her fiance Michael Sallemi, a Harley Davidson salesman, hadn't connected the dots between the government shutdown and the national parks closing.And with less than six days until the 2 October wedding, all options were on the table. But then the New Jersey couple were able to relocate to Sedona, Arizona, and the last-second wedding included an unexpected hike in the white dress.Though she never cared for politics before, the new bride has spent her honeymoon closely following the effects of the shutdown throughout the country.Angry and impassioned, Jeuck has vowed that her days of apathy are over. "Now, I'm sorry I'm following and I'm voting and I'm doing everything I can to have a say."MaiLien and Michael - wedding Saturday, Washington DCMaiLien Le and Michael Cassesso had planned a romantic wedding at the Jefferson Memorial, where they met for their first date more than four years ago.Having worked in politics, the couple are no stranger to Capitol Hill antics, but that didn't soften the blow as their wedding became a casualty of the latest Washington crisis."It's gut-wrenching, frustrating, aggravating, disheartening to have our wedding turned upside down like that," says Cassesso, a legislative analyst. Le, a project co-ordinator at an executive search firm, had a more intuitive reaction, with an expletive.As strangers started donating to their wedding gift registry, Cassesso and Le directed the funds to The Covenant House, a charity for homeless young people, a group the couple think will be adversely affected by the shutdown.They have found another venue for Saturday's wedding in Washington DC, and he says the ordeal has a silver lining."Throughout all this there was no fighting, no arguing," Cassesso says. "It confirmed for me even more than I already knew that this is going to last, this is the right choice."</body>

      <title>Legacy of 1973 Arab-Israeli war reverberates 40 years on</title>
      <description>How 1973 Arab-Israeli war reverberates 40 years on</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24402464</url>
      <date>1380976230</date>
      <body>Israel closes down for the fasting, repentance and prayer of Yom Kippur - the day of atonement.So complete is the suspension of everyday life that traffic stops and normal broadcasting is suspended.It is the holiest day in the Jewish calendar - and Israel's moment of greatest vulnerability.In 1973, Egyptian and Syrian military planners chose it as the perfect moment for a combined surprise attack on the Jewish state - the war changed the world and we all live with its effects to this day.The Arab attacks were an effort to reverse the humiliating defeats of 1967 in which Israel had redrawn the map of the Middle East with stunning speed.The Israelis captured the vast Sinai Desert from Egypt, the Golan Heights from Syria and the West Bank of the River Jordan and the eastern part of Jerusalem from the Jordanians.Egypt and Syria at least were determined to recapture their territory - and to restore national pride.The Egyptian General Sameh Elyazal was a young officer injured when his tank was hit by a missile fired from an Israeli aircraft in the war of '67. He has a piece of shrapnel lodged inside him to this day.He explains the thinking in Cairo in 1973 like this: "When we came back from '67 you could feel the way people looked at you .... as if to say 'you don't deserve our respect'. Even our families were saying that our country deserved better so we thought we have no other way of correcting this impression than getting the Sinai peninsula back."When the attack came Israel was stunned. Out of nowhere it found itself facing a war of national survival on two fronts.In the South, Egyptian commandos crossed the Suez Canal heading eastwards into the Sinai capturing the Israeli forts on the West Bank of the Suez Canal. In the North, Syrian tank regiments swept on to the Golan Heights.The Israeli commanders scrambled to mobilise their reserves - the national radio service which had fallen silent for Yom Kippur began broadcasting a special news bulletin punctuated by code words that recalled soldiers to their military units.The future Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was a graduate student at Stanford University in the United States in 1973.But he'd already served as a commander in Israel's elite commando unit the Sayeret Matkal and as soon as he heard the news from home he packed his bags and said goodbye to his wife and young daughter.When he got home he headed straight for the underground bunker known as The Hole from which Israel's armed forces are run. The atmosphere wasn't good."I saw faces grey like dust," Barak says now, "It was one of the lowest points of the war."Gradually Israel's forces began to rally - and to gain ground as they counter-attacked. But the complacency that was a dangerous by-product of the easy victories of 1967 was punctured and so was the sense of invulnerability which had gone with it.Then, as now, events in the Middle East mattered - and resonated far beyond the region.In the early 1970s the Cold War was at its height and just about any theatre of conflict on earth was effectively a proxy war between the Communist Soviet Union and the power bloc that styled itself the Free World, led by the United States.Russian military 'advisers' went into combat with the Syrians and supplied arms and ammunition to the Arab nations.The United States backed Israel. The bottom line was that the Israelis had chosen - or been chosen by - the right superpower. The Americans made better weapons and they were better at getting them to the war.So the tide of battle turned and after at least one false start ceasefire negotiations eventually produced an end to hostilities. When it came, Israeli forces were not far from the gates of Damascus and were only 100 kilometres from Cairo.The war had been short, but it changed the world.Arab oil exporters who dominated the global energy market at the time decided to punish the West for backing Israel by using what it called ''The Oil Weapon".Prices were suddenly hiked and output was cut.There were fuel shortages, a stock market crash and a global economic slowdown whose effects were felt for years. The 55 mph speed limit on some federal roads in the United States dates from the period when desperate attempts were made to save fuel.Europe and the United States began cultivating alternative oil suppliers and thinking about alternative energy and fuel saving. The death knell was sounded for the gas-guzzling car.Diplomatically Egypt drifted out of the Soviet sphere of influence and became an ally of the United States.It got the Sinai peninsula back in the end but through diplomacy, not war - under American chairmanship it signed a peace treaty with the Israelis a few years after the guns fell silent. The Camp David accords were one of the most important diplomatic achievements of the post-war era.The Arab nations probably concluded privately that they would never defeat Israel in a conventional war. The fighting may have seen the last major tank clashes of history. Armoured vehicles it turned out were too vulnerable to missile fire from aircraft.But Israel was forced to conclude too that it couldn't take easy victories for granted and that the Egyptian army in particular could stand and fight.In the period of introspection that followed the war and the intelligence failures that led up to it, senior politicians and military officials lost their jobs.But the most depressing legacy is perhaps this.If you go up to the Israeli side of the ceasefire line on the Golan Heights today you can find ruined and abandoned armoured vehicles preserved as monuments.You can look into Syria and watch and listen as the Syrian army directs tank and artillery fire onto towns and villages where it claims rebel forces are hiding out.It is evidence of how close the Syrian war has come to history's old battlefields - and a reminder that, in the Middle East, the uncertainties of the future always feel more pressing than the glories and the agonies of the past.</body>

      <body>A two-year-old girl born with a condition which means her brain forgets to tell her to breathe is about to leave hospital for the first time.Maisie Harris from Gillingham, Kent has been at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London since being transferred from Medway Maritime at three months old.She has congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), also known as Ondine's Curse.A new, portable ventilator has enabled Maisie to go home.The machine knows when she is able to take her own breaths and when she is likely to have a CCHS episode and require support.It has batteries and a carry case, so Maisie, who is three on 23 October, will be able to go on outings with her family and go to school when she is older.Staff on Great Ormond Street's Miffy Ward held a party for her on Friday, before she leaves hospital on Monday."We cannot wait to bring Maisie home and enjoy being a normal family," said her mother Rachel Bridger, 23."It's felt as though we have been in hospital for a lifetime."Everyone here has become like a second family to us - they know Maisie inside out."She knows her own mind but she is a really happy little girl - she's hardly ever upset."I don't think it will take her long to get used to playing with her toys at home and sleeping in her own bed for the first time."Maisie, who featured in BBC2's Great Ormond Street series last year, also has malacia of the airways, so her airways are floppy like the top of a balloon and do not hold their shape properly.Consultant Colin Wallis said: "We have been working on ways to allow a greater number of long-term ventilated children to go home."The family home is the best place for a young child to grow and develop, and Maisie will now be able to go out and about with her family, make new friends and experience everything the outside world has to offer."Dr Wallis treated Ms Bridger when she was younger. She also has CCHS, although her condition is less complex.She and Maisie's father Andrew Harris, 26, have been trained on how to use her ventilator and will be supported by a team of local carers.</body>

      <title>A lost city captured on film</title>
      <description>The photographer who captured the 'little Paris of the East'</description>

      <body>Andrei Pandele was a young architect when he began photographing his home country, Romania, in the 1970s. His camera captured a period of huge change under communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. For some, his stunning photos are now a painful reminder of a time of destruction, and a life lost."It's cool! I really like it." Born in the year of the 1989 Revolution, Paul is one of a new generation of Romanians - multilingual, well-educated and ambitious for his country.He is understandably proud of the giant House of the People, once Ceausescu's palace. After all, it's now home to Romania's fledgling democracy and only trumped in size by the Pentagon building in the US.We are hovering in one of its many airless, pointlessly large halls, waiting for a conference on sustainable tourism to finish in the never-ending room next door.I don't share Paul's sentiments. The vast slabs of marble feel suffocating - we may as well be stuck in the centre of an outsized wedding cake.Photographer Andrei Pandele is emphatic: "The Palace? Ha! It is a wall in the way of the people. A dam, even."We have met in a tea shop in the old Jewish quarter of Bucharest. There are photographs from his collection on every wall.They're exceptional images rarely caught on camera, but then Andrei is an exceptional man - tall, dignified and handsome at 65.It is thanks to his fearless vision that Ceausescu's relentless attack on Bucharest can be seen stage by stage - as if peeling away the layers of an onion."I was an architect," he explains. "I could find plans [and] approximate what they would destroy. Not exactly, no-one knew that. They were wild, totally out of control."Seven square kilometres of the city centre were destroyed to make way for the Palace of the People. Andrei wanted to take some pictures before old Bucharest disappeared altogether.I've been coming to Romania for 20 years but I have never seen images like these.A city caught in its very own Armageddon. Andrei preserved a Bucharest that no longer exists - the exquisite glass-covered market, the archways, cobbled streets, the vine-clad villas, the city once called the "little Paris of the East".But in many of the pictures the mighty onslaught has already begun - innumerable cranes chewing their way through people's lives, the facade of the crazy palace looming up over the threatened cityscape. And then, in some others, there's just snow or dust and the desert of demolition.Not a verbose man, in front of his pictures, Andrei becomes almost chatty."After two years of photographing the architectural destruction I decided that it was very bad, but it was even worse that they were ruining the lives of 22 million people. So I began to take pictures of everyday life. I think they are much more striking."The next series of photographs showing everyday life under Ceausescu is like a haunting silent movie. We see desolate streets when there was no petrol, queues for food that never came, trams straddled by desperate commuters, useless cars buried under snow and a wedding party picking their way through the streets. No-one is smiling.I can't decide which is more astonishing - the photographs or the photographer? How did he get away with taking pictures which so openly "denigrated the socialist reality", a crime that carried a six-year prison sentence in communist Romania?Andrei explains that he was a part-time sports photographer, so he had a state-sanctioned excuse to carry a camera.And he tells me I must understand the strange psychology of the state policemen: "Tessa, they are very aggressive with those who are afraid, but much less aggressive with people who are not at all afraid. I was confident. Don't hide if you don't want to get caught."Andrei's brazen behaviour captured a vital slice of Romania's painful past.Yet it took a full 18 years before he could show his photographs to an astonished Romanian public.The people in power did not want to be reminded of what they had got so wrong. He had to wait.Andrei shrugs: "I have seen women over 40 exploding in tears in front of my photographs, because they saw their life had been destroyed, but they realised it 20 years too late. And a lot of teenagers laughed neurotically - because they recognised something in the pictures that their parents had told them, but they had never seen for themselves."My young friend Paul represents the generation that escaped that hell.He's silenced by Andrei - his experience, his audacity, his pictures.Later, as we walk back through the centre of Bucharest, taking in its schizophrenic appearance with fresh eyes, Paul quietly concedes: 'It is a pity Ceausescu had to build the palace complex right in the middle of the old city."From Our Own Correspondent: Listen online or download the podcast.BBC Radio 4: Saturdays at 11:30 and some Thursdays at 11:00BBC World Service: Short editions Monday-Friday - see World Service programme schedule.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Altered Images: Al-Shabab leader 'uses my identity'</title>
      <description>The man who claims he is wrongly labelled as al-Shabab’s leader</description>

      <body>A man claims his photograph has repeatedly been used to illustrate stories about the leader of Somalia's radical Islamist group al-Shabab.Shuuke Abdirahman Odowa - reportedly a reformed militant who joined the Somali government in 2009 - told the Somali Investigative Report website this week that his photograph was first used in error alongside an internet copy of a speech by al-Shabab's Ahmed Abdi Godane. The picture has since been mistakenly picked up by other media, it appears. It's not the first time Odowa has made the claims but previous reports were largely restricted to specialist blogs. So far, his complaints appear to have fallen on deaf ears, to the extent that he claims Godane - who's said to have masterminded the recent mall attacks in Kenya - is taking advantage of the confusion."Now [the photograph] has widespread to the world and people believe that it is him," he's reported to have said. "[Godane] utilized my photo to use so as to mislead the world." The BBC hasn't spoken to Odowa but it appears he may have a case. A photograph on the US government's Rewards for Justice website reveals a very different image from the thin bespectacled man that's appeared on many sites, and which we've chosen not to reproduce. Godane, who was thought to be instrumental in al-Shabab's link-up with al-Qaeda, is rarely seen in public and there are few confirmed photographs of him. The US government has placed a $7m (£4.3m) bounty on his head.Meanwhile, one person quite happily confusing herself with someone else is the former Miss Slovenia Rebeka Dremelj.Now a pop singer, she's posted a Facebook photograph which has been altered to make it look like she's with former Yugolsav leader Josip Broz Tito, to promote her latest record. The black and white photo has Dremelj's face superimposed over that of Tito's widow, Jovanka. The singer posted the image with text reading: "Today I got the first recording of my new song … very happy:))) It mentions a friend, who is here with me," referring to Marshal Tito, whose mother was Slovenian. Some may feel Dremelj's timing was unfortunate, given that Jovanka reportedly remains in a Belgrade hospital, recovering from a heart attack.Use #NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via Twitter.</body>

      <title>Once-banned protest songs make comeback</title>
      <description>The dance music once banned for being a threat to France</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24300017</url>
      <date>1380930672</date>
      <body>A type of dance music from the island of Reunion was considered such a threat to the French state in the 1970s that it was banned. Maloya music is now becoming popular around the world - and is being used to express the anger of a new generation.It is a hot Sunday morning on Reunion, an island out in the Indian Ocean that is a part of France, an overseas departement.And in the little fishing port of Terre Saint, they are holding an annual free festival known as Ris Sofe, named after the Creole word for the rice dish that the sugar cane workers used to eat before heading out for the fields that stretch up towards the volcano in the centre of the island.Down by the pier, there are stalls where the wives of fishermen are of course selling Ris Sofe - rice, mixed with hot peppers, sausages and fish.The beer tent is doing brisk business and there is a crowd of several hundred, from teenagers to old men in suits and straw hats, gathered around a little stage watching a furiously energetic performance from a celebrated local singer.Firmin Viry is now in his late 70s. But you would not think so as he dances across the stage accompanied by drummers and his own kayamb, a traditional tray-like percussion instrument made from cane stalks.He was once a sugar cane worker himself and then spent 20 years working in a cigarette factory, but now he is famous for his songs and albums.And yet, just 33 years ago, he would have been arrested for singing like this.The police would have broken up the concert and smashed all the instruments because Viry is an exponent of maloya, a musical style that was banned by the French authorities.It was particularly hated, so Viry told me, by President Giscard d'Estaing.The songs are sung in Creole, not French, and the percussive backing has its roots in Africa, from where slaves were brought to Reunion to work in the cane fields.The Catholic Church violently disapproved because it was used in servis kabare ceremonies, in which participants say they enter a trance and come face to face with their ancestors.The French authorities had other reasons to be concerned. In its secular form, maloya is great dance music, but it can also be protest music.And the Communist Party made great use of maloya in the 1970s, when it was fighting for greater autonomy from France. It wanted the same status as Corsica, while other activists argued for full independence.Maloya was seen by the French as a threat to the state and, sitting backstage by the sea after the show, Firmin Viry told me about life as a musician in those dangerous days.He performed without being discovered by the French authorities by constantly changing his tactics, organising shows in different peoples' houses, often under the guise of a birthday party.Other musicians were not so lucky. He told me of his friend Augustin, who was jailed for playing maloya.Life for a maloya player changed dramatically in 1981 when Francois Mitterand, leader of the Socialist Party, became the French president.He did not just legalise the music, allowing it to be played on the radio, but provided funds to help cultural projects.The Communist Party had not got what it wanted, Viry told me, but the protests came to an end.Today, maloya is becoming internationally popular among world music fans thanks to artists like Danyel Waro and Christine Salem, who were massively influenced by Firmin Viry.But it still provides a reminder of the divisions that exist on this exquisite little island, between the French who buy houses here or come as tourists - you do not even need to show your passport if you fly in from Paris - and the Creole-speaking population, many of whom are poor and without work and who argue that their identity and culture are in danger of being swamped by France.There have been sporadic violent protests against the cost of living. The most recent was in February last year when riot police were sent to the island from France.And according to Danyel Waro's musician son Sam, "the young people are angry"."Unemployment is over 40% for those between 18 and 25 and they will not shut up. They are starting to scream."They are angry that people from France come here and get jobs when local people are struggling." Although France, he added, does provide unemployment benefit.So does the once-banned old-style maloya music from the 1970s still have a role to play?"It is the cry of the people," says Firmin Viry. "There is no good balance between France and Reunion when it comes to jobs."One of his songs is about unemployment and how hard it is.Far away in Paris, there is no suggestion that the authorities will ever again ban maloya.But perhaps, if they want to judge the mood in this tropical outpost, it is time for them to brush up on their Creole and start listening to Firmin's lyrics.From Our Own Correspondent: Listen online or download the podcast.BBC Radio 4: Saturdays at 11:30 and some Thursdays at 11:00BBC World Service: Short editions Monday-Friday - see World Service programme schedule.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>At school with a guide dog</title>
      <description>How a guide dog at school helped bring one teen out of her shell</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-ouch-24366887</url>
      <date>1380932632</date>
      <body>Three years ago, the Guide Dogs charity changed its rules so children with visual impairments could get assistance dogs. So what do pupils gain from a dog - and can this partnership work in a hectic school environment?Hannah Burgess is 15. She attends Stantonbury Campus in Milton Keynes which, with almost 3,000 students, is the second largest comprehensive school in the UK. She has been taking her guide dog Rory into school since qualifying as a young handler two years ago. Previously she had used a white cane."The first day [with Rory] was quite scary, I didn't know what to expect," she says."I had only been out on training routes with him on streets - I didn't think he'd just flop on the floor and sleep for ages in my classes like he does. His first day at school showed me how good he was going to be."Everyone on campus seems to know Hannah's dog. Two young lads walk past pointedly singing the theme tune to Roary the Racing Car."Now, I don't think he's a racing car, do you?" replies Gerry O'Neill, head of inclusion at the school.Hannah ignores it. "Most people have got over a dog being there now. I get a bit of grief but it's not too bad. Some people start screaming and run away because they think it's funny to. It gets better, then a new lot of year sevens come in September and I get it all over again. But it's OK."Hannah is not completely blind, but has albinism and associated nystagmus, which severely affects her focus. Rory helps locate kerbs, avoid lampposts and Hannah no longer mistakes staircases for slopes with the dog's help. And Rory has stopped her from walking out in front of many cars: "I put full trust in him."But he has also helped her to connect with those around her."I actually have friends now," Hannah laughs. "He's given me confidence to go up and talk to people - he's a great conversation starter."Before Rory I was friendly with people in school but I didn't ever want to go out. I wouldn't go to the cinema with them, for instance. I didn't want to be seen with my cane or holding my mum's arm."At break time, she has special dispensation to remain in one of the halls so Rory doesn't have to go on the noisy and crowded playground.Hannah's friends benefit from having a pal with a dog because they are also allowed to stay indoors at break with her so they can all hang out together, after Rory has been "spent" - guide dog lingo for a toilet stop.But, no matter how well trained, dogs will be dogs."The first day I brought him here he was sick on the floor and my English teacher walked in it," says Hannah. "Also, I took him out to spend, there was fox poo on the floor, and he rolled in it and I had to go back into class with him."Her friends, all present, groaned at the memory. "I think people put up with it quite well actually," says Alice, also 15.O'Neill says he's never heard anybody say the dog shouldn't be at school but has helped advise on issues of safety. Rory doesn't attend science lessons, food practicals or PE lessons because they would give him "unfair distractions"."Most teachers are excited by the idea of a dog in class," says O'Neill. "There's a feeling that it adds something. And most teachers report that he calms the room."Any problems that arise tend to be easily surmountable.Graham Kensett, Coventry mobility team manager for Guide Dogs, has been involved in the organisation's projects with children and young people. He says teachers always worry that a dog may make pupils more excitable, but then find the opposite.But are all schools as welcoming of dogs as Hannah's school has been?Kensett says there have been challenges but the majority of schools have been willing to work with them to allow a dog in."Children with allergies are sometimes raised as a concern but we have to encourage the school to make reasonable adjustments - maybe a dog could go into the admin office for that period. But allergies are fairly rare."In the past, school children weren't allowed guide dogs because it was felt that they were not mature enough to be in charge of an animal with routines such as feeding, walking, toileting important for its welfare.Hannah says a dog is a big responsibility, and she realised early on she'd need to sharpen up if she wanted to keep Rory. She believes it forced her to be more mature."He keeps me in a routine, he keeps me from being late all the time, he keeps me from forgetting things. Because I have to do everything for him, it reminds me of doing things for myself."Twice a week Hannah goes to army cadets where she learns new skills, shoots at (enlarged) targets and teaches younger cadets to march - all whilst accompanied by her dog.On the last two Remembrance Sundays, Rory has paraded with his young owner down Newport Pagnell High Street. "He steps off on his left foot and he's always in time, so it looks really good," Hannah says.She would like to join the Army as her career, but with her sight loss that's not possible. So she wants to pursue her second love and qualify as a pastry chef.O'Neill is pleased at the outcome for Hannah and says that you have to look at the holistic effect of having a dog."The difference he's made to Hannah's life outside of school has transformed her as a student. She's going to get better grades because she is a more self-confident young woman with self-esteem and social skills and that will translate into the quality of her work."Hannah is now out all the time, doing what she wants to be doing - things that a girl her age would normally do. "It's changed so much for me that my mum has recently given me the lecture about treating her house like a hotel."Her friends say they're so used to Hannah walking independently alongside them now that it can be easy to forget she sometimes needs a bit of help."We've left her behind once or twice when she's not got Rory with her," says friend Megan, laughing. "And when we realise, we've gone 'OMG, we've lost the blind girl!'"Would your child benefit from an assistance dog at school?

      <title>Viewpoints: Do children need to read more books?</title>
      <description>Do children need to read more books?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24397801</url>
      <date>1380904450</date>
      <body>Fewer children across the UK are reading in their own time and one in five is embarrassed to be caught with a book, a survey suggests.Just over a quarter of 35,000 children from 188 schools told the National Literacy Trust that they read outside school.A similar number said they did not think their parents cared if they read.The trust says a similar survey in 2005 found one in three children read in their own time.Do children need to read more books, or can they get the same benefits elsewhere?It is important that children and young people read books, as sustained reading is important. The government should reinstate the free-books-for-children scheme and promote the need for libraries in schools.It is a sad fact that there are more libraries in prisons than there are in schools. Reading for pleasure should be an integral part of the school curriculum from primary school upwards.The phonics reading test at the age of five or six years old is also unhelpful when teachers are trying to develop a love of reading not a dread. These measures would ensure that children and young people enjoy reading and will go a long way to getting rid of the idea that it is either an arduous or unnecessary task.It's been shown time and time again that sharing books, particularly at bed time, has beneficial effects on children.But there are numerous other forms in which reading and writing goes on these days, and I'd be keen to advocate their use as well.It's not just about books; it's about sharing the written form in whatever form it takes.Interactive storybooks on [tablets], for instance, have huge benefits - they could be equally as important as traditional book stories.The most important thing is sharing text with a skilled reader, that's the core.There's often a strain of "golden-age-ism"."When we were young the television was rationed so we enjoyed good books, and why shouldn't children today?"It's quite easy to blame new media for making book reading seem old-fashioned or "uncool". [But] we've got more possibilities now, and the more that we can encourage good quality interactive books in different media, the better.There's more reading and writing going on these days with the advent of things like the internet and mobile technology. Kids are growing up in a much richer literacy world, [but] it's not the world that some of us grew up in.Aimee, BBC News School Reporter at Bullers Wood School in KentAs a child I liked flicking through the pages of a book and looking at the pictures in detail.I use a Kindle now because it's easy and I can download a book from anywhere.I do however miss the fun of picking up a real book. I think we need to be encouraged to read more books because it's important to maintain traditions of language.Using the internet is a way of getting us to read, but the sites are often full of slang and it's very easy to get distracted from a reading task.Children are always going to regard computers as "cooler" than books, but it's very worrying that one in five youngsters now regards being seen with a book as "embarrassing".While children do gain vital literacy skills from reading other material like comics, newspapers, magazines and games, reading a book teaches concentration and builds anticipation and a child's imagination like no other format can.Books need to be back in fashion for schools, and parents must work together to make books trendy again. Whether it's discovering exciting new authors who fire a child's imagination like JK Rowling and the Harry Potter series, which every kid was clamouring to read, or accepting that children prefer to digest their books on an eReader rather than in paperback, books must be back on every family's reading list to give all kids an equal chance in life.Jacquie Fisher, in a September article for website Kidsdiscover.comI often hear this question from parents: "What should my child read?" Sometimes parents are asking for book recommendations, but many times they are expressing some frustration that their kids just don't enjoy sitting down to read a book.I understand this struggle. I have two very active kids who didn't like to sit still when they were younger. They considered reading to be a full-contact sport on some days. Sometimes kids just aren't in the mood for a book - so what's a parent to do?My answer: Don't focus on books. Instead, focus on reading! Building literacy skills with children happens in many ways.Like most solitary activities, reading might be seen as "uncool" in the playground.Perhaps now books are regarded as a bit old fashioned next to ebooks on mobiles and Kindles, but young people still love reading, and value reading.Technology is often accused of drawing young people away from books and shortening attention spans, but it's not all about social updates and video games.Technology has inspired young people to write blogs, teach themselves to code, to learn together and socialise with people from all over the world. There are a lot of activities competing for the attention of young people, which affects their reading habits, but young people are still passionate about reading.Skye and Marlies, BBC News School Reporters from Maplesden Noakes School in KentSkye: For me not to be able to read would be like turning the clock back 150 years to a time when women were thought of as servant girls. Not being able to read would mean that young people would not be able to read those fantastic stories that have been written by the great authors. What a waste!Marlies: Reading is even more important today than ever. I am glad that I can read, I think about all the young people around the world who can't, how can their intelligence develop if they have to rely on others for the truth?Reading is about enjoying language, using your imagination to interpret the written word and having the language skills to talk about the story afterwards.Before children can read, they need solid foundations in spoken language and understanding - and we know that one in 10 children will struggle with these skills.Whether children are reading a book, magazine or a Kindle, the fact they are reading and enjoying language is something to be encouraged.We should support children to speak about what they read, in whatever form, to ensure they develop good verbal language, which in turn improves their literacy and numeracy development.Pleasure reading is important for both educational attainment and, arguably, for social mobility.Studies highlight that children who read for pleasure are enhancing and extending their own cognitive development, accounting for factors such as socio-economic background and parental education.All types of reading material are equally valid and important. It is breadth and variety of reading material that is the most significant.It is clear that reading fiction is positively associated with higher reading scores, so it is an important contribution. But it's the young people who read a variety of materials that perform particularly well.A huge part of [encouraging] reading is supporting reading in the home. But another significant element is the focus on reading in the curriculum.My own research has found that whilst primary school teachers do read personally for pleasure, they were insufficiently knowledgeable about children's literature, insofar as being able to recommend books to children.Our teachers don't know enough children's literature. We need teachers who read, and readers who teach.If our focus is the skill to read only, and not the will, we lose the capacity to extend that attainment through focusing on the pleasure.</body>

      <title>Kenya mall attack suspects named</title>
      <description>Kenya's military names four men shown in new CCTV footage who it says were killed as they took part in the Nairobi mall attack last month.</description>

      <body>Four men believed to have been involved in the deadly shopping centre attack in Nairobi last month have been named.The Kenyan military said Abu Baara al-Sudani, Omar Nabhan, Khattab al-Kene and Umayr - shown in new CCTV footage - were killed during the standoff.Kenya said previously 10-15 militants had been involved, but the police chief says the figure may now be four to six.The al-Shabab group said it carried out the attack on the Westgate mall on 21 September, leaving at least 67 dead.The al-Qaeda-linked group said the attack was in retaliation for Kenya's military involvement in Somalia.The naming of the men came as CCTV footage was aired showing four attackers calmly walking through a room in the mall holding machine guns.Kenya Defence Forces spokesman Maj Emmanuel Chirchir told Reuters news agency: "I confirm these were the terrorists; they all died in the raid."Reuters quoted Maj Chirchir as saying that al-Sudani was an "experienced fighter" from Sudan and was believed to be the leader of the group.Maj Chirchir said Nabhan was a Kenyan of Arab origin and al-Kene a Somali linked to al-Shabab. Further details about Umayr had not yet been verified, he said.A Kenyan security analyst told the BBC that at least two of the names would be familiar to the Kenyan intelligence services.Kenyan police chief David Kimaiyo told Kenya's KTN television station it was now believed that four to six gunmen had carried out the attack, not 10 to 15."None of them managed to escape from the building after the attack," he said.Mr Kimaiyo also said that wanted British woman Samantha Lewthwaite had not been involved."We have also established that she was not part of the attackers in the building. There was no woman," he said.Ms Lewthwaite, 29, is the widow of one of the four suicide bombers who attacked London on 7 July 2005.Kenya had earlier said five attackers were killed in the security operation and that nine people were in custody.The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse in Nairobi says the latest CCTV footage is from a limited part of the complex and, with some eyewitnesses reporting a two-pronged attack, it is too early to say definitively how many gunmen were in the building.In addition to the 67 people killed in the attack, a further 39 are still missing, according to the Kenyan Red Cross.Al-Shabab is banned as a terrorist group by both the US and the UK and is believed to have between 7,000 and 9,000 fighters.Its members are fighting to create an Islamic state in Somalia.About 4,000 Kenyan troops were sent to Somalia in October 2011 to help pro-government forces end two decades of violence, with clan-based warlords and Islamist militants all battling for control of the country.On Saturday, Islamist fighters in southern Somalia said Western forces had launched a night-time raid on one of their bases.No-one has admitted the attack. US and French special forces have carried out raids in Somalia in recent years.It is not clear whether the raid was linked to Westgate.</body>

      <title>US defence staff to return to work</title>
      <description>Most of the 400,000 US defence department staff sent home amid a government shutdown are told to return to work after a legal interpretation.</description>

      <body>Most of the 400,000 US defence department staff sent home amid the US government shutdown have been told to return to work next week.Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said the decision was based on an interpretation of the Pay Our Military Act.A budget row between Republicans and Democrats has forced the closure of federal services for five days now.But the sides have now voted to approve back-pay for the 800,000 federal workers sent home without salaries.In a rare moment of bipartisan co-operation, the House of Representatives approved by 407-0 a bill to pay the federal workers once the shutdown ends.There remains no sign of any deal on the federal budget, however.The Republicans are demanding changes to President Barack Obama's healthcare law, but the Democrats insist there will be no such concessions.The Pay Our Military Act had been passed by Congress shortly before the shutdown.Mr Hagel said earlier in the week he wanted to find a way to get his civilian staff back to work.Secretary of State John Kerry on Saturday warned that any prolonged shutdown could affect the US internationally.But, speaking at a meeting of Asian leaders in Indonesia, he said any impact was "momentary" and Washington's commitment to the region was "undiminished".President Barack Obama cancelled his Asia visit because of the shutdown.In his weekly radio address, Mr Obama urged the Republicans to "end this farce".The next key deadline will be 17 October.Unless Congress agrees to raise the $16.7 trillion (£10.4 trillion) statutory borrowing limit by then, the US could default on its debts for the first time in its history.Mr Obama said: "For as reckless as a government shutdown is, an economic shutdown that comes with default would be dramatically worse."</body>

      <title>Public vote to retain Irish senate</title>
      <description>Voters in the Republic of Ireland have rejected a government proposal to abolish the Irish Seanad (upper house of parliament).</description>

      <date>1380997420</date>
      <body>Voters in the Republic of Ireland have rejected a government proposal to abolish Seanad Éireann (upper house of the Irish parliament).The Fine Gael Labour coalition government proposal was supported by Sinn Féin and was lost by a narrow margin, with 48.3% voting in favour of abolition, with 51.7% against.Total turnout in the election was higher than expected at nearly 40%.The Seanad has existed for more than 90 years.The current Irish government had argued it cost too much to run and that its abolition could have saved Irish taxpayers as much as 20m euros (£16.92m) a year.Opponents wanted it retained and reformed, saying it played an essential role in holding governments to account.More than three million people were eligible to vote on whether or not to abolish the Seanad.Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Enda Kenny had claimed the abolition of the Seanad would create a leaner, more effective and more accountable system of government.After the result, he said: "Sometimes in politics you get a wallop in the electoral process."I accept the verdict of the people. But I also say in humility in accepting that verdict, that there is a virtue in actually being able to stand before the people and say: 'I did say four years ago I would ask you this question. We've honoured that commitment in full and so have you'."You've given your verdict and decision and I accept it fully."Opponents, led by the largest opposition party Fianna Fáil, said the Seanad was necessary to serve as a government watchdog and to hold cabinet ministers to account.BBC Dublin correspondent Shane Harrison said the result would be a disappointment for Enda Kenny."Abolition was very much the Taoiseach, Enda Kenny's idea and he has been criticised by Sinn Féin - his temporary ally during the campaign - for his failure to debate the issue with opponents on radio and television," he said."Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams and his colleagues will not be happy that voters in party strongholds in Dublin, rejected their recommendation."The vote was much better news for Fianna Fáil, the only major party to oppose abolition and suggest the Seanad should be reformed."Independent senator Katherine Zappone said it was important that senators now held a meeting with the prime minister to come up with a way of ensuring that the upper house was reformed.Meanwhile, the referendum to establish a Court of Appeal has been passed by a majority of almost two to one.The official result shows just over 65% of voters were in favour of establishing the court.The new court is expected to be operating by this time next year</body>

      <title>Row over Italy migrant boat deaths</title>
      <description>Italy's coast guard denies that it was slow to respond to the sinking of a boat carrying African migrants off the island of Lampedusa on Thursday.</description>

      <body>Italy's coast guard has denied that it was slow to respond to the sinking of a boat carrying African migrants off the island of Lampedusa on Thursday.The accusations were made by a fisherman who took part in the rescue and a local newspaper.So far, 111 bodies have been recovered, and 155 people survived, but about 200 are still unaccounted for.High winds have prevented divers from reaching the boat, restricting rescuers to an aerial search.France has called for an urgent meeting of EU states following the tragedy."European political officials must talk, and soon," said French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault."It is up to them to meet to find a proper solution; compassion is not enough."Tens of thousands of migrants attempt the perilous crossing from North Africa to Sicily and other Italian islands each year, and accidents are common - but this week's shipwreck was among the deadliest on record.The survivors are to be placed under investigation for "clandestine immigration", as provided for by a controversial immigration law pushed through by right-wing parties in 2002.Italy has said it will amend immigration laws and has called for European help.Italian members of parliament have complained that some of its provisions discourage people from helping migrants in distress.The fisherman who arrived first at the site of the accident, Vito Fiorino, has accused the coast guard of wasting time by filming footage of rescue efforts."They refused to take on board some people we'd already saved because they said protocol forbade it," he was quoted as saying by Ansa news agency.A report in local newspaper La Sicilia said two boats belonging to Italy's Financial Guard, which carries out a range of police and rescue duties, had remained in port.The coast guard denied that there was any delay in its rescue effort."After we received the alarm by radio at 07:00 we immediately intervened with out boats, arriving on at the site of the shipwreck at 07:20," it said in a statement.Judicial authorities said they had no evidence of delays.The head of a fishermen's association, Toto Martello, denied in turn reports that three fishermen drove straight past the scene of the accident."The fishermen save lives," he told Ansa. "We rebut the accusations that we didn't help people who were dying at sea."Other fishermen said there were so many migrant boat wrecks near Lampedusa that they damaged their nets every time they went out."Only now they become aware of this situation?" said Salvatore D'Ancona. "It's been 20 years that this is happening."The fishermen laid a wreath of flowers at sea, with some 10 fishing vessels blowing their horns for the victims.The 20m (66ft) boat carrying some 500 people - mostly from Eritrea and Somalia - was approaching Lampedusa early on Thursday when it began taking on water its motor stopped working.Some of those on board then reportedly set fire to a piece of material to try to attract the attention of passing ships, only to have the fire spread to the rest of the boat.The boat - which set sail from the Libyan port of Misrata - is thought to have capsized when everyone moved to one side.Of the bodies recovered so far 58 were men, 49 were women and two were children of one and six years old.</body>

      <body>The supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has endorsed overtures to the US made last month by President Hassan Rouhani in New York."We support the diplomatic initiative of the government and attach importance to its activities in this trip," he said on his website.But he added that some of what had occurred "was not appropriate".Mr Rouhani had spoken to US President Barack Obama by phone in a bid to ease tension over Iran's nuclear programme.They were the first talks between Iranian and US leaders in more than three decades.Iran wants the lifting of UN sanctions, which were imposed over concerns that it is seeking to build nuclear weapons clandestinely - an allegation Tehran denies.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the leading advocate of a hard line against Iran over its nuclear programme, has dismissed Mr Rouhani as a "wolf in sheep's clothing".When Mr Rouhani returned from New York he was greeted at Tehran airport by supporters but also met hardline protesters chanting "Death to America".In his comments on Saturday, Ayatollah Khamenei said that "some of what happened on the New York trip was not appropriate", without being specific."We are pessimistic towards the Americans and do not put any trust in them," he said."The American government is untrustworthy, supercilious and unreasonable, and breaks its promises."Substantive nuclear negotiations between Iran and international powers are due to take place on 15 October and Mr Rouhani has promised to bring a plan to the meeting.He said he wanted to reach a deal over the nuclear issue in three to six months.In an interview conducted on Friday, President Obama told the Associated Press that the US believed Iran was still "a year or more away" from building a nuclear weapon.He also expressed optimism about the current diplomacy."Rouhani has staked his position on the idea that he can improve relations with the rest of the world," Mr Obama said. "And so far he's been saying a lot of the right things. And the question now is, can he follow through?"Iran's key nuclear sites</body>

      <title>Libyan gunmen kill 15 soldiers</title>
      <description>Gunmen attack military checkpoint south-east of the Libyan capital Tripoli killing 15 soldiers and injuring several others, officials say.</description>

      <body>Gunmen have attacked a military checkpoint south-east of the Libyan capital Tripoli killing 15 soldiers, the authorities say.A military official said the attack was near Bani Walid, a stronghold in 2011 of supporters of former leader, Muammar Gaddafi.Several more soldiers were injured in the incident.It is not clear who carried out the attack, but the government has struggled to control armed groups.The official, describing it as an ambush, said the attack took place on a road between Bani Walid city and the town of Tarhouna.The troops came under heavy fire from the gunmen who drove vehicles with mounted machine guns, the official said.The authorities say four soldiers were injured in the shootings in the Wishtata district.The main road to Bani Walid was closed while the incident was investigated. It was the single largest known killing of military personnel since the 2011 civil war.Six soldiers from an elite special forces unit were shot dead in June in the eastern city of Benghazi by masked gunmen. Another six soldiers were killed - also in June - at a checkpoint south of Sirte.The lack of central government control over large swathes of Libya has left room for armed groups linked to clans and Islamist militants to thrive, analysts say.Much of the recent violence has been blamed on groups which grew out of the rebel movement behind the overthrow of Col Gaddafi in 2011.Military officers and other members of the security apparatus are among those to have been targeted in recent weeks.The lack of security in Libya has also been highlighted this year by clashes in Benghazi as protesters demanded the disbandment of militias.Gunmen surrounded ministries in Tripoli earlier this year demanding the sacking of officials who worked during Gaddafi's rule.The army is seen as out-manned and out-gunned by a mix of armed groups seemingly pursuing different agendas, says the BBC's Rana Jawad in Tripoli.With the surge of attacks of this kind in recent months, many feel there is a sustained campaign to counter the formation of a strong army, our correspondent adds.</body>

      <body>A disabled Chinese activist whose imprisonment caused international concern has been released from prison.Ni Yulan, a lawyer who helped defend property rights, was freed after serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence for causing a public disturbance.She said her illness had not been treated during her detention and she was now in poor health.But the 54 year old insists she will fight on, and threatened to sue police and seek redress."If we don't fight for rights, we will just have to wait for our death," she told Reuters news agency."I want them to return my assets. They've torn down my home without giving any compensation, leaving us homeless."Ni was detained during a wave of arrests in 2011 and initially received a 32-month jail sentence.She says the charges were trumped up to stop her work defending people evicted from their homes.Last year an appeals court in China dismissed her fraud conviction, reducing her jail time by two months. However, she remained in jail on a separate disturbance charge.Her husband Dong Jiqin was also given a jail sentence.Both are known for providing legal help to people whose homes have been seized by the government.Ni uses a wheelchair - a consequence, she and her supporters say, of mistreatment by police over the years.</body>

      <title>Tunisia power transfer deal agreed</title>
      <description>Tunisia's governing Islamist Ennahda party and the opposition agree on the formation of a caretaker government to end months of political crisis.</description>

      <date>1380987249</date>
      <body>Tunisia's governing Islamist Ennahda party and the opposition have agreed on the appointment of a caretaker government in the coming weeks.Under the deal signed after talks in Tunis, a cabinet of independent figures will be in power until fresh elections.Last month Ennahda agreed in principle to relinquish power, in an effort to end Tunisia's political deadlock.The crisis was triggered by the assassinations of two opposition leaders earlier this year.It has threatened to disrupt a democratic transition that began after Tunisians threw out their decades-old authoritarian government at the beginning of the 2011 uprisings, widely referred to as the Arab Spring.Talks between Ennahda and the National Salvation Front-led opposition are being mediated by the UGTT labour union.Under the agreement signed on Saturday, the two sides are to hold further negotiations on the formation of the new technocratic cabinet within three or four weeks.The caretaker government is to supervise new elections.Correspondents say the agreement represents a setback for the moderate Islamist Ennahda Party, which has run the country since winning elections in October 2011.The opposition has accused Ennahda of pushing an Islamist agenda on a traditionally secular nation.The rivalry intensified after the murders of prominent left-wing figure Chokri Belaid in February and opposition politician Mohammed Brahmi in July.Ennahda condemned the killings but the opposition accused it of failing to rein in radical Islamists.</body>

      <body>Islamist fighters in southern Somalia say Western forces have launched a night-time raid on one of their bases.The militant group al-Shabab told the BBC "white soldiers" had arrived by boat at the port of Barawe and rebels had repulsed them, losing a fighter.No-one has admitted the attack. US and French special forces have carried out raids in Somalia in recent years.It is not clear whether it is linked to last month's attack in neighbouring Kenya, which al-Shabab has claimed.At least 67 people were killed after militants stormed the Westgate shopping centre in the capital, Nairobi, on 21 September.Residents in Barawe, which is controlled by militants, say they were woken up by heavy fighting before dawn on Saturday."Gunfire broke out for about 10-15 minutes," an eyewitness told AFP news agency.It is not clear who the target of the raid was.Several residents are quoted as saying the soldiers tried to storm a house sheltering senior al-Shabab leaders.However, an unnamed Somali intelligence official told the Associated Press news agency that the targets had been "high-profile" foreigners.Local al-Shabab commander Mohamed Abu Suleiman said the raid had failed and the group remained in control of Barawe.Later, Reuters carried a statement by Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, al-Shabab's military operations spokesman, which said that British and Turkish special forces were involved.He said the commander of the British force was killed, and four SAS and a Turkish soldier were wounded.However, the UK's Ministry of Defence said there was "no British involvement", while a Turkish foreign ministry official told Reuters that Turkish special forces had also not taken any part.Western navies tasked with fighting piracy patrol the seas off Somalia, which has been beset by conflict for more than two decades.In 2009, US Navy commandos attacked and killed an al-Qaeda leader, Kenyan-born Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, in a daylight raid on Barawe.Washington has also used drones in Somalia to support the government and African Union forces in their battle against al-Shabab.France carried out an unsuccessful raid to free a French intelligence agent in January. Two French commandos were killed and al-Shabab later reported that it had killed the agent.</body>

      <body>Rafael Nadal will return to number one in the world rankings on Monday after reaching the final of the China Open.Nadal, 27, was leading fourth seed Tomas Berdych 4-2 in the first set of their semi-final when his Czech opponent retired with a back injury."This is a great year, one of the best of my career," said the Spaniard, who won the French Open and US Open and was last top of the rankings  in July 2011.Nadal will play current world number one Novak Djokovic in Sunday's final.The Serb breezed past France's Richard Gasquet 6-4 6-2 in his semi-final.Nadal broke serve in the fifth game and Berdych, who said he injured his back while reaching for a shot, retired a game later after receiving treatment."It is special to be back to the top position of the rankings after more than half a year without playing tennis," added Nadal."What makes me happy is everything I did to be back where I am."Berdych praised Nadal's achievement in regaining the top spot from Djokovic, who had taken over from the Spaniard more than two years ago.Nadal returned to action in February after seven months on the sidelines with knee problems and has won 10 of the 12 finals he has contested since making his comeback, taking his Grand Slam victories up to 13."With Rafa, well, just all the credit," said Berdych. "It is really incredibly well done in the short time that he has become a number one again. That's really an achievement for an athlete like him."Djokovic has spent 101 weeks as world number one.He was knocked off top spot in July 2012 by Roger Federer, after the Swiss player beat Andy Murray in the Wimbledon final, but returned to number one in November.Nadal had been assured of reclaiming the top spot if he reached the final in Beijing or Djokovic failed to defend his title.He has not lost a match since he was beaten by Belgian world number 135 Steve Darcis in the first round at Wimbledon in June. He has won his last 21 matches and 65 of the 68 he has played this season.</body>

      <body>Police in the Siberian region of Irkutsk have rescued a couple after a bear broke into their holiday home, attracted by the smell of fresh soup.A patrol turned up at their dacha near Ust-Ilimsk in the early hours after a neighbour raised the alarm.They found the couple hiding in their bath-house as the bear digested the hot beetroot soup in their garden.A warning shot was sufficient to scare off the intruder. No-one was hurt, although there was damage to the house.According to a police statement, the couple said they had left the soup to cool when they went to bed.Because of decorating work inside the dacha, they were sleeping out in the bath-house, when they woke to "loud banging".Peering out, they saw a bear breaking the windows of their glassed-in porch. It then hauled itself inside and devoured "all of the borsch, which was still hot".After receiving the alert at 01:00 (16:00 GMT Friday), police sent a patrol to the scene. Officers found the bear padding around the snowy garden and fired a shot into the air."Startled, the unwelcome guest bounded off into the forest," the police statement said.Bears, it noted, had been known to come looking for food around dachas in the area before but happily no attacks had been reported.While splashes of the bright red soup were found at the scene, it could not be immediately confirmed whether the bear had indeed not used a spoon.</body>

      <body>An investigation is under way after a police chase through the heart of Washington DC ended with an unarmed woman shot dead and two officers hurt.The woman identified as Miriam Carey of Stamford, Connecticut, had a one-year-old girl in the car. She was unharmed.Authorities have searched a home in Stamford believed to be Ms Carey's.On Thursday, police said she attempted to bypass a security gate at the White House, and officers opened fire as she sped off towards Capitol Hill.Ms Carey, a 34-year-old dental hygienist, was said to have suffered mental illness in recent months.Law enforcement officials suggested the incident may have stemmed from a delusional obsession with US President Barack Obama and a belief he was stalking her, local media reported.Chief Jonathan Fontneau of the Stamford police said that officers had been called to her home there "at least once" but that she had no criminal background.Her mother, Idella Carey, told reporters on Friday her daughter suffered post-partum depression after the birth of her daughter last August."A few months later, she got sick. She was depressed... She was hospitalised," she said.Stamford police said they were notified immediately following the incident on Thursday afternoon and searched the suspect's home for any related evidence."We did not deem there to be any danger," Mr Fontneau said after the search was completed.Although the reason for Thursday's incident remains unclear, police said it was neither an act of terrorism nor an accident.At 14:12 local time (18:12 GMT) on Thursday, a black Infiniti sedan rammed security fencing at the outer perimeter of the White House, police said.Tourists, congressional staff and senators watched as a convoy of police vehicles chased the car down Constitution Avenue outside the Capitol, where the two houses of Congress meet.Footage showed the car at one point surrounded by police but the driver managed to escape, speeding around a roundabout.Images showed police pointing guns at the car before the driver rammed a Secret Service vehicle and carried on driving.Metropolitan Police Chief Cathy Lanier told reporters that officers later shot and killed the woman on a nearby street.Capitol Police briefly locked down the building where members of the House of Representatives and Senate were debating how to end the current government shutdown.Police said the two injured officers were in good condition and expected to recover.</body>

      <title>Man jailed 41 years in solitary dies</title>
      <description>Herman Wallace, a Louisiana man released from prison on Tuesday after 41 years in solitary confinement, dies of liver cancer.</description>

      <body>A Louisiana man released from prison on Tuesday after 41 years in solitary confinement has died of liver cancer.Herman Wallace, 71, died on Friday morning, his lawyer told the BBC.He was freed after a federal judge ruled his 1974 murder conviction violated his right to a fair trial.Wallace, one of the so-called Angola Three convicted in the murder of a prison guard, was diagnosed with cancer this year. They always maintained their innocence."He passed away early this morning among people who cared for him very much," Wallace's lawyer, George Kendall, told the BBC.One of the Angola Three, Robert King, was released in 2001. Wallace and another man, Albert Woodfox, remained incarcerated, isolated in tiny jail cells and allowed out to shower or exercise one hour a day.The men, initially imprisoned for robbery, were the object of a long-running international campaign arguing they were wrongly convicted of the murder because of their association with the militant Black Panther Party.On Tuesday, Judge Brian Jackson ruled Wallace's conviction was unconstitutional because women were barred from serving on his jury, and ordered him freed.Louisiana State Penitentiary, where the three men were held, is nicknamed Angola for the plantation that once stood on its site, worked by slaves kidnapped from Africa.Wallace was in a nursing clinic at Hunt Correctional Center in St Gabriel, Louisiana, on Tuesday morning when he heard the news."I said, 'Herman, you are a free man,'" Carine Williams, one of his lawyers, told the BBC.By many accounts, the evidence against him was weak, says the BBC's Tara McKelvey.There were no fingerprints at the place where Miller was killed, our correspondent says.Even Miller's widow, Teenie Verret, said she had doubts about the case against the Angola Three - and hoped they would be treated fairly.On Friday, Amnesty International said Louisiana prison authorities had put Wallace "through hell"."No one should have to endure 40-plus years in solitary confinement... It's some small consolation that [Wallace] died a free man after the conviction was finally overturned," said Amnesty International campaigner Tessa Murphy.</body>

      <body>Police in Mexico have arrested one of Guatemala's most wanted men - a drug lord suspected of masterminding the killing of eight policemen in June.Eduardo Villatoro Cano - also known as Guayo Cano - was detained in the southern Chiapas state and later handed over to Guatemala.Mr Cano and another 36 men are blamed for the attack on the police station in north-western Guatemala.President Otto Perez Molina said Mr Cano's gang had now been dismantled.Nine police officers were on night duty at the remote police station in Salcaja on 13 June when heavily armed men entered the building and shot at them at least 40 times, investigators said.The police station is located near the Pan-American highway, in Quetzaltenango department.Eight policemen were killed on the spot. Their commander was taken away by the gang and is presumed dead.The massacre had a big impact in Guatemala and angered the authorities, who have vowed to punish the perpetrators.The Central American nation is being increasingly used as a transit route for cocaine produced in Colombia and smuggled into Mexico and the United States.Guatemala has one of the world's highest homicide rates, says the the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), with 38.5 crimes per 100,000 population in 2011.</body>

      <title>Argentina seeks jail for de la Rua</title>
      <description>Prosecutors in Argentina request a six-year prison term for former President Fernando de la Rua over a bribery scandal.</description>

      <date>1380844267</date>
      <body>Prosecutors in Argentina have asked for a six-year prison term for former president Fernando de la Rua.He has been accused of paying some $5m (£3m) to a group of senators for them to vote in favour of a controversial labour reform bill in 2000.Five former opposition senators are also facing six-year prison sentences over the scandal.Mr de la Rua, 76, denies all the charges and says the accusations against him are politically motivated.The trial began in August and a verdict is not expected until next year.More than 300 witnesses are expected to testify, including President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who voted against the bill and is not accused of taking a bribe.A key witness is Mr de la Rua's former parliamentary secretary, Mario Pontaquarto, who pleaded guilty and agreed to collaborate with prosecutors.Prosecutors have asked for an 18-month suspended jail term for him.Mr Pontaquarto accused the president of giving him orders to offer the bribes to a group of senators to make sure the measure was approved.The legislation was controversial as it scrapped many rights of Argentine workers.It was eventually approved, but revoked two years later.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was at the time demanding public sector cuts from the government as a pre-condition to approve new loans.The crisis got worse as the end of 2001 approached. Angry protests took place on the streets after the banks refused to let customers withdraw their deposits.Mr de la Rua ended up encircled by angry protests at the presidential palace, the Casa Rosada.He resigned on 20 December 2001 and left the presidential palace in a helicopter.Last year, a high court in Argentina dismissed homicide charges against Mr de la Rua over the riots, in which more than 20 people were killed.The court ruled as legitimate his decision to declare a state of siege to deal with the protests.</body>

      <title>Aerial search at Italy sunken boat</title>
      <description>Italy's coastguard uses planes and helicopters to spot migrants' bodies around the boat which sank off the island of Lampedusa on Thursday.</description>

      <body>The Italian coastguard is using planes and helicopters to spot migrants' bodies around the boat which sank off the island of Lampedusa on Thursday.Bad weather is hampering divers. So far, 111 bodies have been found, 155 people have been pulled out alive, but more than 200 are said to be in the seas close to the Mediterranean island.The boat was carrying some 500 people - mostly from Eritrea and Somalia.Italy says it will amend immigration laws and has called for European help.The 20m (66ft) vessel began taking on water when its motor stopped working as it neared Lampedusa on Thursday morning, survivors said.Some of those on board then reportedly set fire to a piece of material to try to attract the attention of passing ships, only to have the fire spread to the rest of the boat.The boat - which set sail from the Libyan port of Misrata - is thought to have capsized when everyone moved to one side.Video footage later showed the vessel sitting upright on the seabed some 45m (150ft) below the surface.The skipper of the boat, a 35-year-old Tunisian, was arrested. It has emerged that he was deported from Italy in April.Of the bodies recovered so far 58 were men, 49 were women and two were children of one and six years old. Italian officials say there could be more women in the sunken boat than men - among the 155 survivors only four were women.Divers are hoping to resume the search in the coming hours, officials say."Though the bad sea conditions persist, our guys are ready to go down if a window opens up that makes it safe for them," coastguard spokesman Filippo Marini said.The operation had initially focused on an area off Lampedusa called Rabbit Island, but the search was then widened beyond the initial radius of four nautical miles in an effort to recover bodies that had been swept away by tides.The divers have been describing seeing horrific scenes inside the wreckage.So many bodies have been brought ashore that the island has had to send for more coffins and turn a hangar at the airport into a huge makeshift mortuary.An evening mass and silent candlelit procession were held on Lampedusa. Most residents of the island turned out, the BBC's Gavin Hewitt reports from the scene.People were sombre, but also angry that such tragedies were happening all too often and so little was being done to prevent them, he adds.Lampedusa Mayor Giusi Nicolini - who wept at the scene - said: "After these deaths, we are expecting something to change. Things cannot stay the same."The future of Lampedusa is directly linked to policies on immigration and asylum."Interior Minister Angelino Alfano has warned there is no reason to think this would be the last disaster of its kind.Mr Alfano said the divers had seen dozens of bodies in the wreck. "There could be even more in the hold, where the poorest of the poor are usually put," he told parliament.Mr Alfano added that this "sense of impotence" explained the anger and prompted Italians to rally around Pope Francis's cry of "shame" - a "collective feeling".President Giorgio Napolitano has called for "specific policies" on refugees and asylum seekers "which are not regulated by Italian laws".In a statement, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres commended the swift action taken by the Italian coastguard to save lives.Mr Guterres also expressed "dismay at the rising global phenomenon of migrants and people fleeing conflict or persecution and perishing at sea".The UN said that in recent months, most migrants attempting the crossing were fleeing the conflicts in Syria and the Horn of Africa rather than coming from sub-Saharan Africa.The number of those arriving by sea to Italy this year until 30 September stood at 30,100, according to the UN.The main nationalities of those arriving were Syrian (7,500), Eritrean (7,500) and Somali (3,000).</body>

      <title>Kenya cleric killing sparks protests</title>
      <description>Four people are killed in Kenya's port city of Mombasa during clashes between police and those angered at the killing of a Muslim cleric, the Red Cross says.</description>

      <body>Four people have been killed in Kenya's port of Mombasa during clashes between police and those angered at the killing of a Muslim cleric, the Red Cross says.Seven people have also been wounded during the disturbances, while a church was set alight.The cleric Ibrahim "Rogo" Omar and three other people were shot dead in Mombasa as they drove home on Thursday night after preaching.It comes two weeks after the deadly attack on a Nairobi shopping centre.Somali Islamist group al-Shabab, which is part of al-Qaeda, said its militants stormed the Westgate mall in the capital in retaliation for Kenya's military involvement in Somalia.Mr Omar's killing is similar to that of Aboud Rogo Mohammed last year, which sparked days of rioting by Muslims in Mombasa.Mr Rogo was alleged to have links with al-Shabab and some Muslims accused the Kenyan security forces of killing him - an allegation they denied.The trouble began after Friday prayers when protesters began stoning cars and lighting bonfires as they clashed with police.At least one of those who died of their wounds in hospital had been shot, according to the Kenya Red Cross.Kenya's national crisis centre said three people had died of stab wounds, the AFP news agency reports.Police said they used tear gas to disperse the protesters who also set fire to a Salvation Army church in the Majengo district, a middle-class area of the city, which has a large Muslim population.Local imams reportedly called for calm.Eyewitnesses said police were also firing in the air to try to disperse the demonstrators.A BBC journalist heard sounds of gunshots being fired while on the phone to a local reporter.Mombasa city police chief Kipkemoi Rop said 24 people had been detained, as the force would not tolerate "unruly youth taking over the town", AFP reports.Correspondents say the Masjid Musa Mosque, which is on the same street as the Salvation Army church, is known to attract some radical followers.Muslim cleric Abubaker Shariff Ahmed, known as Makaburi, said the police were behind the killings of Mr Omar and the others."They should tell us the truth about Westgate, not kill innocent Muslims in Mombasa," he told reporters at the scene of the wrecked car.Makaburi has been sanctioned by the UN Security Council for being "a leading facilitator and recruiter of young Kenyan Muslims for violent militant activity in Somalia"."Sheikh Ibrahim was not at Westgate, he had nothing to do with Westgate, nor were the other people in that car. Why are they killing them here?" the cleric said.The police in Mombasa have denied involvement in Mr Omar's killing."The police have nothing to do with the shooting. That's not how we operate," Reuters news agency quoted Robert Kitur, Mombasa County police commander, as saying.The car smashed into the verge off the main coastal road north of Mombasa, not far from where Mr Rogo was shot dead in his vehicle in August 2012.The vehicle's windows were shattered in the attack and its doors riddled with bullet holes.Salim Abdi was the only survivor of the shooting and said "all four others I was with in the vehicle died on the spot"."There were gunshots and the vehicle veered off the road, I don't know how I walked out of the vehicle alive," AFP quotes him as saying.</body>

      <title>US commitment to Asia 'undiminished'</title>
      <description>The US remains committed to Asia despite the shutdown that forced President Obama to cancel planned trips, Secretary of State John Kerry says.</description>

      <body>The US commitment to Asia remains undiminished despite President Barack Obama's absence from regional summits, Secretary of State John Kerry has said.Mr Kerry was speaking at the start of the Apec summit in Indonesia.Mr Obama cancelled his Asia trip after the partial US government shutdown.The US government closed non-essential operations on Tuesday after Congress failed to agree a new budget. Thousands of federal employees have been sent home. Some are working but not paid.US-EU trade negotiations have also been postponed because of the shutdown.As world leaders began gathering for the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Bali, Mr Kerry sought to allay concerns that Washington was reducing its global engagement."None of what is happening in Washington diminishes one iota our commitment to our partners in Asia," he said.He said the dispute with the Republicans in the US Congress was "an example of the robustness of our democracy".But at the same time, he urged Congress to think about how the US was perceived internationally when "we can't get our own act together".Mr Kerry said areas where the shutdown was affecting US foreign policy funding included:Mr Obama had been due to begin a four-nation Asian trip on Saturday, heading to Bali and Brunei before travelling on to Malaysia and the Philippines.The White House said Mr Obama's decision to cancel his Asia trip was made due to the "difficulty in moving forward with foreign travel in the face of a shutdown".Republicans who control the House of Representatives refused to approve a budget, saying they would only do so if Mr Obama's healthcare reform law was delayed or stripped of funding.Mr Obama and the Democrats have refused, noting the law was passed in 2010, subsequently approved by the Supreme Court, and was a central issue in the 2012 election which Mr Obama won comfortably.On Friday, Democrats and Republicans appeared no closer to finding a way out of the impasse.Republican House Speaker John Boehner insisted Mr Obama and Democratic Senate leaders open negotiations on the shutdown."All we're asking for is to sit down and have a discussion," he said. "This isn't some damn game."Mr Obama later said he was happy to hold talks with the Republicans, "but we can't do it with a gun held to the head of the American people".The US also faces running out of money and defaulting on its debt if there is no agreement to raise government borrowing limits later this month.US officials had been due in Brussels next week to discuss a sweeping free trade pact designed to boost bilateral trade between the European Union and the US.On Friday, US trade representative Michael Froman informed the EU that financial and staffing constraints made it impossible to send a full negotiating team to Brussels.He stressed that Washington would continue working with the EU on drawing up the deal, but would have to wait until the shutdown was over.Reacting to the US announcement, European Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht said the delay was unfortunate."But let me underline that it in no way distracts us from our overall aim of achieving an ambitious trade and investment deal," he added.Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said warned earlier that a failure to raise the US debt ceiling would be a far worse threat to the global economy than the current shutdown.She said it was "mission critical" that the US agreed a new debt limit.</body>

      <body>More than two million people in China are employed by the government to monitor web activity, state media say, providing a rare glimpse into how the state tries to control the internet.The Beijing News says the monitors, described as internet opinion analysts, are on state and commercial payrolls.China's hundreds of millions of web users increasingly use microblogs to criticise the state or vent anger.Recent research suggested Chinese censors actively target social media.The report by the Beijing News said that these monitors were not required to delete postings.They are "strictly to gather and analyse public opinions on microblog sites and compile reports for decision-makers", it said. It also added details about how some of these monitors work.Tang Xiaotao has been working as a monitor for less than six months, the report says, without revealing where he works."He sits in front of a PC every day, and opening up an application, he types in key words which are specified by clients."He then monitors negative opinions related to the clients, and gathers (them) and compile reports and send them to the clients," it says.The reports says the software used in the office is even more advanced and supported by thousands of servers. It also monitors websites outside China.China rarely reveals any details concerning the scale and sophistication of its internet police force.It is believed that the two million internet monitors are part of a huge army which the government relies on to control the internet.The government is also to organise training classes for them for the first time from 14 to 18 October, the paper says.But it is not clear whether the training will be for existing monitors or for new recruits.The training will have eight modules, and teach participants how to analyse and judge online postings and deal with crisis situations, it says.The most popular microblogging site Sina Weibo, launched in 2010, now has more than 500 million registered users with 100 million messages posted daily.Topics cover a wide range - from personal hobbies, health to celebrity gossip and food safety but they talso include politically sensitive issues like official corruption.Postings deemed to be politically incorrect are routinely deleted.</body>

      <body>Negotiations on a sweeping free trade pact between the US and the EU have been postponed because of a partial government shutdown in America.US officials had been due in Brussels next week to discuss the deal aimed at boosting bilateral ties.US President Barack Obama earlier cancelled his trip to Asia because of the shutdown.The US government closed non-essential operations on Tuesday after Congress failed to agree a new budget.Since then hundreds of thousands of government employees have not been working or paid.On Friday, US trade representative Michael Froman informed the EU that financial and staffing constraints made it impossible to send a full negotiating team to Brussels.But he stressed that Washington would continue working with the EU on drawing up the deal, but would have to wait until the shutdown was over.Reacting to the US announcement, European Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht said the delay was unfortunate."But let me underline that it in no way distracts us from our overall aim of achieving an ambitious trade and investment deal," he added.Meanwhile, the White House said that Mr Obama would miss two summits in Asia, including the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) meeting in Indonesia.It said the decision was made due to the "difficulty in moving forward with foreign travel in the face of a shutdown".Mr Obama called Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on Friday and expressed his regret over the cancellation, Indonesian presidential spokesman for foreign affairs Teuku Faizasyah told the BBC.The visit had not been rescheduled, the spokesman added.Secretary of State John Kerry will attend the Apec gathering and the East Asia summit in Brunei in Mr Obama's place, the White House said.President Obama had been due to begin a four-nation Asian trip on Saturday, heading to Bali and Brunei before travelling on to Malaysia and the Philippines.The US government partially shut down operations on Tuesday after Republicans who control the House of Representatives refused to approve a budget, saying they would only do so if Mr Obama's healthcare reform law was delayed or stripped of funding.Mr Obama and the Democrats have refused, noting the law was passed in 2010, subsequently approved by the Supreme Court, and was a central issue in the 2012 election which Mr Obama won comfortably.On Friday, Democrats and Republicans appeared no closer to finding a way out of the impasse.Republican House Speaker John Boehner insisted Mr Obama and Democratic Senate leaders open negotiations on the shutdown."All we're asking for is to sit down and have a discussion," he said.

"We know there are the votes for it in the House of Representatives. If Speaker Boehner will simply allow the vote to take place, we can end this shutdown."The US also faces running out of money and defaulting on its debt if there is no agreement to raise government borrowing limits later this month.Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said warned earlier that a failure to raise the US debt ceiling would be a far worse threat to the global economy than the current shutdown.She said it was "mission critical" that the US agreed a new debt limit.Ms Lagarde's comments were echoed by the US Treasury.It said a debt default could lead to a financial crisis as bad as 2008 or worse.Meanwhile, the impact of the shutdown was being felt across the country.The National Transportation Safety Board did not send investigators to a deadly church bus crash in Tennessee that killed eight people and injured 14 others.The labour department also postponed the release of the highly anticipated September jobs report.With Tropical Storm Karen bearing down on the Gulf states, the website of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), carried a message saying: "Due to the federal government shutdown, NOAA.gov and most associated web sites are unavailable."It referred visitors to the National Weather Service.However, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) recalled workers to help prepare for the storm.On Friday, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said the House would vote on a measure to re-open Fema as well as the National Weather Service to deal with the impending storm.</body>

      <body>Some 50 people have been convicted in a major corruption case centred on the Spanish resort of Marbella.The case, involving bribery, property fraud and money laundering, resulted in convictions for senior officials.These included former city planning chief Juan Antonio Roca, who was jailed for 11 years and fined 240m euros (£202m, $300m) for pocketing huge sums.Two of the coastal city's former mayors were also handed jail terms over the scams, which came to light in 2006.Marisol Yague and Julian Munoz received sentences of six and two years, respectively.A total of 85 men and women were accused in what is thought to be the biggest-ever case of local political corruption in Spanish history.Roca, who managed the city's planning department in the 1990s, became one of Spain's richest men before he was accused of masterminding the corruption.He was initially given the job at the peak of Marbella's construction boom by the city's notorious, late mayor, Jesus Gil, who died in 2004.The verdict read out in court in the province of Malaga detailed a corruption ring involving building permits being handed out to a succession of officials in return for envelopes stuffed with cash.Roca himself became extremely rich, with a portfolio of ranches, expensive cars and boats.The sentences for Roca and the two disgraced mayors were significantly less than those demanded by prosecutors.They had sought a 30-year term for Roca, who was detained in 2006, but the court took into account his admission of the scale of corruption.Marbella's local government was forced to replace large numbers of personnel after the case was exposed.</body>

      <description>Four people have been killed in Egypt as supporters of ousted President Mohammed Morsi take to the streets in defiance of the army-backed government.</description>

      <body>Four people have been killed in Egypt as supporters of ousted President Mohammed Morsi clashed with opponents and security forces.Medical officials said at least 40 others were hurt as gunfire and explosions rocked the centre of Cairo.Troops used tear gas and live rounds to halt crowds heading to Tahrir Square.The square has since been sealed off to prevent pro-Morsi supporters occupying the symbolic heart of the 2011 uprising which ousted Hosni Mubarak.Reports said the four fatalities were all Brotherhood supporters who died amid fighting in two Cairo neighbourhoods.As clashes broke out in the capital, state TV reported further violence in the northern Sharqiya district and to the east in Giza, as well as in the northern port city of Alexandria.There were also reports of skirmishes between pro-Morsi demonstrators and civilian supporters of the military government.The BBC's correspondent in Cairo, Quentin Sommerville, said that by early evening all was quiet on the streets of Cairo, ahead of the early Friday curfew at 1900 local time (1700 GMT).A heavy security presence remained, he said.Hundreds of Islamist protesters have died in violence since the Egyptian military deposed Mr Morsi in July, 13 months after he was elected as president.Thousands of members of the Muslim Brotherhood have also been detained over the past two months.Several senior figures, including Mr Morsi and the movement's general guide Mohammed Badie, are being held on charges such as incitement to violence and murder.Egyptian authorities portray the crackdown as a struggle against "terrorism". They are preparing to seize Muslim Brotherhood assets after appeal courts upheld a recent ban on its activities.Our correspondent says the protesters in the capital's Agouza district were chanting "Rabaa, Rabaa", a reference to the square next to the Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque where a sit-in was cleared by force in August.Troops also took up positions on both sides of Qasr al-Nil Bridge, which leads to Tahrir Square.As protesters pushed towards Tahrir, police and security forces used teargas and warning shots fired overhead to disperse the crowds.Before Friday's clashes, soldiers and police tightened security around key sites in Cairo, including Tahrir.Morsi supporters have said they will be intensifying their demonstrations in the lead-up to Sunday's 40th anniversary of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.Opponents who back the army have also said they will take to the streets.In a statement issued on Thursday, the Brotherhood sharply criticised the officers behind the overthrow of Mr Morsi, comparing them to Adolf Hitler, the Roman emperor Nero and the Mongol conqueror Hulagu Khan.It urged Egyptian soldiers to rebel and said it hoped that Sunday would mark a "victory by the people over those who staged a coup against them for personal gain".On Thursday, the European Union's foreign policy chief, Baroness Catherine Ashton, held talks with armed forces chief Gen Abdul Fattah al-Sisi and interim President Adly Mansour, as well as with religious leaders."I got a real sense of everyone really trying to go forward in the right way," she told reporters afterwards.A day earlier, a 16-year-old boy was killed in clashes between Morsi supporters and opponents in the Red Sea city of Suez.Send your pictures and videos to yourpics@bbc.co.uk or text them to 61124 (UK) or +44 7624 800 100 (International).

      <title>Union anger at health pay proposal</title>
      <description>Unions criticise government moves to halt a 1% pay rise for all NHS staff in England, arguing they deserve to be rewarded for holding the health service together.</description>

      <body>Unions have criticised government moves to halt a 1% pay rise for all NHS staff in England.The Department of Health said the increase was unaffordable alongside the current system which sees many staff automatically receive incremental annual rises.It has urged the NHS pay review body to withhold the rise for 1.3m staff.Rachael Maskell, of the Unite trade union, said staff deserved the pay reward for "holding the NHS together".Health trusts are currently under pressure to make savings and the NHS wage bill accounts for around 40% of its budget.All public sector pay increases are capped at 1%.The Department of Health (DoH) proposes using the funding intended for the rise to "modernise" pay structures.It says automatic increments - linked to length of service and satisfactory performance - add £900m to salary costs.The DoH has stressed no decisions on changes to pay have been taken, insisting independent bodies will make their recommendations in February or March next year.But the plans, outlined in the DoH's submission to two independent pay review bodies, have been criticised by Unite and Labour.Ms Maskell, of Unite, said: "The Department of Health have got other choices. They're entering into a reorganisation which is costing £3bn, which nobody asked for and isn't adding anything to patient care."It is about choices and the NHS staff have already had two years of a pay freeze - 1% last year - and, quite frankly, are really falling behind inflation now with their wages."Staff moraleShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme motivation and morale was down among frontline health workers "at this very difficult time".However, in its submission the DoH points to a staff survey suggesting high levels of motivation and morale and says there should only be basic pay increases if there is "strong evidence" recruitment, retention, morale or motivation issues require this.Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the NHS reorganisation had taken money out of front-line services."There has to be pay restraint in the NHS as well as other public services... but the NHS has been through some very difficult years - so have NHS staff - and this was a modest increase to recognise the pressure that all families are under."To take it away, to break that promise, is just another kick in the teeth."Staff representatives have also reacted angrily to the plans."What they have done is inflammatory," said Christina McAnea, head of health at Unison and joint chairwoman of the NHS Staff Council."We are not going to negotiate while a gun is held to our head for a paltry 1% pay rise - our members will not react well to that."Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association council said this would not result in staff leaving in their "droves".However he added: "We're going to find it increasingly hard to recruit, partly for the specialist skills and partly for the numbers of staff that we'd need to bring into the health service to implement the safe minimum staffing levels."Health minister Anna Soubry defended the government 's stance telling the BBC: "This is about making sure we pay our NHS staff well and we reward their improvement in skills."This system works in other public sectors and the private sector. People want to make sure that they are getting good quality, first class services especially at a time when the NHS faces challenges."Earlier a DoH spokeswoman said: "Many NHS staff have continued to receive pay rises of up to 3.5% and we want to keep working with the trade unions and employers on affordable pay."The measures we are proposing will help increase quality for patients and help us realise our vision of an affordable seven-day service."In June Chancellor George Osborne said ministers were working to "remove automatic pay rises" for teachers, health professionals, prison and police staff.The DoH drew attention to Mr Osborne's comments and confirmed it wanted NHS pay to have "stronger links to performance, quality and productivity".</body>

      <title>MoD to examine US base attack report</title>
      <description>The Ministry of Defence is to examine a US review into a Taliban attack on Camp Bastion in Afghanistan which criticised Britain for the way it handled security.</description>

      <date>1380997926</date>
      <body>The Ministry of Defence is to examine a US review into a Taliban attack on Camp Bastion in Afghanistan which criticises the British military for the way it handled security at the base.Two US marines were killed and over $200m (£124m) worth of aircraft destroyed in the September 2012 attack.This week, two US generals were forced to retire after an investigation.The MoD said it would "consider" the US findings to confirm its own assessment that no further UK action was required.The UK's own inquiry into the attack has not been released.But the US investigation was partially declassified and has been published online.It looks into the actions of US personnel but points out security was the responsibility of British officers.Up to 28,000 troops and contractors worked at Camp Bastion at the time of the attack, but the US investigation found only half of the guard towers on Camp Bastion were manned, including including the one closest to the breach.A similar proportion at the US Marines' Camp Leatherneck section were also left unguarded.A concertina wire, a ditch, obstacle and a 30ft (10m) high boundary chain link fence were in place around Camp Bastion.One of the US generals who was forced to retire, Major General Gregg Sturdevant, said in his statement that his impression had been that some of the enhanced security which commanders had asked for had been refused on cost grounds both in the UK and US.In a statement to investigators, he said it was only after the attack that he found out there were unmanned towers at the base, because he said the "information flow was slow and the Brits were embarrassed".He added that after the attack, "the Brits desperately wanted" to continue to be in charge of security, "but I told them that we were no longer willing to accept not being in charge of overall security. The attack definitely changed the environment. They knew that they had screwed up".The conclusion of the American investigation was that, while the US commanders had correctly delegated their responsibilities, in the end, they alone were accountable.But an MoD spokesman pointed out that the US review found a separate internal perimeter fence would likely not have presented "any serious challenge, barrier or impediment to the enemy" on the day of the attack.He added: "Force protection measures at Camp Bastion have been reviewed and are appropriate to current threat levels."The insurgents were repelled by US Marines and Royal Air Force Regiment personnel whose courageous actions prevented greater loss of life and equipment."While the US review was intended to examine US actions only and not those of coalition forces, the UK will consider its findings in detail to confirm our earlier assessment that no further UK action is required."</body>

      <title>Shutdown 'could affect US standing'</title>
      <description>The US government shutdown could affect its global standing if prolonged, Secretary of State John Kerry warns on a trip his president had to cancel.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24410213</url>
      <date>1380990631</date>
      <body>US Secretary of State John Kerry has warned that any prolonged shutdown of the government could affect the US internationally.But, speaking at the Apec forum in Indonesia, he said any impact was "momentary" and Washington's commitment to Asia was "undiminished".President Barack Obama cancelled his Asia visit because of the shutdown.The US government closed non-essential operations on Tuesday after Congress failed to agree a new budget.Hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been sent home, and the House of Representatives voted unanimously to pay them retroactively once the shutdown ends.In a weekly address President Obama said he was not prepared to "pay a ransom in exchange for reopening the government" and that the far right of the Republican party was preventing a Yes-or-No vote."Take that vote. Stop this farce. End this shutdown now," he said.Republicans, who control the House, have tied passage of the budget to Mr Obama's healthcare reform, which they are seeking to weaken or delay. They have accused Democrats of refusing to negotiate."Republicans are eager to end the shutdown and move ahead with the fiscal and economic reforms that our country so urgently needs," said Senator John Cornyn."But we're never going to make real progress without greater co-operation from our friends across the aisle."Democrats note that the healthcare law was passed in 2010, subsequently approved by the Supreme Court, and was a central issue in the 2012 election which Mr Obama won comfortably.As world leaders headed for the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Bali, Mr Kerry sought to allay concerns that Washington was reducing its global engagement."None of what is happening in Washington diminishes one iota our commitment to our partners in Asia," he said.He said the dispute with the Republicans in the US Congress was "an example of the robustness of our democracy".But at the same time, he urged Congress to think about how the US was perceived internationally when "we can't get our own act together".Mr Kerry said areas where the shutdown was affecting US foreign policy funding included:The Secretary of State warned of the consequences if the shutdown became longer term."This is a momentary impact. Obviously if it were prolonged or repeated people would begin, I think, to question the willingness of the United States to stay the course or its ability to, but that's not the case and that will not be the case."Mr Obama had been due to begin a four-nation Asian trip on Saturday, heading to Bali and Brunei before travelling on to Malaysia and the Philippines.He used the APEC summit two years ago to announce a rebalancing of American naval power towards the Pacific.The White House said Mr Obama's decision to cancel his Asia trip was made due to the "difficulty in moving forward with foreign travel in the face of a shutdown".US-EU trade negotiations have also been postponed.US officials had been due in Brussels next week to discuss a sweeping free trade pact designed to boost bilateral trade, but US trade representative Michael Froman informed the EU that financial and staffing constraints made it impossible to send a full negotiating team to Brussels.He stressed that Washington would continue working with the EU on drawing up the deal, but would have to wait until the shutdown was over.Reacting to the US announcement, European Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht said the delay was unfortunate."But let me underline that it in no way distracts us from our overall aim of achieving an ambitious trade and investment deal," he added.The US faces running out of money and defaulting on its debt if there is no agreement to raise government borrowing limits later this month.</body>

      <title>Twitter plans to raise $1bn in IPO</title>
      <description>In documents made public for the first time, social networking company Twitter has said it plans to raise $1bn as part of its stock market debut.</description>

      <date>1380856665</date>
      <body>Social networking company Twitter has said it plans to raise $1bn (£619m) in its stock market debut in documents filed with US regulators.In the filing, revealed on Thursday, the seven-year-old company said that it now has 218 million monthly users and that 500 million tweets are sent a day.It made a loss of $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m.It will be the largest Silicon Valley stock offering since Facebook's listing in 2012.Analysts said that the offering was likely to get a good response."Social media is red hot," said Internet analyst Lou Kerner. "Twitter is front and centre benefiting from market enthusiasm for all things social, and remarkably strong metrics."The filing also revealed Twitter's finances for the first time.While the company has never made a profit, its revenue has grown from just $28m in 2010 to $317m by the end of 2012.Around 85% of Twitter's revenue last year came from ad sales; the rest was from licensing its data.The company takes in a significant portion of its ad revenue from mobile devices, an important metric often tracked by analysts.As of 2013, over 65% of the company's advertising revenue was generated from mobile devices. More than 75% of Twitter users accessed the site from their mobile phone during that same time period.Some analysts said that the decision by the firm to raise capital indicated that it was keen on improving the way people enjoy content on its platform and how advertisers connect with its users."Users should be happy about this," said Zachary Reiss-Davis, an analyst with Forrester."It looks like Twitter is looking at how to enrich the experience and it understands that to build a successful service, they have to create something people like and want to come back to and spend time on."Peter Esho from Sydney-based Invast Financial Services, added that Twitter's ease to use had seen it increase its user base, making it an attractive option for advertisers."I think what Twitter has working in its favour is that it's very easy to use: it doesn't eat up too much bandwidth for the average user in places where broadband penetration is low," he said.The filing also revealed that two of the company's co-founders, Evan Williams and Jack Dorsey, own significant stakes in Twitter, and could stand to take in significant sums from the company's stock market listing.Mr Williams owns 12% of shares in the company, while Mr Dorsey owns 4.9%.Benchmark Capital's Peter Fenton, an early investor in the company, is the second-biggest shareholder, with 6.7% of shares.Twitter indicated three weeks earlier that it had filed for a public stock market offering.However, under a new law passed by Congress in 2012, it did not have to reveal its financial documents because it had revenue of less than $1bn.But by releasing the documents publicly, it gave an indication that it hopes to complete its stock sale soon.The company plans to list under the stock symbol TWTR, but it did not reveal which stock exchange, the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange, it had chosen.However, Mr Esho said that the listing was likely to be on the Nasdaq."I was to speculate, I think it would have to be Nasdaq," he said. "That really is the exchange that has seen so many tech names come to the market."Goldman Sachs is the lead bank taking the company public, a coveted position that is often fought for amongst the nation's biggest banks.The other banks helping with the offering are Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, BofA Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank Securities and CODE Advisors.</body>

      <title>Silk Road accused appears in court</title>
      <description>The alleged mastermind behind the online illegal drugs marketplace Silk Road is too dangerous to be bailed, prosecutors say.</description>

      <body>The alleged mastermind behind the online illegal drugs marketplace Silk Road is too dangerous to be bailed, US prosecutors have said.Ross Ulbricht, 29, was arrested this week and is charged with being the administrator of the site which has now been shut down.He is also accused of trying to arrange the killing of one of the site's users."We deny all charges and that is the end of the discussion at this point," Mr Ulbricht's lawyer said.Mr Ulbricht appeared in a San Francisco court on Friday wearing a green T-shirt under red jail clothes and had his ankles shackled.A request from his legal team for his bail hearing to be pushed back was granted - it will now take place on 9 October.Federal magistrate Joseph Spero asked Mr Ulbricht's lawyer Brandon LeBlanc whether seeing the criminal indictment that included a murder-for-hire charge had "changed his calculus" on whether he thought Mr Ulbricht would be granted bail.As part of its criminal complaint, the FBI alleged that Mr Ulbricht had sought to pay a Silk Road user to kill another user who had threatened to expose details of the site's users.Prosecutors opposed the delay, arguing that Mr Ulbricht represented a danger to the community, and that there was a high likelihood that he may attempt to flee.The Silk Road was a well-known destination on Tor, a so-called "dark web" service that anonymises users, making it much more difficult for authorities to track locations.The site sold a range of items, but was most famous for offering a host of illegal drugs, paid for using virtual currency Bitcoin.</body>

      <title>Sunderland 1-2 Manchester United</title>
      <description>Adnan Januzaj scores twice on his full debut as Manchester United beat Sunderland for their first victory in three league games.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24350276</url>
      <date>1380999601</date>
      <body>Manchester United teenager Adnan Januzaj rescued manager David Moyes from another hazardous situation as he inspired a vital victory at Sunderland.Moyes knew three points were essential at the Stadium of Light after successive Premier League defeats by Manchester City and West Bromwich Albion - but Craig Gardner's early goal gave struggling Sunderland a deserved half-time lead.United could have been in deeper trouble had goalkeeper David De Gea not saved magnificently from Emanuele Giaccherini's header before 18-year-old Januzaj celebrated his first league start with a double strike to turn the game around.Januzaj demonstrated great composure to slide Patrice Evra's cross past Sunderland keeper Keiren Westwood 10 minutes after the break, then showed wonderful technique to score with a left-foot volley to put United in the ascendancy six minutes later.It was tough on Sunderland, who provided a glowing reference for interim head coach Kevin Ball's credentials to succeed the sacked Paolo Di Canio before they were deflated by Januzaj's brilliance and ran out of steam.The gifted youngster's goals and performance brought great relief for Moyes, who had been under the spotlight following United's indifferent start to the season and embarrassing defeats in the Manchester derby and at home to West Brom.It may not have been United at their most fluent but a win was the sole priority on Wearside and Moyes will now hope the reigning Premier League champions move towards top gear.For Sunderland, it was another defeat that leaves them rooted to the bottom of the Premier League with only one point from seven games - but they can take heart from many aspects of this performance and will look back on De Gea's brilliant save as the decisive moment.Moyes was able to pair the returning Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie in attack - but it was at the back where United had all the problems.And they were in evidence inside five minutes when Phil Jones and Nemanja Vidic failed miserably to deal with Giaccherini's cross and the loose ball was drilled low past De Gea by Gardner.There were ominous signs for United in their failure to cope with Jozy Altidore's physical approach, with even the usually formidable Vidic struggling to contain the powerful striker as he was brushed effortlessly off the ball in some fierce exchanges.United, wisely given the vulnerability of their defence, were attempting to keep Sunderland back - but that was no easy task against a side bristling with energy and making a complete nonsense of their early season struggles.Nani had the visitors' best first-half opportunity but volleyed carelessly across the face of goal from Evra's inviting cross.It took a world-class save from De Gea to stop Sunderland extending their lead when Adam Johnson crossed for Giaccherini. The diminutive forward was alone and was turning away to celebrate a headed goal when De Gea produced a quite magnificent flying save, one-handed and away to his right.Giaccherini could blame no-one but himself when he wasted another opportunity as half-time approached, scooping over from eight yards after Johnson weaved through more shambolic work from United's defenders.Januzaj had shown flashes of promise, though he was booked for a clear dive, and turned them into the finished product to put United level after 55 minutes when he timed his arrival perfectly to meet Evra's cross with a calm side-footed finish.His second goal to complete the turnaround six minutes later was even better, showing real class to send a low left-foot volley past Westwood when Sunderland defender John O'Shea could only partially clear a cross.Van Persie wasted an opportunity to make the scoreline more emphatic as he missed when clean through on Westwood - but Moyes looked a satisfied man as he celebrated at the final whistle.</body>

      <body>Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel beat Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton to pole position at the Korean Grand Prix.The German secured his third pole in a row to put himself in the best possible position to extend his 60-point championship lead over Fernando Alonso.The Ferrari driver qualified sixth but starts fifth as a result of a 10-place penalty for Red Bull's Mark Webber, who was third.Lotus's Romain Grosjean moves up to third ahead of Mercedes' Nico Rosberg.Webber drops back from third to 13th as automatic punishment for picking up his third reprimand of the season for accepting a lift back to the pits from Alonso in what stewards considered a dangerous manner at the last race in Singapore.Vettel's pole was his sixth of the season - more than anyone else - and had looked locked on after an impressive performance in Saturday's final practice session.The world champion's margin over Hamilton, who was fastest in both Friday practice sessions, was 0.218secs.Vettel's time came on his first run in the final part of qualifying. He went out again at the end of the session but aborted his lap when he was held up by Raikkonen in the last few corners."It was fairly close," Vettel said. "As expected, Mercedes was pretty strong, so it was a tight battle."Bit of a surprise this year we are very good in sector one, which is mainly straights and slow corners. That's good - it's the easiest place to make up time in the race. We improved the car - I wasn't that happy after Friday; that's why I was happy after qualifying."Hamilton added: "We did as good a job as we could. I feel I got the most out of the car. In general it's been a good weekend and I really hope tomorrow we're able to fight with them."Webber's penalty also drops him back behind Ferrari's Felipe Massa, who qualified sixth fastest, Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg and Esteban Gutierrez, Lotus's Kimi Raikkonen, the McLarens of Sergio Perez and Jenson Button and Daniel Ricciardo's Toro Rosso.Webber said: "We had to take a bit of pace out of the car for qually. Not much, but just looking at how we would compromise the car for qually looking to the race. It was a good little battle. I'm well and truly out of position but we'll fight and come back through."Scot Paul Di Resta starts 15th in his Force India, one place and 0.287secs behind team-mate Adrian Sutil.Marussia's Jules Bianchi was handed a three-place grid penalty and a reprimand for impeding Di Resta and will start last.Full qualifying results</body>

      <description>New Zealand clinch the Rugby Championship title following an impressive victory over South Africa in Johannesburg.</description>

      <body>New Zealand secured the Rugby Championship with a pulsating 38-27 win over South Africa at Ellis Park.After Ben Smith's try put the All Blacks ahead, two Bryan Habana scores gave the Springboks hope only for two tries from Liam Messam to give the visitors a half-time lead.Tries from Willie le Roux and Jean de Villiers put South Africa in front.But scores from Beauden Barrett and Kieran Read earned a sixth win from six games for the All Blacks.South Africa went into the game needing a bonus point win by more than seven points to claim the trophy.But Kiwi coach Steve Hansen's team never looked interested in winning the title with damage limitation, producing a stylish display to win the tournament for the eighth time in 11 years.Barrett's try - New Zealand's fourth - guaranteed a bonus point and confirmed the trophy even with 20 minutes left."We had the belief to hit back when the momentum was against us," said New Zealand skipper Richie McCaw."As an All Black I relish these occasions and winning at this great stadium makes me so proud. We gave everything out there this evening."Springboks captain Jean de Villiers said: "To win rugby matches you have to attack and defend and our defence was not up to scratch in this match."Let us give credit to New Zealand - they deserved to win the match and the Championship after a great advertisement for rugby."Morne Steyn kicked an early penalty but the All Blacks moved ahead when a fine offload from Read was followed by Smith beating two defenders to score.But South Africa responded when Duane Vermeulen made space with a surging run and sent Habana over in the 18th minute.Two minutes later a fine one-handed pass from Francois Louw put Habana into space and the winger chipped over Smith and gathered before touching down in the corner.Habana limped off with what appeared to be a hamstring injury two minutes later and the hosts failed to build on their 15-7 advantage.Heavy pressure from New Zealand resulted in Messam, assisted by Brodie Retallick, bundling over from about a yard.And when South Africa attempted to run the ball out in first-half added time, Read turned the ball over and a slick passing move to the left ended with Messam stepping in to score his second try.Six minutes after the interval Messam was sent to the sin bin and within seconds the hosts took a penalty quickly and fed the ball right for Le Roux to cross, with Steyn's conversion making it 22-21.With 14 men, Ma'a Nonu denied a decisive try and after Barrett's penalty restored New Zealand's advantage, De Villiers barged through three tackles to score.The game swung again within two minutes when Barrett broke through to score a fourth try and end South Africa's chances of winning the trophy.New Zealand's Ben Franks was shown a yellow card but, even with a man down, the outstanding Read was sent over in the corner by Julian Savea.</body>

      <body>Photojournalist Bill Eppridge - who took images of the aftermath of Robert Kennedy's assassination - has died aged 75.Eppridge died in hospital in Connecticut from a blood infection caused by a fall.His image of Kennedy lying on the floor of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles is widely considered one of the greatest news photos of all time.He worked for Life Magazine at the time of the shooting in 1968.Friend and fellow photographer David Hume Kennerly said: "He extended a helping hand and a bushel of inspiration to me, and his kindness shaped the course of my career.Born in Buenos Aires, Eppridge moved to the US with his family as a young boy.Working as a staff photographer for Life Magazine from 1964, he covered a wide variety of stories from revolutions in Latin America to the Beatles' arrival in the US.Eppridge followed Kennedy from a campaign event at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles into the back kitchen where a 24-year-old Palestinian Christian, Sirhan Sirhan, shot and killed the 42-year-old presidential hopeful.Eppridge took several black and white images that night, but the most enduring and haunting depicted Kennedy lying on the floor, with a halo of light in the background, with a hotel worker at his side."You are not just a photojournalist, you're a historian," he once explained when asked how he could keep snapping pictures while someone was lying injured in front of him.Commenting on his unforgettable image of Kennedy, he said: "I never hung it on my wall."His 1965 photo essay about a drug-addicted New York couple inspired the Al Pacino film The Panic in Needle Park.After leaving Life in 1972, Eppridge worked for other magazines including Time and Sports Illustrated.Before his death, he and his wife, Adrienne Aurichio, had been putting the finishing touches to a book on the Beatles, to mark next year's 50th anniversary of their arrival to the US.</body>

      <title>Shankar addresses Delhi gang rape</title>
      <description>Musician Anoushka Shankar says she decided to reveal her own experiences of sexual abuse after the gang rape and murder of a woman in Delhi.</description>

      <date>1380907941</date>
      <body>Musician Anoushka Shankar says she was prompted to reveal her experience of sexual abuse after learning of the gang rape and murder of a woman in Delhi.Shankar, daughter of legendary Indian sitar player Ravi Shankar, said in February she had been abused by "a man my parents trusted" in her childhood.Her revelation followed the fatal attack on an Indian student, for which four men have been sentenced to death."Her story is the apex of millions of stories," Shankar told BBC Radio 4.Speaking on the Front Row programme, she said: "No-one I knew could help being affected by the gravity and intensity of that attack - and if it resonates with something in our experience then obviously it doubles the impact of hearing a story like that."I felt quite conscious as an Indian woman that there was a very unique moment happening where the entire world's attention was on sexual violence and on the role and position of women in India."I felt almost an obligation [to talk about my experience]. It didn't feel dragged out of me. If I was ever going to talk about my story, that felt like the right moment."Shankar, 32, took the decision to talk about her experiences in a video, recorded in her London home, in which she appealed for people to support a campaign in memory of the gang rape victim."As a child I suffered sexual and emotional abuse for several years at the hands of a man my parents trusted implicitly," she said.She added the attacks had included "groping, touching and verbal abuse".Reflecting on the statement, the musician told Front Row's John Wilson: "It was something I never spoke to the media about."It had never felt like something relevant in a public context until this moment where I thought 'hang on, it's important for people to realise that this kind of thing can happen to anyone, anywhere'."I think there's a class issue in India where there can be an assumption that things like this don't happen to people from upper classes or who are privileged. I think part of what shocked people within India was that [the victim] was a middle-class girl. It's so ridiculous."The musician has responded to the attack, and tried to address its causes, with a track on her new album, Traces Of You.She said the song, which references the 23-year-old victim's name in its title, tries to capture a sense of the horror of the attack.The album, recorded with producer Nitin Sawhney and her sister Norah Jones, also addresses the death of her father last year.Shankar said her experiences had informed the spirit of the record, and brought a sense of "resilience" to the music."It's not necessarily about the passing of my father, it's about me passing through the passing of my father."There's a way that we all go through horrible and painful things and I'm not nullifying it in any way when I say we do go on."My childhood experiences were one of the big experiences for me [but] I know as a woman I've come through that."At some cost, but I've come through it."You can hear the full interview with Anoushka Shankar on BBC Radio 4's Front Row at 19:15 BST on 4 October, 2013.

      <title>Cyrus and O'Connor row escalates</title>
      <description>Pop star Miley Cyrus hits back at Sinead O'Connor, after the Irish singer warned her not to be exploited by the music business.</description>

      <body>Pop star Miley Cyrus has hit back at Sinead O'Connor, after the Irish singer warned her not to be exploited by the music business.In a series of tweets, Cyrus mocked O'Connor, comparing her to US actress Amanda Bynes before alluding to O'Connor's mental health problems.O'Connor responded with another open letter to the singer, accusing her of "irresponsible" behaviour.The Irish singer told her to "remove her tweets immediately".The tit-for-tat conversation began after Cyrus, 20, cited O'Connor's video Nothing Compares 2 U as an inspiration for her explicit Wrecking Ball video.O'Connor, 46, said she was prompted to write, "in the spirit of motherliness" after "phone calls from various newspapers" who wanted the singer-songwriter to comment upon similarities between the two videos.In the video for Nothing Compares 2 U, O'Connor sheds a single tear as she performs the Prince-penned break-up ballad.Cyrus cries in the promo clip for Wrecking Ball, which shares similar lyrical themes to O'Connor's song. But the video also finds her licking a sledgehammer and swinging naked on a metal demolition ball.O'Connor said she was "extremely concerned" that those around Cyrus had led or encouraged her to believe "that it is in any way 'cool' to be naked and licking sledgehammers in your videos".Cyrus, who found fame as the child star of Disney children's show Hannah Montana, has been criticised in recent weeks for her controversial performances, particularly at the MTV Video Music Awards in Brooklyn last month.O'Connor continued: "The message you keep sending is that it's somehow cool to be prostituted.. it's so not cool Miley... it's dangerous."It is in fact the case that you will obscure your talent by allowing yourself to be pimped, whether it's the music business or yourself doing the pimping," added O'Connor.Responding on Twitter, Cyrus wrote: "Top of the mornin to ya."She added a screen shot of O'Connor's tweets from 2012 in which the Irish star, who has bi-polar disorder, referred to her own mental health problems, asking for Twitter followers to recommend a psychiatrist.She compared the singer to former child actress Amanda Bynes, who is currently undergoing psychiatric treatment."I don't have time to write you an open letter cause I'm hosting and performing on SNL this week," Cyrus continued.Cyrus also tweeted a picture of O'Connor ripping up a photograph of the pope, an infamous on-stage stunt by the singer, before asking her to "meet up and talk".Responding to Cyrus in a third open letter, O'Connor said she would take legal action against her if she did not remove the tweets."You have posted today tweets of mine which are two years old, which were posted by me when I was unwell and seeking help so as to make them look like they are recent."In doing so you mock myself and Amanda Bynes for having suffered with mental health issues and for having sought help," said O'Connor.She added: "It is most unbecoming of you to respond in such a fashion to someone who expressed care for you," O'Connor added.</body>

      <title>Legacy of 1973 Arab-Israeli war reverberates 40 years on</title>
      <description>How 1973 Arab-Israeli war reverberates 40 years on</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24402464</url>
      <date>1380976230</date>
      <body>Israel closes down for the fasting, repentance and prayer of Yom Kippur - the day of atonement.So complete is the suspension of everyday life that traffic stops and normal broadcasting is suspended.It is the holiest day in the Jewish calendar - and Israel's moment of greatest vulnerability.In 1973, Egyptian and Syrian military planners chose it as the perfect moment for a combined surprise attack on the Jewish state - the war changed the world and we all live with its effects to this day.The Arab attacks were an effort to reverse the humiliating defeats of 1967 in which Israel had redrawn the map of the Middle East with stunning speed.The Israelis captured the vast Sinai Desert from Egypt, the Golan Heights from Syria and the West Bank of the River Jordan and the eastern part of Jerusalem from the Jordanians.Egypt and Syria at least were determined to recapture their territory - and to restore national pride.The Egyptian General Sameh Elyazal was a young officer injured when his tank was hit by a missile fired from an Israeli aircraft in the war of '67. He has a piece of shrapnel lodged inside him to this day.He explains the thinking in Cairo in 1973 like this: "When we came back from '67 you could feel the way people looked at you .... as if to say 'you don't deserve our respect'. Even our families were saying that our country deserved better so we thought we have no other way of correcting this impression than getting the Sinai peninsula back."When the attack came Israel was stunned. Out of nowhere it found itself facing a war of national survival on two fronts.In the South, Egyptian commandos crossed the Suez Canal heading eastwards into the Sinai capturing the Israeli forts on the West Bank of the Suez Canal. In the North, Syrian tank regiments swept on to the Golan Heights.The Israeli commanders scrambled to mobilise their reserves - the national radio service which had fallen silent for Yom Kippur began broadcasting a special news bulletin punctuated by code words that recalled soldiers to their military units.The future Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was a graduate student at Stanford University in the United States in 1973.But he'd already served as a commander in Israel's elite commando unit the Sayeret Matkal and as soon as he heard the news from home he packed his bags and said goodbye to his wife and young daughter.When he got home he headed straight for the underground bunker known as The Hole from which Israel's armed forces are run. The atmosphere wasn't good."I saw faces grey like dust," Barak says now, "It was one of the lowest points of the war."Gradually Israel's forces began to rally - and to gain ground as they counter-attacked. But the complacency that was a dangerous by-product of the easy victories of 1967 was punctured and so was the sense of invulnerability which had gone with it.Then, as now, events in the Middle East mattered - and resonated far beyond the region.In the early 1970s the Cold War was at its height and just about any theatre of conflict on earth was effectively a proxy war between the Communist Soviet Union and the power bloc that styled itself the Free World, led by the United States.Russian military 'advisers' went into combat with the Syrians and supplied arms and ammunition to the Arab nations.The United States backed Israel. The bottom line was that the Israelis had chosen - or been chosen by - the right superpower. The Americans made better weapons and they were better at getting them to the war.So the tide of battle turned and after at least one false start ceasefire negotiations eventually produced an end to hostilities. When it came, Israeli forces were not far from the gates of Damascus and were only 100 kilometres from Cairo.The war had been short, but it changed the world.Arab oil exporters who dominated the global energy market at the time decided to punish the West for backing Israel by using what it called ''The Oil Weapon".Prices were suddenly hiked and output was cut.There were fuel shortages, a stock market crash and a global economic slowdown whose effects were felt for years. The 55 mph speed limit on some federal roads in the United States dates from the period when desperate attempts were made to save fuel.Europe and the United States began cultivating alternative oil suppliers and thinking about alternative energy and fuel saving. The death knell was sounded for the gas-guzzling car.Diplomatically Egypt drifted out of the Soviet sphere of influence and became an ally of the United States.It got the Sinai peninsula back in the end but through diplomacy, not war - under American chairmanship it signed a peace treaty with the Israelis a few years after the guns fell silent. The Camp David accords were one of the most important diplomatic achievements of the post-war era.The Arab nations probably concluded privately that they would never defeat Israel in a conventional war. The fighting may have seen the last major tank clashes of history. Armoured vehicles it turned out were too vulnerable to missile fire from aircraft.But Israel was forced to conclude too that it couldn't take easy victories for granted and that the Egyptian army in particular could stand and fight.In the period of introspection that followed the war and the intelligence failures that led up to it, senior politicians and military officials lost their jobs.But the most depressing legacy is perhaps this.If you go up to the Israeli side of the ceasefire line on the Golan Heights today you can find ruined and abandoned armoured vehicles preserved as monuments.You can look into Syria and watch and listen as the Syrian army directs tank and artillery fire onto towns and villages where it claims rebel forces are hiding out.It is evidence of how close the Syrian war has come to history's old battlefields - and a reminder that, in the Middle East, the uncertainties of the future always feel more pressing than the glories and the agonies of the past.</body>

      <title>Why men flee Eritrea for Europe</title>
      <description>Eritreans explain why they risk all to reach Europe</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24413144</url>
      <date>1380982987</date>
      <body>The latest tragedy in the Mediterranean has, not before time, human rights groups say, put the spotlight on the situations which drive people to make the perilous boat journey to Europe, and the many dangers they face along the way.It is believed most of the dead came from Eritrea and Somalia, so all must have taken not only the risky sea crossing, but a long and hazardous journey across the Sahara desert as well."I still can't believe it when I think about the Sahara," said Samson Kidane, an Eritrean who is now a refugee in Switzerland."It was so difficult to cross. We were more than 30 people in a small automobile, and later we were in a container, more than 120 people for 24 hours."Mr Kidane, like many young Eritreans, fled his country's forced, indefinite military conscription, a system which requires all citizens to serve in the army for an unlimited amount of time.Human rights groups have condemned the practice as akin to slavery, claiming that a lack of freedom of press and expression, and widespread arbitrary detention and torture, mean that the only real way to avoid conscription is to flee the country.Until June of this year, Switzerland accepted avoidance of Eritrea's military service as a valid reason for claiming asylum, and the country now has one of Europe's biggest communities of Eritrean refugees.But Switzerland, like many European countries, no longer allows applications for asylum to be made at its embassies abroad, meaning that anyone wanting to make a claim must make their way, somehow, to Switzerland.Human rights groups suggest Europe's asylum policies are a contributory factor to the regular boat tragedies in the Mediterranean.Daniela Enzler, an asylum adviser with Amnesty International and the Swiss charity Caritas, said she was not surprised by this week's loss of life."Almost every week boats sink in the Mediterranean," she said. "It's a tragedy that people can't apply for asylum in embassies anymore. If they could, they would not have to risk this journey… Lives could be saved."When Mr Kidane was finally granted refugee status by the Swiss, it was the end of a journey which could easily have cost him his life.After crossing the Sahara, which cost each man more than $1,000 (£621; 735 euros), he and his friends had to find what he calls a "businessman" to get them across the Mediterranean."If you pay the money for the journey, the businessman sometimes disappears with the money," he said.In the end his trafficker took another $1,200 from each member of the group, and organised five small boats, each carrying around 30 people.After 53 hours at sea, Mr Kidane arrived in Italy. But only two boats arrived. Three had sunk, one of them carrying his best friend.Both human rights groups like Amnesty International and the UN refugee agency have expressed concern that national coastguards and Europe's joint border patrol Frontex are more interested in pushing migrants and asylum seekers back than they are in rescuing those in distress."Nearly every asylum seeker I have met who made the Mediterranean crossing told me they had seen boats pass by, even helicopters flying overhead," said Daniela Enzler, "but distress calls were ignored."That allegation is borne out by the experience of Bemnet Aron, who fled Eritrea aged just 17. An exhausting journey across the Sahara was followed by three months working in Libya, while he tried to earn the money for the sea crossing.Eventually he got a place in a boat, with around 80 other people."The boat was overloaded, too heavy," he remembered, "and after three days we ran out of fuel."As time went on food and then water ran out too. "We started to drink our own urine," he said, "but some people couldn't bring themselves to do that."One by one, people began to die. "We saw other boats going by, one very close, and we all jumped up and waved and shouted, but it just kept on going."Mr Aron drifted in the Mediterranean for days. When he and his colleagues were finally rescued, just five were left alive - 75 had died, of thirst, hunger, and exposure.Now 21, he is also a refugee in Switzerland, but his traumatic experiences continue to affect his ability to lead a normal life.The UN's High Commissioner for Refugees, Antonio Guterres, has said he hopes the latest tragedy in the Mediterranean will serve as a "wake-up call"."There is something fundamentally wrong in a world where people in need of protection have to resort to these perilous journeys," he said.And the refugee agency's Director of Protection, Volker Turk, believes Europe must now engage in a political debate and find solutions to prevent further deaths."What happened should go high up on the political agenda of governments, not just in the Mediterranean, but in all parts of the world where lives are lost every day in the most cruel circumstances because people flee out of despair, and try to cross the sea in rickety boats," he said.But with unemployment high in many countries, and opinion polls consistently suggesting that immigration and asylum worry voters, Europe is unlikely to relax its polices.And as conflict, poverty and repression continue to affect parts of Africa and the Middle East, people like Mr Kidane and Mr Aron will go on risking their lives in the hope of a better future.</body>

      <title>A lost city captured on film</title>
      <description>The photographer who captured the 'little Paris of the East'</description>

      <body>Andrei Pandele was a young architect when he began photographing his home country, Romania, in the 1970s. His camera captured a period of huge change under communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. For some, his stunning photos are now a painful reminder of a time of destruction, and a life lost."It's cool! I really like it." Born in the year of the 1989 Revolution, Paul is one of a new generation of Romanians - multilingual, well-educated and ambitious for his country.He is understandably proud of the giant House of the People, once Ceausescu's palace. After all, it's now home to Romania's fledgling democracy and only trumped in size by the Pentagon building in the US.We are hovering in one of its many airless, pointlessly large halls, waiting for a conference on sustainable tourism to finish in the never-ending room next door.I don't share Paul's sentiments. The vast slabs of marble feel suffocating - we may as well be stuck in the centre of an outsized wedding cake.Photographer Andrei Pandele is emphatic: "The Palace? Ha! It is a wall in the way of the people. A dam, even."We have met in a tea shop in the old Jewish quarter of Bucharest. There are photographs from his collection on every wall.They're exceptional images rarely caught on camera, but then Andrei is an exceptional man - tall, dignified and handsome at 65.It is thanks to his fearless vision that Ceausescu's relentless attack on Bucharest can be seen stage by stage - as if peeling away the layers of an onion."I was an architect," he explains. "I could find plans [and] approximate what they would destroy. Not exactly, no-one knew that. They were wild, totally out of control."Seven square kilometres of the city centre were destroyed to make way for the Palace of the People. Andrei wanted to take some pictures before old Bucharest disappeared altogether.I've been coming to Romania for 20 years but I have never seen images like these.A city caught in its very own Armageddon. Andrei preserved a Bucharest that no longer exists - the exquisite glass-covered market, the archways, cobbled streets, the vine-clad villas, the city once called the "little Paris of the East".But in many of the pictures the mighty onslaught has already begun - innumerable cranes chewing their way through people's lives, the facade of the crazy palace looming up over the threatened cityscape. And then, in some others, there's just snow or dust and the desert of demolition.Not a verbose man, in front of his pictures, Andrei becomes almost chatty."After two years of photographing the architectural destruction I decided that it was very bad, but it was even worse that they were ruining the lives of 22 million people. So I began to take pictures of everyday life. I think they are much more striking."The next series of photographs showing everyday life under Ceausescu is like a haunting silent movie. We see desolate streets when there was no petrol, queues for food that never came, trams straddled by desperate commuters, useless cars buried under snow and a wedding party picking their way through the streets. No-one is smiling.I can't decide which is more astonishing - the photographs or the photographer? How did he get away with taking pictures which so openly "denigrated the socialist reality", a crime that carried a six-year prison sentence in communist Romania?Andrei explains that he was a part-time sports photographer, so he had a state-sanctioned excuse to carry a camera.And he tells me I must understand the strange psychology of the state policemen: "Tessa, they are very aggressive with those who are afraid, but much less aggressive with people who are not at all afraid. I was confident. Don't hide if you don't want to get caught."Andrei's brazen behaviour captured a vital slice of Romania's painful past.Yet it took a full 18 years before he could show his photographs to an astonished Romanian public.The people in power did not want to be reminded of what they had got so wrong. He had to wait.Andrei shrugs: "I have seen women over 40 exploding in tears in front of my photographs, because they saw their life had been destroyed, but they realised it 20 years too late. And a lot of teenagers laughed neurotically - because they recognised something in the pictures that their parents had told them, but they had never seen for themselves."My young friend Paul represents the generation that escaped that hell.He's silenced by Andrei - his experience, his audacity, his pictures.Later, as we walk back through the centre of Bucharest, taking in its schizophrenic appearance with fresh eyes, Paul quietly concedes: 'It is a pity Ceausescu had to build the palace complex right in the middle of the old city."From Our Own Correspondent: Listen online or download the podcast.BBC Radio 4: Saturdays at 11:30 and some Thursdays at 11:00BBC World Service: Short editions Monday-Friday - see World Service programme schedule.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>In prison with al-Shabab: What drives Somali militants?</title>
      <description>What sharing a cell revealed about Somali militant mindset</description>

      <body>After a year locked up in Uganda with self-confessed Islamist militants, a Kenyan human rights lawyer is able to give clues as to what drove those behind Kenya's deadly mall siege, writes the BBC's Will Ross."They have a conviction that what they are doing is right and the rest are wrong," says Al Amin Kimathi about the members of the Somali group al-Shabab who bombed bars in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, where patrons were watching the 2010 World Cup final on TV."The conviction comes from what they would say is an act of faith," says Mr Kimathi.Following the bombings, in which 76 people died, Mr Kimathi accused Kenya and Uganda of illegal rendition - arresting suspects in Kenya and sending them to Uganda without due process.He was then arrested himself and accused of involvement in the bomb plot - a charge he denies.Al-Shabab said it carried out the attack because Ugandans at the time made up the bulk of the African Union force in Somalia (Amisom).Mr Kimathi's case never went to trial and he was released in September 2011.In prison he had lengthy conversations with the al-Shabab members, including those who planted the bombs."They are given quotations from the Koran, the Hadiths [Prophet Muhammad's teachings], but they do not have the benefit of a critical mind to look at it in any other context and they trust the people driving them to this," he says."Advantage is taken of this person's feeling of desperation and that is dangerous enough to drive them over the top."They are given the feeling that they are a very important person and that martyrdom is something to aspire to - the anger over their deprivation is lowered to a feeling of comfort, to a point where the only thing they aspire to is a collective action."Whether that action leads to their survival or death that doesn't really matter any more."Mr Kimathi says he challenged the young al-Shabab members in prison to say which Koranic authority gave them the right to take innocent lives.After discussions they would often admit they were wrong: "In a lot of instances you would even see a lot of remorse. But they would just come back with the mere argument of revenge."They would say: 'Look you have not been out there in Somalia during this whole war - we've been there and we've seen the kind of attacks by the Ugandan forces and African Union forces, the kind of raids they conduct and this [Kampala attack] is nothing compared to what we've seen out there.'"Mr Kimathi believes that despite being brainwashed, it is still very possible to pull sympathisers back from the brink of committing violence."One thing that needs to be done is to identify people who have that kind of mindset, reach out to them - which is rarely done - and show them that they belong, people care about them and that people are not hunting them - because they feel they are hunted."Outside the Jamia Mosque in the centre of Kenya's capital, Nairobi, where worshippers were being screened with metal detectors before praying, people told me why they thought young men were being enticed to join groups like al-Shabab."Our young people are being used," says one man leaving the mosque."They don't have a job and if someone offers them some little money they'll do anything."Another man said: "They are too desperate to earn money - some are earning less than $1 (£0.60) a day so they are easily misused."This person is willing and ready to do anything that is offered to him."He said a solution could be found in Islamic schools, or madrassas."But the teachers there need formal education so they understand the importance of getting a proper education."A lot of money comes to Kenya through free primary education but those madrassas are left out."There are counter-radicalisation programmes in Kenya but some analysts suggest they rely too heavily on a counter-terrorism approach - with the police and army leading the way."There are still plenty of existing grievances in Kenya and in the wider region that mean people will be animated by the kind of issues that fuel al-Shabab and will be determined to join either al-Shabab or other networks allied to al-Qaeda," says Cedric Barnes, project director for the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group (ICG).Those social grievances include marginalisation not just in north-east Kenya, where most Somalis live, but also in coastal districts.While in any big city, particularly Nairobi, there will be people who feel they are not getting a chance."Young men in particular, I think, suffer from feeling overlooked and not getting opportunities that they see others getting," says Mr Barnes.Al-Shabab has been severely weakened inside Somalia where it has lost territory to the foreign troops fighting under the banner of Amisom over the past two years.September's Westgate shopping centre attack seemed to be sending out the message - "we are not a finished force" - but al-Shabab also hopes to provoke a reaction which will boost the group."The Kenyan people and government now control the next move," Somalia expert Ken Menkhaus wrote on the American political blog, ThinkProgress."If they respond to this terrible tragedy with restraint and respect for due process and rule of law, they will do more to undermine al-Shabab than all of the counter-terrorism operations conducted inside Somalia."If the deadly attack succeeds in prompting vigilante violence by Kenyan citizens or heavy-handed government reactions against Somali residents, al-Shabab stands a chance of recasting itself as the vanguard militia protecting Somalis against external enemies."It desperately needs to reframe the conflict in Somalia as Somalis versus the foreigners, not as Somalis who seek peace and a return to normalcy versus a toxic jihadi movement," writes Mr Menkhaus.Mr Kimathi also knows there is a danger of playing into al-Shabab's hands, because he has seen the way young people have reacted upon release after years in detention."They come out angry and indeed you would even hear in the first minutes of release somebody coming out and saying: 'I am going to [get] revenge - I cannot stand these sort of injustices any more.'"Right now there is so much sympathy for the authorities, even from those people who have stood at the borderlines of extremism," Mr Kimathi says."If they can see the investigation and operations are being conducted within the bounds of some civil order then there is going to be quite a lot of collaboration and co-operation."But what if there is a heavy-handed response?"Then they risk feeding into the vicious cycle of recruitment and offering fodder for more terrorist propaganda," Mr Kimathi warns.</body>

      <title>Once-banned protest songs make comeback</title>
      <description>The dance music once banned for being a threat to France</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24300017</url>
      <date>1380930672</date>
      <body>A type of dance music from the island of Reunion was considered such a threat to the French state in the 1970s that it was banned. Maloya music is now becoming popular around the world - and is being used to express the anger of a new generation.It is a hot Sunday morning on Reunion, an island out in the Indian Ocean that is a part of France, an overseas departement.And in the little fishing port of Terre Saint, they are holding an annual free festival known as Ris Sofe, named after the Creole word for the rice dish that the sugar cane workers used to eat before heading out for the fields that stretch up towards the volcano in the centre of the island.Down by the pier, there are stalls where the wives of fishermen are of course selling Ris Sofe - rice, mixed with hot peppers, sausages and fish.The beer tent is doing brisk business and there is a crowd of several hundred, from teenagers to old men in suits and straw hats, gathered around a little stage watching a furiously energetic performance from a celebrated local singer.Firmin Viry is now in his late 70s. But you would not think so as he dances across the stage accompanied by drummers and his own kayamb, a traditional tray-like percussion instrument made from cane stalks.He was once a sugar cane worker himself and then spent 20 years working in a cigarette factory, but now he is famous for his songs and albums.And yet, just 33 years ago, he would have been arrested for singing like this.The police would have broken up the concert and smashed all the instruments because Viry is an exponent of maloya, a musical style that was banned by the French authorities.It was particularly hated, so Viry told me, by President Giscard d'Estaing.The songs are sung in Creole, not French, and the percussive backing has its roots in Africa, from where slaves were brought to Reunion to work in the cane fields.The Catholic Church violently disapproved because it was used in servis kabare ceremonies, in which participants say they enter a trance and come face to face with their ancestors.The French authorities had other reasons to be concerned. In its secular form, maloya is great dance music, but it can also be protest music.And the Communist Party made great use of maloya in the 1970s, when it was fighting for greater autonomy from France. It wanted the same status as Corsica, while other activists argued for full independence.Maloya was seen by the French as a threat to the state and, sitting backstage by the sea after the show, Firmin Viry told me about life as a musician in those dangerous days.He performed without being discovered by the French authorities by constantly changing his tactics, organising shows in different peoples' houses, often under the guise of a birthday party.Other musicians were not so lucky. He told me of his friend Augustin, who was jailed for playing maloya.Life for a maloya player changed dramatically in 1981 when Francois Mitterand, leader of the Socialist Party, became the French president.He did not just legalise the music, allowing it to be played on the radio, but provided funds to help cultural projects.The Communist Party had not got what it wanted, Viry told me, but the protests came to an end.Today, maloya is becoming internationally popular among world music fans thanks to artists like Danyel Waro and Christine Salem, who were massively influenced by Firmin Viry.But it still provides a reminder of the divisions that exist on this exquisite little island, between the French who buy houses here or come as tourists - you do not even need to show your passport if you fly in from Paris - and the Creole-speaking population, many of whom are poor and without work and who argue that their identity and culture are in danger of being swamped by France.There have been sporadic violent protests against the cost of living. The most recent was in February last year when riot police were sent to the island from France.And according to Danyel Waro's musician son Sam, "the young people are angry"."Unemployment is over 40% for those between 18 and 25 and they will not shut up. They are starting to scream."They are angry that people from France come here and get jobs when local people are struggling." Although France, he added, does provide unemployment benefit.So does the once-banned old-style maloya music from the 1970s still have a role to play?"It is the cry of the people," says Firmin Viry. "There is no good balance between France and Reunion when it comes to jobs."One of his songs is about unemployment and how hard it is.Far away in Paris, there is no suggestion that the authorities will ever again ban maloya.But perhaps, if they want to judge the mood in this tropical outpost, it is time for them to brush up on their Creole and start listening to Firmin's lyrics.From Our Own Correspondent: Listen online or download the podcast.BBC Radio 4: Saturdays at 11:30 and some Thursdays at 11:00BBC World Service: Short editions Monday-Friday - see World Service programme schedule.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Four weddings and a shutdown</title>
      <description>Four big days scuppered by US shutdown</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24403995</url>
      <date>1380930144</date>
      <body>As disagreements in Congress mean that "closed" signs hang outside national parks across the US, four couples explain how they've coped with their wedding venues being suddenly out of bounds.When Natasha Juliao and Sean Coughlin walked on to Paramount Ranch just outside Los Angeles, they knew they had found their perfect wedding venue."The second that we stepped on the property, I knew it was where I was going to get married and we were jumping up and down and giddy," gushed bride-to-be Natasha.So when she found out that the bohemian ghost town would be closed for her big day, she was crushed. "I immediately had a nervous breakdown and started crying at work, it was awful. I had no idea what to do."With family and friends flying in from places as far as Taiwan, postponing the wedding was not an option. Unable to get a refund, Juliao and Coughlin, a nursing assistant and production co-ordinator, were nearly out of time and money to find an alternative. Then, through a stroke of fate and a stranger's kindness, Natasha managed to put together a new wedding in two days.The owner of Wooden Nickel Ranch, two hours away from their original venue, found out about the couple's story in local media and then discovered she had a cancellation for the same Sunday.Feeling for the couple's misfortune, she knocked down the starting price by 90%. Still a bit shaky from the entire ordeal, Natasha praised her wedding day hero: "She was really an angel for us."Hoping to create an intimate setting for their families' first encounter, Drake Lucas and Zach Kouwe spent more than a year poring over Pinterest, planning a low-key wedding in California's Yosemite National Park."Ironically," Drake noted, "we chose it because we thought it would be stress-free." But with the park closed, the Brooklyn couple are scrambling to put together a plan B wedding in San Francisco, a five-hour drive away.From the flowers to the venue, everything has to be found in less than a week, which means nothing will be quite as they envisaged.In the midst of her hectic attempts to salvage her big day, Lucas, a grant-writer at Human Rights Watch, has some words of wisdom for Congress."If I can just share a little of the advice I've been given during my engagement, I might be able to help us all out. It's called compromise."I hear you have to do a lot of it in marriage, and it seems to me that you should have to do a lot of it in your job, too. You can't just give up if you don't get your way."And you have to pay your bills on time. Because we are in this for the long haul and there are enough real problems we will have to weather - there is no need to create ones you can prevent.""I never thought I'd hike in a wedding dress."As an endurance athlete, Genevieve Jeuck knew how to push through in tough situations. But when she found out that her Grand Canyon dream wedding would be off limits, she stopped in her tracks."I got the call Thursday night. I cried. I was freaking out, and then I thought I was turning into a 'Bridezilla.'"Jeuck, a violinist, and her fiance Michael Sallemi, a Harley Davidson salesman, hadn't connected the dots between the government shutdown and the national parks closing.And with less than six days until the 2 October wedding, all options were on the table. But then the New Jersey couple were able to relocate to Sedona, Arizona, and the last-second wedding included an unexpected hike in the white dress.Though she never cared for politics before, the new bride has spent her honeymoon closely following the effects of the shutdown throughout the country.Angry and impassioned, Jeuck has vowed that her days of apathy are over. "Now, I'm sorry I'm following and I'm voting and I'm doing everything I can to have a say."MaiLien and Michael - wedding Saturday, Washington DCMaiLien Le and Michael Cassesso had planned a romantic wedding at the Jefferson Memorial, where they met for their first date more than four years ago.Having worked in politics, the couple are no stranger to Capitol Hill antics, but that didn't soften the blow as their wedding became a casualty of the latest Washington crisis."It's gut-wrenching, frustrating, aggravating, disheartening to have our wedding turned upside down like that," says Cassesso, a legislative analyst. Le, a project co-ordinator at an executive search firm, had a more intuitive reaction, with an expletive.As strangers started donating to their wedding gift registry, Cassesso and Le directed the funds to The Covenant House, a charity for homeless young people, a group the couple think will be adversely affected by the shutdown.They have found another venue for Saturday's wedding in Washington DC, and he says the ordeal has a silver lining."Throughout all this there was no fighting, no arguing," Cassesso says. "It confirmed for me even more than I already knew that this is going to last, this is the right choice."</body>

      <title>Afghan pullout: Central Asia worries</title>
      <description>Under threat from Islamic militancy?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24397109</url>
      <date>1380933301</date>
      <body>The neglected region of Central Asia faces a new threat from Islamic militancy as the US withdrawal from neighbouring Afghanistan nears, reports guest columnist Ahmed Rashid.The five Central Asian Republics are deeply fearful of the consequences of next year's withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan.Having faced attacks from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) and other al-Qaeda linked groups before and after September 11 2001, they fear a redoubled onslaught of extremists coming across their borders from Afghanistan and Pakistan.And there are reports that the IMU and their allies are trying to establish new bases along the Afghan border adjacent to Central Asia.While addressing the UN General Assembly on 27 September, the foreign ministers of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, Abdulaziz Kamilov and Erlan Idrissov, warned of serious threats to regional and global security from terrorism, extremism and drug trafficking emanating out of Afghanistan after 2014.Separately, they both blamed the West for failing to secure a political solution to the Afghan conflict before pulling troops out next year.The five republics - Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan - do not trust the Americans or Nato to secure the region after 2014, because of their collective failure to secure peace inside Afghanistan or a regional settlement among countries bordering Afghanistan.They feel politically slighted by the US and the Kabul government.Meanwhile the Central Asian states are themselves deeply at odds with each other as they cannot agree on a common plan to protect their region after 2014.Some are turning back to their old overlord - Russia.On 1 October Tajikistan's parliament ratified a treaty with Moscow to extend by three decades Russia's bases and troops in Tajikistan.Russia has 6,000 troops stationed in three cities to defend Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan.The most vulnerable countries are Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, which share over 1,200 miles (1,900km) of borders with northern Afghanistan.Tajikistan is already the weakest state in the region, with an untrained army and facing a severe economic crisis - and corrupt state institutions resulting from their involvement in the opium trade coming out of Afghanistan.For several years the IMU and other groups have been trying to establish a base around the northern Afghan city of Kunduz and the border town of Emam Sahib.There has been fighting between the IMU and US and German troops who were based in this region, but those troops have now pulled out, leaving the Afghan army in charge.Latest reports from the region point to an even more potent threat emanating from Badakhshan province in Afghanistan's north-west.Up to 500 militants have ousted Afghan forces from several districts in the province and are trying to take control of Iskashim, a key district and town that lies along the Afghan border. It is separated from Tajikistan only by the narrow Panj river which freezes over in winter, making forays into Tajikistan much easier.The IMU's main base is the district of Warduj, that lies in the centre of Badakhshan where some of the local population have been forcibly converted to Wahabbism - the strict Islamic code practised by the IMU and al-Qaeda.Badakshan's mountainous terrain, set in the Pamir and Hindu Kush ranges, is to the militants' advantage.They want to occupy a vast region where the tip of southern Tajikistan, Pakistan's north-western border, and eastern Afghanistan are all in touching distance.In the north-east is the Wakhan corridor and the border with China, from where the IMU recruit from the local Uighur or Chinese Muslim population.Much of the area is inaccessible to regular troops - especially the Afghan army which lacks effective air power.Pakistan remains a crucial source of supplies for the militants, with Pakistani militant groups playing a key support role for the IMU. The IMU in turn pay for the services they receive through the money they earn in drug trafficking.The Pakistan-based militants are believed to be from several groups, showing the extent of their interest in the future of Central Asia.They include the IMU, Pakistani and Afghan Taliban, another Pakistani Punjabi group, Lashkar-e-Toiba, and the Islamic Jihad Union, a group that recruits Turks and European Muslims as well as Central Asians, and is said to be directly controlled by al-Qaeda.The strategic danger is that the militants are trying to secure the entire north-eastern corridor of Afghanistan - the provinces of Kunar, Nuristan and Badakhshan - before next year so that they can have a major base of operations against the Kabul government.The IMU under their charismatic leader Juma Namangani launched attacks in three Central Asian states before September 11, but then retreated into Afghanistan, joining up with the Taliban and al-Qaeda.After Namangani was killed fighting the US invasion in 2001, IMU remnants retreated into Pakistan's tribal areas, from where they have reorganised themselves and operated ever since.They received large numbers of recruits after the Uzbek government massacred more than 1,000 people in Andijan in the Ferghana Valley in 2005.Since then IMU fighters have fought with the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban and al-Qaeda against the Pakistan, Afghan and US armies.The IMU recruits from all the nationalities in Central Asia as well as Uighurs, Pakistanis, Chechens and other ethnic groups from the Caucasus.For the first time there are reports of Turkmen and Kazakhs among the fighters in Badakshan. Traditionally these two ethnic groups have not supported militancy.Despite its partial oil and gas wealth, politically Central Asia remains one of the most neglected regions of the world. The states remain deeply suspicious of outsider intentions.The Americans are disliked, the Russians are not trusted and overwhelming Chinese influence is feared.However Central Asia now faces a new threat from Islamic militancy.</body>

      <title>'Digital baby' screen for sperm donors</title>
      <description>A service that digitally weaves together the DNA of prospective parents to check for potential disease in thousands of "virtual babies" is set to launch in the US by December.</description>

      <body>A service that digitally weaves together the DNA of prospective parents to check for potential disease in thousands of "virtual babies" is set to launch in the US by December.New York start-up Genepeeks will initially focus on donor sperm, simulating before pregnancy how the genetic sequence of a female client might combine with those of different males.Donors that more often produce "digital children" with a higher risk of inherited disorders will be filtered out, leaving those who are better genetic matches.Everything happens in a computer, but experts have raised ethical questions."We are just in the business right now of giving prospective mothers, who are using donor sperm to conceive, a filtered catalogue of donors based on their own underlying genetic profile," Genepeeks co-founder Anne Morriss told BBC News."We are filtering out the donor matches with an elevated risk of rare recessive paediatric conditions."Ms Morriss, an entrepreneur, gave a presentation on the company at the Consumer Genetics Conference in Boston last week.She was motivated in part by her own experience of starting a family. Her son was conceived with a sperm donor who happened to share with Morriss the gene for an inherited disorder called MCADD.MCADD (medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency) prevents those affected from converting fats to sugar. It can be fatal if it is not diagnosed early. Luckily, in Ms Morriss's case, the condition was picked up in newborn screening tests."My son has a pretty normal life," Ms Morriss said, "but about 30% of children with rare genetic diseases don't make it past the age of five."Genepeeks has formalised a partnership with a sperm bank - the Manhattan Cryobank - and has a patent pending on the DNA screening technology.The start-up benefits from the rapid pace of change in genetic technology.Indeed, six months ago, Genepeeks' founders decided it was able to use a superior system for DNA analysis (called "targeted exon sequencing") than the one originally envisaged - a result, says Anne Morriss, of falling costs and increased flexibility.For couples planning babies, other companies already screen one or both partners for genes that could cause disease if combined with a similar variant - so-called "carrier screening".One academic who studies the use of genetic technology commented: "This is like that, but ramped up 100,000 times."Ms Morriss's business partner, Prof Lee Silver, a geneticist and expert on bioethics at Princeton University, New Jersey, told BBC News: "We get the DNA sequence from two prospective parents. We simulate the process of reproduction, forming virtual sperm and virtual eggs. We put them together to form a hypothetical child genome."Then we can look at that hypothetical genome and - with all the tools of modern genetics - determine the risk that the genome will result in a child with disease. We're looking directly for disease and not carrier status. For each pair of people that we're going to analyse, we make 10,000 hypothetical children."The process will be run for the client and each potential donor one by one, scanning for some 600 known single-gene recessive conditions. In this way, the highest-risk pairings can be filtered out.Anne Morriss added: "At this stage our clients won't be receiving any genetic information back. We're very much focused on the practical utility of helping prospective parents who want to protect their future kids, giving them the option of additional analysis to what is currently being offered in the industry."But the company's founders have plans to expand the screening beyond single-gene recessive disorders to more complex conditions in which multiple genes play a part.Indeed, going to the trouble of simulating thousands of digital children deliberately lays the ground for this: "[It's] impossible to get towards an accurate risk calculation in any other way," said Anne Morriss.And in a video produced by the company, Prof Silver says: "My hope for the future is that any people who want to have a baby can use this technology to greatly reduce the risk of disease being expressed in their child."To some, such a prospect might appear like a step towards designer babies - until now the preserve of science fiction literature and films such as Gattaca, which envisaged a future of genetic "haves" and "have-nots".Bio-ethicists approached by the BBC said Genepeeks was a logical outcome of the increasing demand for more information when making reproductive decisions.However, some raised potential concerns about risk communication and the expansion of screening beyond rare single-gene disorders. But they suggested there were few, if any, regulatory barriers.One ethicist told BBC News: "The biggest question for me, just from the outset, is the understanding of uncertainty. Even people who have been doing genomics for years still have a hard time figuring out exactly what a risk for a particular genetic predisposition really means for a family."Gene-environment interactions can lead to people either having disease or not having disease."Dr Ewan Birney, associate director of the European Bioinformatics Institute in Hinxton, UK, echoed the point: "It's good that they're focusing on the carrier status of these rare Mendelian disorders where it's potentially more clear-cut. That said, these things are more complex than they first seem," he said."I'm sure the scientists appreciate that complexity. But when transmitting that complexity to everyday people, these things can sound more absolute than they really are."He added: "The thing I would want to stress here is just how complex this is. It's great that people are thinking of using this technology in lots of different ways, but our knowledge gap is very large."Risk communication to clients was, said Anne Morriss, "absolutely critical to anyone in this industry"."We have to be crystal clear about what we're testing for, what risks we're helping to reduce; that there's no guarantee you won't give birth to a sick child," she said.Prof Mildred Cho, associate director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics in California, raised questions over whether the sperm donor should also receive information about their genome gleaned from the screening process."Unlike hair colour, occupation or family history - those are things, presumably, the donor already knows - the thing that's different about this that I see is it could create information that the donor doesn't already have. It also has implications for the donor's other biological family members," Prof Cho told BBC News.This week it also emerged that California-based consumer genetics company 23andMe had submitted the patent on a DNA analysis tool for planning a child.Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter</body>

      <title>New shape-shifting metals discovered</title>
      <description>Scientists develop a new family of smart materials that could be used in applications ranging from space vehicles to electronics to jet engines.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24400101</url>
      <date>1380888037</date>
      <body>A new shape-changing metal crystal is reported in the journal Nature, by scientists at University of Minnesota.It is the prototype of a new family of smart materials that could be used in applications ranging from space vehicles to electronics to jet engines.Called a "martensite", the crystal has two different arrangements of atoms, switching seamlessly between them.It can change shape tens of thousands of times when heated and cooled without degrading, unlike existing technology.Currently, martensite metals are made of an alloyed mixture of nickel and titanium.They have the remarkable ability to "remember" their shape and even after being bent will return to their original form. For this, they are called "shape memory" metals.They have been used in spectacle frames and brassiere wires, but also in surgery as frameworks for shaping healing bones, and as "stents" for holding heart arteries open.Martensite metals change shape when heated or cooled through a certain temperature, when the atoms that make up their structure rearrange themselves in a sudden transformation.Some call this a "military transformation" because the rows of atoms that make up the metal crystal click into their new shape in an orderly manner.The transformation means that martensite can be used in smart mechanisms that respond to temperature change.Examples include automatic windows-openers in glasshouses, a means for automatically guiding solar panels to point at the Sun on the Hubble Space Telescope, and, very recently, in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to morph the trailing edge of the engine cowling, making it quieter when it runs hot on take-off.The pitfall of current martensites is that after repeated shape changes, they build up stresses inside that degrade them and eventually break them apart. The new alloy, made of a mixture of zinc, gold and copper, changes back and forth almost indefinitely with little internal damage, opening up a new range of applications for these types of "active materials".The aim is now to apply the lessons learned from the new metal to make a family of ceramic solids that can also be shape-switched back and forth."The real advance is to make the transformations reversible that could be applied in many situations" explains Prof Richard James, one of the authors of the study."You could make devices that convert heat to electricity directly. They could use the waste heat from computers and cell phones to recharge the battery and make them more efficient."As the material cycles through its different atomic arrangements, crystals can be seen at its surface in ever-changing patterns, looking like microscopic rivers.The structures fit together without any stress layers between them, and this seems to be the key to their longevity and potential.The new materials could also be used in improved and efficient microelectromechanical systems - energy harvesting devices, in which small vibrations can be converted directly into power.These sorts of gizmos are already used in tyre pressure-monitoring systems in cars to power the electronics in the sensors.</body>

      <body>Ornithologists working in Oman say an owl discovered in a remote, mountainous region could be a new species.Wildlife sound-recordist Magnus Robb told BBC News that he heard the bird's call whilst trying to record the call of another type of owl.After repeated trips to the remote site, he and a colleague - naturalist and photographer Arnoud van den Berg - captured photographs of the bird.They have published their observations in the journal Dutch Birding.Mr Robb's first recordings of the bird's unfamiliar hoot were a serendipitous discovery in March of this year."I was listening through my headphones, when I suddenly heard something completely different [to the owl species I was there to record]," he told BBC News."I know the other Arabian owl sounds quite well, and this was clearly something that didn't fit."The bird call expert said he had a "good inkling straight away that this could be something new"."I even phoned a colleague a few minutes later and said, 'I think I've just discovered a new species of owl."Mr Robb, who is involved in an international project called the Sound Approach, which aims to catalogue and understand bird sound, analysed the owls' call in detail.This revealed that the bird was most likely to belong to a genus, or group of species, known as Strix.Dr Wesley Hochachka from Cornell University's lab of ornithology commented that, in the last few decades, it had become "more accepted by ornithologists, particularly in tropical areas, that new species are being discovered based on distinctively different vocalisations".The team plans to gather DNA evidence from the owl's feathers in order to confirm their find genetically.But Prof Ian Newton, a bird expert from the UK's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said he found the evidence that the team had already provided convincing."Based on the recordings of songs and calls and on the good-quality photographs, I was also convinced that it should be placed within the genus Strix, which also contains the Tawny Owl of Britain and Europe," he told BBC News.Mr Robb said he hoped eventually to name the new species the Omani owl, in honour of the Omani people."One of the reasons we've gone through this process of describing and confirming this as a new species so quickly is to get conservation for this owl as soon as possible," he explained to BBC News."Conservation can only start when this species is accepted and given some official status."He hopes to return to Oman later this year in to learn more about the owl, its habitat and its behaviour.So far, he and and his colleagues have found only seven of the birds in a single wadi in the remote, mountainous area of Oman."This suggests that it's a very rare creature indeed," he told BBC News.</body>

      <title>Pollution 'hampers bees' foraging'</title>
      <description>Honeybees' ability to find flowers could be hampered by a chemical in diesel exhaust, say scientists.</description>

      <body>Honeybees' ability to find flowers could be hampered by a chemical in diesel exhaust, say scientists.Tests showed that exhaust degraded some floral scent chemicals the bees "home in on" when they are foraging.The study, published in Scientific Reports, also revealed that a specific group of chemicals found in diesel exhaust, known as NOx, diminished the insects' response to floral scents.They say the results are evidence that air quality should be improved."We got into this, because we were aware of the impacts of airborne pollutants on human health, so it didn't seem so wild that there may be impacts that extended beyond human health," said University of Southampton neuroscientist Dr Tracey Newman, who was involved in the work.To drill down to the chemical effects of pollution on the pollinators, the researchers made a mixture of the volatile, or smelly, chemicals that make up the scent of oilseed rape.They then used a diesel-powered generator to create a mixture of air and exhaust that closely matched levels of exhaust found on a busy road, and mixed this lab-made air pollution with the floral scent mix."We saw that there was loss of two of the components [of the floral odour mixture]," Dr Newman said.The two odour chemicals that were "lost" had chemically reacted with a component of the diesel exhaust, mono-nitrogen oxide, known as NOx.Having worked out how the pollution affected the chemistry of floral scents, the team set out to discover if the bees were affected by this change."Bees need to decipher the chemical messages they're getting [from flowers] to be able to home in on the flowers they know will give the best yield [of nectar]," said Dr Newman.The pollinators, she said, learned to recognise the scents of nectar-rich flowers and this enabled them to forage more efficiently.The team carried out a test that involved teaching bees to associate the smell of a particular chemical with being given a drop of sugary liquid.Bees respond to the taste of the sugar by sticking out their tongues - just as they do when drinking nectar from a flower. So after a few trials where the scent of the odour is followed closely by a sweet drop of liquid, the bees stick out their tongues as soon as they detect the scent."Having trained a bunch of bees, we then tested to see if they would respond in the same way to the mixture that was depleted by exposure to NOx [the reactive chemical in diesel exhaust]," said Dr Newman.When these odour chemicals were degraded by NOx, the bees were much less responsive to their smell and would not stick out their tongues.Biologist and lead researcher Dr Guy Poppy added that the airborne pollution appeared to be interfering with "the complex relationship" that had evolved between plants and animals."Flowers have evolved to produce chemical mixtures that attract pollinators," he told BBC News.Dr Newman added that the study highlighted the need to reduce pollution and improve air quality, in order to protect pollinating insects as well as improve human health.The value to food production of so-called "pollination services" is estimated to be hundreds of millions of pounds per year in the UK alone.Prof James Nieh, who studies honeybee health and behaviour at the University of California San Diego, said that the research posed a "largely unexplored question"."Most research on such contaminants has focused on pesticides," he told BBC News."But bees are subject to a much wider variety of pollutants and contaminants. The influence and potential synergy of these pollutants with pesticides should be studied."</body>

      <title>Uncertainty hampering food security</title>
      <description>More than 600 scientists from around the world have gathered in the Netherlands for a food security conference, described as the first of its kind.</description>

      <body>More than 600 scientists gathered in the Netherlands for a global food security conference, described as the first of its kind.Organisers said science could help end uncertainty surrounding efforts to meet the food needs of future generations.They added that, until now, there were many policy debates on food security but there was no scientific forum for researchers to share knowledge.The next food security conference will be held in the US in 2015."A really key message from the conference for us is that we have got lots of estimates about needs of population growth etc, but at the moment we are so uncertain of the exact numbers - the uncertainty is really very high," said conference co-chairman Ken Giller, professor of plant production systems at Wageningen University."We talk about the current population being seven billion, moving to 9.2 billion in 2050 and the estimate is that we need to increase production 70% or more."But there are many different ways of addressing that. If we don't know what the problem is then we can't get started in addressing them."Appetite for changeProf Giller said there was "unprecedented interest" among the scientific community when details of the conference was first announced."We did anticipate about 250-300 people , but we actually ended up with more than 900 abstracts being submitted," he told BBC News."The conference was basically sold out - we had 600 people and that was all we could accommodate."He explained that the conference was designed to create a forum where representatives from the different branches of science could come together and discuss and debate the issues of global food security."We pulled together a science committee with the real aim to make the conference broad and to include all the main disciplines," he said."We had people on the science committee from economics, nutrition and we had people dealing with food waste, which is a very important topical issue."Prof Giller said that current estimates suggested that 30-40% of the food produced was wasted and not eaten.Other themes that were discussed at the conference included:The organisers hope that the outcomes from the four-day event in Noordwijkerhout, South Holland, will help focus the scientific world's contribution to the UN global policy system.One of the UN's eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) was to "eradicate extreme poverty and hunger" by 2015, which included the target of halving - between 1990 and 2015 - the proportion of people suffering from hunger.Assessments suggest the target is "within reach". However, a 2013 report on the progress of the MDGs warned that one in eight people remained chronically undernourished.UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has announced that he wants to build on the MDGs, replacing them with a suite of Sustainable Development Goals that will run from 2015-2030.He said one of his priorities was to "adopt globally agreed goals for food and nutrition security, mobilise all key stakeholders to provide support to smallholder farmers and food processors and bolster the resilience of communities and nations experiencing periodic food crises".Prof Giller said this presented a "wonderful opportunity for science to get directly engaged in policies and help advise governments".</body>

      <title>Worker error causes Fukushima leak</title>
      <description>Japan's crippled Fukushima nuclear plant has a new leak of radioactive water after workers overfilled a storage tank, its operator says.</description>

      <body>Japan's crippled Fukushima nuclear plant has a new leak of radioactive water after workers overfilled a storage tank, its operator says.The workers miscalculated the tank's capacity as it was tilted on unlevel ground, plant operator Tepco said.It said around 430 litres (100 gallons) of water may have leaked from the tank, and could have flowed into the sea.The plant has experienced several leaks since being crippled by an earthquake and tsunami in 2011.One of the largest leaks took place in August, when Tepco discovered a leak of at least 300 tonnes of highly radioactive water at a different part of the plant.The latest leak was discovered by workers late on Wednesday.Tepco official Masayuki Ono said: "We would like to apologise that we have to announce that we've had another leak in our tanks today.""This is partly because we've had to fill our tanks to the brim in order to deal with the difficult management of rain water overflow following [a typhoon]," he added.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said that Tepco had failed to deal with the leaks successfully."It's actually leaking so of course we can't say that [Tepco] have been properly dealing with the issue. It should not be leaking at all," he said.The 2011 disaster knocked out cooling systems to the nuclear plant's reactors, three of which melted down.Water is now being pumped in to cool the reactors, but storing the resultant large quantities of radioactive water has proved a challenge for Tepco.In September, the government said it would invest hundreds of millions of dollars into building a frozen wall around the plant to stop the leaks.</body>

      <title>Trees in ancient forest are felled</title>
      <description>The felling of diseased trees across an area the size of around 300 football pitches is taking place at Wales' largest ancient woodland.</description>

      <date>1380916448</date>
      <body>The felling of diseased trees across an area the size of around 300 football pitches is taking place at Wales' largest ancient woodland.Larch trees at Wentwood Forest, near Newport, have become infected with the fungal disease Phytophthora ramorum.The infection can kill trees and has spread across the UK after being found in south west England four years ago.The Woodland Trust, which owns most of the forest, said the felling of the trees was essential."This is the most serious and devastating action we've had to take on our estate," said the trust's head of woodland management, Andrew Sharkey."It again highlights both the need to tackle tree disease and the importance of restoring as much of our damaged ancient woodland to make it more resilient in decades to come."Felling the infected conifers across an area of 200 hectares (500 acres) will leave the Woodland Trust with a £35,000 bill for replanting in the forest.It also hits restoration work that has been taking place since the trust bought 352 hectares (869 acres) of Wentwood in 2006."Our aim was to prevent clear felling at Wentwood from happening. However, there is no alternative," explained Rory Francis, also from the trust."We are hoping that the action will slow down the spread of the infection or perhaps halt it."Wentwood Forest is the remains of the ancient tree cover that stretched from the River Wye to the River Usk.Conifers were first introduced to the wood in 1880, and much of the forest cleared to provide timber for trenches in World War I.When it was replanted in the 1950s and 1960s, the once abundant broadleaf trees were replaced with imported conifers, ultimately damaging the forest floor and its natural formation.The forest is spread out over 400 hectares (1,000 acres) and is home to 75 species of birds, including turtle doves, nightjars and spotted flycatchers, and is a habitat for dormice, otters, and pipistrelle bats.It is also a home to wild bluebells, wood sorrel and wild daffodils."Every time you have to clear-fell, the risk is that the shock of the sudden change in conditions stresses some of the native species and they could be lost," said Mr Francis."So in the short term, it will have a negative impact. We don't want to do it but it is a legal requirement."Natural Resources Wales (NRW), which manages most of the remaining forest, said it had already invested £500,000 across Wales to halt the spread of the infection, and was setting aside another £2m to tackle the problem.The disease has recently been discovered at Bwlch Nant-yr-Arian near Aberystwyth and at Cwmcarn Forest Drive in Caerphilly county borough.The infection has also spread to parts of north Wales, at Coed Maentwrog near Porthmadog, and at Coed Cymerau near Blaenau Ffestiniog.It has also affected larches across south west England, Northern Ireland and the west of Scotland."The felling in Wentwood Forest is very sad but this prompt action by the Woodland Trust is essential to try to slow the spread of this devastating disease," said John Browne, from NRW."Our ultimate aim is to make our forests more resilient to pests and diseases and we are heartened that the Woodland Trust is to seize this opportunity to undertake change of structure and species within Wentwood Forest by planting native broadleaves."The felled larch trees will be replaced with a mix of oak and cherry trees, and other broadleaf native trees."In some ways it will actually accelerate the work to plant native trees, but it is not in the circumstances we would have preferred," added the trust's Mr Francis.</body>

      <title>Top five physics discoveries chosen</title>
      <description>Quantum computers and science that could enable mobile phone shoe chargers are among the top physics spin-offs chosen by a leading magazine.</description>

      <body>Five physics discoveries with the potential to transform the world have been selected by a leading science magazine for its 25th birthday issue.Quantum computing and science that could enable shoes to charge a mobile phone are among the list compiled by Physics World.A potential new tumour treatment called hadron therapy and the "wonder-material" graphene also feature.The magazine also picked its top five breakthroughs of the last 25 years.In all, the publication compiled five lists of five to examine different aspects of physics.Graphene has been one of the most talked-about discoveries in the last decade.Its strength, flexibility and conductivity make it a potentially ideal material for bendable smartphones and superior prosthetic limbs.But graphene has another, less-heralded property which could help it transform the everyday lives of people around the world.Despite being just one atom thick, it is impervious to almost all liquids and gases.Generating holes in sheets of graphene could therefore create a selective membrane - "the ultimate water purifier" - which might someday create drinking water from the sea."Predicting the future is a mug's game. Of course, we expect to get a few of them wrong," Hamish Johnston, editor of physicsworld.com told BBC News."Grandiose, utopian predictions that never materialise always look faintly ridiculous in years to come - have you seen anyone recently flying to work on a nuclear-powered jet-pack?"Physics World is the monthly magazine of the Institute of Physics and was first published in October 1988.Selecting the five most important breakthroughs of its lifetime was "harder than choosing Nobel laureates", according to reporter Tushna Commissariat."There have been so many eye-popping findings that our final choice is, inevitably, open to debate," she wrote."Yet for us, these five discoveries stand out above all others as having done the most to transform our understanding of the world."They are, in chronological order:The magazine's 25th anniversary issue also highlights five images that have allowed us to "see" a physical phenomenon or effect.They range from the microscopic - electrons on a copper crystal - to the enormous - the Cat's Eye Nebula, as photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope.The list of five "biggest unanswered questions" features some eternal riddles - "is life on Earth unique?" Another is: "what exactly is time?"The final top five is a set of "fiendish physics-themed puzzles" devised by the British signals intelligence agency GCHQ.The first has already appeared online - a jumbled set of letters on a page which need to be deciphered before arriving at a physics-themed answer.A similar puzzle was recently used by GCHQ to attract potential employees.It will be followed by another four problems, one per week throughout October, which will become progressively more challenging."We think the puzzles are going to really stretch even the brightest minds," says Matin Durrani, editor of Physics World."You won't need any physics to solve them, but they are certainly going to make you think and they're a fun way to celebrate our 25th anniversary."I also hope our top fives in the birthday issue will remind everyone just how vital, enjoyable and interesting physics can be."</body>

      <title>Health of oceans 'declining fast'</title>
      <description>The health of the world’s oceans is deteriorating even faster than scientists previously thought, a report says.</description>

      <date>1380777580</date>
      <body>The health of the world’s oceans is deteriorating even faster than had previously been thought, a report says.A review from the International Programme on the State of the Ocean (IPSO), warns that the oceans are facing multiple threats.They are being heated by climate change, turned slowly less alkaline by absorbing CO2, and suffering from overfishing and pollution.The report warns that dead zones formed by fertiliser run-off are a problem.It says conditions are ripe for the sort of mass extinction event that has afflicted the oceans in the past.It says: “We have been taking the ocean for granted. It has been shielding us from the worst effects of accelerating climate change by absorbing excess CO2 from the atmosphere.“Whilst terrestrial temperature increases may be experiencing a pause, the ocean continues to warm regardless. For the most part, however, the public and policymakers are failing to recognise - or choosing to ignore - the severity of the situation.”It says the cocktail of threats facing the ocean is more powerful than the individual problems themselves.Coral reefs, for instance, are suffering from the higher temperatures and the effects of acidification whilst also being weakened by bad fishing practices, pollution, siltation and toxic algal blooms.IPSO, funded by charitable foundations, is publishing a set of five papers based on workshops in 2011 and 2012 in partnership with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN’s) World Commission on Protected Areas.The reports call for world governments to halt CO2 increase at 450ppm. Any higher, they say, will cause massive acidification later in the century as the CO2 is absorbed into the sea.It urges much more focused fisheries management, and a priority list for tackling the key groups of chemicals that cause most harm.It wants the governments to negotiate a new agreement for the sustainable fishing in the high oceans to be policed by a new global high seas enforcement agency.The IUCN’s Prof Dan Laffoley said: "What these latest reports make absolutely clear is that deferring action will increase costs in the future and lead to even greater, perhaps irreversible, losses."The UN climate report confirmed that the ocean is bearing the brunt of human-induced changes to our planet. These findings give us more cause for alarm – but also a roadmap for action. We must use it."The co-coordinator, Prof Alex Rogers from Oxford University has been asked to advise the UN's own oceans assessment but he told BBC News he had led the IPSO initiative because: "It’s important to have something which is completely independent in any way from state influence and to say things which experts in the field felt was really needed to be said."He said concern had grown over the past year thanks to papers signalling that past extinctions had involved warming seas, acidification and low oxygen levels. All are on the rise today.He agreed there was debate on whether fisheries are recovering by better management following examples in the US and Europe, but said it seemed clear that globally they were not.He also admitted a debate about whether overall climate change would increase the amount of fish produced in the sea. Melting sea ice would increase fisheries near the poles whilst stratification of warmer waters in the tropics would reduce mixing of nutrients and lead to lower production, he said.He said dead zones globally appeared to be increasing although this may reflect increased reporting."On ocean acidification, we are seeing effects that no-one predicted like the inability of fish to detect their environments properly. It’s clear that it will affect many species. We really do have to get a grip on what’s going on in the oceans," he said.Follow Roger on Twitter</body>

      <body>A contract to build the UK's first nuclear plant in a generation is said to be "within weeks" of completion.Energy Minister Michael Fallon told the Financial Times he was "working intensely" to seal a deal for the £14bn Hinkley Point C reactor in Somerset.Long negotiations have taken place with France's EDF over the price it could charge for the electricity generated.Government approval to build the first in a planned set of new nuclear sites in the UK was granted in March."We're not quite there yet, but I hope we will be in the next few weeks," Mr Fallon told the FT.Talks between EDF and the government to agree on a contract stalled earlier this year over the guaranteed price at which the electricity could be sold.China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group has a co-operation agreement with EDF and could claim a stake of up to 49% in the project, the FT reports.The government's plan to meet its emissions reduction and renewable energy targets were outlined in last year's Energy Bill.It hopes the UK can become more self-sufficient in its energy by increasing the use of both nuclear and wind power, as well as other forms of clean sources such as biomass.He suggested the deal with EDF, which has not commented on the reports, would pave the way for further negotiations on new nuclear plants planned by Japan's Hitachi in Anglesey and Oldbury, in Gloucestershire.There is also said to be interest in further investment in the UK's nuclear sector from companies in South Korea, China and Japan.Mr Fallon said: "There's intense interest there because people can see that finally we're getting our civil nuclear programme moving again after the long, dead Labour years."However, environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth have raised concerns over the potentially high price for electricity the government will agree to in order to get the new plants built, and the issue of nuclear waste.Hinkley Point C will be the third nuclear plant at the Somerset site and will have the potential to provide power for five million homes.Hinkley A, which is now being decommissioned, began generating in 1965 and was closed down in 1999. Hinkley B, which started generating in 1976, is due to be turned off in 2023.The last nuclear plant built in the UK was Sizewell B in Suffolk, completed in 1995.</body>

      <title>Roman skulls washed down lost river</title>
      <description>Archaeologists working with London's Crossrail project uncover 20 skulls believed to be from the Roman period.</description>

      <date>1380677812</date>
      <body>Archaeologists working with London's Crossrail project have uncovered 20 skulls believed to be from the Roman period.It is likely the bones were washed from a nearby burial site along one of London's "lost" rivers - the Walbrook.In the last year archaeologists in London have also found about 10,000 Roman items at a nearby site.These latest finds could give new insights into the lives of Roman people.Near-intact pottery artefacts were also found which probably travelled along the same route as the skulls. Other bone fragments would not have been washed as easily down the river.Paved over in the 15th Century, the Walbrook river divided the western and eastern parts of the city, its moist muddy walls providing exceptionally good conditions for artefacts to be preserved.The discoveries were found about 3m below ground and underneath the the Bedlam cemetery, a burial ground where hundreds of skeletons have been unearthed.Though they have yet to be forensically dated, Nicholas Elsden from the Museum of London Archaeology said they were likely to be from the 3rd to 4th Centuries AD, as that was when Romans buried their citizens as opposed to cremating them."It's relatively unusual to find so many concentrated [in one area] when you're not in a graveyard. We're 100 yards outside the Roman city walls."Roman law required burial outside the city, explained Mr Elsden, which meant there were burial sites circled around the town."What we're looking at here is how the Romans viewed their dead. You wouldn't imagine modern burial grounds being allowed to wash out into a river," he told BBC News.Don Walker, an osteologist also from the Museum of London Archaeology, said the skulls were probably buried in different environments, shown by their shades of brown and grey."Forensic studies show that when the body disintegrates near a watercourse, the skull travels furthest, either because it floats or it can roll along the base of the river."They were possibly buried in an area where there wasn't much land available. At the moment it looks as though they've collected together through natural processes."From initial observations, Mr Walker said there was no evidence of any "foul play", but details about their sex and age would only emerge through further investigations.He added that chemical markers on the teeth could reveal where these people came from and what sorts of food they ate.Archaeologists believe that the Crossrail Project will lead to further discoveries hidden beneath the streets of London and say it could transform our understanding of Roman London.Other recent findings include several bodies believed to date from the time of the Black Death and wood thought to be evidence of a 3,500-year-old Bronze Age transport route through London.Crossrail currently operates over 40 worksites and archaeological investigations are carried out at each site ahead of main construction works to build the central stations.The project will connect 37 stations from Heathrow Airport and Maidenhead in the west, through central London and out to Abbey Wood and Shenfield in the east and is due to be completed in 2018.</body>

      <title>Body clock 'reset button' found</title>
      <description>The prospect of drugs to rapidly reset the body clock to avoid jet lag and the pains of shift work has moved a step close after research in Japan.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24387491</url>
      <date>1380823371</date>
      <body>Drugs that rapidly tweak the body clock in order to avoid jet lag and the pains of shift work have moved a step closer after research in Japan.The team at Kyoto University has found the clock's 'reset button' inside the brain.Their study, published in the journal Science, showed the button could be used to switch the clock to a new time zone in a single day.Experts said the team was "close to the money" in the hunt for a jet lag cure.There are clocks throughout the body and a "master clock" in the brain, keeping the body in sync with the world around it to make people sleepy at night.Anyone who has ever done shift work or a long-haul flight has experienced the disrupted sleep and hunger patterns of a body clock which is out of tune with the rising and setting of the sun.The clock uses light to help keep track of time, but it is naturally stubborn and adjusts slowly.The rough rule is that for every time zone crossed it takes a full day for the body to catch up. Fly from London to Beijing and it would take a week for the body clock to fully adapt.The team in Japan have come up with a way to get the master clock to be a bit more flexible.It is a group of 10,000 brain cells - about the same size as a grain of rice - which constantly talk to each other to keep a strict control over the time.The scientists found that interfering with the vasopressin receptors, essentially a brain cell's ears that allow it to keep in touch with its neighbours, let the clock shift rapidly.Genetically modified mice which had no vasopressin receptors were able to adjust to the clocks being put back eight hours within a single day, while normal mice took six days.When the clocks were put forward eight hours then it took normal mice eight days to adapt, but those without vasopressin receptors adjusted in two.Similar results were then achieved in normal mice using a drug.The study's authors concluded: "Studies have shown that chronic jet lag and rotating shift work can increase an individual's risk of developing hypertension, obesity, and other metabolic disorders."Our results identify vasopressin signalling as a possible therapeutic target for the management of circadian rhythm [body clock] misalignment."Dr Michael Hastings, a Medical Research Council body clock researcher, told the BBC's Science in Action programme: "It's a remarkable study, it really is very exciting for our field."There's been many false dawns when it comes to a cure for jet lag, but I think this time they're close to the money."However, he cautioned that vasopressin receptors were also heavily involved in kidney function so any drug developed would need to be designed carefully to target the body clock without disrupting the kidneys.Dr Hastings added that with an increasingly 24-7 society a drug which can adjust the body clock could, in theory, improve the health of shift workers."The issue here in terms of public health is rotational shift work, the epidemiological evidence that we have now shows that if a worker has spent a working life doing rotational shift work they're at higher risk of contracting certain forms of cancer, cardiovascular disease or metabolic syndrome like diabetes."</body>

      <body>Mars may have had giant explosive volcanoes in its ancient past that spewed billions upon billions of tonnes of rock and ash into the sky.Vast areas of collapsed ground in a region of the planet called Arabia Terra are their likely remains, believe Joe Michalski and Jacob Bleacher.The two scientists report their findings in this week's Nature journal.They say such supervolcanoes would have had a profound impact on the early evolution of Mars.Their gases would have influenced the make-up of the atmosphere and perturbed the climate. And the ashfall would have covered the landscape across great swathes of the planet. It is quite likely some of the deposits the rovers are now encountering on Mars have their origin in colossal blasts."Scientists know the planet must have been more active in its deep past, in its first billion years. But we've always struggled to find evidence for these early volcanoes. The supervolcanoes we report in Nature may solve this puzzle," said Dr Michalski, who is affiliated to the Natural History Museum in London, and the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona.Supervolcano is an informal term to describe an immense eruptive event that expels in excess of a 1,000 cu km of rock and ash.Earth has experienced this type of cataclysm numerous times, although not for many thousands of years. The US Yellowstone National Park, for example, sits on top of a past supervolcano.But these behemoths are not so straightforward to identify.Unlike, familiar volcanoes - such as Etna or St Helens on Earth, or indeed Olympus Mons on Mars - supervolcanoes do not build mountains out of layers of lava. Rather, their great scale means that, when they erupt, the whole landscape lets go with multiple vents and fissures. And after the eruption, the ground will fall back into the void left by all the ejected material, producing a large bowl or caldera.Michalski and Bleacher, from Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center, have identified a number of potential supervolcanoes in an area of Mars's northern hemisphere known as Arabia Terra. It is assumed to be one of the oldest terrains on the planet.The researchers say their calderas are unlikely to be old meteorite impacts sites because they are irregular in shape, and lack the raised rim and central peak often found at impact craters. Neither do they have an apron of ejected material, another classic impact trait."Our best example is Eden Patera," Dr Michalski told the BBC's Science In Action programme."Thousands of cubic kilometres of material would have been erupted, and that's a minimum. In terms of size, it would be very similar to Yellowstone - about 70km across. So, imagine driving for an hour; it would take you most of that time to get across this hole in the ground."The supervolcanoes' gases would certainly have influenced the composition of the early atmosphere and the evolution of the climate thereafter. But they may also have had an impact on Mars' potential for habitability, by pulling up substantial quantities of water and the essential elements needed for life from deep inside the planet.These are ideas that can be tested by Nasa's Curiosity rover, which is heading for a large mountain in the middle of Gale Crater on Mars' equator.No-one knows how this mountain formed, but some fraction of its layers may well be ashfall, possibly from the Arabia Terra supervolcanoes; and if not these particular volcanoes then perhaps other giants that have yet to be identified in satellite images."If future work shows that supervolcanoes were present more widely on ancient Mars, it would completely change estimates of how the atmosphere formed from volcanic gases, how sediments formed from volcanic ash and how habitable the surface might have been," emphasised Dr Michalski.Commenting on the research, Mars expert Dr Peter Grindrod, from Birkbeck, University of London, said: "Understanding ancient terrains on Earth is extremely difficult because of subsequent processes hiding or removing the evidence - attempting to understand the earliest periods of Mars' history is even more challenging, as in addition we are limited to data returned from spacecraft."However, this study is a fascinating example of just what can be achieved with data from recent missions. This study is important because, if correct, it not only tells us something about Mars' early geological history, but can also help explain the source of later sedimentary deposits, many of which are important in studies of habitability on Mars."And planetary geologist Dr Dave Rothery, from the Open University, proffered: "It is entirely plausible that the few, slightly anomalous, large craters that Michalski and Bleacher have highlighted are volcanic rather than impact craters. If so, then their size would suggest that they could well have erupted in the style of supervolcanoes on Earth."We know that such eruptions have had profound but short-lived effects on the Earth's climate."Were such an event to happen on Mars, it could either cool the globe (because of a global ash and aerosol cloud) or warm it (because of erupted greenhouse gases). The latter could lead to episodes of surface water flow, responsible for carving some of the medium-size valley systems on Mars."Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos</body>

      <title>Plastic ingredient spied on Titan</title>
      <description>The Cassini probe detects propene - a common constituent of common Earth plastics - on Saturn's moon Titan.</description>

      <date>1380622324</date>
      <body>The Cassini probe has detected propene, or propylene, on Saturn's moon Titan.On Earth, this molecule, which comprises three carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms, is a constituent of many plastics.It is the first definitive detection of the plastic ingredient on any moon or planet, other than our home world, says the US space agency (Nasa).The discovery, made by Cassini's infrared spectrometer, is reported in Astrophysical Journal Letters."This chemical is all around us in everyday life, strung together in long chains to form a plastic called polypropylene," said Conor Nixon, a Nasa planetary scientist from the agency's Goddard Space Flight Center. A classic example would be the plastic boxes used to store food in kitchens worldwide.Titan is dominated by hydrocarbons - principally methane, which after nitrogen is the most common component of the atmosphere.Sunlight drives reactions that break apart the methane, allowing the fragments to join up and form even bigger molecules.Other common species seen at the moon as a result are propane, which on Earth is used in portable cooking equipment, and ethane, which is the raw material for another ubiquitous plastic - polyethylene.But the likes of methane, propene, propane and ethane are dwarfed by some truly colossal hydrocarbons that have been detected in Titan's atmosphere.When the effects of ultraviolet light are combined with the bombardment from particles driven in Saturn's magnetic field, it becomes possible to cook up some very exotic chemistry.Cassini's plasma spectrometer has seen evidence for hydrocarbons with an atomic mass thousands of times heavier than a single hydrogen atom.</body>

      <title>Cygnus freighter reaches station</title>
      <description>The new Cygnus cargo ship arrives at the International Space Station carrying about 700kg of food and other supplies for the platform's astronauts.</description>

      <body>The new Cygnus freighter has arrived at the International Space Station (ISS) carrying about 700kg (1,500lb) of food and other supplies.Astronauts on the platform reached out with a robotic arm and grabbed the vessel at 11:00 GMT.Cygnus is on a demonstration mission to prove its technology.It is one of two commercial ventures seeded by Nasa to pick up America's ISS re-supply requirements following the retirement of the space shuttles.The new vehicle, developed by the Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC), made its approach using a mix of GPS, inertial navigation and lidar.It parked itself a little over 10m under the station, within reach of the Canadarm2.Operated by astronauts Italian Luca Parmitano and American Karen Nyberg, the robotic limb then grappled the freighter, pulling it into the ISS's Harmony module.Capture - the securing of bolts mating Cygnus to Harmony - occurred at 1244 GMT, when the ISS was moving over the Indian Ocean.Cygnus has arrived at the station a week later than planned after an initial attempt last Sunday encountered software problems.This left the freighter unable to establish the correct communications and navigation links with the space station.Cygnus was commanded to loiter more than 2,000km from the ISS while engineers developed, tested and uploaded a patch. The arrival mid-week of a new crew at the station then pushed the second berthing attempt back even further.Astronauts will wait a day before entering the freighter to start removing its stores.The current schedule calls for Cygnus to stay at the platform for about a month, after which it will be sent into a destructive dive into the atmosphere.Nasa is attempting to hand over routine human spaceflight operations in low-Earth orbit to commercial industry, in a way similar to how some large organisations contract out their IT or payroll.The carriage of freight is the first service to be bought in from external suppliers; the transport of astronauts to and from the station will be the second, later this decade.The US space agency hopes these arrangements will save it money that can then be invested in exploration missions far beyond Earth, to destinations such as asteroids and Mars.To this end, it offered Orbital a series of incentive payments to help it develop a cargo-delivery system, with the carrot of a bumper, eight-flight, $1.9bn (£1.2bn) operational contract once it was up and working.Nasa has also seeded California's SpaceX company in the development of its Dragon capsule. This vehicle has already completed two missions in a 12-flight, $1.6bn contract.Cygnus has significant European involvement. The pressurised vessel that holds the cargo is produced in Turin, Italy, by Thales Alenia Space (TAS).Its design is based on the logistics modules that TAS produced for the space shuttles when the orbiters ran cargo deliveries to the station.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos</body>

      <title>Distant planet's clouds are mapped</title>
      <description>Astronomers have created the first map of the clouds on a planet outside our Solar System.</description>

      <body>Astronomers have created the first map of the clouds on a planet outside our Solar System.The planet in question is Kepler-7b, a large gaseous world like Jupiter, roughly 1,000 light-years away.The researchers used data from Nasa's Spitzer and Kepler space telescopes to study the exoplanet, which orbits close to its parent star.Their results suggest the hot giant is marked by high clouds in the west and clear skies in the east.The findings have been accepted for publication in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters."By observing this planet with Spitzer and Kepler for more than three years, we were able to produce a very low-resolution 'map' of this giant, gaseous planet," said co-author Brice-Olivier Demory of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, US."We wouldn't expect to see oceans or continents on this type of world, but we detected a clear, reflective signature that we interpreted as clouds."Astronomers have previously been able to make temperature maps of planets orbiting other stars, but this is the first look at cloud structures on a distant world. Kepler-7b is something of an oddity - bigger than Jupiter, but lower in mass - with a density about the same as polystyrene.The Kepler telescope's visible-light observations of this distant world's moon-like phases led to a rough map of the planet that showed a bright spot on its western hemisphere. But these data were not enough on their own to decipher whether the bright spot was coming from clouds or heat.So the team used Spitzer to gather further clues about the planet's atmosphere. They determined that light from the planet's star was bouncing off cloud tops located on the west side of Kepler-7b."Kepler-7b reflects much more light than most giant planets we've found, which we attribute to clouds in the upper atmosphere," said Thomas Barclay from Nasa's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, US, who works on the Kepler telescope team."Unlike those on Earth, the cloud patterns on this planet do not seem to change much over time - it has a remarkably stable climate."Nasa says the findings are an early step towards using similar techniques to study the atmospheres of exoplanets that are more like Earth in composition and size.Paul Hertz, director of Nasa's astrophysics division in Washington DC commented: "We're at a point now in exoplanet science where we are moving beyond just detecting [them], and into the exciting science of understanding them."The Kepler mission has now ended because of problems with the spacecraft's reaction wheels - the spinning components that aid fine-pointing of the satellite. But astronomers are still studying the data it gathered; the mission has so far discovered more than 150 bona fide exoplanets and thousands of other candidate worlds.</body>

      <title>Turbines 'threaten' Dark Sky Park</title>
      <description>Astronomers and land charities warn that Britain's only Dark Sky Park is being threatened by applications for wind turbines.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-24325181</url>
      <date>1380501539</date>
      <body>Astronomers and land charities have warned that Britain's only Dark Sky Park is being threatened by applications for wind turbines.Galloway Forest Dark Sky Park secured its status in 2009.But the Astronomer Royal for Scotland, the John Muir Trust and the Scottish Wild Land Group have written to the Scottish government, asking it to rule out wind farms in the vicinity.There have been nine proposals for turbines near the park's observatory.These include plans from energy companies such as E.ON and RWE npower renewables, among others.Mark Gibson, chairman of the board of trustees of the Scottish Dark Sky Observatory, said that while some applications had been rejected, having one approved could open the door for further development.Ministry of Defence and Aviation Authority safety requirements mean that wind turbines must be illuminated by infra-red light and, in some areas used regularly for training or search and rescue, visible light illumination may also be needed.Turbines near the park could fall into the latter category, and the campaigners said it would affect both the ability of astronomers to use sensitive equipment, and the visibility of stars, galaxies, comets and northern lights.The group has called for the park to be given protection similar to that afforded to areas of wild land, and has called on the Scottish government to update planning policy to rule out the construction of wind farms around the park.The facility is the only Dark Sky Park in Britain - although both Exmoor and the Brecon Beacons national parks have been awarded Dark Sky Reserve status - and is home to the world's only publicly accessible, research-grade observatory within a Gold Tier Dark Sky Park.The observatory was officially opened by First Minister Alex Salmond last year.Prof John Brown, Astronomer Royal for Scotland, said: "Installing any large structures that require illumination (whether visible or infra-red) would be akin to putting a factory in Glen Coe or electricity pylons along the Cuillin Ridge."Our first minister was instrumental in helping to secure funding for the observatory and he opened it with much passion and aplomb in October last, praising Scotland for leading the world with this fine public and educational facility."But Mr Salmond is also an ardent advocate of wind farms and so faces a dilemma."I, for one, would call upon him now to prove his sincere interest in our wild lands and skies by ensuring wind farms and other dark sky contaminants are excluded from the entire Galloway Forest Dark Sky Park."This would lay down a benchmark for future decisions on all similar wild land sites where wind farms are wholly inappropriate."However, Jeremy Sainsbury of the renewable energy consultancy, Natural Power, said studies had shown that the type of beacons used did not contribute in any significant way to light pollution."This is low level background infra-red - visible to pilots but it does not penetrate the upper atmosphere," he said."It only stays within the clutter of the lower atmosphere so is very, very localised to wind turbines."He said wind farm and studies had confirmed this to be the case.A Scottish government spokesman said: "The Scottish government consulted on the draft Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) earlier this year."It included proposals to guide local authorities in the preparation of spatial frameworks for wind energy development."We received a large number of responses to the consultation, including many views on onshore wind, and will take these responses into account when we publish the finalised SPP next year."</body>

      <title>Mystery eruption traced to Indonesia</title>
      <description>Scientists think they have found the volcano responsible for a huge eruption in the 13th Century that perturbed the climate worldwide.</description>

      <date>1380571177</date>
      <body>Scientists think they have found the volcano responsible for a huge eruption that occurred in the 13th Century.The mystery event in 1257 was so large its chemical signature is recorded in the ice of both the Arctic and the Antarctic.European medieval texts talk of a sudden cooling of the climate, and of failed harvests.In the PNAS journal, an international team points the finger at the Samalas Volcano on Lombok Island, Indonesia.Little remains of the original mountain structure - just a huge crater lake.The team has tied sulphur and dust traces in the polar ice to a swathe of data gathered in the Lombok region itself, including radiocarbon dates, the type and spread of ejected rock and ash, tree-rings, and even local chronicles that recall the fall of the Lombok Kingdom sometime in the 13th Century."The evidence is very strong and compelling," Prof Clive Oppenheimer, from Cambridge University, UK, told the BBC's Science In Action programme.Co-worker Prof Franck Lavigne, from the Pantheon-Sorbonne University, France, added: "We conducted something similar to a criminal investigation."We didn't know the culprit at first, but we had the time of the murder and the fingerprints in the form of the geochemistry in the ice cores, and that allowed us to track down the volcano responsible."The 1257 eruption has been variously linked with volcanoes in Mexico, Ecuador and New Zealand.But these candidates fail on their dating or geochemistry, the researchers say. Only Samalas can "tick all the boxes".The team's studies on Lombok indicate that as much 40 cubic kilometres (10 cubic miles) of rock and ash could have been hurled from the volcano, and that the finest material in the eruption plume would likely have climbed 40km (25 miles) or more into the sky.It would have had to be this big in order for material to be carried across the entire globe in the quantities seen in the Greenland and Antarctic ice layers.The impact on the climate would have been significant.Medieval texts describe atrocious weather the following summer in 1258. It was cold, and the rain was unrelenting, leading to flooding.Archaeologists recently put a date of 1258 on the skeletons of thousands of people who were buried in mass graves in London."We cannot say for sure these two events are linked but the populations would definitely have been stressed," Prof Lavigne told BBC News.In comparison with recent catastrophic blasts, Samalas was at least as big as Krakatoa (1883) and Tambora (1815), the researchers believe.The ice cores do hold clues to yet another colossal event in about 1809, but, like Samalas before it, finding the source volcano has been difficult.Prof Oppenheimer said: "It's outstanding that we haven't come across evidence for it.

      <title>Baby born after ovaries 'reawakened'</title>
      <description>Doctors say they have made a breakthrough in helping women who had a very early menopause to have children, with one baby born and another expected.</description>

      <date>1380569780</date>
      <body>A baby has been born through a new technique to "reawaken" the ovaries of women who had a very early menopause.Doctors in the US and Japan developed the technique to remove the ovaries, activate them in the laboratory and re-implant fragments of ovarian tissue.The technique, reported in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, has resulted in one baby being born, with another expected.The findings were described as early, but a "potential game-changer".The 27 women involved in the study became infertile around the age of 30 due to "primary ovarian insufficiency". The condition affects one in 100 women who essentially run out of eggs too young, leading to an early menopause.Women have a fixed number of eggs at birth and those with the condition tend to use them up too quickly or are born with far fewer eggs in the first place.Eggs in the ovaries are not fully formed; rather, they stay as follicles and some mature each month.The teams at Stanford University, US, and St Marianna University School of Medicine, Japan, were trying to activate the last few remaining follicles, which may be present.They removed the ovaries from the women and used a combination of two techniques to wake up the sleeping follicles. First they cut the ovaries into fragments, which has been used in the past as a fertility treatment. Then a chemical to "take the brakes off" egg development was applied.The fragments were put back at the top of the fallopian tubes and the women were given hormone therapy.Following the treatment, residual follicles started to develop in eight women. Eggs were taken for normal IVF and so far one couple has had a baby and another woman is pregnant.Prof Aaron Hsueh, from Stanford, told the BBC: "It has to be improved to figure out the best way to do it, but we estimate it could help 25 to 30% of the women."We think it could help in two other forms of infertility. Cancer survivors after chemotherapy or radiotherapy; if there's any follicles left there's a chance this will help."And also women aged 40 to 45 with an irregular menstrual cycle."The implications for women with early menopause are still unclear as the technique will require further testing and refinement before it could be used in clinics.Prof Charles Kingsland, from Liverpool Women's Hospital and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: "It's really clever, but will it work for everyone? We don't know."It's potentially really, really, interesting, but we need a lot more investigation to confirm this is not another false dawn."I will see primary ovarian insufficiency on a regular basis in my clinic so if it's effective in the long term, it's something we'd be interested in."Prof Nick Macklon, from the University of Southampton, told the BBC: "Finding a new way to get new eggs by waking up sleeping follicles is very promising. It's potentially a game-changer."It's a very important and very exciting piece of science, but it is not ready for the clinic. It still needs good randomised control trial data."He added that performing the technique outside of a research study would be unfeasible, but a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of egg development could lead to new medications.</body>

      <title>Earlier origin for flowering plants</title>
      <description>Flowering plants may have originated more than 100 million years earlier than previously thought, scientists suggest.</description>

      <body>Flowering plants may have originated more than 100 million years earlier than previously thought, according to scientists in Switzerland and Germany.The previously oldest known flowering plant-like pollen dates from the Early Cretaceous period.But the team described six types of fossil pollen grains from older Middle Triassic core samples that closely resemble these earliest examples.The research is published in the journal Frontiers in Plant Science.Flowering plants - also known as angiosperms - are the most numerous and diverse group of seed-producing plants on land.All seed-producing plants make pollen, with each grain enclosing the developing male cell used in sexual reproduction."That's why plants developed a very tough and resistant wall of organic matter to protect them," explained Professor Peter Hochuli from the University of Zurich, Switzerland."In the fossil record we find only this protective wall of the pollen grains."Based on the increase in abundance and diversity of flowering plants during the Early Cretaceous - approximately 140 million years ago - it has been assumed that they originated in this period.In the older Triassic samples, Prof Hochuli and his team used confocal laser scanning microscopy to obtain high resolution, three-dimensional images and identified six distinct types of fossilised flowering plant-like pollen based on size, patterning and structure."With a few differences...the pollen from the Middle Triassic look exactly the same as the angiosperm pollen from the Early Cretaceous," explained Prof Hochuli.Taken with previous reports of pollen in Triassic sediment from the Barents Sea with similar features to these suggests that flowering plants originated over a 100 million years earlier in the Middle Triassic period - circa 243 million years ago."The number of species found in Switzerland and the from the Barents Sea suggest a rather high diversity and that the group might originate from the Early Triassic or the Late Palaeozoic era," he said.However, this does leave a period of 100 million years for which there are no records of flowering plant-like pollen."I think part of it is a gap in the observation, one finds what is already known. Without my experience from the Barents Sea, I think I would have missed the few tiny grains," Prof Hochuli told BBC Nature.As the described pollen grains were rare, making up less than 1% of the pollen count, they cannot tell us much about the period's climate.But according to Prof Hochuli: "The accompanying pollen assemblages tell us that during the Middle Triassic the climate was warm/hot and arid in Central Europe/Switzerland and still warm, but more humid in the Barents Sea area."In the future they could go on to describe these pollen types as new species. But Prof Hochuli is more interested in finding evidence from other places and from even older sediments, such as the Early Triassic, "that's our next step".</body>

      <body>Bangladesh has begun building the first of two new nuclear power plants north of the capital, Dhaka.The plants - each with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts - are being constructed with Russian help as Bangladesh looks to close a yawning power deficit.Inaugurating the project, PM Sheikh Hasina said that "utmost priority" would be given to nuclear safety".The $2bn project is funded by $500m of Russian credit and is expected to be fully completed by 2022.Prime Minister Hasina said the plant would be constructed so that natural disasters could not damage or destroy it."Regarding the design of the plant, we are following the guidelines of the International Atomic Energy Agency," she said.The plants will implement new safety features following the nuclear accident in Fukushima in Japan, officials say.Under the terms of the construction deal, Russia's state-run Rosatom nuclear energy corporation will build, operate and provide fuel for the plant in addition to processing its spent fuel in Russia.Correspondents say that the project is part of an export drive backed by Russian President Vladimir Putin that includes Rosatom building plants in Iran and Turkey.The reactors at Rooppur in Pabna district, 120km (75 miles) north of Dhaka, are expected to operate for 60 years with options to extend by another 20 years.Bangladesh currently relies on dilapidated gas-fired plants for its power supplies and experiences daily electricity shortfalls.Erratic electricity supplies have been blamed for hampering industrial production and economic growth.</body>

      <body>Attacks by hornets in northern China have killed 41 people since July, state-run media report.More than 1,600 people have also been injured by stings in Shaanxi province, according to China News Agency.It says 206 people are still being treated in hospital, with 37 patients remaining in a critical condition.Local officials have been quoted as saying that drier and warmer weather this year may have contributed to a rise in hornet numbers in the area.Environmental activists have also blamed rapid urbanisation for worsening the problem as more rural land is swallowed up for urban development, intruding into habitats where hornets hunt and build their nests.The cities of Angkang, Hanzhong and Shangluo have been worst affected by the spate of attacks over the past three months.The provincial government has dispatched pest control experts to help deal with the situation.China News Agency says local police and fire-fighters have been given equipment and protective clothes to help remove and destroy hornet nests.Hornet attacks are a recurring problem in Shaanxi province in particular, but the authorities have released no casualty figures for previous years.Zhao Fang, a city government official in Ankong, told the China Daily newspaper that hornet attacks had increased in recent years as the "local ecological environment improved".Winters have been getting milder and summers hotter and more humid in Shaanxi, which may have helped caused hornet numbers there to rise.The Chinese term for hornets is "hu feng" - those behind the deadly attacks this summer appear to be the Asian giant hornet, or Vespa mandarinia.They can grow up to 5cm long with a 6mm sting.The area is also home to the smaller Asian hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax.</body>

      <title>Award for UK food security pioneer</title>
      <description>British geographer John Anthony Allan is one of three scientists to be awarded a Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation Award.</description>

      <body>British geographer Prof John Anthony Allan has received an award from the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation for his work on water security.He introduced the idea of "virtual" water, whereby the amount of water used in food production can be traded when that food is imported or exported.The awards were presented a ceremony in Monaco on Monday evening.The two other winners were US environmental scientist Jane Lubchenco and Spanish geologist Jeronimo Lopez.Dr Lubchenco is the most recent chief of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Prof Lopez is president of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (Scar).The purpose of a virtual water market is to account for all of the water embodied in the production of food.As Prof Allan explained during his acceptance speech, "it takes 1,000 tonnes of water to raise a tonne of wheat, and it takes 16,000 to raise a tonne of beef".The ultimate aim of a global market for virtual water, he said, would be to "trade our way into food security" as water-intensive commodities are traded from places where they are economically viable to produce, to more water-scarce places where they are not.At the awards ceremony, Prince Albert said that Prof Allan had "opened up new perspectives in the management of water stocks and their trade, in particular in regions suffering from [water] shortage, such as the Middle East.Prof Allan, who is based at King's College London, said: "Accountants could save the world if we enable them to put accounting rules into and reporting rules into this food supply chain, which looks as if it's a market, but it has no accounting rules or reporting rules for water".This was the sixth annual Prince Albert II Foundation awards.The three awards represent each of the research areas the prince has named as priorities for his foundation: climate change, biodiversity and water.Dr Lubchenco, who received the climate change award for her work on ocean acidification, told BBC News that she hoped the award would help draw attention to the fact that climate change was "happening now and in our own back yards"."The recent IPCC (UN climate panel) report provides very compelling evidence that that is the case, but that evidence has not yet translated to sufficient action to reduce carbon emissions, and we need that if we are to transition to a better place."</body>

      <body>Fourteen Greenpeace activists, including at least four from the UK, have been charged with piracy by the Russian authorities.They were among a 30-strong crew on a Greenpeace ship that was protesting against oil drilling in the Arctic.The group was arrested last month after two of the protesters tried to board an oil platform owned by the Russian state-controlled firm Gazprom.Greenpeace has called the charges "irrational, absurd and an outrage".The 14 activists were taken from jail to the Murmansk office of the Investigative Committee, the Russian equivalent of the FBI, the BBC's Daniel Sandford reports from Moscow.There they were formally charged with "piracy of an organised group", an offence that carries a 15-year prison sentence.Those charged include Kieron Bryan, a freelance video producer from London; Anthony Perrett from Newport in Wales; Alexandra Harris, originally from Devon, and Philip Ball from Chipping Norton.Greenpeace said more activists are expected to be formally charged on Thursday.The group's international executive director, Kumi Naidoo, said the charges were "extreme and disproportionate"."A charge of piracy is being laid against men and women whose only crime is to be possessed of a conscience. This is an outrage and represents nothing less than an assault on the very principle of peaceful protest," Reuters news agency quoted Mr Naidoo as saying.Mr Naidoo said the way Russian officials had treated the protesters represented "the most serious threat to Greenpeace's peaceful environmental activism" since the bombing of the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior in New Zealand in 1985, when the group was campaigning against French nuclear testing in the Pacific.Russian President Vladimir Putin had previously said the activists were "not pirates", but may have broken international law.The Investigative Committee said earlier this week that peaceful aims would not justify what it has described as an "attack" that posed a threat to the rig and its personnel.Last month the Greenpeace ship approached the Prirazlomnaya platform, Russia's first offshore oil rig which is scheduled to start operating by the end of the year.Two activists tried to climb up onto the platform and tie themselves onto it, in an attempt to draw attention to the issue of the expansion of oil and gas exploration in the Arctic Ocean.They were detained after a short skirmish in inflatable dinghies in which armed Russian FSB officers in balaclavas fired warning shots into the water.Greenpeace has released cameraphone images it says show the moment Russian security forces boarded the Arctic Sunrise ship.The ship, with its crew comprising 18 nationalities, was then towed to Murmansk.Mr Bryan's parents, Andy and Ann, from Devon, said they were very worried."Our son is a very kind, caring individual and environmental issues have always been very close to his heart," they said.Andy Bryan had spoken of his shock at the actions the Russians had taken against what he said was a peaceful organisation.</body>

      <body>Hidden cameras have captured the moment London Zoo's first tiger cub for 17 years was born.Five-year-old Sumatran tiger Melati gave birth to the cub on 22 September after a six-minute labour.The pregnancy, which lasted about 15 weeks, was kept secret by zookeepers who are "over the moon" about the cub.It was born six months after the opening of the "tiger territory", designed to encourage the endangered sub-species of tiger to breed.BBC correspondent Emma North said the cub was the product of a "whirlwind romance".Senior zookeeper Paul Kybett explained: "They came from opposite ends of the globe. Melati joined us from Perth at the end of September last year."Jae Jae came from Ohio. When they first saw each other they made the lovely sneezy purr kind of noise that they make."When we introduced them for the first time he trotted up to her and gave her a big head rub so we knew we were going to be getting something quite special."He added: "When it came to her due date, we were all watching our monitors with bated breath."The actual birth happened very quickly and Melati's maternal instincts kicked in immediately."We couldn't have asked for a smoother birth."It's still very early days, so we're leaving Melati to take care of her adorable baby, and our cameras allow us to watch them both from a distance."So far she's proving to be a doting mum."Malcolm Fitzpatrick, curator of mammals at the zoo, said the birth was very important for the global zoo tiger population.He said: "This tiger's one of the most important births in Europe this year."Zookeepers do not yet know the sex of the cub, which is in the exhibit's cubbing den with its mother and will remain away from the public for several weeks.The cub is the grandchild of the zoo's last tiger cub, Hari, the father of Melati.</body>

      <body>A rescue operation to save up to 500 ducks caught up in an oil spill on a lake is continuing in Denbighshire, says the RSPCA.Nearly 200 have been rounded up so far following the incident in Glyndyfrdwy, between Corwen and Llangollen.Most of the birds are heavily coated in engine oil and are being taken to the RSPCA's wildlife centre in Taunton, Somerset, for treatment.The rescue started on Monday after last week's oil spill.Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said the spill was confined to the lake and there was no impact on the wider environment.The agency was called out to investigate the incident on Thursday and Friday and advised the landowner how to clean up the oil.The ducks were originally reared for shooting but had been signed over to the RSPCA, said its officials.It said they would be rehabilitated and survivors released back into the wild.RSPCA Inspector Keith Hogben said: "Oil can be incredibly damaging to birds - affecting their plumage and so their ability to stay warm and dry. It can also cause a lot of internal injuries if ingested."The RSPCA said the birds were being washed in Taunton and kept on pools so staff could check that their feathers were waterproof and there were no long-term effects from the oil.Peter Venn, RSPCA centre manager, said: "So far they all seem to be doing well which is good news."He said the oil was coming off easily with washing up liquid and the ducks seemed relatively strong."Fingers crossed we can get as many of them as possible fighting fit and ready for release," he added.People with information about the oil spill can contact the RSPCA in confidence on 0300 123 8018.</body>

      <title>Mammals threatened by fragmentation</title>
      <description>Small mammals affected by rainforest fragmentation are likely to be wiped out more quickly than previously thought, scientists warn.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24229723</url>
      <date>1380224144</date>
      <body>Species affected by rainforest fragmentation are likely to be wiped out more quickly than previously thought, scientists have warned.A study found that some small mammal species on forest islands, created by a hydroelectric reservoir, in Thailand became extinct in just five years.It also showed that populations in the fragmented habitats were also at risk from another threat - invasive species.The findings have been published in the journal Science.Results showed that almost all small mammals disappeared from patches of fragmented forest smaller than 10 hectares (25 acres) within just five years, and larger plots - measuring up to 56ha - recorded the loss of small animals within 25 years.Co-author Luke Gibson from the National University of Singapore said the team was very surprised by the findings, describing it "like an ecological Armageddon"."None of us expected such a dramatic change from 20 years ago," he told the BBC's Science in Action programme."Our study focused on small mammals but what we did not report was a similar near-complete extinction of medium to large-sized mammals, such as elephants, tigers and tapirs, which are now completely absent from these islands in the reservoir."All of these animals were all in the forest landscape before the creation of the reservoir."'Natural laboratory'The researchers carried out their studies at the Chiew Lan (or Larn) Reservoir in southern Thailand. About 160 sq km of the Khao Sok National Park was flooded in the mid-1980s to create the reservoir.The rising water also created in excess of 100 islands of tropical forest, which the team called a "natural laboratory".The researchers carried out a survey of small mammals found on 16 of the islands, which ranged in size from 0.3ha to 56.3ha, five to seven years after the reservoir was created. They then repeated the survey 25-26 years after the islands were formed.Co-author Prof William Laurance, one of the world's leading ecologists on habitat fragmentation, said there were probably two factors that drove the rapid demise of small mammals on the isolated habitats."Native mammals suffered the harmful effects of population isolation, and they also had to deal with a devastating invader - the Malayan field rat," he said.The team found the population of the invading rat species became so abundant in just a few years that it displaced the native small mammals.The field rat is known to invade disturbed habitats, such as fragmented forests.Habitat fragmentation is widely recognised as one of the main global threats to biodiversity. Although it can occur naturally as a result of natural disasters, the main threat today comes via human activities, such as urbanisation and pressure for agricultural land.Mr Gibson said he expected the trend of fragmentation in tropical landscapes to become increasingly common in the coming decades."One example [of a] highly fragmented forest region is in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil where more than 80% of fragments are smaller than 50ha in area," he observed."The bottom line is that we must conserve large, intact habitats for nature. That is the only way we can ensure biodiversity will survive."</body>

      <title>Himalayas still uphill for climate report</title>
      <description>Data on Himalayan glaciers remains poor</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24396330</url>
      <date>1380882233</date>
      <body>Although the latest global update on climate change says the vast majority of glaciers worldwide have continued to shrink, scientists have admitted that the Himalayas remain an area where they still have very limited information.Glaciologists involved in the cryosphere chapter of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) first phase report, launched last week, said there was no good sample of Himalayan glaciers that could help them forecast their future behaviour."The Himalayas are one of the areas we really are data-poor," said Prof David Vaughan from Cambridge University, UK, and one of the two lead coordinating authors of the ice chapter in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)."We really need good samples of lots of glaciers and their measurements; we would like to have a larger number of benchmark glaciers," he told BBC News.The Himalayas received scant coverage in past IPCC reports.Until its Third Assessment Report in late 2001, the supreme authority on climate science called the Himalayan region a "white spot" because of the lack of information.Its Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 courted huge controversy when it mistakenly said that most of the Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035.After the IPCC put its hand up on this error, there was an expectation that AR5 would contain something more, particularly from the ground.But scientists involved in the latest IPCC report said there had been very little ground-truthing of the satellite imagery obtained for the Himalayas."Ground measurements are still very few, and, in addition, these few are usually limited to very small and not very representative glaciers," said Prof Georg Kaser, a University of Innsbruck, Austria, glaciologist and a lead author on AR5's cryosphere chapter."Field work on these glaciers is extremely difficult and also dangerous on an unacceptable scale. There is no way to overcome this, and this fact is also one of the reasons why we knew so little about these glaciers - giving thus also good reasons for [exaggerated] guesses."The Himalayas cover about one million square km, and there are more than 15,000 glaciers in the region according to several studies.The first-phase instalment of AR5 has significant detail on the Arctic, Greenland and the Antarctic.On the Greenland ice sheet, for instance, it said: "There is very high confidence that the Greenland ice sheet has lost ice during the last two decades."Combinations of satellite and airborne remote sensing together with field data indicate with high confidence that the ice loss has occurred in several sectors, and that large rates of mass loss have spread to wider regions than reported in AR4."But there is nothing like this on the Himalayas - the largest body of ice outside the northern and southern polar regions - and scientists say the main reason is the lack of studies on the ground.Even countries in the region have not been able to expand upon the few field studies they have initiated in limited pockets.India's Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology has been monitoring less than half-a-dozen glaciers within the Indian Himalayas."There are also strategic reasons behind the lack of ground work," says WIHG director Prof Anil Gupta, who was also a review editor on AR5's paleoclimate chapter."For instance, China and India share borders in the Himalayas and so because of the sensitivities on both the sides, it becomes difficult to reach these areas."WIHG has found that one of the reasons behind the recent catastrophic floods in Uttarakhand State of northern India was a breach of a glacial lake."The heavy precipitation led to the melting of the soft snow and even old ice in the Chorabari and companion glaciers that fed to the Chorabari Lake, which got breached due to excessive water intake from the glaciers," Prof Gupta explained."The mixing of glacial moraine, or debris, with glacial melt water mainly impacted the town of Shri Kedarnath and downstream towns of Gauriganga, Ramban, etc in the Kedarnath Valley."Prof Vaughan said that updates on the state of nearby glaciers were crucial for people living in such valleys in the Himalayas."If you live in a valley below one glacier, you really don't care what the global average [of glacial retreat] is; you just want to know what's happening to that particular glacier that's affecting your water security.According to the United Nations Environment Programme, there have been at least 35 events of glacial lake outbursts in Nepal, Pakistan, Bhutan and China during the last century.To minimise future risks, Prof Vaughan said scientists urgently needed more data on Himalayan glaciers."If they are going to start retreating then some of them will leave these kinds of glacial lakes that can then be quite dangerous if they burst out."We could actually predict which glaciers are likely to have that kind of behaviour in the future if only we can get on the ground and get some details."</body>

      <title>Hydrogen: The car fuel of the future?</title>
      <description>Could hydrogen power the cars of tomorrow?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24381812</url>
      <date>1380843391</date>
      <body>A small British firm is looking forward to a day in which we will take our cars to the garage and fill them with hydrogen.Acal Energy, based in Runcorn in Cheshire, says it has developed a chemistry that could make hydrogen fuel cells much cheaper and longer-lasting than current technologies.It wants to license its chemistry to the world's car-makers, opening the way for hydrogen vehicles to sell in large volumes in 10 or 20 years' time."We believe this is one of the breakthrough technologies," says Brendan Bilton, the company's chief commercial officer."We're pretty confident and excited... that this will start unlocking the barriers," he continues, "Allowing fuel cells to be in products for mass market applications."It is a bold dream but not a crazy one.The automotive industry is already far advanced with plans for a first generation of hydrogen cars.Hyundai, the South Korean manufacturer, has said it will soon start selling a hydrogen-powered version of its ix35 model.Meanwhile, the Japanese giant Toyota is expected to unveil its first nearly-production-ready foray into the territory at next month's Tokyo motor show.Other big names - including Daimler and Volkswagen - are thought to be on track to get hydrogen vehicles into showrooms by 2017.But few expect these first-generation hydrogen cars to sell in very large numbers.Acal Energy is pitching its technology as the enabler for a second generation of less costly, more durable vehicles which could - if all goes to plan - pose a serious challenge to the long domination of the internal combustion engine from about 2020 onwards.To begin with, consumers may take a bit of persuading.Hydrogen is widely seen as a dangerous fuel - an image underpinned by that grainy newsreel footage of the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg airship bursting into flames in the 1930s.But actually, experts do not seem daunted by this particular technical challenge.They point out that hydrogen is already used and managed on a routine basis in industrial processes.The main reason anyone bothers with it as a fuel for the future is because it is emission-free at the point of use.The hydrogen is combined with oxygen in a bit of kit called a fuel cell. This process generates electricity to power the engine in the vehicle.The waste products are heat and harmless water.Water is benign, unlike the global warming-inducing, carbon dioxide emissions that spew from even the most efficient petrol and diesel vehicles.The car industry has been developing fuel cells that use costly platinum as the catalyst for generating power from hydrogen for many years.Acal Energy claims the problem with this current technology is that it results in fuel cells that are either prohibitively expensive because of the high platinum content, or prone to degrade quickly.To get round these issues, the company has developed what Mr Bilton describes as a "liquid catalyst" composed of "a dissolved solution of metal salts".As well as being a lot cheaper than a platinum catalyst, the liquid doubles up as a coolant and a cleaning agent that extends the life of the fuel cell by taking away damaging by-products as it circulates through a "regenerator"."We have a solution that both increases durability and reduces cost," says Mr Bilton.The company has its offices in a science park that until a few years ago was the research and development centre for the British chemicals giant ICI, now shrunken in size and foreign-owned.Intriguingly, the ideas behind Acal Energy's patented "FlowCath" technology derive from techniques developed to clean clothes more efficiently.The founder of the company, Dr Andrew Creeth, now its chief technology officer, spent much of his career working as a scientist for the washing powder giant Unilever.Development of the product is taking place in an environment not unlike a gigantic school chemistry lab - full of bubbling chemicals, complicated equipment and clever looking people in white coats.The company has already raised £15m ($24m) to finance its work from a mixture of private investors and government sources.It is currently hoping to raise another £15m or so from a new funding round, with the outcome due to be announced soon.Eventually, Acal Energy aims to earn profits from the business model pioneered by the successful British micro-chip designer Arm Holdings.Arm's technology is embedded in most of the chips used in the world's smartphones and tablet computers.It receives a small royalty payment every time anyone upgrades their mobile device.Acal Energy dreams of equal success from licensing its technology to car manufacturers in decades to come.The big questions, though, are does the technology work and will it be the breakthrough that the company claims?Prof Nigel Brandon of Imperial College in London, a leading academic in hydrogen energy, is well qualified to comment."The core technology looks very exciting," he says."There are some components in their system they need to improve. I don't see any reason why they can't do that but they've still got to do it," Prof Brandon adds.It is guarded optimism that could equally be applied to the whole field of hydrogen fuel cell energy.The big advantages over battery-powered electric vehicles are hydrogen cars can be refuelled in a just a few minutes, they can run for 300 or 400 miles between refuelling and they have the environmental benefits of battery driven cars with the same range and convenience as those with petrol or diesel engines.But there are also significant snags.Among them is the need to create a hugely expensive new infrastructure of hydrogen filling stations to replace garages.Hydrogen enthusiasts often quote the example of the internet.Once the demand was proven, a global network of optical fibre cables to carry data traffic was rapidly built despite the cost.Major players in the car industry are betting - but not yet on a truly large scale - that hydrogen energy will follow the same pattern.</body>

      <title>Can a drug make you tell the truth?</title>
      <description>Can 'truth serum' really stop you telling lies?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24371140</url>
      <date>1380759219</date>
      <body>In movies and TV dramas, sodium thiopental is shown as a sinister truth serum used to get information out of captured people. Michael Mosley tried it out.One of the great challenges of living in our society is knowing when people are telling the truth or not. We lie all the time and are remarkably bad at detecting when other people are deliberately deceiving us.There are lots of urban myths about lie detecting, such as the claim that liars tend to look away, twitch their feet or touch their noses when lying (the so-called Pinocchio effect).In study after study, it has been shown that professionals such as policemen are no more reliable at detecting liars than the rest of us. So it's not surprising that for many years scientists have been working to develop "truth drugs" - drugs that will make you open up and tell all you know to an interrogator.One of the oldest and best known of these truth drugs is sodium thiopental. Although it was first developed in the 1930s, it is still used today in a range of settings, including, in some countries, by the police and the military.I was intrigued but also extremely sceptical about the claims that sodium thiopental, originally developed as an anaesthetic, could make people speak the truth if they chose not to. So I decided, as part of a series I've been making on the extraordinary history of pharmaceuticals, to try it out.Sodium thiopental is part of a group of drugs called barbiturates, drugs widely used in the 1950s and 60s to help people sleep better. They are no longer used for that purpose because they are extremely addictive and potentially lethal - Marilyn Monroe famously died from a barbiturate overdose.I decided to take a low dose of sodium thiopental under proper medical supervision, with anaesthetist Dr Austin Leach monitoring my vital signs throughout. Barbiturates work by slowing down the rate at which messages travel through the brain and spinal column. The more barbiturates there are, the harder it is for chemical messages to cross the gaps between one neuron and the next.Your whole thinking process slows down until you fall asleep. With thiopental, that happens very quickly indeed.Although it was originally developed as an anaesthetic, it was soon noticed that when patients were in that twilight zone halfway between consciousness and unconsciousness, they became more chatty and disinhibited. After the drug had worn off, the patients forgot what they had been talking about.It was decided that sodium thiopental might form the basis for a truth drug, an interrogation tool. But does it really work?I decided that I would have a go at trying to maintain the fiction that rather than being Michael Mosley, science journalist, I would be Michael Mosley, famous heart surgeon. We started with a very low dose. Immediately I felt extremely light-headed, intoxicated. But would this make me more inclined to speak the truth?There is an expression, "in vino veritas" (in wine there is truth). Alcohol is an anaesthetic and it depresses some of our higher centres, areas like the cerebral cortex where a lot of thought processing occurs. It reduces inhibitions but also slows thought processes, making it difficult to think clearly. The Roman historian Tacitus claimed that Germanic tribes held their important councils while drunk, as they thought it made effective lying harder.One theory about sodium thiopental is that it works in much the same way. Because lying is generally more difficult and complicated than telling the truth, if you suppress higher cortical functions you are more likely to speak the truth, simply because it's easier.I'm not sure if I lied effectively while under the influence of low dose thiopental, but I found that I could still lie."I am a cardiac - ha ha ha! - cardiac surgeon, a world famous cardiac surgeon," I shouted out when Dr Leach asked me what I did for a living."Would you like to tell me what the last operation you carried out was?" he enquired, politely."It was a heart bypass," I improvised. "They survived, yeah, I was awesome."Not convincing, but I had just about managed to stick to my fictional story. But what would happen when the dose was upped?At this point I felt some trepidation. There was a risk that I might say something that I really didn't want the world to know, but, confident in my ability to keep on lying, I told Dr Leach to go ahead.I was given another slightly larger dose of sodium thiopental and this time I actually felt more sober, more in control. So what happened next was a complete surprise.Again Dr Leech asked me my name and my profession. This time there was no hesitation."I'm a television producer. Well, executive producer, well, presenter, some, mix of the three of them.""So you don't have any history of performing cardiac surgery?" he asked gently."None whatsoever. None whatsoever"I'm still confused about what happened because one effect of the drug is to distort short-term memory. But I think the reason that I spoke the truth on this occasion is because the thought of lying never occurred to me.So does it work? Well my conclusion after trying it out and speaking to experts is that it will certainly make you more inclined to talk, but that when you are under the influence you are also in an extremely suggestible state. The reason you become more suggestible is probably because the drug is interfering with your higher centres, like your cortex, where a lot of decision making goes on. There is a serious risk you will say what your interrogator wants to hear rather than the truth.The truth is we don't have a reliable truth drug yet. Or if there is one out there, nobody's telling.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <body>Have you ever seen a foraging badger being followed by a bat? A nightjar clapping for attention? Or a cloud of bats feeding over a lake?These are just some of the fascinating insights filmmakers captured for BBC One series The Great British Year thanks to state of the art thermal imaging equipment.The military might have led the development of this technology but since cameras have become commercially available, researchers have started exploring the unique perspective on the natural world they can provide.Using infra-red radiation to visualise differences in temperature has delivered some surprising sights, here are 10 of the most remarkable revelations.Figuring out whether a giant panda is pregnant is one of the biggest challenges in animal medicine but staff at San Diego Zoo have successfully used thermal imaging to give them a new perspective."Thermal imaging is a useful tool for detecting activity in the giant panda uterus prior to the time a foetus can be visualised with ultrasound," says Dr Barbara Durrant who has led the technology's use at the zoo.By monitoring a panda's abdomen, the team were able to visualise heat changes as early indicators of the animals preparing for pregnancy.Dr Durrant explains that the advantage of thermal imaging is that the animals can be monitored without restraints or anaesthetic for a broad, non-invasive view before more specific methods are administered.Wildlife vets have also embraced thermal imaging as a tool to monitor animals without getting too close.High temperatures in specific body parts can indicate inflammation and such information has proven useful in the diagnosis of conditions from arthritis in elephants to rabies in raccoons.Interestingly, while higher nose temperatures sound alarm bells in racoons, a cooler face has been identified as an indicator of rabies in big brown bats.A team of French and Scottish scientists investigating emperor penguins in Antarctica discovered that the animals can actually have a colder surface temperature than the surrounding air.Via thermal images of the penguin colonies, researchers identified that the outer layer of feathers was 4 to 6 C colder than the air.Dr Dominic McCafferty from the University of Glasgow explained that this was due to "extreme radiative cooling" whereby the penguins lose heat to the clear sky where heat escapes rapidly from our atmosphere.The specialised structure of their feathers acts as an insulator however to keep these dangerously low temperatures away from the penguins' skin.Thermal technology was used to study Asian elephants living at Busch Gardens zoological park, US.African elephants are known to keep cool using their large ears where huge volumes of blood are circulated close to the skin's surface so heat can dissipate.Asian elephants however have much smaller ears and are known to cool off overnight so they start the day at a lower temperature.Rather than losing heat through their ears, thermal images showed that overnight heat loss is greatest from Asian elephants' trunks.The titan arum (Amorphophallus titanum) is the stinking giant of the plant world. It has the world's largest flowering head growing up to 3 metres tall and smells like a rotting corpse.Researchers discovered that the plant emits puffs of this odour to attract carrion eating insect pollinators from across its Sumatran jungle home.Thermal imaging revealed that the puffs are achieved by a build up of heat in the plant's stem resulting in regular releases of steam which carry the odour through the canopy to attract insects.Bees are known for their stings but Japanese honeybees have another form of defence against predatory giant Asian hornets.If they find an intruder in the nest, the bees swarm around it to form a bee ball - the inside of which reaches 46 C.Thermal cameras indicate that the temperature inside the bee ball is maintained by the bees at the optimal level so that they can defeat their nemesis without overheating themselves.Biologists are tracking the movements of whales without even dipping a toe in the water.Instead they survey the seas for "spouts" of warmer water released by the whales as they take a breath.The technology provides valuable data on grey whales as they pass California on their annual migrations, particularly their previously unseen night-time movements.Last year, researchers reported the first use of thermal imaging in an automated system that aims to protect whales from underwater noise by alerting when their spouts are sighted near mining or naval activities.A further bizarre discovery about Madagascar's mysterious lemur the aye-aye was made using thermal imaging cameras.The animals are known for their unusual extra-long finger which they use to tap trees when foraging for grubs.Scientists discovered that the aye-aye's super sensitive digit is kept cool when not in use but heats up by 6 C when in action.The finger is packed with nerve endings and experts suggest the ability to "switch" its temperature on and off saves the lemur essential energy.In the past, bats have proven difficult to study because most of their activity takes place after dark but thermal imaging has revealed a wealth of information about their behaviour.When researchers found high numbers of dead bats below wind turbines in both the US and Europe, they turned to thermal imaging for an explanation.US researchers recorded footage that identified bats actively investigating and foraging around the turbines.Scientists suggest insects are attracted to the structures with a knock on effect for the bats and birds that feed on them.Experts studied common seals off the coast of Scotland to understand more about their habits during the annual moult.Through thermal imaging they found that the seals' skin heats up to help them shed and regrow their hair.With increased blood flow to their skin to aid the moult, the seals choose to stay out of the water to avoid a chill and save energy.The Great British Year begins on Wednesday 2 October 2013 at 2100 on BBC One.Join BBC Nature on Facebook and Twitter @BBCNature.</body>

      <title>Letter from Africa: Elephants' end?</title>
      <description>The battle to save Africa's elephants from cyanide slaughter</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24352104</url>
      <date>1380761882</date>
      <body>In our series of letters from African journalists, filmmaker and columnist Farai Sevenzo considers the plight of the African elephant.Our world has become a more dangerous one for man and beast alike, with murder and murderers dominating recent news.I was struck these past few days by the callous murder of some 80 elephants in Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park.Poachers, it has been reported, poured cyanide into the drinking and salting wells frequented by some of Zimbabwe's 80,000 elephants with the sole aim of killing them and removing their ivory tusks for sale to buyers in Asia.The National Parks say a thorough search of the surrounding villages has already yielded 19 tusks together with cyanide poison and the authorities have made arrests.Across the continent, poachers have been killing elephants in greater and larger numbers - a family of 11 was slain in Kenya's Tsavo East National Park back in January, and, according to The International Fund for Animal Welfare, some 400 elephants were slaughtered in the first three months of 2012 in Cameroon's Bouba Ndjida National Park.While over in Gabon, a country whose green credentials are the envy of many, 11,000 forest elephants are said to have been killed by poachers from 2004 to 2013 because they were after the pink-tinged ivory of Gabon's forest elephants which is said to fetch high prizes and much in demand by jewellers and their customers in Asia.A pattern seems to be emerging here where Africa's close encounter with new economic giants like China has meant all resources are on the negotiating table; but ivory, long protected by international law, can only be obtained by the illegal poaching of Africa's most majestic beasts.It is difficult to know where the blame begins for this sudden elephant murder spree.African detective novelists might lead their protagonists from the urban hotels where an encounter with a Chinese businessman will tempt a poor worker to head to his village and inform his relatives that a little hunting will benefit the whole family.But in reality it will impoverish these African nations as a whole and the sight of elephant carcasses strewn across the savannah with their tusks removed confirm the suspicion that people are the worst guardians of this planet and should not be trusted to hand it over to future generations without unbelievable damage.And so it was heartening to hear Zimbabwe's Environment Minister Saviour Kasukuwere talking of changing the law so that poachers may be punished more severely for their outrageous disregard for the nation's heritage."We are responding with all our might because our wildlife, including the elephants they are killing, are part of the national resources… that we want to benefit the people of Zimbabwe," the minister said.This particular cyanide slaughter will have affected not just the elephants - birds, lions, leopards, giraffes and many other beasts that used the same watering holes will have perished and the body count will rise as hyenas, jackals and vultures feasting on the remains will ingest the cyanide poison which human hands laid in the water for a few miserable dollars.Ironically, since the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) banned ivory sales in 1989, loxondanta Africana - African elephants - have had a tough time holding on to their tusks and their lives.Before such a ban, China even gifted the United Nations, in 1974, a magnificent sculpture of exquisite craftsmanship depicting the Chengdu-Kunming Railway.But today we would recognise that that piece was made out of eight enormous elephant tusks, four elephant lives and dozens of repercussions for their grieved offspring.The minister of environment in Zimbabwe is at pains to call this a global problem and he is right.The green concerns of the modern day are alive to the possibility that there may be none of these awesome beasts left should poaching and the markets for ivory be allowed to go unchecked.Rather than turn Zimbabwe's Victoria Falls into a tacky Disney World theme park in an effort to attract tourism, the government would be better off pulling in the elephants' friends to their beautiful parks.For elephants are not short of sympathisers and half a million people in 15 cities across the globe will be marching to draw attention to the plight of the African elephant this October.The cyanide slaughter awoke the social media generation from teenagers to vegetarians to international footballers.The Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey - whose current form has delighted fans in north London and Africa's massive Arsenal following - tweeted a few days ago: "Just read about elephants being poisoned for their ivory in Zimbabwe. Absolutely shocking."The minister was aware of this famous tweet and told the BBC that Mr Ramsey would be welcome to see for himself the efforts under way to save his tusked friends.But if Minister Kasukuwere is to be the saviour of the elephants, he must punish the buyers too, and not flinch at the possibility of poisoning the poachers themselves - the life of a poacher who cannot think of the future beyond a few hundred dollars surely deserves poison too?For the lives of 80 elephants lost so brutally would have replenished the national coffers with their enormous weight in gold 80 fold through resurgent tourism.In the end, the government threw the law book at the poachers - 15 years in jail and a fine of $800,000 (£493,000).But someone bought that cyanide, someone funded the brutal operation and someone somewhere has more of those tusks missing from those elephant carcasses.There is more to be done.If you would like to comment on Farai Sevenzo's column, please do so below.</body>

      <title>What have we learned from Fukushima?</title>
      <description>A return to the site of Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24332346</url>
      <date>1380586014</date>
      <body>Since moving to Japan in 2012, I have reported on the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear disaster - speaking to experts, visiting the site and watching the clean-up. For the Editors, a programme which sets out to ask challenging questions, I consider what I have learned.Firstly, Fukushima was not an unavoidable natural disaster. For many outside Japan it is easy to draw the conclusion that Fukushima is unique, as very few places experience such huge earthquakes and tsunamis as Japan. So, the logic goes, there are no real lessons to be learned for other countries.Much the same was said after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine in 1986. Chernobyl was a bad design, a similar accident could not happen in Japan, which has Western-designed reactors. But it did.Prof Kiyoshi Kurokawa chaired the Japanese parliamentary inquiry in to the Fukushima disaster and his conclusions are devastating. It was, he told me: "Man-made, and made in Japan."Tatsujiro Suzuki, the deputy head of Japan's Atomic Energy Commission, has also been damning."There were studies which showed a one-in-1,000-year probability of the Fukushima coast being hit by a 10m tsunami," he said. "Unfortunately, those studies were dismissed. The nuclear industry didn't think it would happen, so they didn't prepare for it," he said.For me, this is the most revealing and shocking part of the Fukushima story. When the earthquake and tsunami hit on 11 March 2011 there was no plan for how to deal with such a large and complex disaster. How was this allowed to happen?Prof Kurokawa blames what he calls "regulatory capture", a process by which the nuclear power industry "captured" the bureaucracy that was supposed to regulate it.Put crudely, the "poachers" and the "gamekeepers" were far too close. Many senior bureaucrats from Japan's Nuclear Industry Safety Agency would take lucrative jobs in the nuclear industry after leaving government.The result was a nuclear industry imbued with a culture of arrogance, secrecy and complacency. Lessons learned after Chernobyl and Three Mile Island in the US were not implemented here. When disaster struck, Japan was woefully ill-prepared.An investigation by Japan's NHK broadcaster last year found that simple equipment, things like mobile generators and battery packs that could have helped prevent the meltdowns, were sitting at a depot just 25 miles (40km) from the Fukushima plant.After the tsunami knocked out the plant's electrical system there was still time to bring in the back-up equipment. Army helicopters were on standby. But there was no plan. Chaos ensued.A senior company official in charge of logistics was asked by the NHK team why he had not dispatched the equipment. "We had a very long list of things they needed. We had no way to prioritise which should go first," he said.And so the back-up equipment stayed in the depot, and the reactor cores melted down.Nor was there any evacuation plan. In the little town of Namie, five miles (8km) north of the plant, Hirohisa Suzuki was clearing up debris from the quake when the order came to leave."People were just told to head north west," he told me, "but that was exactly the same direction the radiation cloud was moving. Some people were evacuated to an area where the radiation was even higher than here."In retrospect, Mr Suzuki agrees the whole town was far too trusting. They were told the plant was safe, so no-one had ever asked whether there was a disaster plan.Two and a half years later, Mr Suzuki and the 26,000 people who lived in Namie are still nuclear refugees as radiation in parts of the town is still too high for residents to return. His family's 150-year-old miso and soy sauce business may never reopen.This is the other thing I have learned: cleaning up a nuclear disaster is extremely difficult. That may sound obvious, but just how complex only becomes apparent when you see how it is done.In the large town of Minamisoma, 19 miles (30km) north of the plant, they are cleaning virtually every house. I watch a team of men using high-power sprayers to clean the roof of a farmhouse, surrounded by plastic sheets to catch the waste water, which is then pumped into a nearby tanker.Another team of men is removing topsoil from the garden and putting it in huge plastic bags. The garden is then covered in a 2in (5cm) layer of fresh sand. Behind the house, shrubs and bamboo are being cut down and bagged. It will take a team of 20 men two days to finish this one house.But much of Fukushima prefecture is covered in densely-forested mountains. How do you clean forest? The answer is you cannot. So large areas may have to be declared out of bounds for decades.Finally, there is the waste. Already the clean-up is generating huge quantities. I was taken to a "temporary" dump deep in the mountains near the little town of Kawauchi. This single dump contains 50,000 cubic metres of waste. Kawauchi alone already has four dumps this size, and it is building a fifth.Just how temporary these dumps really are is another question Japan's government is unable to answer. The radiation in the dumps will gradually fall. In 30 years it will be half the level it is today. But the Caesium 137 and Strontium 90 will not be gone completely for 300 years.Finally let me end by quoting again Tatsujiro Suzuki, the deputy head of Japan's Atomic Energy Commission. I asked him why, if the nuclear industry knows there is a possibility of a disaster, does it continue to tell the public nuclear power is safe?"We need to be prepared for the worst case. We need to tell the public this is the worst case. But if we tell the worst case, the public says ,'Don't build the reactor near here.' So that was the dilemma. And if you want to continue building nuclear power plants you have to keep telling people the reactors should be safe. But now that myth is gone."BBC News: The Editors features the BBC's on-air specialists asking questions which reveal deeper truths about their areas of expertise.

      <title>Why does the human brain create false memories?</title>
      <description>Why does the brain create false memories?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24286258</url>
      <date>1380453642</date>
      <body>Human memory constantly adapts and moulds itself to fit the world. Now an art project hopes to highlight just how fallible our recollections are.All of us generate false memories and artist AR Hopwood has been "collecting" them.For the past year he has asked the public to submit anecdotes of fake recollections which he turns into artistic representations.They have ranged from the belief of eating a live mouse to a memory of being able to fly as a child.One man who wrote in wrongly believed his girlfriend had a sister who died while at the dentist. So strong was his conviction that he kept all his dentist visits secret.He wrote: "Over dinner one day she said she was going to the dentist the next week. It all went quiet at the table and my mum said it must be hard for her to visit the dentist after what had happened."This is hardly a rare case. Neuroscientists say that many of our daily memories are falsely reconstructed because our view of the world is constantly changing.Subtle cues can easily steer our memories in the wrong direction.A famous experiment carried out by Elizabeth Loftus in 1994 revealed that she was able to convince a quarter of her participants they were once lost in a shopping centre as a child.Another similar experiment in 2002 found that half of the participants were tricked into believing they had taken a hot air balloon ride as a child, simply by showing them doctored photographic "evidence".This work was carried out by Kimberley Wade at the University of Warwick, UK. For the current project she was asked by Mr Hopwood to take part in a real hot air balloon ride, video and images of which are now exhibited in his show. She says she was very excited to take part."I've been studying memory for more than a decade, and I still find it incredible that our imagination can trick us into thinking we've done something we've never really done and lead us to create such compelling, illusory memories," she says.The reason our memories are so malleable, Kimberley Wade explains, is because there is simply too much information to take in."Our perceptual systems aren't built to notice absolutely everything in our environment. We take in information through all our senses but there are gaps," she adds."So when we remember an event, what our memory ultimately does is fills in those gaps by thinking about what we know about the world."For the most part false memories are about everyday situations with no real consequences except the occasional disagreement with a friend or partner about trivial things like who lost the keys, again.But sometimes, false memories can have more serious ramifications. For example, if an eyewitness testimony in court contributes to a false conviction.Forensic technology has now led to many such convictions being overturned. The Innocence Project in the US campaigns to overturn eyewitness misidentification and lists all the people who have subsequently been acquitted.The project reports that there have been 311 post-conviction DNA exonerations in the US, which includes 18 people who were sentenced to death before DNA evidence was able to prove their innocence.Christopher French of Goldsmiths University in London says there is still a lack of awareness of how unreliable human memory is, especially in the legal system."Although this is common knowledge within psychology and widely accepted by anybody who has studied the literature, it's not widely known about in society more generally," he says."There are still people who believe memory works like a video camera as well as people who accept the Freudian notion of repression - that when something terrible happens the memory is shoved down into the subconscious."But the evidence of repressed memories, he adds, is "very thin on the ground".Prof French was also involved in the memory project. He hopes it will create more awareness of the malleability of human memory.So too does AR Hopwood. He says he was fascinated to learn that people could strongly believe in an entirely imagined event."What's interesting is that the submissions become mini-portraits of the person (albeit anonymously) yet the only thing you are finding out about this person is something that didn't actually happen. So there's a lovely paradox there which I'm very drawn to as an artist," he says.According to another researcher, the errors the human brain makes can sometimes serve a useful purpose.Sergio Della Sala, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Edinburgh, UK, says it can be thought of in the following way. Imagine you are in the jungle and you see some grass moving. Humans are likely to panic and run away, with the belief that there could be a tiger lurking.A computer, however, might deduce that 99% of the time, it is simply the wind. If we behaved like the computer, we would be eaten the one time a tiger was present."The brain is prepared to make 99 errors to save us from the tiger. That's because the brain is not a computer. It works with irrational assumptions. It's prone to errors and it needs shortcuts," says Prof Della Sala.False memories are the sign of a healthy brain, he adds. "They are a by-product of a memory system that works well. You can make inferences very fast."The False Memory Archive, supported by the Wellcome Trust, opened at The Exchange in Penzance on Saturday 28 September</body>

      <body>He was one of the most intrepid explorers of the 19th Century, leading five expeditions to the Arctic and surviving for 10 months after his ship was crushed between two ice floes. But 100 years after his death, Benjamin Leigh Smith is now largely forgotten.Somewhere in the Arctic Ocean, about halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole, there's an archipelago where Benjamin Leigh Smith's name marks its easternmost point.The likes of Captain Robert Falcon Scott, Sir Ernest Shackleton and Sir Henry Morton Stanley were superstar explorers, men who earned great renown and who had sought great renown.On the other hand, Leigh Smith was a modest man. The cape and adjacent glacier bearing his name (Kapp Leigh Smith and Leighbreen) are some of the few lasting tokens of his historic expeditions.Unlike so many of his contemporaries, even unlike today's explorers, he never sought fame for discovering new places. He didn't publish any detailed account of his explorations and he shunned public appearances, often sending someone else in his place.Born in 1828, the Briton was one of the first explorers to take ships to the high Arctic, where extensive sea ice - the thin frozen surface of the ocean, a few metres in thickness - made conditions very hostile."He saw and mapped areas and islands that were being observed for the first time," says Prof Julian Dowdeswell, director of the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge University."The high Arctic had much more sea ice a century ago than it does now, which made navigating through it difficult."He received the Patron Gold Medal - one of the two highest awards the Royal Geographical Society gives - for his achievements, so was hugely eminent," he says.As well as his advances in scientific exploration, Leigh Smith was at the centre of a survival feat that is arguably a match for the later exploits of the much more famous Shackleton.In 1881, Leigh Smith's purpose-built research vessel Eira was crushed between two ice floes and sank off another Arctic archipelago, Russian Franz Josef Land, north of Siberia.The crew survived for 10 months in makeshift huts, living off provisions salvaged from the ship and hunting walrus and polar bear. Leigh Smith then led a voyage of escape in boats with sails made from table cloths, before they were ultimately rescued.Every single man survived."This remarkable Arctic journey was executed with as much grace as that of Shackleton 40 years later," says Peter Capelotti, author of Shipwreck at Cape Flora: The Expeditions of Benjamin Leigh Smith, England's Forgotten Arctic Explorer."His leadership was so successful that the veteran Arctic whaling captain David Gray was moved to call him the very model of 'quiet, cool, thoroughbred English pluck'," he says.When it came to accepting medals for his achievements, however, Capelotti says Leigh Smith "always begged off"."Explorers as a rule are self-obsessed people who love to talk about themselves, but not this one. He once told his brother-in-law that if Queen Victoria herself asked to see his Arctic photographs, he would send his expedition photographer around to the palace with them."Capelotti puts part of Leigh Smith's low profile down to his family background. While he came from a wealthy family, his father, who was an MP, never married his mother, an unusual and potentially scandalous situation.And although he studied law at Jesus College, Cambridge, he couldn't get a degree immediately because it was difficult for anyone but practising members of the Church of England to gain degrees at the time."He was always at odds with upper society," says Capelotti. "He didn't fit in."Leigh Smith's great-great-great niece Charlotte Moore, who lives in Sussex, agrees."He was both establishment but also separate because he was illegitimate and from a dissenting family, so he never received a knighthood or got that kind of honour, which is probably a factor in why his story is not better known," she says.In fact, it was only after Leigh Smith's father died, and another man left him money, that he embarked on his first expedition to the Arctic, according to Moore."The first one was a sporting cruise really. All polar expeditions were from the Royal Navy, but Ben wanted to do a private non-naval expedition, so he hired a ship."Then he realised he was interested in the scientific side of Arctic exploration and brought back specimens for the British Museum and Kew. He even brought back live polar bears for London Zoo," she says.By his fourth expedition, Leigh Smith's enthusiasm for Arctic exploration was so advanced that he had his own vessel - Eira - specially built. He also named a lot of the places he mapped after friends and family."Mabel Island is named after a niece, Amabel. And the hut the 25 shipwrecked crew made out of driftwood, rocks and masts of ships on his last expedition was named Flora Cottage after his cousin Florence Nightingale," says Moore.With the famous nursing pioneer for a first cousin and a father active in the campaign against the slave trade, Leigh Smith came from an outspoken family.He was also overshadowed by his sister Barbara, a leading feminist and activist for women's rights, which may be part of the reason why he didn't like to talk about his accomplishments, according to Capelotti.But Moore says although Leigh Smith was a private man of few words when it came to his expeditions, with his log books a "bare record - simple, factual and unemotional", he was seen as a forceful character in the family home."In my family he's seen as both a hero and a villain. His Arctic stuff is heroic, but he tried to prevent the marriage of one of his nieces and laid down rules over that."They did marry after they were 21, but the same forceful character that led people to safety at sea could apparently be uncomfortable within the family and the feud with Ben went on for many years. At the same time, people were in awe of him."You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Demand for Royal Mail shares strong</title>
      <description>Demand for Royal Mail shares is high enough for the government to sell them near the top of its hoped-for price band.</description>

      <body>Demand for Royal Mail shares is high enough for the government to be able to sell them near the top of its hoped-for price band.The government had priced the shares at between 260-330p, but demand is outstripping supply and they will be sold for between 300-330p.BBC business editor Robert Peston says applications for the shares are a "few times" the value of those on offer.Labour says there is a danger the privatisation undervalues the business.Shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, expressed concern over the possible sale of Royal Mail sites after the privatisation."Royal Mail has a huge property portfolio in prime development sites in London and across Britain and there is nothing to stop the privatised company making a quick buck by flogging off these assets for development," he said.He also said that if sites are sold customers could face longer trips to collect their mail.The government is selling up to 62% of the business and will keep the rest.Under the terms of the share sale a 10% stake in the business has been reserved for Royal Mail employees.Members of the Communication Workers Union are currently voting on whether to strike over the government's privatisation plan.The ballot closes on 16 October. The earliest a strike could be held would be 23 October.Members of the public can apply for Royal Mail shares online until 8 October. Shares will begin trading in full on 15 October.The minimum application for the public wishing to purchase shares is £750, or £500 for eligible Royal Mail employees.The government said it might also sell an additional 15% of its stake in what is called an "over-allotment" option, if the demand for shares was very high.In the official prospectus for the share issuing, the Royal Mail warned that industrial action posed a potential risk for the share price.The statement said: "National industrial action, or the threat of national industrial action... could also have a material adverse effect on the success of the offer and, if it occurs after admission, could cause the price of ordinary shares to fall significantly."</body>

      <body>Card fraud hit its highest half-yearly level since 2009 as fraudsters tricked consumers into handing over details.Some £216m on credit and debit cards was lost to fraudsters in the first six months of the year, a 17% increase on the same period in 2012.Financial Fraud Action, which represents the financial services industry, said this was still well below the peak of £304m in 2008.Some con-artists have posed as police officers to gather vital information.Others have posed as bank fraud investigators to deceive people into handing over their cards or four-digit Pin.The figures show a 23% rise in the level of fraud on telephone, online and mail order shopping, as the trend of buying over the internet continues.Meanwhile, ID theft has risen by 24% and counterfeiting was up 15% when people's cards were cloned or skimmed.In June, Financial Fraud Action warned about "shoulder surfing", when thieves look over a person's shoulder while they key in their number at cash machines and then distract them as the card comes out of the ATM, enabling the thief to snatch it."The move towards these low-tech crimes of deception highlights the importance of consumers knowing how they can protect themselves," said Detective Chief Inspector Dave Carter, head of the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit."Whether victims are targeted on the phone or online, we know that these professional conmen are highly persuasive."He urged people to keep their Pin safe, shield it when using a cash machine, and check that a website is secure - featuring a padlock icon - when shopping online.He stressed that banks and police officers would never call or email to ask for a Pin number, or full login details.</body>

      <title>Cadbury loses colour purple fight</title>

      <body>Nestle has won a court battle with confectionery rival Cadbury, over Cadbury's attempt to trademark the purple colour of its Dairy Milk bars.Last year Cadbury won a legal case to stop other chocolate firms using the colour - known as Pantone 2865c.But Swiss firm Nestle, the world's biggest food company, has now won an appeal against that earlier ruling."Cadbury's formulation does not comply with the requirements for [trademark] registration," said the UK court.The Court of Appeal also said the trademark application lacked "the required clarity, precision, self-containment, durability and objectivity to qualify for registration".The legal battle has been running since 2008, when Nestle first opposed Cadbury's initial trademark application.Cadbury - bought by US food giant Kraft in 2010 - has been using a purple colour on its chocolate wrappers since the early 20th century."We are disappointed by this latest decision but it's important to point out that it does not affect our long held right to protect our distinctive colour purple from others seeking to pass off their products as Cadbury chocolate," said a Cadbury spokesman."Our colour purple has been linked with Cadbury for a century and the British public has grown up understanding its link with our chocolate."We are studying this particular ruling and will consider our next steps which includes the possibility of an appeal."Nestle said it welcomed the court decision, which it believed "was the right outcome from a legal perspective".</body>

      <title>Shutdown 'could affect US standing'</title>
      <description>The US government shutdown could affect its global standing if prolonged, Secretary of State John Kerry warns on a trip his president had to cancel.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24410213</url>
      <date>1380990631</date>
      <body>US Secretary of State John Kerry has warned that any prolonged shutdown of the government could affect the US internationally.But, speaking at the Apec forum in Indonesia, he said any impact was "momentary" and Washington's commitment to Asia was "undiminished".President Barack Obama cancelled his Asia visit because of the shutdown.The US government closed non-essential operations on Tuesday after Congress failed to agree a new budget.Hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been sent home, and the House of Representatives voted unanimously to pay them retroactively once the shutdown ends.In a weekly address President Obama said he was not prepared to "pay a ransom in exchange for reopening the government" and that the far right of the Republican party was preventing a Yes-or-No vote."Take that vote. Stop this farce. End this shutdown now," he said.Republicans, who control the House, have tied passage of the budget to Mr Obama's healthcare reform, which they are seeking to weaken or delay. They have accused Democrats of refusing to negotiate."Republicans are eager to end the shutdown and move ahead with the fiscal and economic reforms that our country so urgently needs," said Senator John Cornyn."But we're never going to make real progress without greater co-operation from our friends across the aisle."Democrats note that the healthcare law was passed in 2010, subsequently approved by the Supreme Court, and was a central issue in the 2012 election which Mr Obama won comfortably.As world leaders headed for the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Bali, Mr Kerry sought to allay concerns that Washington was reducing its global engagement."None of what is happening in Washington diminishes one iota our commitment to our partners in Asia," he said.He said the dispute with the Republicans in the US Congress was "an example of the robustness of our democracy".But at the same time, he urged Congress to think about how the US was perceived internationally when "we can't get our own act together".Mr Kerry said areas where the shutdown was affecting US foreign policy funding included:The Secretary of State warned of the consequences if the shutdown became longer term."This is a momentary impact. Obviously if it were prolonged or repeated people would begin, I think, to question the willingness of the United States to stay the course or its ability to, but that's not the case and that will not be the case."Mr Obama had been due to begin a four-nation Asian trip on Saturday, heading to Bali and Brunei before travelling on to Malaysia and the Philippines.He used the APEC summit two years ago to announce a rebalancing of American naval power towards the Pacific.The White House said Mr Obama's decision to cancel his Asia trip was made due to the "difficulty in moving forward with foreign travel in the face of a shutdown".US-EU trade negotiations have also been postponed.US officials had been due in Brussels next week to discuss a sweeping free trade pact designed to boost bilateral trade, but US trade representative Michael Froman informed the EU that financial and staffing constraints made it impossible to send a full negotiating team to Brussels.He stressed that Washington would continue working with the EU on drawing up the deal, but would have to wait until the shutdown was over.Reacting to the US announcement, European Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht said the delay was unfortunate."But let me underline that it in no way distracts us from our overall aim of achieving an ambitious trade and investment deal," he added.The US faces running out of money and defaulting on its debt if there is no agreement to raise government borrowing limits later this month.</body>

      <title>Sotheby's adopts 'poison pill'</title>

      <body>The auction house Sotheby's has put in place a defence to ward off takeovers, just days after an attack on its leadership by an activist investor.It gives existing shareholders rights to double their shareholding should any investor's stake go above 10%.The "poison pill" would make it much more expensive for Mr Loeb to build a stake of more than 10%.This week investor Daniel Loeb, who has a 9.3% stake, said Sotheby's was a painting desperately needing restoring."Poison pill" defences are so-called because they should make a target company unpalatable to predators.Through his hedge fund, Third Point, Mr Loeb targets what he considers to be underperforming companies.Previously his fund has taken significant stakes in Sony and Yahoo.In a letter sent earlier this week he said Sotheby's boss William Ruprecht enjoyed the perks of a "long-gone era of imperial CEOs", that included club memberships.He has accused Sotheby's management of wasting shareholders' money, singling out what he says was an "extravagant" lunch and dinner at a famous restaurant in New York, where they "feasted on organic delicacies and imbibed vintage wines at a cost to shareholders of multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars."We acknowledge that Sotheby's is a luxury brand, but there appears to be some confusion - this does not entitle senior management to live a life of luxury at the expense of shareholders."Third Point has been a strong buyer of Sotheby's shares, building up its stake from 5.7% in August to its current holding of more than 9%.</body>

      <title>Silk Road accused appears in court</title>

      <body>The alleged mastermind behind the online illegal drugs marketplace Silk Road is too dangerous to be bailed, US prosecutors have said.Ross Ulbricht, 29, was arrested this week and is charged with being the administrator of the site which has now been shut down.He is also accused of trying to arrange the killing of one of the site's users."We deny all charges and that is the end of the discussion at this point," Mr Ulbricht's lawyer said.Mr Ulbricht appeared in a San Francisco court on Friday wearing a green T-shirt under red jail clothes and had his ankles shackled.A request from his legal team for his bail hearing to be pushed back was granted - it will now take place on 9 October.Federal magistrate Joseph Spero asked Mr Ulbricht's lawyer Brandon LeBlanc whether seeing the criminal indictment that included a murder-for-hire charge had "changed his calculus" on whether he thought Mr Ulbricht would be granted bail.As part of its criminal complaint, the FBI alleged that Mr Ulbricht had sought to pay a Silk Road user to kill another user who had threatened to expose details of the site's users.Prosecutors opposed the delay, arguing that Mr Ulbricht represented a danger to the community, and that there was a high likelihood that he may attempt to flee.The Silk Road was a well-known destination on Tor, a so-called "dark web" service that anonymises users, making it much more difficult for authorities to track locations.The site sold a range of items, but was most famous for offering a host of illegal drugs, paid for using virtual currency Bitcoin.</body>

      <title>Child benefit deadline day looms</title>
      <description>A tax boss says nearly 200,000 parents must "get off their backsides" and register with the UK tax authority amid changes to child benefit.</description>

      <date>1380919790</date>
      <body>A tax boss has said nearly 200,000 parents must "get off their backsides" and register with the UK tax authority amid changes to child benefit.Saturday marks the first deadline for better-off families to sign up with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).They will need to register for self-assessment so the HMRC can claw some or all of the benefit back.Families where one parent has a taxable income of more than £50,000 are affected.They will lose some of the benefit, following the introduction of the new rules in January 2013, while child benefit has been withdrawn entirely if one parent earns more than £60,000.Eligible families receive £20.30 per week in child benefit for their first child and £13.40 a week for any further children.The new rules meant that this payment is reduced gradually for families where one parent is earning between £50,000 and £60,000.HMRC has written to people who it believes have a taxable income of more than £50,000 and so need to take some action. Taxable income is earnings from employment, as well as other income such as from savings and shares, but may not include some pension contributions.Lin Homer, HMRC chief executive, told BBC Radio 5 Live: "We think there is about 200,000 people who need to get off their backsides and do something."Some 350,000 people have opted out of receiving child benefit altogether, generally because they earn and will continue to earn a taxable income of more than £60,000 and therefore would not be entitled to the payment.HMRC says another 425,000 people were already in self-assessment, some 140,000 people have registered for self-assessment, and another 185,000 people have still to register.In theory, the deadline to register and avoid a possible penalty is 5 October. The penalty would be between 10% and 100% of the child benefit paid.However, HMRC says it is unlikely that anyone who registers and pays the tax by 31 January would be penalised."HMRC is committed to helping people pay the right amount of tax and urges parents who have been affected by the changes to child benefit to register for self-assessment," said Ms Homer."We know that lots of people leave it until the last minute."Anita Monteith, of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, said: "This adds considerable complication to the tax system for ordinary people, particularly for those brought into the self-assessment system for the first time."I would urge those affected to register for self-assessment as soon as they can."</body>

      <title>New UK car sales best in five years</title>
      <description>New car sales hit the highest level in more than five years in September helped by the latest registration plate, according to the Society of Manufacturers and Traders.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24396562</url>
      <date>1380888667</date>
      <body>New UK car sales in September hit their highest monthly total for five and a half years as the latest 63-plate attracted buyers.The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said 403,136 new cars were registered in the UK, a rise of 12.1% on the same month in 2012.September is typically strong as it is one of the two months each year when new registration plates are issued.Cars made in the UK account for one in seven of the domestic sales.Ford's Fiesta remains the UK's top selling car, with 20,600 sold in September. Vauxhall's Corsa was in second place with 14,500 vehicles sold.Car sales have now risen for 19 months in a row.The SMMT's chief executive, Mike Hawes, said: "The UK market is reflecting growing economic confidence.""Robust private demand has played a major role in this growth, with customers attracted by exciting, increasingly fuel-efficient new models which offer savings in the cost of ownership."The SMMT said the growth also reflected the fact buyers were returning to the market after a period of holding off.Buyers typically tend to replace new cars after three years, but because of economic conditions in recent years may have left that longer.It is three years since the ending of the vehicle scrappage scheme, which gave people incentives to trade in their old cars. Cars bought under that scheme would now be around three years old.Another factor boosting sales was the type of financing deals available, which can lump together payments with servicing and even vehicle excise duty.Richard Lowe, an analyst at Barclays, said: "Attractive finance packages are offering consumers more clarity on running costs, which even with a more promising economic outlook is an important factor for those on a budget."But he added that the UK car market was likely to remain strong. "As we head into the quieter months, I suspect we'll see sales hold firm, keeping the UK market zooming ahead of our European counterparts," he said.The UK car market is the second biggest in Europe after Germany .So far this year, UK buyers have bought 1.79 million new cars, compared with Germany's 2.22 million.The gap between the two has shrunk 6% since this time last year.The figures came as Daimler announced record monthly sales at its Mercedes-Benz arm.In September sales volumes grew by 15.9% to 142,994 cars.The company said sales were driven by China, where volumes rose 21% last month."Looking at the previous nine months, we can safely say that Mercedes-Benz will post another sales record for 2013," said Joachim Schmidt, head of sales at Mercedes-Benz Cars.</body>

      <title>Twitter plans to raise $1bn in IPO</title>

      <date>1380856665</date>
      <body>Social networking company Twitter has said it plans to raise $1bn (£619m) in its stock market debut in documents filed with US regulators.In the filing, revealed on Thursday, the seven-year-old company said that it now has 218 million monthly users and that 500 million tweets are sent a day.It made a loss of $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m.It will be the largest Silicon Valley stock offering since Facebook's listing in 2012.Analysts said that the offering was likely to get a good response."Social media is red hot," said Internet analyst Lou Kerner. "Twitter is front and centre benefiting from market enthusiasm for all things social, and remarkably strong metrics."The filing also revealed Twitter's finances for the first time.While the company has never made a profit, its revenue has grown from just $28m in 2010 to $317m by the end of 2012.Around 85% of Twitter's revenue last year came from ad sales; the rest was from licensing its data.The company takes in a significant portion of its ad revenue from mobile devices, an important metric often tracked by analysts.As of 2013, over 65% of the company's advertising revenue was generated from mobile devices. More than 75% of Twitter users accessed the site from their mobile phone during that same time period.Some analysts said that the decision by the firm to raise capital indicated that it was keen on improving the way people enjoy content on its platform and how advertisers connect with its users."Users should be happy about this," said Zachary Reiss-Davis, an analyst with Forrester."It looks like Twitter is looking at how to enrich the experience and it understands that to build a successful service, they have to create something people like and want to come back to and spend time on."Peter Esho from Sydney-based Invast Financial Services, added that Twitter's ease to use had seen it increase its user base, making it an attractive option for advertisers."I think what Twitter has working in its favour is that it's very easy to use: it doesn't eat up too much bandwidth for the average user in places where broadband penetration is low," he said.The filing also revealed that two of the company's co-founders, Evan Williams and Jack Dorsey, own significant stakes in Twitter, and could stand to take in significant sums from the company's stock market listing.Mr Williams owns 12% of shares in the company, while Mr Dorsey owns 4.9%.Benchmark Capital's Peter Fenton, an early investor in the company, is the second-biggest shareholder, with 6.7% of shares.Twitter indicated three weeks earlier that it had filed for a public stock market offering.However, under a new law passed by Congress in 2012, it did not have to reveal its financial documents because it had revenue of less than $1bn.But by releasing the documents publicly, it gave an indication that it hopes to complete its stock sale soon.The company plans to list under the stock symbol TWTR, but it did not reveal which stock exchange, the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange, it had chosen.However, Mr Esho said that the listing was likely to be on the Nasdaq."I was to speculate, I think it would have to be Nasdaq," he said. "That really is the exchange that has seen so many tech names come to the market."Goldman Sachs is the lead bank taking the company public, a coveted position that is often fought for amongst the nation's biggest banks.The other banks helping with the offering are Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, BofA Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank Securities and CODE Advisors.</body>

      <body>Switzerland's financial regulator is investigating possible manipulation of foreign exchange rates at several Swiss financial institutions.The regulator, FINMA, said several banks, including some from outside Switzerland, could be implicated.It is coordinating the investigation closely with authorities in other countries.It would give no further details on the investigations or the banks potentially involved.Swiss Banking, the group that represents the nation's banks, said it had no further information.The Swiss announcement follows reports in June that the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), was looking into whether traders manipulated benchmark foreign-exchange rates to increase profits.This followed an investigation by Bloomberg News that found that dealers shared information and used client orders to move the rates.The FCA, which does not announce its investigations, only its enforcement actions, said: "We are aware of the allegations and we have been speaking to relevant parties."London is by far the world's biggest market for foreign currency trading, with 41% of global turnover, according to the Bank for International Settlements.New York has a 19% share, followed by Singapore, Tokyo and Hong Kong.Switzerland accounts for 3.2% of foreign exchange trading.</body>

      <title>Fine over unemployment phone scam</title>
      <description>Unemployed people were tricked into calling expensive premium rate numbers while applying for non-existent jobs.</description>

      <date>1380894936</date>
      <body>The man behind a phone scam targeting the unemployed has been fined £75,000 by the regulator PhonepayPlus.Jobseekers were tricked into calling expensive premium rate numbers while applying for non-existent jobs.In the ruling, the regulator said the numbers were run by sole trader John Francis, from Epsom, and cost callers a least 50p a minute. Some spent more than £80 enquiring about jobs.The regulator said the trick gave false hope to vulnerable people.Jobseeker Karl Lever told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours he was charged £40 after he responded to an advert for bar staff in Brighton.In his hour-long phone call he was asked about his suitability for the role, previous experience and even his medical history."In hindsight it did feel like they were trying to keep me on the phone for as long as possible," he said.In a statement, PhonepayPlus said: "When it received these complaints PhonepayPlus launched an investigation and found that they were linked. It then identified John Francis, registered as a sole trader, as the person responsible for the service."As well as the £75,000 fine, he has been ordered to refund all those affected.Paul Whiteing, PhonepayPlus chief executive, told You and Yours: "He has seven days to pay and if he doesn't we will pursue him through the courts."They look like conventional mobile phone numbers, therefore many people don't realise what they are - so something should be done about that."It's unacceptable."None of the callers were told about the cost of the calls and most believed they were calling a mobile number. But the 070 numbers cost at least 50p a minute and those running the lines take a cut.PhonepayPlus acknowledge that it can be confusing and said they were working with Ofcom, which allocates phone numbers, and are reviewing the use of these numbers.The regulator also found the same numbers used for bogus jobs on adverts for cheap housing and in spam emails sent out offering work.One complainant told the regulator about spending an hour on the phone trying to arrange an interview. After complaining about the delay, the complainant was told: "You'll be even less happy when you get the bill."John Francis has seven days to pay the fine, otherwise further action will be taken. He did not respond to the regulator.</body>

      <body>UK floorings chain Carpetright says this year's profits will be "significantly below" previous hopes and says its chief executive is leaving the company after 17 months.The company said the UK market was "softer" and its business in the Netherlands had also suffered.The forecast marks a sharp turnaround in its performance.In June Carpetright reported a loss but said it had seen an "encouraging" rise in UK sales.On Friday it said that sales were down by 2.5% over the 10 weeks to the end of September.Darren Shapland took over as chief executive in May 2012.He was formerly chief financial officer and group development director at Sainsbury's,He oversaw changes including store refurbishments, new products and improvements to digital marketing.Lord Harris, the founder and currently chairman, will become full-time executive chairman and Graham Harris, who has been with the company for just four months as trading director, will join the board and become chief operating officer.In a statement Lord Harris said: "I am disappointed that Darren Shapland, who has made a significant contribution to Carpetright over the last 17 months, is leaving the business, but he does so with our thanks and we wish him well for the future. "Carpetright's fortunes are closely tied to conditions in the housing market, where activity has improved.But Lord Harris said: "The underlying market remains soft despite recent improvements to mortgage approvals and consumer confidence."Lord Harris, is a Conservative peer and a party donor, he also donates to education, and has founded a number of academy schools.He is also a non-executive director of the retailer Matalan and Arsenal football club.Carpetright has almost 500 stores across the UK.</body>

      <body>Anglo American Platinum (Amplats), the world's biggest platinum producer, said it had lost an average of 3,100 ounces of production a day since workers went on strike a week ago.Staff at two mines in South Africa are striking over plans to cut 3,300 jobs.Amplats said the cuts are necessary for its long-term competitiveness.It had originally planned to lose up to 14,000 jobs, but had to pare that back after pressure from the government and trade unions.Last year, the company, which is 80% owned by Anglo American, reported a 6.33bn-rand ($710m; £452m) operating loss, partly due to output at its Rustenburg mine, in north-west of Johannesburg, being disrupted by violent strikes.The firm would not confirm what proportion of total production is being lost at the two mines.But based on current platinum trading prices of $1,380 an ounce, the lost output is equivalent to $4.3m a day.The company said less than 20% of workers had turned up for work at its Rustenburg and North of the Pilanesburg mining operations.The company, which mines about 40% of the world's platinum, said it would continue to engage with the union "to try and return the business safely to optimal operation levels".When the strike started Chris Griffith, Amplats' chief executive, said the company was under tremendous economic pressure."Strikes and work stoppages will result in further losses that will hamper plans for future sustainability and further threaten the future of our 45,000 employees," he said.Last August, Rustenburg was the scene of violent wildcat strikes, during which police shot dead 34 miners.The bloodshed at the Marikana mine was the most deadly police action since South Africa became a democracy in 1994 and sparked national outrage.</body>

      <title>Energy price freeze 'will happen'</title>

      <body>Labour leader Ed Miliband has said he is "absolutely clear" that energy bills will be frozen if his party wins the next general election."We are absolutely confident because we've done all the figures, we've looked at all of the issues," he told the BBC's Breakfast programme.He repeated his accusation that energy companies have been over-charging businesses and consumers.Critics have warned that the plan could put future energy supplies at risk.But Mr Miliband claimed that energy companies were "unreliable witnesses" in the debate: "They're the people who would say that anyway.""There's a cost-of-living crisis in this country. Energy bills are a big part of it," he said."For too long the companies have been able to over-charge people. Somebody's got to stand up and be counted."That's why we'll freeze energy bills until the beginning of 2017 if we win the election. That will benefit 1.5 million businesses across our country, make a big difference to them."The policy was unveiled at the party's annual conference last week, and has faced strong criticism about its feasibility and the effect it would have on investment in energy infrastructure.But Mr Miliband continued: "Even if wholesale prices rise, this freeze is going to happen. I want to be absolutely clear about this."We're absolutely confident the companies can stomach this, can make this happen, and we're going to make this happen."He again dismissed predictions that energy companies might try to "collude" and hike prices before the election."If they try and do that, that is illegal," he said, "they can't do that."Labour has also released figures suggesting that British business could save £1.5bn if the price freeze came into force.The party said the estimate was based on research by the House of Commons Library.Meanwhile, two energy companies, EDF and First Utility, have unveiled plans to freeze current prices voluntarily.EDF Energy unveiled a new tariff that fixes bills until 2017, and First Utility said its current variable tariff would be frozen until March 2014.The former head of the UK's competition watchdog, John Fingleton, has suggested Labour's price-freeze policy was unlikely to work."In the long term [it] will harm consumers, and taking political responsibility for prices you cannot ultimately control is quite risky," he said earlier this month.The Conservatives have accused Labour of "bashing business" and insisted action was already being taken to ensure customers are on the cheapest tariff.Energy UK, the trade body representing the six largest energy firms, said the move could push up prices across the board and threaten the 600,000 people employed in the industry.</body>

      <body>Samsung Electronics, the world's biggest mobile phone and TV maker, has forecast record profits for the July-to-September quarter.It expects operating profit of 10.1 trillion won ($9.4bn; £5.8bn) for the quarter, a 25% jump from a year ago.The profit guidance beats many analyst forecasts.Samsung has enjoyed tremendous success with its Galaxy range of smartphones, but there had been concerns recently that its growth rate may be slowing."The company is doing a phenomenal job of continuing its growth rate," said Andrew Milroy, an analyst with consulting firm Frost and Sullivan."One would have expected that its growth rate may be hit by the emergence of other cheaper mobile phone makers."But it doesn't seemed to have happened, at least not yet," he added.The success of its Galaxy range of smartphones has seen Samsung become the leading player in the global mobile phone market.Analysts say the company's policy of catering to the low and high-end segments of the market has proved particularly effective.Samsung has launched top-end products such as the Galaxy S4 in a bid to take on the likes of Apple's iPhone.It has also introduced low-cost smartphones targeted at customers in emerging markets such as India and China.Many mobile phone operators in those markets do not subsidise phones, making low-cost devices a much more attractive option for many consumers."Samsung realises that growth opportunities in emerging markets are key to overall success of their business, and they have been smart enough to tap into it," said Mr Milroy."They have covered both ends of the spectrum really well."Last month, Samsung said that it is planning to launch handsets with curved displays.It exhibited prototype products with bendy and extendable screens in January this year, but there are doubts as to how this technology can be mass-produced cheaply and reliably.The firm also launched a smartwatch, the Galaxy Gear, last month - beating Microsoft, Apple and Google in the race to bring this type of technology to market.The smartwatch has a colour screen that can show alerts, be used for voice calls and run apps.</body>

      <title>IMF says US must solve debt crisis</title>
      <description>IMF managing director Christine Lagarde says failure to raise the debt ceiling would be far worse than the current shutdown.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24384759</url>
      <date>1380831404</date>
      <body>IMF managing director Christine Lagarde says failure to raise the US debt ceiling would be a far worse threat to the global economy than the current shutdown.The shutdown is due to a budget standoff between President Barack Obama and Congress.But a worse problem looms: the US will run out of money if there is no agreement to raise the borrowing limit.Ms Lagarde's comments were echoed by the US Treasury.It says a debt default could lead to a financial crisis as bad as 2008 or worse.Mr Obama emphasised that gloomy message in a separate speech on Thursday."As reckless as a government shutdown is, as many people as are being hurt by a government shutdown, an economic shutdown that results from default would be dramatically worse," he said.Mr Obama and congressional leaders have been in political deadlock for days, which has had the effect of freezing non-essential US government functions.The US government closed non-essential operations on Tuesday after Congress failed to strike a deal on a new budget.The shutdown has left more than 700,000 employees on unpaid leave and closed national parks, tourist sites, government websites, office buildings, and more.For US economic watchers, a widely tracked indicator - the monthly US jobs report - has been delayed due to the shutdown, it was announced on Thursday.However, while this budget crisis rages in Washington DC, another, more dangerous, one looms in the coming weeks.On 17 October, the US government will run out of cash to pay its bills - unless the debt ceiling is raised.In a speech looking ahead to a decade of challenges for the world economy, Ms Lagarde said that the US government needed to fix its finances for the long term.She said it was "mission critical" that the US agrees a new debt ceiling.But as she has often said before, there should not be too much change in the short term because that could undermine the economic recovery.On the prospects for the world economy in general terms Ms Lagarde was cautiously positive.She added that, although the global economic outlook remained subdued, there were signs that growth was looking up and financial stability returning.She said not only was the US picking up steam, but the Eurozone was too, with a growth forecast of 1% next year. Even Japan, she said, was beginning to improve - albeit all three areas needed to make policy changes.The IMF's latest economic forecasts will be released in a few days and will give a more detailed view of global economic health and prospects.To ensure that the shutdown impasse does not bleed into negotiations over the debt ceiling, Mr Obama used his speech to call on the speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, to bring a spending bill to a vote."Take a vote, stop this farce, and end this shutdown right now," implored Mr Obama, speaking from the floor of a construction business that has been hurt by the shutdown.Mr Obama added that in his view, unlike budget battles of the past, the shutdown was not about ideological differences relating to how much the federal government should be spending - noting deficits have been falling at their fastest pace in 60 years."This not about spending and this is not about fiscal responsibility, this whole thing is about one thing: the Republican obsession with dismantling the Affordable Care Act," he said, citing his signature domestic legislative achievement, which expands health care coverage for millions of Americans.Impact 'more than a generation'In its report, the US Treasury warned: "A default would be unprecedented and has the potential to be catastrophic.""Credit markets could freeze, the value of the dollar could plummet, US interest rates could skyrocket, the negative spillovers could reverberate around the world, and there might be a financial crisis and recession that could echo the events of 2008 or worse."The report said that if this were to happen, the impact could last for "more than a generation."Already, the cost of US borrowing in the short term has increased.Essentially, the US government is paying less to borrow for six months than it is paying to borrow for one month - an indication that investors are worried about the near-term prospects of a US debt default on 17 October, which would put the security of one-month Treasury bonds in doubt.Some bank analysts have termed the next month the "debt ceiling danger zone".Traditionally, investors view this as an "inverted yield curve" which is typically viewed as a harbinger of a recession.The current shutdown is costing the US economy an estimated $300m a day.According to Goldman Sachs, it could shave as much as 0.2% from GDP each week the government is closed.</body>

      <body>The photo sharing service Instagram announced it will start placing ads in US users photo streams in a posting on its website."We have big ideas for the future, and part of making them happen is building Instagram into a sustainable business," it said.Ads will appear in a few months and involve just a handful of firms.Instagram was bought by Facebook for $1bn (£619m), but has never made a profit.The company, which now has 150 million users, has been a favourite among consumers but has long left analysts wondering how it could turn enthusiasm among photographers into a business model.Early efforts by Instagram to generate revenue were met with user backlash, such as when the company changed the terms of service to seemingly indicate that it would own user images and could sell those images to advertisers.The failure of this move was acknowledged in the company's posting."As always, you own your own photos and videos. The introduction of advertising won't change this," it said.In an interview earlier this year with the BBC, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom said that Instagram must "fund its own future."Social media advertising is a booming business in the US.According to research firm eMarketer, advertisers will spend $9.5bn on social network ads worldwide this year.Facebook has boosted its efforts to gain a larger share of this ad spending.This year, the company's share of global mobile ad revenues will rise to 15.8% from 5.35% last year.</body>

      <body>Suspected members of a drug trafficking gang in Bolivia have thrown a bag containing more than $1m (£615,000) from a low-flying plane.The cash was supposed to be collected by other gang members on the ground in eastern Santa Cruz province, said Interior Minister Carlos Romero.But they missed the target and the bag was seized by Bolivian anti-drugs police, who later made several arrests.Bolivia is one of the world's top three cocaine producers.The authorities say the money - in US dollar bills of various denominations - was wrapped with a seal from a bank in neighbouring Paraguay.They believe it was going to be used either to build a cocaine production centre or to set up a fake commercial enterprise in Bolivia."Three Bolivian citizens have been detained in the operation," said Mr Romero.Guns and vehicles were also seized near the town of Rincon del Tigre.Bolivian police had been monitoring the gang, which is believed to be well organised and with links to several countries.Peru, Bolivia and Colombia are the world's biggest coca leaf and cocaine producers, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.Coca leaf production is legal in small amounts in Bolivia, where it is used to alleviate the effects of the high altitude. But the production of cocaine is banned.</body>

      <title>Payday lenders face tougher rules</title>
      <description>The UK's payday lenders have been warned that tougher regulation is on its way, to protect consumers.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24372134</url>
      <date>1380799198</date>
      <body>The UK's payday lenders have been warned that tougher regulation is on its way, to protect consumers.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed that all borrowers should have an "affordability" check before being given a loan.Among other new rules, the FCA wants to put risk warnings on adverts and marketing material.The payday industry gave the plans a guarded welcome, saying irresponsible lenders would struggle to comply.Martin Wheatley, the FCA's chief executive, said: "Today I'm putting payday lenders on notice: tougher regulation is coming and I expect them all to make changes so that consumers get a fair outcome. The clock is ticking."The proposals mean that anyone taking out a loan would need to prove that they could afford to repay it.In a separate government survey, one in five customers said they were not even asked about their finances when they applied for a payday loan.Among other proposals, the FCA suggested that:The FCA said it did not want to stop people using payday lenders, as they might turn to illegal loan sharks instead."We believe that payday lending has a place; many people make use of these loans and pay off their debt without a hitch, so we don't want to stop that happening," said Mr Wheatley.Business Minister Jo Swinson said the new rules would "call time on unscrupulous payday lenders". She said the industry had "failed to self-regulate effectively"."We warned the industry months ago that if it didn't get its house in order we would step in."The FCA said the risk warnings to be attached to adverts would be similar to those used by mortgage lenders, which remind borrowers that their home may be repossessed if they fall behind with payments.After the FCA takes over as the new regulator for consumer credit, in April 2014, it will also consider whether to put a cap, or limit, on the interest rates that lenders can charge.The government has decided against such a cap for the moment, but does not want to rule it out in the future.Previously the FCA has also said it will consider making rogue payday lenders reimburse customers where necessary.It has also said it might close firms down overnight if it needs to.The current regulator, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), wrote to 50 payday lenders earlier this year to see if they were suitable to continue in business.Nineteen lenders withdrew from the market as a result.A further six companies have stopped offering payday loans since, or have had their licences suspended by the OFT.But the FCA said that, despite the OFT campaign, the industry was still failing to respond.Despite 25 companies leaving the payday loans market, it is thought there are still more than 200 firms offering short-term loans within a matter of minutes.Many belong to the Consumer Finance Association (CFA).Under the CFA's code of conduct, roll-overs are permitted three times only.If borrowers default on their repayments for longer than 60 days, the amount they owe is frozen."As major lenders in the mainstream market, CFA members have always supported well-designed, well-implemented regulation in order to protect consumers and drive up standards," said Russell Hamblin-Boone, the CFA's chief executive.He added that the FCA's proposals were "an opportunity to set a bar over which irresponsible lenders will struggle to jump".The public consultation on the FCA's proposals will be open until 3 December.</body>

      <title>Benefit cap hits 8,400 households</title>

      <date>1380794361</date>
      <body>The government's cap on the total amount of benefits a non-working household can receive has affected 8,400 households between April and August, according to its own figures.The cap was introduced in April this year and means no household can receive more than £500 a week in benefits.The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) says 77% of those affected lost up to £100 a week.Just over half of these were households with between one and four children.The figures only cover those first affected by the cap and do not cover the whole country.The 10-week roll-out was only completed last week.The DWP said full figures for all those affected would not be ready for "probably another couple of months".It has previously said that 40,000 households will eventually be hit.The cap takes money from housing benefit, although the limit is based on adding up all welfare payments, including Jobseeker's Allowance and child benefit.For single adults, the cap is £350 a week.The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Iain Duncan Smith, said: "Benefits should be a safety net - but not something that gives claimants an income out of reach of many hard-working families."We have now successfully delivered a cap on benefits so that out-of-work households know they can no longer claim more than the average family earns and we have returned fairness to the benefits system."He said that those facing a cap were getting extra support at job centres, while those eligible for working tax credits were exempt from the cap altogether.On Wednesday, three families challenged the government in court in an attempt to find the benefits cap unlawful.Two High Court judges are being asked to rule that the payment limit breaches the human rights of unemployed parents.</body>

      <body>House prices are rising at their highest annual pace for more than three years, the Halifax says, as demand for properties continues to rise.Prices in the three months to September were 6.2% higher than a year earlier, the highest rate since June 2010.Prices rose by 0.3% in September compared with the month before, taking the average house price to £170,733.However, the average price of a home still remains 14% below the peak reached in August 2007.Last week, the Nationwide said that house prices rose at an annual pace of 5% in September.The Halifax said demand for property was rising thanks to low interest rates and improving consumer confidence.It added that government schemes - such as Funding for Lending and Help to Buy - also appeared to have increased demand for housing.The recovery in property prices over the past few months has led to concerns that the market could be in danger of overheating.However, others note that prices and activity still remain well below levels seen before the financial crisis, and that the rise in prices has been centred around London and the South East.The Halifax added there were signs that more properties were starting to come on to the market, which could begin to slow price increases."The recent strengthening in house prices is increasing the amount of equity that many homeowners have in their home, enabling more to put their property on the market for sale," said Martin Ellis, housing economist at the Halifax.The Halifax also noted that levels of housebuilding were starting to increase.On Wednesday, a survey of the UK's construction sector suggested that housebuilding activity grew last month at its fastest pace for almost a decade,</body>

      <body>Activity in the UK services sector grew at its fastest pace since 1997 in the third quarter of the year, a closely-watched survey has indicated.The Markit/CIPS PMI services index said the rise was due to growth in financial services, bolstered by the housing market, and the business sector.The survey raises hopes that the economy as a whole saw strong growth in the July-to-September period.The PMI survey showed services continued to grow strongly last month.The activity index for the sector recorded 60.3 in September, which was marginally down from August's near seven-year high of 60.5. Any score above 50 indicates growth.The strong reading for the UK services sector follows similarly strong surveys of the manufacturing and construction sectors published earlier this week.David Noble, chief executive officer at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, said: "After nearly six lost years of economic output, the UK economy looks to have really found its feet."He said the survey reflected the stability in the global economy, which the services sector was taking "full advantage of"."The industry sustained August's impressive business growth, dipping only fractionally from a near seven-year high, and new orders have now been growing for nine months consecutively," Mr Noble added.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said there were "encouraging signs" that growth would continue in the coming months."September saw one of the largest inflows of new business ever seen by the services survey," he said.</body>

      <title>Obama warns of US default danger</title>
      <description>President Obama warns that Wall Street should be concerned about the risk of a default, as talks on ending the government shutdown end without agreement.</description>

      <body>US President Barack Obama has warned that Wall Street should be concerned that a conservative faction of Republicans is willing to allow the country to default on its debt.The US government has partially closed after Congress failed to agree a budget and will run out of cash on 17 October unless its debt ceiling is raised.In a TV interview on Wednesday, Mr Obama said he was "exasperated".He later held talks with Congressional leaders that ended without agreement.The US government closed non-essential operations on Tuesday after Congress failed to strike a deal on a new budget.Republicans and Democrats are blaming each other for the impasse.The shutdown has left more than 700,000 employees on unpaid leave and closed national parks, tourist sites, government websites, office buildings, and more.However, as one budget crisis raged in Washington DC, another one - potentially more dangerous - loomed in the coming weeks.On 17 October, the US government will run out of cash to pay its bills unless the debt ceiling is raised.On both issues, the Republicans who control the House of Representatives have demanded concessions from Mr Obama and his fellow Democrats in return for funding the government's continued operation and for raising the debt ceiling.Chiefly, the Republicans demand the repeal, delay or defunding of a healthcare reform law - dubbed Obamacare - passed by the Democrats in 2010.Major portions of that law, which was subsequently validated by the US Supreme Court and was a major issue in the 2012 presidential election, took effect on Tuesday.On Wednesday, Mr Obama met the heads of some of Wall Street's biggest banks - including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America - to discuss the debt ceiling and other economic issues.The bankers are members of the Financial Services Forum, a lobby group which has, along with 250 other businesses, sent a letter to Congress urging it to raise the debt limit.Following the meeting, Mr Obama told CNBC "it's important for them to recognise that this is going to have a profound impact on our economy and their bottom lines".Mr Obama also said he was unwilling to negotiate "with the extremist wing of one party" as the 17 October deadline neared."The message I have for the [Congressional] leaders is, as soon as we get a clean piece of legislation that reopens the government... until we get that done, until we make sure that Congress allows [the Department of the Treasury] to pay for things that Congress itself already authorised, we are not going to engage in a series of negotiations," he said.As foreign markets anxiously monitored the US budget crisis, European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi warned that a protracted shutdown was "a risk not only for the US, but also the world economy".On Wednesday evening Mr Obama met Republican House Speaker John Boehner, as well as Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi at the White House.Mr Boehner later left the talks complaining that the Democrats would not negotiate."All we're asking for here is a discussion and fairness for the American people under Obamacare,'' he told reporters.Nancy Pelosi, however, accused the Republicans of "moving the goalposts" on the budget deal.Harry Reid said Democrats were "locked in tight on Obamacare'' and neither the president nor Democrats in Congress would accept changes to the law as the price for a deal on reopening the government.Analysts say Mr Boehner could end the current government showdown by allowing the House to vote on a "clean" budget bill that does not alter the health law, because that could pass with a coalition of Democrats and moderate Republicans.But doing so would risk his standing with the most conservative elements of his caucus.Earlier on Wednesday, senior US intelligence officials warned the shutdown of the government seriously damaged the ability of spy agencies to protect the US.Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told a Senate panel that an estimated 70% of intelligence workers had been placed on unpaid leave.Also on Wednesday, the White House announced Mr Obama would cut short a planned four-nation tour of Asia next week.He will attend regional summits in Indonesia and Brunei, but skip Malaysia and the Philippines due to the government shutdown.The US government ceased operations deemed non-essential at midnight on Tuesday, when the previous budget expired.National parks and Washington's Smithsonian museums are closed, pension and veterans' benefit cheques will be delayed, and visa and passport applications will go unprocessed.However, members of the military will be paid.</body>

      <body>Goldman Sachs' boss Lloyd Blankfein has warned that a failure to raise the nation's borrowing limit would be "extremely adverse".The warning came after a meeting between US President Barack Obama and 15 heads of large companies on Wednesday.Business leaders want Washington to understand "the long-term consequences of a shutdown," said Mr Blankfein.The US government has been shut down since Tuesday, 1 October.Other well-known business leaders who attended the meeting included Michael Corbat of Citigroup, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, and Brian Moynihan of Bank of America.By some estimates, the government shutdown is costing the US economy $300m (£185m) per day. If it continues, it could shave as much as 0.9% off third-quarter GDP growth.Mr Blankfein and his banking counterparts have expressed concern that there is a possibility the impasse over the US budget could bleed into efforts to raise the so-called debt ceiling, which allows the US government to borrow money to pay back its debts.The current debt ceiling of $16.7 trillion has already been breached in 2013, and the US Treasury has been engaging in a series of "extraordinary measures" since the summer to continue paying the nation's bills.US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has warned that those measures will be exhausted by 17 October, and then the nation would be forced to default on its debts.Mr Obama is scheduled to meet Congressional leaders later on Wednesday.</body>

      <title>Pioneer woman in Sri Lankan business</title>
      <description>Nimali Gunawardana is a 25-year-old Sri Lankan proving that young women can succeed in the country's male-dominated business world.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24206038</url>
      <date>1380496667</date>
      <body>Nimali Gunawardana, a petite, soft-spoken 25-year-old, is a lot tougher than she looks.From an impoverished upbringing as one of seven children in a poor family in rural Sri Lanka, she has turned herself through sheer drive and determination into one of the country's most up-and-coming young businesswomen.Able to recover from one serious business setback along the way, the self-made boss and her company - Nimali Chips and Fibre Mill - are now continuing to prosper in Sri Lanka's male-dominated business community.And Ms Gunawardana now has her sights set on exporting."I am happy that I have broken down the barriers a woman has to face in Sri Lankan society," she says."I've always had ambition, and I want to get to the top."Ms Gunawardana's company turns discarded coconut husks into three useful materials - coir, coir pith and husk chips.Coir is the fibrous outer cover of the coconut. It can be made into everything from string and rope to fishing nets, brushes and mattresses.Coir pith, one layer down, has a cork-like texture, and is used as a compost. Husk chips, made by crushing up the hard part of coconut shells, are also used as a growing material for plants, and even to filter water.Ms Gunawardana set up the company just over a year ago, and it now processes 15,000 coconuts a day.The business, based in the southern rural district of Ambalantota, employs 13 people - 11 women and two men.For Ms Gunawardana it is a far cry from her first job working as a sewing machine operator in a clothing factory.She says: "My parents are poor, and when I was at school I always wanted more money for the family."So I had to earn money, and I got a job at a garment factory. I didn't like it, I didn't like the supervisors always blaming you, I didn't like working for someone else, but I was able to save up money."I knew I wanted to save up the money to establish my own business."And so, using cash she had saved and money invested by some of her friends, she bought the lease for a coir-producing factory in 2010.Unfortunately she soon realised she did not have the experience to run a company. More pressingly, she was unaware that the business had a number of outstanding loans.As a result, she had to close down the company, losing 300,000 Sri Lankan rupees ($2,300; £1,400).Many people would have given up the dream of owning their own business, but Ms Gunawardana was determined to bounce back.After the company failure, no bank would lend to her, so she went to Youth Business Sri Lanka, a business support organisation that is part of Youth Business International, the global charity run by the Prince of Wales.Youth Business gave her a week's training in running a company, her own mentor, and a modest loan of 100,000 Sri Lankan rupees.And so her new company, Nimali Chips and Fibre Mill, was born in August last year, and is proving a success.Ms Gunawardana says she is on target for turnover this year of 5.1m Sri Lankan rupees ($39,000), and she is able to pay back the money lent by her friends.She says: "When I first started out in business, my parents did not agree with my choice, mainly because I am a girl. In rural parts of Sri Lanka, women like me are very rare."But now my parents are proud, and they give me their support, as does my husband."Ms Gunawardana has now been married for nine months, and her husband quit his job to work for her.Such has been the success of her new company that Youth Business International recently awarded her the global title of Start-up Entrepreneur of the Year 2013.Ms Gunawardana travelled to London this month to receive the award from the Prince of Wales.She now has her eyes on expanding the business.Ms Gunawardana currently sells her products to other companies who then export them. She wants to start doing the exporting herself. She also plans to start making products from what she produces, with her company starting to turn its coir into rope."I have faced a lot of challenges, but I have also had help from Youth Business. I hope that more young women in Sri Lanka think of starting their own companies."</body>

      <description>The BBC's Jennifer Pak speaks to Lew Fong Voon about his passion for shoe design and how he came to create his own brand in Malaysia.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24330094</url>
      <date>1380668759</date>
      <body>What makes an entrepreneur? The BBC's Jennifer Pak spoke to Lew Fong Voon (now known as Lewre Lew) about discovering his passion for shoe design while working in a manufacturers and how, despite initial obstacles, he came to create his own brand.In 1991, Lew Fong Voon thought he had a big break when his shoe trading company was chosen as one of nine businesses to represent Malaysia at an international exhibition.He gathered all of the best designs sourced from Malaysian factories because he said that the GDS fair in Germany was "like the Olympics" of the shoe industry.But nobody looked at his collection.People had no idea where Malaysia was or how to even pronounce the name of the country, said Mr Lew."It was very discouraging and at the same time humiliating," he said.Mr Lew did not get any business that year or the next two years after that but he continued to show up at the annual international shoe fair even when the other Malaysian companies had given up.He believed Malaysia had very good shoe craftsmen but didn't have updated designs. Bringing back ideas from the fair, he aimed to change this.In the fourth year, two customers finally ordered a thousand pairs of shoes from Mr Lew. The small shipment helped launch his overseas business.Over the next decade he produced shoes for international labels, but there was a slow push in the country to not only rely on natural resources and cheap manufacturing.Mr Lew was inspired to work on his own brand after he met fellow Malaysian designer Jimmy Choo.He produced his mid-priced collection under the name Lewre, a loose combination of his surname and the name of his first company, Roondy, in 1997 at the start of the Asian financial crisis.The venture was risky but it also meant that production costs became cheaper, he says.Mr Lew's company weathered the financial crisis. He attributes this to the fact that his childhood prepared him for the tough battle. He was one of ten children in his family. Food was a struggle. At eight years old, he started working at a plantation in northern Perak state, tapping rubber trees before dawn to help make ends meet for his family.Mr Lew 's commute to work required him to walk across terrain filled with snakes and the sounds of tigers growling nearby."It was full of challenges [and] I think full of fun," he said.Today, Mr Lew has exchanged the jungle for a spacious office on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur and has expanded his brand to more than 20 countries.He turned an initial capital investment of RM50,000 ($15,000; £10,000) in shoe manufacturing in the late 1980s into a company whose revenue is expected to reach $25m (£15.5m) in three years' time.At the Lewre headquarters in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia, middle-aged women sit in the back of the workshop sewing each bead onto a satin heel.Mint-green shoe moulds belonging to affluent women, including actress Michelle Yeoh and the Duchess of Cambridge, hang in the backroom.The recent global downturn has not slowed down Mr Lew's expansion plans. He is set to open a couture shop in London and the company has invested millions to develop several new sub-brands.Mr Lew describes his designs as "fashion forward". He wants to prove that Asian brands can produce quality products that appeal to a global audience.His future projects could make even more customers take notice - Mr Lew has considered designing high-heel shoes for men.It was normal for women to wear 4-5in (10-13cm) heels now, so as our women got taller so the men needed to "catch up," said Mr Lew.</body>

      <title>How companies can survive in a crisis zone</title>
      <description>What can businesses do to protect themselves against unexpected events such as the recent coup in Egypt?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23944571</url>
      <date>1380236748</date>
      <body>Running a business can be unpredictable at the best of times. But sometimes freak events occur that could not possibly be forecast.The political uncertainty and violence on the streets of Cairo that followed Islamist President Mohammed Morsi's removal from office in Egypt, for instance, forced businesses in the area to react rapidly.US car giant General Motors, which employs more than 14,000 Egyptians, temporarily closed its Cairo office and stopped production in its plant there, while home appliance maker Electrolux temporarily pulled out its expatriate staff and halted production in the region for about a week.For large, global firms such as these the impact is temporary and usually minimal - slower or no production in Egypt made up for by higher production elsewhere in their global network.But for smaller firms, the disruption can be harder to manage.Christine Sfeir, chief executive of restaurant group Treats Holding, operates a restaurant chain called Semsom in Lebanon. The country was devastated by a 15-year civil war, which ended in 1990, while the effects of its 2006 war with Israel and the problems in neighbouring Syria mean it remains politically unstable.Ms Sfeir says the turmoil has affected the way she runs her business.When she recently opened a new branch of the restaurant in Lebanon's capital, Beirut, she planned a red-carpet launch with local celebrities, high-flying business people and media all in attendance.But two days before the grand opening, trouble broke out an hour away from Beirut. Soldiers driving tanks continuously past the restaurant meant they had to shift the opening to a low-key, small scale dinner instead."I didn't feel it was right to do a big event while we have funerals going on," says Ms Sfeir, who was worried continuing with the original plan would have appeared insensitive and damaged the Semsom brand.On a day-to-day basis these types of troubles hurt revenue, typically meaning no customers for three days. "We know when there is tension, the restaurant is going to be empty," Ms Sfeir says.Emile Khoury, chairman of the Virgin Megastore franchise in Lebanon, says this ongoing instability is particularly difficult for retail businesses such as his that rely on shoppers passing by and tourists visiting.One of his 10 Lebanon stores is in Martyrs' Square in the centre of Beirut. After the war with Israel, protesters set up camp in the square for six months, meaning any shoppers had to pass through this to enter the store. Unsurprisingly barely anyone did.Mr Khoury estimates he has had to close down the shop for at least 100 days over the past eight years."It's very difficult. We're constantly in crisis mode. Our revenues go down tremendously so we have to adapt. We delay payments to suppliers, reduce operating expenses and negotiate rents down with our landlords."Right now we don't see an end to the open war in Syria. We've reduced to a skeleton staff, reduced working hours and reduced inventory."Is there anything small firms can do to protect themselves against this kind of disruption?Patrick Lord, managing director for global risk consultancy Control Risks in the Middle East, says planning is key."There are three key points - understand the context of your business on a national, regional and local level, do scenario planning and work out the likelihood of them happening and remain updated as things can change extremely quickly."Unless you have that planning formula right from the start, then you are leaving yourself open to last-minute panic," he says.For Ms Sfeir, the impact of such continual short-term disruption has made her look beyond the borders of her own country to secure stable revenues. Semsom now has restaurants in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Next she has set her sights on North America."I don't think Lebanon will be stable in my lifetime. To be able to sustain from a business perspective, you need some stability, you need to be able to make long-term plans. [At present] we only make plans for next month, cannot make plans for next year or for five years."Opening in other countries in the region and hopefully outside the region as well gives us this stability and this gives us a way to keep growing and to know that in 10 years we can still be here," she says.Similarly, Mr Khoury has stores in Saudi Arabia that provide stable revenues and where he admits business is much easier because "most of the parameters are within our control".But when asked why he doesn't shut down the Lebanon stores and instead focus his business elsewhere, he is aghast."We are Lebanese and we want to support our country. We have to believe better days will come. But we cannot predict when and if they will."Escape from the Boardroom is a five-part series, starting on 21 September, broadcast on BBC World News on Saturdays at 02:10 and 15:10, and Sundays at 09:10 and 21:10 (all times GMT).</body>

      <title>Fifa sets up 2022 World Cup taskforce</title>
      <description>Fifa agrees to set up a taskforce to look into alternative dates for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</description>

      <date>1380889925</date>
      <body>Fifa has agreed to set up a taskforce to look into alternative dates for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.But a final decision on when the tournament could be played will not take place before the 2014 World Cup.Fears that Qatar's hot summer temperatures could pose a heath risk to players and fans forced football's world governing body to act.The taskforce will consult with medical experts, broadcasters, sponsors and influential European leagues."We need to carry out very deep consultations and investigations and show some diplomacy and wisdom," said Fifa president Sepp Blatter.At the climax of a two-day meeting in Zurich, Blatter also confirmed Asian Football Confederation president Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim al-Khalifa would head the taskforce.The BBC understands that Fifa is considering inviting English Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore to be a member of the working group.He has been an outspoken opponent of plans to stage a World Cup in the northern hemisphere winter, claiming it would lead to disruption in many domestic leagues.The name of FA general secretary Alex Horne has also been mooted but sources say the final composition will be subject to agreement by Fifa's executive committee.The Premier League said in a statement: "We welcome the news that Fifa intends to conduct a thorough consultation process involving all of the appropriate stakeholders, including confederations, associations, leagues and clubs."Qatar was awarded the World Cup in December 2010, beating Australia, Japan, South Korea and the United States in a vote.The Gulf state planned to combat the fierce heat, with temperatures rising to in excess of 40C, by building air-conditioned stadiums.But concerns remained, prompting Blatter to announce in July this year that the World Cup should be switched to a cooler time of the year, away from Qatar's summer months of June and July.There have also been calls to strip the desert nation of the right to stage the World Cup completely and run the vote again.But Blatter insisted: "The Fifa World Cup 2022 will be played in Qatar. There you have it."Qatar has also come under scrutiny after a British newspaper published a report that accused the country of abusing the rights of migrant workers.Blatter said Fifa could not get involved in labour issues in any country but added that his organisation "cannot ignore" the allegations."I express all my sympathy and regret for anything that happens in any country where there are deaths on construction sites, especially when they are related to a World Cup," he told a news conference.Hassan Al Thawadi, head of Qatar's organising committee, has already said the Gulf state was addressing concerns."It's not a World Cup being built on the blood of innocents," he said. "That is unacceptable to anybody. We will be eradicating these issues."Prior to Friday's announcement, Harold Mayne-Nicholls, the head of the Fifa inspection team that assessed Qatar's 2022 World Cup bid, thought the tournament should be moved to January and February, when temperatures in the Gulf state average about 22C.However, that could lead to a potential clash with other big sporting events, notably the Winter Olympics and American football's Super Bowl, as well as domestic football leagues and the Champions League.New International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach has said he is confident there will be no clash with the Winter Olympics.American TV network Fox, World Cup rights-holder for North America, is understood to be concerned over the commercial implications of any move that would see the World Cup clash with the NFL season.</body>

      <title>Work halted on World Cup stadium</title>
      <description>A Brazilian judge orders construction work to be halted on one of the football stadiums for the 2014 World Cup over concerns for workers' safety.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-24362315</url>
      <date>1380716340</date>
      <body>Work on a Brazilian football stadium which is being refurbished for the 2014 World Cup has been suspended after a judge ruled there were safety concerns.The Arena da Baixada stadium in the city of Curitiba is due to stage four matches during the World Cup. Refurbishment work on the stadium is already lagging behind schedule.Judge Lorena Colnago said workers were at serious risk of accidents.She ordered a new inspection be carried out before work could resume."Countless infractions have been committed, in various stages of the building process," the judge from Brazil's labour tribunal said.She said workers were in danger of "being buried, run over and of collision, falling from heights and being hit by construction material, among other serious risks".The news comes a week after an investigation revealed that construction workers employed on another World Cup-related project faced what were termed "slave-like" conditions.Investigators said that more than 100 workers employed to expand Sao Paulo's international airport were living in unsuitable accommodation near the building site.In August, Sports Minister Aldo Rebelo said he was worried about delays at five stadiums still being built for next year's football World Cup.Arena de Baixada, which is owned by football club Atletico Paranaense, was among the five.Plans for its refurbishment have already been scaled back. After a visit from Fifa Secretary-General Jerome Valcke, the club said it would now not fit a retractable roof in order to speed the work up.Mr Valcke said all the stadiums would have to be ready in December and warned he would not tolerate any more delays as there was "no plan B".The World Cup will be played in 12 stadiums across the country.The opening match is due to take place at a brand-new venue being built in the outskirts of Sao Paulo on 12 June 2014.The final is scheduled for 13 July in the country's most famous football stadium, the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro.</body>

      <description>Irn Bru renews its association with Scottish football, becoming the SPFL's official soft drink for a six-figure sum.</description>

      <body>The Scottish Professional Football League has signed a new sponsorship deal with Irn Bru believed to be worth a "substantial six-figure sum".The figure for Scottish-based beverage company AG Barr for their beverage to become the league's official soft drink was confirmed by a SPFL source.But the league is continuing its search for a main sponsor.Irn Bru was the sponsor of the Scottish Football League for six seasons before this summer's league merger.SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster said: "It is a very positive sign to the market that such a strong brand has invested in the new SPFL set-up."AG Barr head of marketing Adrian Troy also welcomed the three-year agreement."We're proud that our deal with the SPFL lets us extend our support to the clubs across all four divisions," he said.Doncaster revealed the search for a title sponsor of the Scottish Professional Football League and League Cup continues but refused to put a time scale on any announcement."We remain in discussions with a number of different bodies around League title sponsorship and also League Cup sponsorship," said Doncaster. "Those conversations will continue."It is important that we take the time to partner with the right organisation. It is important not to put time scales on this. It is important to work with the various brands that we are talking to and in time, be able to announce the right brand and the right fit for the SPFL."We have all sorts of licensing deals and we have a very good broadcast deal."I think today's deal demonstrates the confidence that exists within the SPFL and within Scottish football in general."</body>

      <description>How does Twitter make money?</description>

      <date>1380892903</date>
      <body>On Thursday, Twitter announced that it wanted to raise $1bn (£619m) by listing on the US stock markets, making it the biggest initial public offering (IPO) from a technology company since Facebook went public in May 2012.The giant micro-blogging site, founded just seven years ago, has been valued at about $10bn.So, how does Twitter make its money and how can we explain its high valuation?Twitter may have more than 218 million monthly users, but the company does not make money - yet.In papers filed with US regulators, it was revealed for the first time that Twitter made a loss of $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m.But analysts say the company is showing strong signs of growth, with revenue rising from just $28m in 2010 to $317m by the end of 2012.One research firm, eMarketer, estimates that Twitter's revenues from advertising sales will increase by more than 100% by the end of this year.Almost all of Twitter's revenue - about 85% of it - comes from advertising on its site.There are three main ways for a company or an individual to advertise on Twitter: by promoting a tweet that will appear in people's timelines, promoting a whole account, or promoting a trend.Twitter tends to charge its advertisers according to the amount of interaction their content generates.A budget is usually set at the start of the campaign and then the advertiser pays per click or per retweet.It also has a "bidding" system in which advertisers compete with each other to have their content appear in a particular space."One of the advantages of Twitter for marketers over traditional display advertising is they have worked really hard to make sure that advertising on Twitter is not interruptive," says Lara O'Reilly, senior reporter at Marketing Week.Anything that disrupts the user experience might reduce engagement from users, which in turn can put off advertisers, Ms O'Reilly says."It's not a flashy banner that gets in the way of something. It looks very native," she explains.Also, the company takes in a significant portion of its advertising revenue from mobile devices - in contrast with Facebook, which had not fully developed its mobile strategy at the time of its listing.As of 2013, more than 65% of Twitter's advertising revenue was generated from mobile devices.More than 75% of Twitter users accessed the site from their mobile phone during that same time period."Because Twitter was born as a mobile platform they already have this part sorted," Ms O'Reilly adds. "In investors' eyes, they have a mobile strategy."Data licensing is Twitter's second major revenue stream.The micro-blogger sells something known as the "firehose", its public data, which often adds up to about 500 million tweets each day.Companies can dive deep into the data to analyse consumer trends and sell their insight on to other brands and companies.Because the tweets are public, consumers also have access to this data.But Nick Halstead, founder of DataSift, one of the only two companies with access to the firehose, says that with sophisticated analysis companies can learn detailed and specific information about their users that, because of the volume of data, an ordinary user or company would not be able to get.Firms could use the data to do simple things, he says, like monitoring sentiment towards their brand or product.But the data can also be used in a much more complex way."One of my favourites is around stock levels," Mr Halstead says."For example, in the US football teams will analyse the popularity of players by region to work out how much they should buy of a particular football top to stock them in shops."He adds: "In the UK we all rush out and buy barbecue equipment on particular weekends, and supermarkets want to stock up when that happens, but they need three or four days to do that."You can use Twitter for modelling when people are planning to hold those kind of events."While Twitter may have proved it has the potential to make money, analysts say there are still hurdles to profitability.The company is spending a lot of money investing in advertising technology and expanding its team, says Clark Fredericksen, vice president at eMarketer.And it plans to keep spending after going public."We can expect that they will continue to make those investments because they're looking long-term," he says.But Mr Fredericksen adds Twitter needs to show it can monetise its international users and work with small businesses."When Twitter goes to advertisers a big part of their pitch is using Twitter to work with other media," he says, adding that the site gets huge traction with users around events like the Oscars or episodes of popular television shows such as Breaking Bad."Whether that formula will translate in smaller TV markets needs to be seen."</body>

      <body>If you are already missing the sunshine then here is something to consider.The pound is having a revival on the currency markets, thanks to the strengthening British economy.It is a welcome change for British tourists who saw the pound slump after the 2008 financial crisis.But the economy has perked up and sterling has seen a spectacular rise against some currencies this year.And there are other trends in the currency market which are making a difference.Now obviously changes in the value of the pound are not the top priority when it comes to choosing a holiday destination, not least because some cheap countries are not particularly safe.And it is impossible to predict exactly what's going to happen on the markets.(You can check travel advice from the Foreign Office here.)But after years of suffering the effects of a weak pound, travellers may be tempted by countries that are once again looking like good value.Currency experts in the City of London have given their views on where that value can be found over the next 12 months.South Africa is one of a group of nations which, in economic circles, are called the Brics.Along with Brazil, Russia, India and China, it was favoured by investors for its fast-growing economy.But it has run into trouble recently.Prices for its main exports such as gold, platinum and diamonds have fallen and the mining industry has also been hit by labour trouble.As a result the South African rand has plunged 25% this year."There are question marks over the economy," says Jeremy Stretch, market strategist at CIBC."Even if sterling does badly I expect the rand to underperform."Another nation that has fallen out of favour with international investors is India.Economic growth has been weak and the government has struggled to push through reform that economists say would lift growth.This year the rupee has fallen 12% against the pound.Analysts say the situation is unlikely to change in the near future."India will always be vulnerable," says Jane Foley, senior forex strategist at Rabobank in London."India has disappointing growth and a lack of reform and other emerging markets will be seen as better bets."The Australian economy has become tied to the fortunes of China.Much of its iron ore and other commodities are exported there.But prices and volumes have fallen and so has the Australian dollar.It is down more than 10% against the pound this year, currently trading at around 1.73 Australian dollars to the pound."The Oz dollar has been overvalued since mid-2010," says Jeremy Stretch."It (the pound) will probably get to 1.85, maybe 1.90, but not as high as 2. That overvaluation is dissipating."Turkey's economy has been a success story in recent years.But protests against the government in June have unsettled investors. Confidence in Turkey is also vulnerable to unrest in Syria and to a lesser extent Egypt.The Turkish lira is down 12% against the pound so far this year. But since the worst of the financial crisis in 2008, the lira has fallen 50% against the pound."It's been a very, very big move," says Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon in London."But it's very hard to know with emerging markets because they are illiquid. If political tensions ease there would be a rapid move back."If I was going to to Turkey I would buy my lira now."Anyone considering a visit to Turkey should check on the latest advice from the Foreign Office.</body>

      <body>A small British firm is looking forward to a day in which we will take our cars to the garage and fill them with hydrogen.Acal Energy, based in Runcorn in Cheshire, says it has developed a chemistry that could make hydrogen fuel cells much cheaper and longer-lasting than current technologies.It wants to license its chemistry to the world's car-makers, opening the way for hydrogen vehicles to sell in large volumes in 10 or 20 years' time."We believe this is one of the breakthrough technologies," says Brendan Bilton, the company's chief commercial officer."We're pretty confident and excited... that this will start unlocking the barriers," he continues, "Allowing fuel cells to be in products for mass market applications."It is a bold dream but not a crazy one.The automotive industry is already far advanced with plans for a first generation of hydrogen cars.Hyundai, the South Korean manufacturer, has said it will soon start selling a hydrogen-powered version of its ix35 model.Meanwhile, the Japanese giant Toyota is expected to unveil its first nearly-production-ready foray into the territory at next month's Tokyo motor show.Other big names - including Daimler and Volkswagen - are thought to be on track to get hydrogen vehicles into showrooms by 2017.But few expect these first-generation hydrogen cars to sell in very large numbers.Acal Energy is pitching its technology as the enabler for a second generation of less costly, more durable vehicles which could - if all goes to plan - pose a serious challenge to the long domination of the internal combustion engine from about 2020 onwards.To begin with, consumers may take a bit of persuading.Hydrogen is widely seen as a dangerous fuel - an image underpinned by that grainy newsreel footage of the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg airship bursting into flames in the 1930s.But actually, experts do not seem daunted by this particular technical challenge.They point out that hydrogen is already used and managed on a routine basis in industrial processes.The main reason anyone bothers with it as a fuel for the future is because it is emission-free at the point of use.The hydrogen is combined with oxygen in a bit of kit called a fuel cell. This process generates electricity to power the engine in the vehicle.The waste products are heat and harmless water.Water is benign, unlike the global warming-inducing, carbon dioxide emissions that spew from even the most efficient petrol and diesel vehicles.The car industry has been developing fuel cells that use costly platinum as the catalyst for generating power from hydrogen for many years.Acal Energy claims the problem with this current technology is that it results in fuel cells that are either prohibitively expensive because of the high platinum content, or prone to degrade quickly.To get round these issues, the company has developed what Mr Bilton describes as a "liquid catalyst" composed of "a dissolved solution of metal salts".As well as being a lot cheaper than a platinum catalyst, the liquid doubles up as a coolant and a cleaning agent that extends the life of the fuel cell by taking away damaging by-products as it circulates through a "regenerator"."We have a solution that both increases durability and reduces cost," says Mr Bilton.The company has its offices in a science park that until a few years ago was the research and development centre for the British chemicals giant ICI, now shrunken in size and foreign-owned.Intriguingly, the ideas behind Acal Energy's patented "FlowCath" technology derive from techniques developed to clean clothes more efficiently.The founder of the company, Dr Andrew Creeth, now its chief technology officer, spent much of his career working as a scientist for the washing powder giant Unilever.Development of the product is taking place in an environment not unlike a gigantic school chemistry lab - full of bubbling chemicals, complicated equipment and clever looking people in white coats.The company has already raised £15m ($24m) to finance its work from a mixture of private investors and government sources.It is currently hoping to raise another £15m or so from a new funding round, with the outcome due to be announced soon.Eventually, Acal Energy aims to earn profits from the business model pioneered by the successful British micro-chip designer Arm Holdings.Arm's technology is embedded in most of the chips used in the world's smartphones and tablet computers.It receives a small royalty payment every time anyone upgrades their mobile device.Acal Energy dreams of equal success from licensing its technology to car manufacturers in decades to come.The big questions, though, are does the technology work and will it be the breakthrough that the company claims?Prof Nigel Brandon of Imperial College in London, a leading academic in hydrogen energy, is well qualified to comment."The core technology looks very exciting," he says."There are some components in their system they need to improve. I don't see any reason why they can't do that but they've still got to do it," Prof Brandon adds.It is guarded optimism that could equally be applied to the whole field of hydrogen fuel cell energy.The big advantages over battery-powered electric vehicles are hydrogen cars can be refuelled in a just a few minutes, they can run for 300 or 400 miles between refuelling and they have the environmental benefits of battery driven cars with the same range and convenience as those with petrol or diesel engines.But there are also significant snags.Among them is the need to create a hugely expensive new infrastructure of hydrogen filling stations to replace garages.Hydrogen enthusiasts often quote the example of the internet.Once the demand was proven, a global network of optical fibre cables to carry data traffic was rapidly built despite the cost.Major players in the car industry are betting - but not yet on a truly large scale - that hydrogen energy will follow the same pattern.</body>

      <title>Why image is crucial for charities</title>
      <description>Why image is crucial for a charity to secure donations</description>

      <body>When Mark Goldring joined Oxfam as chief executive in April this year, the charity's income had fallen. It fell by nearly £18m last year, with revenue from its two main sources, shops and fundraising, both down on the previous year.To better understand the business from both a staff and customer point of view, he decided to spend some time working as a shop volunteer and in the field in Africa.After volunteering on the shop floor in Oxfam's Bury branch in Greater Manchester, he found a lack of understanding from both volunteers and customers about what the charity actually did and how it spent its money.For instance, he calculated that one week's profit from the Bury shop would enable Oxfam to buy two cows in a village in Zambia to initially help two families to make a living, but subsequently would enable many other families to make a living as the calves were passed on.But no-one in the shop was aware of that."We need to show both the volunteer and the customer a bit more about the difference [their contributions] make day to day," he says.This kind of disconnect between what charities do and people's perception of what they do is common.In the 1950s, the charity St Dunstan's was a household name famed for its work with blind former military personnel. Yet in 2010 its research showed few people under the age of 75 were aware of the charity or what it did.It hired consultancy Spencer du Bois to help it rebrand. After a two-year process surveying the general public, staff, volunteers and supporters, it renamed itself Blind Veterans UK with a new logo based on the union flag. The rebranding process cost the charity £90,000 but it expects it to help raise an extra £7m over five years.And according to market research firm nfpSynergy, 22% of the British public said they would consider supporting the rebranded charity, compared with 16% before it was rebranded.While many people may believe that charities do not need to focus on branding as much as profitable organisations, Max du Bois, executive director at Spencer du Bois, disagrees."It's as important in the charity sector as it is in the commercial sector. It's a way of getting people engaged with what you do," he says.Joe Saxton, director of nfpSynergy, says: "When you give £50 to a charity, the only thing you have to judge whether your gift is well spent is the reputation and the image of the organisation."In the absence of the concrete and the tangible, the intangibles of image, personality and reputation have a much greater importance."However, Vicky Browning, director of CharityComms, an industry body that aims to improve how charities communicate, admits it can be hard for charities to justify spending on measures such as brand that do not show instant, tangible results.To help the cause, it recently produced a guide to branding best practice, which cites the case of Macmillan Cancer Support.Since its 2006 rebrand, it has seen both its brand recognition and market share increase rapidly. Awareness among its core audiences of people diagnosed with cancer and their families and friends rose from 41% and 38% respectively to 65% and 66% between 2006 and 2011. In the same period, fundraising income increased from £97m to £141m."We live in tough economic times. Supporters have tightened their belts and organisations are zeroing in on efficiency and value for money," says Ms Browning."More than ever, charities must demonstrate how their cause is unique, effective, relevant and worthy of support. A charity's brand is key to achieving this."Oxfam's Mr Goldring realises that how the charity communicates with the public is key."We can't just say, 'The world is poor, you're guilty'. So we've got to find new ways of telling those stories."We need to remind the public that they can actually convert their surplus clothes into cows for people in Zambia, into crops for people in Zimbabwe, into healthcare for people in Cambodia very easily. 'This is the difference you can be making, do it.'"The charity is now planning to launch a major campaign on 26 December to reinforce this message about what donations can achieve."It won't be, 'You'll be saving lives tomorrow,' but, 'You'll be strengthening lives forever,'" he says.Escape from the Boardroom is a five-part series, starting on 21 September, broadcast on BBC World News on Saturdays at 02:10 and 15:10, and Sundays at 09:10 and 21:10 (all times GMT).</body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: What is the debt ceiling?</title>
      <description>What is the US debt ceiling and why does it matter?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24365018</url>
      <date>1380796790</date>
      <body>The debt ceiling is a cap on the total amount the US government can borrow, set by US lawmakers.The current debt limit of $16.699 trillion was reached in May. Since then the US Treasury has been using what are called extraordinary measures to keep paying the bills.Why does the US government need to borrow so much?If you compare borrowing to the size of the US economy, it has been increasing since the 1980s.But the 2007 financial crisis created huge gaps between government income and expenditure.The economy was plunged into a deep recession and federal finances deteriorated dramatically as the government attempted to boost the economy and stabilise the financial sector.As a result the debt ceiling was raised twice in the second half of 2008 and twice in 2009.According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), US debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) is now 73%, twice as much as it was at the end of 2007.Why can't the president raise the limit?He doesn't have that power.The limits are set by lawmakers in Congress, which is made up of two houses, the Senate and the House of Representatives.They set in law how much the Treasury department can borrow.How often has the limit been raised?Since March 1962, Congress has enacted 77 separate measures that have altered the limit on federal debt.Until recently those changes have been achieved without a lot of fuss.Why has it become such a big issue?Since the Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives to the Republicans in 2010, budget fighting between the two parties has become commonplace.Republicans took their victory in the mid-term elections as a sign that Americans had rejected the president's Democratic agenda, and more specifically, that Americans were unhappy with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or "Obamacare" as Republicans label it.Although past budget fights have included larger questions about the size and scope of the US government, this one is very specifically about Mr Obama's healthcare law, substantial parts of which took effect on 1 October.Republicans have been doing everything in their power to force Mr Obama to delay implementation of a law they strongly believe was rejected by the American public.Democrats argue the law was validated by the Supreme Court in June 2012 and was a central issue in the 2012 presidential election, which Mr Obama won decisively.It seems a messy way to run the nation's finances.Part of the problem is that Congress approves spending separately from the debt ceiling.So politicians can agree to all sorts of expenditure without necessarily having the financing in place to pay for it.In good years that does not matter too much as government income is greater that expenditure.But historically those have been rare.Usually the Treasury has to cover the gap between income and expenditure, by borrowing on the international money markets.When does the money run out?The government has been juggling its debts to keep paying the bills, but those measures will run out between 22 October and the end of the month, according to the Congressional Budget Office.What happens then?The government could make drastic cuts in federal spending or try to raise taxes, or possibly even both.That would be difficult and, perhaps, not enough.During the previous row over the debt ceiling in 2011, then Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner warned that the US government's obligations are so great "immediate cuts in spending or tax increases cannot make the necessary cash available".So what does that mean?The big worry is that the US government may have to stop paying back its debts, which is known as a default.Traditionally the US has been able to borrow at low interest rates on the international markets, which has helped keep interest rates low for consumers.But a default could damage confidence and drive up the cost of borrowing for Americans.A default could also create a chaotic situation on the international market for debt.Investors would not want to accept bonds that were no longer being honoured.But the market is not set up to deal with rejected bonds, so there could be a period of confusion for traders.What would it mean for the rest of the world?A default would send a shock through the financial markets.US bonds, known as treasuries, have always been seen as a safe investment and trillions of dollars are invested in them.Analysts say it is hard to know what would happen and a lot would depend on how long the default lasts.Investors may be prepared to wait out a short disruption.But a lengthy default might see money switch into other perceived havens, such as German and Swiss debt.There might also be a rush into gold, which is traditionally seen as a safe investment.Are there any other options?The president could ignore the debt ceiling.He would be breaking the law and could be impeached.But if the alternative is to cut funding for doctors, schools and agencies such as the FBI, he might decide it is the least bad option.</body>

      <title>PM proposes under-25s' benefits cut</title>
      <description>'I'm worse off than before I got a job'</description>

      <body>David Cameron has suggested benefits paid to people under the age of 25 could be cut in an effort to reduce long-term worklessness.In his speech to the Conservative conference, the prime minister promised to "nag and push and guide" young people away from a life on the dole.It was later confirmed that the government is reviewing policies for 16 to 25-year-olds.The latest figures from the Department of Work and Pensions showed 1.09 million people between the ages of 16 and 24 were not in work, education or training.Mr Cameron argued that action was needed in the UK, saying: "There are still over a million young people not in education, employment, or training."Today it is still possible to leave school, sign on, find a flat, start claiming housing benefit and opt for a life on benefits. It's time for bold action here."BBC News website users have been sending their views on this story, here is a selection of their comments.I graduated from university in July 2012 and have been on Jobseeker's Allowance since then. I have been registered to the Work Programme as well. I have applied for at least three jobs a week and have only had one interview in that time, you rarely hear anything at all and it is very disheartening.I have dyspraxia that inhibits my ability to process information that isn't written down. I am not stupid, but I am trained in a particular field of expertise and constantly looking to break into the industry.I completed a course in teaching assistance since graduating and volunteer as an assistant in a local school and as an English teacher to military families. I have also learned British Sign Language.I am qualified and experienced in two different disciplines. Why should I have my sole source of income reduced? I give back to the community. I would have nothing against having job seekers do mandatory work for their benefits, but they need to be paid the national minimum wage.For the people that are searching for work, and are actually being let down by job centres and the Work Programme, a reduction of benefits is a punishment they do not deserve.I graduated from university with a 2:1 in architecture in 2012. I immediately started applying for jobs both in my chosen profession and posts such as shop assistants and receptionists, as well as unpaid internships. I applied to about 200 jobs. I went on a few interviews and assessment centres but no job. I was living with my parents in London and using savings, birthday and Christmas money to live.After six months of looking for work independently, my parents suggested I contact the job centre for support. They did not help me in any way, no improving my CV or training, just £50 a week. The staff just wanted me to apply for any old job and it had to be through their website, an inflexible system since you couldn't send through personalised cover letters or in my case attach a PDF portfolio. After a month, I found an unpaid internship at a graphic design studio myself.I found a job 11 months after graduating, although it is not in architecture. I still live at home because my salary can't support London rent. Three of my friends found their first jobs a whole year after graduating, and a large percentage are working in shops as they can't afford to intern to get a job in design. This is the reality.I have five children, the youngest of whom is 25. She graduated from university three years ago and looked very hard for a job in the media industry, but it is a very competitive area. She has applied for more than 100 jobs. While she was looking she got a job as an assistant manager at a restaurant and held that job for two years until the company went bust.Since then she has been looking for a job working with children. She would like to go back to college to study, but she is in a catch 22-style situation as she needs to be in a paid job working with children before she can be accepted on an NVQ Level 3 course, but she cannot get a job unless she has the relevant training.Because I do not like my children just sitting around I have encouraged her to volunteer at a local children's day care centre. Last week she was offered a part-time job there and she accepted. When she visited the job centre on Friday she told them and they stopped her Jobseeker's Allowance.The very little she does earn goes on her transport costs, so she is actually worse off than before she took the job. I am very fortunate I can support her, but what would happen to her if I couldn't?My son left school at 16 to go to college to train as a carpenter. He studied for three years and gained all his NVQs and yet despite applying to all the major employers in the area he has been unable to find work in his chosen profession.He was unemployed and receiving benefits for around a year and eventually got so disheartened he took a part-time job working nights stacking shelves at a supermarket.It is a job, but no life for a young man of 23. He would still love to get a job in carpentry, but it doesn't look likely.Interviews by Sian Richards</body>

      <body>A long-running feud has pitted protesters from a small town of 2,000 people in the shadows of Australia's temperate rainforest against one of the world's most recognisable brands.Tranquil Tecoma, 35km (20 miles) east of central Melbourne, has become a battleground between McDonald's and "community" protesters over the construction of a 24-hour drive-through restaurant.Opponents say the restaurant would be too close to a nursery and primary school, would damage other businesses and disrupt the fabric of a leafy community known for its artists and wildlife.The plan was initially rejected by the local council, but the fast-food giant won an appeal at a state planning tribunal, and work on the site is under way.It's been a two-and-a-half-year fight spanning two continents.Last month, campaigners delivered a petition containing 97,000 signatures to the company's global headquarters in Chicago."We knocked on the door of every house in Tecoma and we discovered that nine out of 10 people didn't want this," says Garry Muratore, a spokesman for No McDonald's in the Dandenong Ranges, who denies the group is on an anti-corporate crusade."They have the legal right, but they don't have the moral right. McDonald's have a right to run a business as long as it is in an appropriate place," he tells the BBC News website."But people who moved up here for a 'tree change' [to escape the city and live in the countryside] are worried about litter and the fact that this would be the closest McDonald's to a national park anywhere in Australia. Some people are worried about the traffic."So, too, is the Yarra Ranges Shire Council, which unanimously turned down the original planning request from McDonald's on 15 different grounds back in October 2011."From a council point of view it was about the building and the application. It's never been about the brand. It's more about the intensity of [commercial] use on that site in that village. It's not about snobbery at all," says councillor Samantha Dunn, adding there had been "enormous resistance" to the plan in Tecoma.Despite such fierce opposition, McDonald's says it will press ahead.The company tells BBC News: "We have followed due process every step of the way to build a family restaurant on a highway that houses a number of food and service outlets. The area is appropriately zoned, we have an approved planning permit and we are moving forward."We know that there is much support in the community and our obligation is to ensure that those who want a McDonald's in the community have that option."But in the foothills of Victoria's Dandenong Ranges, protesters are promising a daily blockade of the restaurant, although a recent court order bans them from entering the site.McDonald's has dropped a claim for damages against a group of demonstrators, while a judge has sent both sides to mediation to resolve a dispute over the company's legal costs.Business advocates believe McDonald's is being unfairly victimised by activists."Business operators are increasingly being confronted by so-called community protests, which are highly organised and difficult to combat," says Richard Clancy, from the Victorian Employers' Chamber of Commerce and Industry."In response, they are forced to go to court at great expense just so they can engage in their lawful business activity."But academics note the great Tecoma stand-off could be a turning point for grassroots campaigns against corporate might in Australia.Marketing expert Dean Wilkie, from the Australian School of Business at the University of New South Wales, says community groups can now wield great influence over public opinion."Social media is giving consumers back the power, and those companies that don't act ethically or don't listen to what consumers want will suffer the consequences," Mr Wilkie told the BBC."McDonald's stresses this idea of helping the local community as one of its core values, but the fact that they are going against the people of Tecoma in such a manner is to me inconsistent with what they say their cores values are. It creates a lack of credibility."In Tecoma, regular community meetings are held to determine the demonstrators' next moves, including a plan to distribute leaflets in Korean, Japanese and Mandarin to hotels, urging tourists to boycott McDonald's in their village."It will be a peaceful, non-violent protest that will go on as long as they are there," says Garry Muratore.</body>

      <title>The drink of kings makes a comeback</title>
      <description>Why mead is making a comeback in the US</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24184527</url>
      <date>1380755618</date>
      <body>Long relegated to the dusty corners of history, mead - the drink of kings and Vikings - is making a comeback in the US.But what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe."Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour.When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel."If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works," he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge."We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day," explains Mr Alexander.It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead."It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages," he gushes.After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business.His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US.It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China.Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead.Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade."We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years," she says."I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once."Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree.Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead "is becoming more and more available - similar to cider".Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry.But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments."I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is," says Mr Alexander."You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience."The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers who were just looking for something good to pair with food. But mead has since changed."People don't realise that just because it has honey in it, [mead] doesn't need to be sweet," says Ms Rowe, citing the proliferation of not only dry meads but also meads flavoured with fruits, herbs, and spicy peppers.Yet hampering efforts towards building mead awareness is also the name mead itself.Technically, mead is classified as wine by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which regulates alcohol sales and labelling in the US.This means that mead has to be labelled as "honey wine", which doesn't help combat people's perception of the drink as being as cloyingly sweet."How do people recognise it as mead if you can't say the word?" says Ms Rowe.Ironically, the alcoholic beverage that most credit with the resurgence of the mead business is beer.The craft brewing movement, which was recently singled out in a report by the Atlanta Federal Reserve as a source of job growth, inspired many home brewers to expand their repertoire."I was a home brewer, and at first I liked mead because I had never had it," says Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit, Michigan."Every home brewer has the same dream of, 'Hey what if I could sell this? Wouldn't that be great?'" he says.After he spent months making batch after batch of mead, perfecting his recipe, he realised that mead was "kind of an untouched category", and that no-one, at least back in 2008, was really doing it commercially.So when he and his wife, Kerri, were both laid off of their jobs in Detroit's car industry during the recession, they decided to take the plunge.Now, B Nektar is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, US meadery, shipping 1,100 cases a week across the country.But for Mr Dahlhofer and his fellow mead enthusiasts, that's just the beginning."If you look at craft beer 25 years ago, they had 1% of the total beer market, and now they have 8%," says Maine Mead's Mr Alexander."So we've got a long way to go, but I feel like it's got the opportunity because of the diversity of the beverage."You've got a canvas with very few limits."</body>

      <title>Economic impact of a US shutdown</title>
      <description>What will be the economic cost of a shutdown?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24341406</url>
      <date>1380646665</date>
      <body>The US government has shut down, laying off hundreds of thousands of workers, closing national parks, and delaying vital services like passport renewal.On Monday, US President Barack Obama said the "shutdown will have a very real economic impact on real people, right away".But what exactly will that economic impact be?Research firm IHS estimates that it's costing the US government about $300m a day, for each day of the shut down.Overall, the last time the US government shut down in 1995 for 21 days, it cost the federal government $1.5bn (£927m) - that's $2.1bn (£1.3bn) in today's dollars.Goldman Sachs estimates a three-week shutdown could shave as much as 0.9% from US GDP this quarter.However, markets have largely shrugged off the shut down, with all three indexes rising after markets re-opened on Tuesday.Overall, US stocks are up 18% for the year.For now, it seems, the business community is focused on other concerns, like when the Federal Reserve will begin to ease off its extraordinary efforts to prop up the US economy - something the central bank says will not happen any time soon, partially due to Washington dysfunction.Not an economic barometer"They're going to eventually get to a compromise and then we'll move on," O'Neil Securities trader Kenny Polcari told the BBC from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.A veteran trader, Mr Polcari was also at the NYSE during the last government shutdown, from 1995-1996.Back then, he remembers, markets sold off but then actually rebounded."A government shutdown is not necessarily a comment on the state of the US economy," says Mr Polcari."All indications are that they US economy is starting to turn a corner."In fact, for traders like him, he says now might actually be a good time to get into the market, before third quarter earnings next week."This is in hindsight will probably be viewed as a good buying opportunity, as long as you don't get real panicked," says Mr Polcari."I don't expect to get panicked."And, for many businesses, another debt squabble in Washington is just background noise during a time of good, if not great, economic growth."The difference between now and a couple years ago was that a couple years ago we were coming out the depths of a recession," says David Zarin, who owns a fabric store on Manhattan's Lower East Side.During the debt ceiling negotiations of 2011, he says he saw his business decline in the wake of so much uncertainty at a fragile time of the US economic recovery.Now, while business isn't as a robust as it was prior to the crisis, he's no longer as sensitive to what he calls "Washington posturing.""Frankly, I'm a little numb," he says.Brian Hamilton, boss of Sageworks, a market research company, says Mr Zarin's views are common throughout the private business community."There's sort of an assumption that what happens in Washington looms large on the minds of people who run private companies," says Mr Hamilton."Not to be flip about it, but I don't believe that the people who run private companies wake up every morning and worry very much about what's happening in Washington unless it affects their bottom lines."But for one place, the economic impact of the shutdown will be felt immediately.According to George Mason University professor George Fuller, the Washington DC area will lose an estimated $220m a day while federal workers and contractors are furloughed, perhaps not spending money at local restaurants and businesses.The federal government accounts for one-third of the region's economy."If it's a one day event, it's like a snow day, if its three days it's a blizzard - but if it's more than that, it's a big deal," says Prof Fuller.Furthermore, uncertainty is never good for hiring.One-half of bosses surveyed by the Business Roundtable "indicated that the ongoing disagreement in Washington over the 2014 budget and debt ceiling is having a negative impact on their plans for hiring additional employees over the next six months".And global markets, always keen to see how the world's largest economy is faring, will certainly have cause to pause.If the shutdown continues until Friday, the release of crucial US jobs figures could be delayed."All survey and other programme operations will cease and the public website will not be updated," said Erica Groshen, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said in a memo published on the department's website.However, some reports suggest that the jobs figures would be deemed "essential" and would end up being released on time.A prolonged closure could also have an impact on the biggest stock market news of the year: Twitter, the social networking company, has indicated that it would like to make its stock market debut soon, filing the proper paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission.The SEC says it has funds to stay open for a few weeks, but a prolonged shutdown could force the agency to delay reviewing public offering applications.But for now, at least, traders and economists have painted the shutdown as a wait-and-see moment - but something with a bit of popcorn value, like must-see TV."Investors have been riveted on still another gripping episode of fiscal policy dysfunction in a divided US government," wrote UBS's chief US economist Maury Harris in a note to clients.Mr Harris notes that indications that Washington dysfunction could spill over into wider economic impacts have been muted, with consumer confidence surveys still pointing towards a positive US public.And the main worry continues to be what happens, if, in a few weeks time, politicians cannot agree on raising the limit the US can borrow so that the country can pay its creditors."Any delay in raising the debt ceiling would have dire economic consequences," said Moody's chief US economist Mark Zandi in recent testimony in front of Congress."There will be a violent reaction in financial markets if policymakers fail to act in time," he warned.</body>

      <description>Students in England face a cost-of living-crisis as loans and grants fail to keep pace with rents and bills, suggest figures from the National Union of Students.</description>

      <body>Students in England face a cost-of-living crisis as loans and grants fail to keep pace with rents and bills, claims the National Union of Students.The gap between income and expenditure for a typical student amounts to more than £7,600 according to NUS analysis.The union compared the cost of living and studying for the 39-week 2013-14 academic year with typical income from government grants and loans.The government said it was targeting support at those who needed it most.Rent, bills and other outgoings continue to rise year after year above the rate of inflation but grants and loan rates were frozen this year and will only rise by 1% next year, says the union.It estimates that a student living outside London will pay an average of £21,440 in tuition fees, books, equipment, rent, travel and other living expenses.Against this, they have a potential income of £13,747 composed of their tuition fee loan plus maintenance loans and the grants available to those on average and low incomes.This leaves a shortfall of £7,693.In London, higher rents mean students typically spend £23,187 says the union - but they are also eligible for a higher maintenance loan of £6,090 though this still leaves them with a shortfall of £7,654, says the union.The union adds that some students from less well-off families who are eligible for grants are facing an additional squeeze as the level at which they can claim maximum support has remained at a household income of £25,000 since 2008.NUS president Toni Pearce said: "Those who do not have the rare luxury of resorting to the 'bank of mum and dad' are increasingly being driven to work full-time alongside study where jobs can be found, or worse still, into the arms of predatory pay day lenders just to make ends meet."We need a financial support system that ensures students get what the support they need, when they need it."A spokeswoman for the Department for Business Innovation and Skills said the government's student finance package was designed to target support at students from the poorest households."This year, students from the lowest income households can access over £7,100 of living-cost support, of which over £3,350 does not have to be repaid."The government also provides additional, non-repayable support to students in specific circumstances, such as students with children and disabled students."Scholarships and bursaries are also available from most universities, and students in hardship can apply for additional support through the Access to Learning Fund."</body>

      <title>Fewer children 'read in spare time'</title>
      <description>Fewer children in the UK are reading in their own time and one in five says they are embarrassed to be caught with a book, a survey suggests.</description>

      <body>Fewer children across the UK are reading in their own time and one in five is embarrassed to be caught with a book, a survey suggests.Just over a quarter of 35,000 children from 188 schools told the National Literacy Trust that they read outside of school.About the same number said they did not think their parents cared if they read.The trust says a similar survey in 2005 found one in three children read in their own time.The survey for the trust involved children filling in online questionnaires last winter.Half of those taking part said they enjoyed reading either "very much" or "quite a lot" and a high proportion (four out of five) agreed with the statement "the more I read, the better I become".Nearly two in five agreed reading was "cool", but about one in three said they only read when they had to.Report author Christina Clark, from the Literacy Trust, said young people who enjoyed reading very much were four times as likely to read above the level expected for their age compared with those who did not enjoy reading at all.Those who read outside of class every day were five times as likely to read above the expected level compared with those who never did.And children who do not think "reading is cool" were four times more likely to be below-average readers, the report says.National Literacy Trust director Jonathan Douglas said: "Our research not only reveals that children are reading less and developing more negative attitudes towards reading, but also that there is a clear correlation between this and their performance in reading tests."The study, of children aged from eight to 16, found that the proportion who read e-books outside of school had doubled since 2010 to 12%.Reading is most popular among eight to 11-year-olds, the survey suggests, although teenagers are more likely to read for longer.The charity released the research to coincide with a new campaign to find the UK's "literacy heroes".It is asking the public to name people who might have inspired a love of books or helped to improve reading skills.Anyone from a parent, teacher or young person who has overcome a personal literacy problem to a favourite author or celebrity can be nominated, the Literacy Trust said.The campaign is being supported by the Duchess of Cornwall, who said: "I firmly believe in the importance of igniting a passion for reading in the next generation."In a world where the written word competes with so many other calls on our attention, we need more literacy heroes to keep inspiring young people to find the pleasure and power of reading for themselves."</body>

      <title>Muslim free school 'rated inadequate'</title>
      <description>A Muslim-ethos free school in Derby is expected to be rated as inadequate in all areas, the BBC understands.</description>

      <date>1380884839</date>
      <body>A Muslim free school in Derby is expected to be rated as inadequate in all areas, the BBC understands.The Al-Madinah school closed on Tuesday after one day of an Ofsted inspection over "health and safety concerns".Sources said this was due to incomplete records of child protection checks being done on all staff. The school said it will reopen on Monday.While the Ofsted report has not been finalised, preliminary findings have given it the lowest possible rating.Opened in September 2012, Al-Madinah school claimed to be the first Muslim ethos, all-through (reception, primary and secondary) free school in the country.But persistent concerns over the application of strict Islamic practices led to a scheduled full inspection being brought forward.On Wednesday, it emerged unnamed female staff members claimed they had been forced to wear headscarves and alleged girls were made to sit at the back of the classroom.The interim principal, Stuart Wilson, has said he had not received any complaints from colleagues regarding the dress code, which was made clear to all staff and applicants.He also denied pupils had been segregated.In a statement on the school's website, posted on Friday, Mr Wilson said the school would reopen on 7 October."While it was regrettable that the school had to close at all, the well-being of our pupils will always be our first concern," he said."Unsurprisingly, there has been a number of rumours circulating. While unfortunate, my decision to close the school related to a short-term health and safety issue that has now been completely resolved and will not reoccur."He said they would await the full findings of the Ofsted report which he expected to be published "in the next few weeks".Regional Officer for the National Union of Teachers, Nick Raine, said they only had a handful of members in the school but all had complained about various issues at Al-Madinah."There were concerns about some of the things going on in the classroom, concerns about the quality of the education the children were getting," he said."Our members are very concerned about children as a whole and obviously took this job thinking it was a new and exciting school."We did say, being a free school, it's a completely different paradigm and we are very worried this is going to be run out across the country."It's an experiment on our children's education."Separately, inspectors from the Education Funding Agency have also been at the school, looking at allegations of financial irregularities around the awarding of contracts.</body>

      <title>Concerns delay schools' flu vaccine</title>
      <description>A programme to vaccinate children against flu is delayed in Glasgow after concerns from Muslim parents that it contains products derived from pork.</description>

      <body>A programme to vaccinate schoolchildren against flu has been delayed in Glasgow after concerns from Muslim parents that it contains products derived from pork.About 100,000 primary school pupils in Scottish health board areas taking part in a pilot programme are being offered the Fluenz vaccine.It is given as a nasal spray rather than the traditional jab.But parents in Pollokshields, which has a high number of Muslim pupils, have complained the spray contains gelatine.A letter sent to Glasgow schools in the wake of concerns cites a World Health Organisation study in 2001 which indicated that Islamic and Jewish scholars had agreed pork gelatine was permissible within a vaccine.However, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC), whose area contains most of Scotland's Muslims, said it had put back the rollout of the vaccinations "following concerns raised by a small number of parents".The programme is due to resume next week when parents will be offered a choice of the nasal spray or the more traditional jab.Scottish government public health minister Michael Matheson said flu was a "very serious infection" which needed to be vaccinated against.He said: "That is why, for the new programme for children, we are using a quick and painless nasal spray Fluenz, which has proven to be more effective in children and avoids the use of needles."Parents should be reassured that the existing guidance issued in 2001 from the World Health Organisation, prepared by religious scholars, advises that gelatine of porcine origin used in vaccines and other medicines is judicially permissible as the gelatine in the final product is a completely changed substance."Vaccination is voluntary and we want all parents to have the information they need to make an informed choice."If parents continue to have any concerns, children can be given an alternative safe injectable vaccine which does not contain any porcine gelatine but provides less protection than the nasal spray."He added: "The Scottish Government very much appreciates the help and advice provided by Muslim councils in response to these concerns and a letter has been issued to parents of children in Glasgow to offer reassurance about the use of the Fluenz vaccine."A fifth of the Scottish population will be offered a free flu vaccine, including people aged over 65 and those with conditions that put them at greater risk.For the first time, all two and three-year-olds - about 120,000 children - will be offered the vaccine, as well as 100,000 primary school pupils in health board areas which are taking part in a pilot programme.The programme will be rolled out to eventually see about one million children aged between two and 17 have the chance to be immunised towards the end of 2015.</body>

      <title>Call to revamp IT studies in schools</title>
      <description>A subject called "computing" should be created to replace information and communications technology (ICT) in school, a report suggests.</description>

      <body>A subject called "computing" should be created to replace information and communications technology (ICT) in school, a report suggests.ICT is no longer regarded as relevant for the future, the report by a steering group says.It said its replacement should encourage creativity, develop real-life problem solving and be flexible enough to evolve to stay current.Education Minister Huw Lewis called the report detailed and thorough.The report also suggested grouping computing with the three main science subjects."A career in IT typically involves some degree of logic, creativity, com­munication and collaboration, managing uncertainty, and problem solving," the report said."This is at odds with the current ICT curriculum that is prescriptive, outdated and documentation heavy, focusing on the consumption rather than cre­ation of software and digital content."It added: "We feel strongly that ICT has lost its meaning and become synonymous with word processing and spreadsheets."By renaming and rebranding it as computing as part of a new curriculum we will have an opportunity to improve these perceptions."The new subject would be broken down into two areas - computer science and information technology.Computer science would include the academic side and encompass programming, while information technology would focus on the use of computers in industry, commerce, arts and elsewhere.The report, prepared by an independent steering group chaired by Stuart Arthur from software experts Box UK, recommended computing should be designed with input from the industry and have an online assessment tool.It also added that digital literacy - the general ability to use computers - should start in primary school when pupils are five years old."We should equip children with the skills and empower them with the knowl­edge and confidence to become innovative digital creators, effective digital citizens and successful entrepreneurs so they can take advantage of the global growth opportunities that exist in the digital economy and beyond," the authors said."We have a unique opportunity to learn from the challenges identified in this report and aspire to become truly world class, not just by delivering a digital Wales but by becoming a world leader in computing and digital skills."It is essential to empower our children by giving them the skills required to con­tribute to the rapidly growing digital economy."Education Minister Huw Lewis said: "ICT in Wales is global and dynamic and I want Welsh learners to be given opportunities to develop the skills required to work in and contribute to the sector."We have concerns that fewer Welsh learners are seeing the value in pursuing a career in ICT and that many learners, as well as the wider public, perceive learning about computing in a negative way."It's therefore of great importance what is currently being taught is relevant to the global economy of the future."We will now take time to consider the report's findings in the context of our wider review of assessment and the national curriculum."</body>

      <title>More children pass new phonics test</title>
      <description>More children have passed the new phonics test for England's five- and six-year-olds this year.</description>

      <body>More children have passed the new phonics reading test for England's five- and six-year-olds this year.More than two-thirds (69%) of pupils in state schools reached the expected level - up from 58% last year.Nearly 180,000 pupils failed to meet the expected standard in the controversial new check, which is carried out at the end of Year 1.Girls did better than boys - almost three-quarters passed - while about two-thirds of boys did so.The statistics were published on Thursday by the Department for Education.This is the second year that pupils have taken the test, which is based on "synthetic phonics", a system that focuses on children being able to identify sounds of letters and groups of letters so that they are then able to decode and read real words.For the check, the children are asked to sound out 40 words, some of which are made up, such as "voo", "spron" and "terg" - to test their reading skills.They need correctly to identify 32 out of the 40 phonic sounds to pass.Ministers say the phonics check will improve literacy standards by helping to identify children who need extra help with reading and say it has helped to increase schools' focus on phonics.Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said: "We are committed to improving children's reading."The phonics check helps teachers identify those pupils who need extra help in learning to read."Many thousands of children will now receive the extra support they need to catch up with their peers and develop a love of reading."Teaching unions say the phonics check does not tell teachers anything they did not know about their pupils and risks labelling some as failures at an early age.And they warn that children could be confused by reading "non-words".Christine Blower, the head of the National Union of Teachers, said: "To be telling five- and six-year-olds that they have failed is quite simply wrong."Children develop at different levels, the slow reader at five can easily be the good reader by the age of 11."In many other countries with successful education systems such as Finland most children haven't even started school until seven."</body>

      <title>Teachers in China 'highest status'</title>
      <description>Teachers in China are the most highly respected, in an international study comparing the status of teachers in 21 countries.</description>

      <body>Teachers in China have the highest levels of public respect, according to an international study comparing their status in 21 countries.Teachers in the UK were in 10th place in the global index which was compiled by the University of Sussex professor Peter Dolton.The study was based on surveys of 1,000 adults in each of the countries.This examined public attitudes to professional status, trust, pay and the desirability of teaching as a career.The study confirmed the high status of teachers in China, where there is a strong cultural emphasis on the importance of education."Teachers are revered," says Prof Dolton.A large majority of adults in China believed that students would respect their teachers - in contrast to most European countries where only a minority believed that students would show respect.In the UK, only about one in five adults believed that students showed their teachers respect in school.And while teachers in China were compared with doctors, in the UK they were more likely to be bracketed with nurses and social workers.In the US, people compared teachers with librarians and in Japan the feeling was that they were on a par with local government officials.This reveals the cultural differences in how the role of teaching is perceived, says Prof Dolton, a professor of economics at Sussex University and senior research fellow at the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics.The status of teachers in China was considerably above the next highest countries, which were Greece, Turkey and South Korea.The study, published by the Varkey GEMS Foundation, also included some results that might be thought of as unexpected.Finland, often seen as a model for recruiting high-quality, high-status teachers, was in the bottom half of the rankings, in 13th place. while Germany (16th) and Japan (17th) were ranked among the lowest countries.No countries from sub-Saharan Africa were included in the survey.The findings for the UK are based on a single national figure, rather than individual devolved administrations.They show a positive picture in public attitudes, with much higher levels of trust in the education system than in the US and most other European countries in the survey.There was a considerable level of public support for teachers - with a majority believing that they should be better paid and also underestimating the starting salary for teachers (currently about £22,000 in England outside London).More people thought that teachers' unions should have greater influence, compared with those who thought that they had too much influence.But a large majority were sympathetic to the principle of performance pay for teachers.Head teachers in the UK are particularly highly respected - more so than in any other of the countries surveyed.Former education minister, Lord Adonis, said the rankings showed the importance of the role of teaching in education reform."To recruit the brightest and best, teaching needs to be a high status occupation, and we need to understand better what contributes to the social standing of teachers," said Lord Adonis.Sunny Varkey, founder of the Varkey GEMS Foundation, said: "It is my ambition that teachers are treated with as much respect as doctors. Sadly, in many countries around the world teachers no longer retain the elevated status that we used to take for granted."Prof Dalton says the public status of teaching will influence standards of education."This informs who decides to become a teacher in each country, how they are respected and how they are financially rewarded. Ultimately, this affects the kind of job they do in teaching our children," he says.</body>

      <title>Murdered Keanu 'failed' by agencies</title>
      <description>A serious case review into the murder of two-year-old Keanu Williams finds police, social services and health workers "failed" to prevent his death.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-24365700</url>
      <date>1380809518</date>
      <body>There were "a number of significant missed opportunities" to save a two-year-old boy from being beaten to death by his mother, a report has found.Rebecca Shuttleworth is serving a life sentence for murdering Keanu Williams.The toddler was found with 37 injuries including a fractured skull and torn abdomen, in Ward End, Birmingham.A serious case review said social care workers, the police and health professionals had "collectively failed to prevent Keanu's death".Shuttleworth, 25, was spoken to in prison by members of the serious case review team, telling them she was "surprised" social workers allowed her to keep custody of Keanu.The report states: "She expressed some surprise that Keanu had not been removed from her care when born."As Rebecca Shuttleworth is intending to appeal her sentence, although it is unclear if that is possible, she was not able to talk more about services which might have prevented Keanu's death."The report found different agencies had "become confused" as their strategy discussions had focused on the medical and forensic aspect of his injuries, the report said.It concluded that although Keanu's death on 9 January 2011 could not have been predicted, the agencies involved could have seen that he was "likely to suffer significant harm".The toddler should have been subject to a child protection plan "on at least two occasions" to address issues of neglect and physical harm, the report said.Jane Held, from the Birmingham Safeguarding Children Board, said Keanu died because there were "failings across every agency"."No-one walked in his shoes, staff were distracted by his mother's needs and by taking what she had told them at face value," she said.Ms Held said there had been "double-figure sackings" since Keanu's death, but added: "It is unfortunately an appalling situation."We are unequivocally sorry about the fact that unacceptable failures in 2011 and from the start of Keanu's life meant that we did not prevent his death and we failed to protect him, and that is something that I think all the board feel incredibly distressed about."Shuttleworth, of Cottingham Road, Manchester, was convicted of murder and four counts of child cruelty after a five-month trial. She was ordered to serve at least 18 years.Keanu was born in Torbay, Devon, and the report also found Torbay's Children's Services should have been aware of the risks even before his birth.It states: "There was enough information available to raise concerns that the unborn child was likely to be at risk of suffering significant harm."The authority also later received two anonymous reports of concerns about Rebecca Shuttleworth's care of Keanu which should have led to a reassessment of his safety.It concluded: "If a child protection plan had been in place, there would have been more robust arrangements to safeguard and promote Keanu's interests."Torbay Council's director of children's services, Richard Williams, said: "This is an extremely sad case and I would like to reassure everyone that we take the recommendations in this review very seriously and have acted upon them all."The serious case review makes eight recommendations:The report was told there has been an "end-to-end" review of the child protection system since Keanu's death, as it became clear there had been poor performance and a general lack of compliance with child protection procedures.In a comment that echoes those made after the death of starved four-year-old Daniel Pelka, the report says that Keanu had become "invisible".The serious case review into the death of Keanu Williams is the twenty-third to be published in Birmingham since the Local Safeguarding Board's inception in 2006.Peter Hay, from Birmingham City Council said admitted that its track record over recent years was "poor" and said the council was "unequivocally sorry"."Keanu's death is another tragic reminder of the consequences of failing children's services," he said.Edward Timpson, the government minister for children and families, said he has issued the council with a "final warning"."There is no quick fix, however I have been very clear with Birmingham that unless I see rapid improvement further action will follow," he added.Ofsted will return to Birmingham in autumn to determine what progress has been made, the minister said.The National Children's Bureau said it was "particularly worrying" that the review found that no conversations were held with Keanu to find out what he was feeling.Dr Hilary Emery, from the children's charity, said no child at risk should ever be "only seen and not heard"."We urgently need to review how best to support children within the child protection system - especially the very young ones - to ensure their voices are listened to at every opportunity," he said.West Midlands Police said their officers need to "challenge social workers and doctors" in future.Assistant Chief Constable Sharon Rowe said: "Of course it's a collective failure and we paid a key role in that."Ultimate accountability rests with Keanu's mother who was convicted of his murder - let's not forget that."Fay Baillie, director of nursing for NHS England in Birmingham, Solihull and the Black Country said: "I don't think children in Birmingham will ever be completely safe."We are always going to have deceptive mothers and families, however we can aim to make it as safe as possible by working together and improving education."</body>

      <body>An "inspirational" head teacher has been given a suspended prison sentence after admitting false accounting.Sir Alan Davies, 66, of Grants Close, the former head at Wembley's Copland School, in north London, pleaded guilty to creating a false paper trail on bonus payments and allowances.Davies, knighted for his services to education, resigned in 2009.At Southwark Crown Court, Judge Deborah Taylor said: "Your dishonest behaviour represents a fall from grace."Davies had pleaded guilty to six counts of false accounting after he admitted creating eight back-payment documents at the same time.The court heard that Davies paid himself, three staff members and two governors a total of £2.7m over several years through bonuses and salaries.Defending Davies, William Clegg QC, told the court he was an "inspirational" teacher and the offences needed to be taken in context.He said: "This is not a case of documents being forged to permit payments to be made that were unlawful and not agreed or made dishonestly. The position is the opposite."The payments were honestly made and honestly received. This is not somebody seeking to obtain money he was not entitled to."Prosecutor John Black QC added there was no dishonesty in the making or receiving of the payments.He said: "The dishonesty relates to false paper trails in order to legitimise these payments."The Crown say they [paperwork backing up payments] were all generated at the same time, after Sir Alan Davies had become aware of the impending or likely scrutiny, to give the impression the right procedure was being adhered to."Two counts of money laundering and conspiracy to defraud were dropped and conspiracy charges against five others were also dropped.Following the case Davies said: "In some instances I have felt that we were being tried by the media and there were a lot of misrepresentations made in the press, many of which were wholly unfounded."I do, however, have to accept that I did not have all the necessary paperwork in place and I made a profound error of judgment by backdating eight documents."In a statement, Brent Council, said: "The council will always act robustly and take action where allegations of financial irregularities have been made, to investigate and pursue legal action."In this case the guilty plea of false accounting vindicates the actions taken although we are disappointed the Crown Prosecution Service saw fit not to pursue the conspiracy to defraud."</body>

      <title>London top city in university table</title>
      <description>London has more universities ranked in the top 40 of a global table than any other city, although only one of the four makes the top 10.</description>

      <body>London has four universities in the top 40 of a global league table - more than any other individual city - although only one makes the top 10.US universities are still the most dominant international force in the Times Higher Education rankings.In top place, as last year, is the California Institute of Technology.In the UK there are concerns that, outside Oxford, Cambridge and London colleges, many major universities are slipping down international rankings.The so-called "golden triangle" of UK universities - Oxford, Cambridge and leading London institutions - is seen as a breakaway elite group, with these universities consolidating their international reputations.Imperial College, University College London, LSE and King's College London are all in the top 40. London has more universities in this league table than all of Japan, although only Imperial College makes the top 10.Phil Baty, editor of the rankings, says this is part of a global pattern of clustering of "excellent universities". Boston in the US has eight universities in the top 200, more than entire countries such as China, Switzerland and Australia.But there are warnings from the rankings organisation that prominent UK regional universities are falling away.Edinburgh, Manchester, Bristol, Sheffield, Warwick, Southampton, Nottingham and Newcastle are all seen as going downwards against international rivals.However the University of Leicester has risen sharply, which has been described as the "Richard III effect", after the high-profile research associated with the discovery of the body of the medieval king.This is described by the Times Higher Education rankings as showing that "power is draining from the UK regions".The top 20 still reflects the dominance of wealthy US university powerhouses, taking 15 of the top 20 places, with institutions such Harvard, MIT and Stanford in the leading pack behind the California Institute of Technology.The highest UK university is Oxford and the highest ranked continental European university is ETH Zurich in Switzerland, which is also the only non-English speaking university in the top 20."No university can rest on its laurels. No-one is guaranteed to retain a top-200 place when the US, Far East and others are investing in research so heavily," said Sir David Bell, vice-chancellor of Reading University, which has fallen from 176th to 194th place."There are some dramatic year-on-year rises and falls this year, so we should be careful not to read too much into a single set of figures.""It is no surprise that a small number of UK universities at the very top end will remain more stable, with others more likely to fluctuate."Sir Christopher Snowden, president of Universities UK, said the rankings showed that the UK had "the second-strongest university system in the world after the US"."What is clear, however, is that the UK must continue to invest in higher education if we are to maintain this global competitiveness."</body>

      <title>Disabled students 'need campus help'</title>
      <description>Disabled students are calling on universities across the UK to do more to help them take part fully in campus life.</description>

      <body>Disabled students are calling on UK universities to do more to help them take part fully in campus life.A study by the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign's Trailblazers suggests many students are unable to access areas such as lecture theatres and libraries.It says many institutions are failing to signpost key information such as details of accessible accommodation.The Equality Challenge Unit said many universities were working hard to be as accessible and welcoming as possible.The Disability Discrimination Act 2005 means it is illegal for education providers to treat disabled students less favourably because of their disability.A Trailblazers' survey of 100 UK universities found only half of those questioned confirmed that all teaching rooms, study rooms and libraries were fully accessible for students with mobility difficulties.The research found half of universities questioned said that not all inter-campus transport was accessible.Only a quarter of the universities surveyed had considered disabled students when planning freshers' week information and only a third had a society representing disabled students in the student union.Tanvi Vyas, manager of Trailblazers, said: "We continue to hear about how many universities are still missing the mark when it comes to helping people planning on entering higher education - and helping them to complete their time there."There are plenty of simple measures that universities can take. Providing inclusive freshers' guides, handy information on accessible transport and buildings and support networks can all make a huge difference to students adapting to campus life."We also need the government and local authorities to examine the issue of relocating care packages, which continues to be an enormous struggle for many students studying away from home."Chris Brill, senior policy adviser for the Equality Challenge Unit, which helps universities ensure equality for staff and students, said: "Trailblazers' audit highlights a number of small changes that would make big improvements for students."For example, making sure information is clearly signposted on websites, and ensuring the needs of disabled students are reflected in freshers' week programmes."Students' unions, often a conduit between universities and students, could also be encouraged to consider how they involve disabled students in the democratic structures."Through this, we may see an increase in societies representing disabled students, and better involvement of disabled people in higher education."</body>

      <title>Tories may cut under-25s' benefits</title>
      <description>David Cameron suggests that out-of-work benefits paid to people under the age of 25 could be cut so all of them are either "earning or learning".</description>

      <date>1380745590</date>
      <body>David Cameron has suggested benefits paid to people under the age of 25 could be cut in an effort to reduce long-term worklessness.In his speech to the Conservative conference, the prime minister promised to "nag and push and guide" young people away from a life on the dole.It was later confirmed that the government is reviewing policies for 16 to 25-year-olds.But Labour accused the Conservatives of a "desperate" lack of ideas.In his speech, Mr Cameron promised to create a "land of opportunity" by boosting business and reducing reliance on benefits.He also vowed to improve the education system and told party activists that there was still much work to do to fix the economic "mess" left by Labour.The latest figures from the Department of Work and Pensions showed 1.09 million people between the ages of 16 and 24 were not in work, education or training.The problem has proved stubbornly hard to tackle across Europe, with rates of youth unemployment soaring above 50% in Spain.Mr Cameron argued that action was needed in the UK, saying: "There are still over a million young people not in education, employment, or training."Today it is still possible to leave school, sign on, find a flat, start claiming housing benefit and opt for a life on benefits. It's time for bold action here."He promised the Conservatives would consider, as they write their manifesto for the 2015 general election, whether "that option should really exist at all".A Conservative source has told the BBC the manifesto will definitely contain a commitment to end the automatic entitlement to housing benefit for the under-25s, as suggested previously by Mr Cameron.In his speech, the prime minister criticised reliance on benefits, saying: "Instead we should give young people a clear, positive choice: Go to school. Go to college. Do an apprenticeship. Get a job."But just choose the dole? We've got to offer them something better than that."He added: "And let no one paint ideas like this as callous. Think about it: with your children, would you dream of just leaving them to their own devices, not getting a job, not training, nothing?"No - you'd nag and push and guide and do anything to get them on their way… and so must we. So this is what we want to see: everyone under 25 - earning or learning."During the week-long conference in Manchester, the Conservatives have announced plans to make the long-term unemployed undertake work placements if they want to continue receiving benefits.Mr Cameron did not set out any specific changes regarding under-25s during his 50-minute speech, but Education Secretary Michael Gove offered more detail when questioned on BBC Radio 4's The World at One.He announced that Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood was already reviewing the policies in place. He is expected to report his findings by the end of the year.Mr Gove said: "It is always going to be the case that there are some people for whom you need not so much a nudge as a dunt (a firm blow or stroke) towards the workplace."It's important also that we all recognise that welfare is there explicitly to help those people through hard times that it shouldn't become habituated."He said he would not pre-empt the policy review, adding: "I don't think any of us would want to take away any form of necessary support to young or old vulnerable people."However, unions warned that any cut in benefits would hurt the worst-off.TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: "Given the government's awful track record of helping young people find jobs, the prime minister's threat to ban the dole for under-25s will simply push hundreds of thousands of young people, including those with young families, even deeper into poverty."Young people suffered most in the recession. Today the prime minister has pledged that they will suffer most during the recovery too."The general secretary of the University and College Union, Sally Hunt, said: "What we need is a real plan at local and national level which provides sustainable and secure employment opportunities for young people and access to education which is useful and mind-broadening."Cheap headlines about lazy youngsters or cutting their benefits are no substitute for a strategy which is on the side of young people and allows them to realise their potential."A Labour spokesperson said: "This is an empty and a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that there was absolutely nothing in David Cameron's speech to deal with the cost-of-living crisis facing families."If the Conservatives really wanted to get young people off benefits, they'd be backing Labour's youth jobs guarantee, giving young people who've been out of work for over a year a job they must take or lose benefits."</body>

      <title>Private schools 'only share crumbs'</title>
      <description>Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw says private schools need to make greater efforts to support their state school neighbours</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24367150</url>
      <date>1380792922</date>
      <body>Private schools have been accused of failing to support their local state schools, in a "call to arms" from Ofsted chief, Sir Michael Wilshaw.He told the head teachers of leading independent schools that they should sponsor academies, rather than only offer "crumbs off your table".There was a frosty reception from some of the heads, who accused Sir Michael of creating a false impression.But he told them: "Not enough of you are willingly going the extra mile."Sir Michael's call for greater involvement between state and independent schools was delivered at the annual conference of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in London.The delegates, representing some of the most prestigious private schools, were challenged to make greater efforts to use their resources and expertise to support their neighbouring state schools.Sir Michael argued that many of the links between private and state schools were only "thin stuff", such as occasionally making a playing field available.He called for a more sustained connection, such as sponsoring an academy, telling the head teachers that the private and state sectors should not be seen as rivals but as sharing a joint moral project to educate.As state schools become increasingly more autonomous, Sir Michael said, they could learn much from the long experience of independent schools at running their own affairs.He told the private school heads that they would not diminish their own success or academic advantage by supporting other local schools."Education should not be a scarce resource hoarded by those lucky enough to possess it. Education is meant to be shared. Its power does not decrease with the giving. It is an economic and social good," said Sir Michael.But the criticism prompted an angry response from some delegates, who claimed that Sir Michael was misrepresenting their commitment to collaborating with state schools.They also challenged the idea that sponsoring an academy should be the key measure of their intentions.Head teachers also told Sir Michael that their attempts to engage with local state schools had been rejected, because of political hostility to the independent sector.However Anthony Seldon, master of Wellington College, spoke in support of Sir Michael's emphasis on sponsoring academies.He told fellow head teachers that there was more to be gained by both private and state schools from such a sustained and structured relationship.Sir Michael also took issue with the idea that inner city head teachers were focusing too much on exam results, rather than a more holistic approach.He said their priority must be helping disadvantaged children to academic success."These heads in inner city London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds haven't got the time to worry whether their children are climbing trees proficiently," said Sir Michael."These heads know that gaining academic qualifications is the one route out of poverty and disadvantage."They would find it deeply insulting to believe that some in this room felt that they don't worry sufficiently about a balanced education for their students," he said.In response, the HMC's general secretary, William Richardson, said: "We look forward to continuing our highly varied work with colleagues in maintained schools, in providing Sir Michael with illuminating examples and in assuring him that such work is informed by educational values that are both thorough-going and broadly-based."Sir Michael's comments were criticised by the leader of another independent schools' body, who said 90% of private schools were working with state schools.Matthew Burgess, general secretary of the Independent Schools Council, said: "Once again, Sir Michael Wilshaw shows his lack of understanding at just how much work independent schools are already doing in collaboration with their state sector colleagues."As a sector, we can be proud of the enormous amount of time and energy devoted by independent school teachers and leaders in working for the benefit of all children."</body>

      <title>Call to delay GCSE entry changes</title>
      <description>Michael Gove is asked to delay last-minute exam system changes aimed at stopping schools in England "gaming" the league tables.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24366724</url>
      <date>1380722998</date>
      <body>Education Secretary Michael Gove has been asked to delay mid-course changes aimed at stopping schools from entering pupils for GCSEs before they are ready.The Independent Academies Association head Nick Weller said stopping GCSE retakes from counting in England's league tables could backfire on pupils.It is claimed that schools enter pupils early so they can bank a key C-grade, only taking exams again if they fail.The government says heads will still be able to enter students for GCSEs early.But it argues that if pupils are entered for exams at the expected time - at the end of a two-year course - they are more likely to do better.Mr Weller, who is chairman of the main body representing state-funded but privately run schools known as academies, said in a letter to Mr Gove that he shared the secretary of state's concern about multiple entries for the same qualification and other aspects of league table "game-playing".But he was worried about "damage being done to students' prospects this year" because the changes were effective almost immediately - affecting the league tables based on next summer's GCSE results.He appealed to Mr Gove to delay the proposed changes so that current GCSE students could continue their courses as planned."I am not sure that the department has fully understood the unintended consequences of previous mid-course changes in relation to the GCSE qualification, and I fear that these latest revisions, if they are as reported, will further undermine confidence in the system," he said.He also questioned whether the Department for Education could clearly distinguish between "gaming" the league tables and doing what was best for students."Many schools will now cancel early entries, despite the fact that students themselves might be better off sitting a paper this winter with the chance to retake if necessary in the summer," he said.He added that academy leaders were "dismayed at the confusion and loss of confidence in the GCSE examination since the summer of 2012".This follows the changes to grade boundaries to GCSE English courses midway through the year, which left pupils with the same marks on different grades. It was the subject of a judicial review against Ofqual and some exam boards by teaching unions, which was not upheld.Mr Weller said: "Sensible reform in the pursuit of rigour should be associated with greater clarity, consistency and logic, not less."And he urged the secretary of state to consult properly with professionals he trusted on any further revisions to the exams system.A Department for Education spokesman has said: "We recognise that early entry can be used effectively in certain cases and schools will continue to be able to enter pupils early for examinations where they feel it is appropriate."However, schools should definitely not be entering children for exams before they are ready. It is not good for pupils to be put in early in a school's hope they can 'bank' a C - it is far better that children study the subject fully and take it when they are ready."A document on its website said the changes were being made to address "the significant increase" in early entry in recent years.The education secretary has previously described early entry as a "damaging trend that is harming the interests of many pupils", adding that there is evidence that "candidates who enter early perform worse overall than those who do not, even after resits are taken into account".The DfE paper continues: "It seems likely that candidates are being entered before they are ready, and 'banking' a C grade where their performance at Key Stage 2 [end of primary school] would suggest that if they had continued to study the subject and taken the GCSE at the end of year 11 they could have achieved a top grade.""If schools decide they wish to withdraw students from November examinations, they should contact their exam board."If schools are confident that pupils will achieve well even when entered early and that early entry is therefore in the interests of the pupil, they should not need to make any changes to entry plans. Any pupil who does enter early from this point on will still be able to retake if they receive a disappointing result."That result will not count towards the performance tables for their school, even if it is an improvement on their earlier entry, but pupils will still be able to use their best result to support applications to further and higher education, or for employment."It comes as head teachers are writing to parents also expressing concern about the changes.A joint letter from the National Association of Head Teachers and the Association of School and College leaders says: "Without any notice and with immediate effect, the government has limited schools' ability to enter students early for GCSEs - after we had already planned entries for the year. Early entry can serve many good purposes, including vital 'live' preparation for later exams."It seems that barely a term goes by without another sudden change to GCSE examinations. Worst of all, these changes are often made in the middle of students' courses of study, making it impossible to plan properly or to focus on learning rather than constant administrative change. They changed grade boundaries between exam sittings; they dropped the vital skills of speaking and listening from English mid-course; and now this latest announcement."These changes are often timed to coincide with party conferences or similar events, leading us to fear that students and schools are just collateral damage in party political squabbles."The move, announced last weekend, is one of a number steps brought in aimed at preventing schools from engaging in league table "tricks" that some say may harm pupils' prospects.</body>

      <title>Muslim free school closes doors</title>
      <description>A Muslim free school accused of imposing strict Islamic practices closes after an inspection by Ofsted, but its interim head insists it is temporary.</description>

      <body>A Muslim free school accused of imposing strict Islamic practices, such as segregated classrooms, has closed following an inspection by Ofsted.The BBC understands Ofsted's findings were so damning that the acting head of Al-Madinah, in Derby, had little choice but to shut it down immediately.The school said the move was due to a "health and safety issue" but expected it to reopen in the "very near future".Ofsted said it could not disclose its concerns until the inspection ended.It added it had "made some findings and shared them with the principal". The second day of the inspection is taking place later.In a statement on the school's website titled "short term closure", interim principal Stuart Wilson said: "Owing to a health and safety issue, I have taken the decision to close the school... until I am confident that all children are safe on site."As parents, you will be informed directly, and on the website, when you are able to send your children back to school..."Assuring you that we have your children's best interests at heart."In a series of newspaper reports unnamed former staff members of Al-Madinah, which opened as a free school in September last year, had alleged that girls were forced to sit at the back of the classroom.Unnamed female staff members have also claimed they were forced to conform to a strict dress code including wearing a head scarf or hijab - whether or not they were Muslim.When it opened Al-Madinah claimed to be the first Muslim ethos, all-through [reception, primary and secondary] free school in the country.The school's first head teacher, Andrew Cutts-Mckay, left the school after less than a year in the job.Last week, the interim principal told the BBC that he had not received any complaints from colleagues regarding the dress code and that pupils were not being segregated, with girls and boys being treated equally.Ofsted is not the only organisation with concerns about Al-Madinah.The Education Funding Agency - from which the school gets its public funding - is investigating alleged financial irregularities.In a statement, the Department for Education said it was already investigating the school before the allegations became public.It said: ''We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection. We are waiting for Ofsted's final report and considering all legal options."The school's closure is likely to be embarrassing for Education Secretary Michael Gove, who introduced free schools in 2010 in an effort to raise standards in education.Free schools are state funded but operate outside local education authority control and can be set up by parents and community groups in England.</body>

      <body>Teaching Shakespeare with a hip-hop soundtrack is patronising, evil and "viciously racist" to black pupils, the Tory Party conference has been told.Youth mentor and writer Lindsay Johns, a guest speaker invited by Education Secretary Michael Gove, said teachers were "hell-bent on making everything cool or hip".They should "stop genuflecting at the altar of youth", he said."Hamlet doesn't need a hip-hop sound track for young people to enjoy it."Mr Johns added: "It's been doing just fine for the last 400 years.""It's not only incredibly patronising, but also viciously racist to think that black and brown kids in the inner cities will only 'get Shakespeare' if it's set to a hip-hop beat and presented in three-minute, MTV-Base-style chunks."It is positively evil to deny inner city kids access to the manifold joys of hearing their national poet's true voice, in essence their birthright, simply because of a culture of low expectations."Mr Johns said he was tired of "vacuous PC [politically correct] educationalists who took great offence at Mr Gove's drive for a national curriculum more focused on English literary classics and the history of Britain.He said: "Young people need more not fewer dead white men - by dead white men I mean the Western literary canon."You can of course be fiercely proud of your Jamaican, Ghanaian or black British roots and ardently love Horace, Boccaccio and Milton."The two are in no way mutually exclusive and they certainly don't make you any less black or less brown by reading them."The novels of Jane Austen and Charles Dickens were just as relevant to all young people no matter what colour or creed, he said, adding that it was "positively nefarious" to deny access to them.Mr Johns also attacked "bling culture" and "ghetto grammar", which he said were holding some youngsters back and making them sound like they had had "a frontal lobotomy""Our aim is for the young people to confound, not conform to stereotypes," he said.Mr Johns, who himself studied French and Italian at Oxford, also said a portrayal of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge as institutionally racist was "actually putting off ferociously bright, black, brown, and white, working-class kids from applying"."Maybe, just maybe, if you didn't keep on discouraging them from applying in the first place with your duplicitous horror stories of how terrible life is there, then levels of representation would actually get better," he said.</body>

      <title>Teachers in strike action over pay</title>

      <body>Thousands of schools were closed as members of the two biggest teaching unions took strike action in a row over pay, pensions and workloads.The walkout affected schools in 49 authorities in the east of England, the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber.It is part of a continuing campaign of rolling regional strikes involving members of the NUT and NASUWT.The government said the strike would disrupt learning, inconvenience parents and damage the reputation of teachers.At least 2,500 schools were closed or partially closed.The strikers are angry about changes to their pensions, increased workloads and government plans to bring in performance-related pay.NUT general secretary Christine Blower said teachers could not "stand by and watch our profession be systematically attacked and undermined".She declared the action a "huge success" and added: "There can be no doubt left about the feeling of anger towards this government's treatment of the teaching profession."Strike action is never a step that teachers take lightly and we are very aware and concerned about the inconvenience it causes parents."Unfortunately we are faced with a coalition government that is refusing to listen to the reasonable demands of the profession."Teachers gathered for a series of marches and rallies in support of the strike.Ian Lever, from the NUT in Leicester, said: "Teachers are very angry about what is happening to the education system in this country and are prepared to make a stand on it."These are relentless attacks from this government, not just on our pay and conditions but on the education system in general."As professionals, as people who care about education, teachers are saying 'enough is enough' - we have to do something about this."BBC News Online journalist Max Mulgrew said he had seen about 3,000 people in Birmingham's Victoria Square."I've seen banners from NUT and NASUWT groups from Dudley, Coventry, Warwickshire, Walsall, the West Midlands region and even Wigan," he said.About 2,000 people had gathered in Barkers Pool, Sheffield, and about 800 assembled at Parker's Piece, Cambridge.Susi Artis, a spokeswoman for the NUT in Nottingham, said: "I recognise that for a lot of parents this is really inconvenient and we're very sorry for that. Striking is very much a last resort."Alison Core, a Shropshire primary school teacher, said: "Teachers do not want to strike but we feel we have no choice."Our jobs should not be about pay and targets. The bigger picture is the education of the children and with so many fast changes in the industry, we cannot lose sight of that."Jane Lucas, a parent from Coventry, said one of her children was at home and one was at school.She said: "Luckily, there's a couple of mums that we've managed to rally round and we're going to share the childcare today."It's difficult because I do support any worker who wants to fight for the right of their pensions and pay, it's just unfortunate that it's affecting children."Lisa Chambers, Conservative deputy leader of Suffolk County Council and cabinet member for education, said she had taken her son Alex, 13, with her to County Hall meetings."Unfortunately we don't have grandparents close to us and friends have got to make arrangements for their own children so he's had to come to work with me," she said."I have a diary of commitments to people and I really don't feel I can let people down because of this strike."Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said: "Strike action is a last resort, teachers have been left with no choice but to demonstrate their anger and frustration in the face of their genuine concerns being dismissed and trivialised."Teachers of course deeply regret any disruption to children and families."Such action would have been unnecessary had the secretary of state been prepared to engage in genuine discussions."A Department for Education spokesman said: "It is disappointing that the NUT and NASUWT are striking over the government's measures to allow heads to pay good teachers more."Industrial action will disrupt pupils' education, hugely inconvenience parents and damage the profession's reputation in the eyes of the public at a time when our reforms are driving up standards across the country."In a recent poll, 61% of respondents supported linking teachers' pay to performance and 70% either opposed the strikes or believed that teachers should not be allowed to strike at all."A further regional strike is planned in London, the North East, South East and South West on 17 October.Plans for a national one-day walkout before Christmas have also been announced by the two unions.</body>

Nothing to do with Star Trek and sombre Vulcans, but plenty to do with ambitions "to boldly go".And could these be the real deal? The academic chairing Harvard's online experiments says we are already "post-Mooc".Moocs - massive open online courses - have been something of a hurricane in universities, making a lot of noise and promising to rip everything up.Pioneered by some of the most prestigious US universities, they have been re-packaging course units into online lessons and making them available to anyone with an internet connection.But it's still not clear whether this is a passing storm or something that will fundamentally change how higher education is delivered.Last week the UK joined the fray, with more than 20 universities launching an online platform called FutureLearn, which will challenge the dominant players on the east and west US coasts.The biggest success for online courses and their greatest problem are the same - the huge numbers attracted.It demonstrates the scale of the unmet demand for higher education, but at the same time it's not clear how tens of thousands of students on a course could ever satisfactorily be taught, assessed and accredited. Most of these signs-up will sign off without completing courses.At Harvard, more people have signed up for Moocs in a single year than have attended the university in its entire 377-year history. That's a great success story in opening up education, but what do you do with all those hungry minds?Enter the Spoc. And the clue is in the "small, private" part of the name. These courses are still free and delivered through the internet, but access is restricted to much smaller numbers, tens or hundreds, rather than tens of thousands.It means a selection process for applicants and the capacity for a more customised experience. Looking further down the track, it wouldn't be difficult to imagine fees and course credits.Harvard and University of California, Berkeley, part of the edX online alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are among the universities beginning to experiment with this more refined model.Next week a popular and highly topical course in US national security strategy will begin at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Alongside the campus students in Cambridge, Massachusetts, there will be a parallel Spoc version with a limit of about 500 online students.Students wanting to get into this online classroom have to submit a written assignment about the US government's response to the conflict in Syria, along with details of their academic credentials.Even though this online course won't have a formal academic credit at the end, it's going to require eight hours of work a week and a capacity to tackle questions about "Iran's nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria's civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information".These Spoc students might include Harvard students who couldn't get into the campus course, alongside those who might be studying from home or at work.Harvard isn't abandoning Moocs, but rather like Russian dolls sitting inside each other, a single course might now be delivered to a large open Mooc audience, to a much smaller number of Spoc students and then down to an even smaller number enrolled at the bricks-and-mortar campus.It's taking the limited and expensive resource of a Harvard course and amplifying it for widening rings of audiences.Prof Robert Lue chairs the committee of academics that runs Harvard's online experiments, under the banner of HarvardX.He describes the current online learning experiments as a "remarkable moment of possibility".And he sees the move towards more flexible and refined formats such as Spocs as an "almost inevitable evolution"."The Mooc represents just the first version of what we can do with online education," says Prof Lue. And this first version has now been overtaken. "We're already in a post-Mooc era.""What has become very clear is that the engagement you get from a very large group with a wide-ranging set of priorities can be radically different from what you get from a more focused group," says Prof Lue.It also paves the way to tackling one of the biggest problems for Moocs. How can they provide formally-recognised qualifications?The smaller class size will allow "much more rigorous assessment and greater validation of identity and that will be more closely tied to what kind of certification might be possible," he says."It's safe to say that in the quite near term there will be announcements of experiments in this area."There are voices of caution about over-hyped expectations for online learning.A report published last week by the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggested there remained many uncertainties over Moocs.The lack of a clear business model was described as a "burning issue".The edX project is in the fortunate position of being given $60m by Harvard and MIT, but few universities have the resources to give away so much expensively-produced content and staff time.Prof Lue suggests that the really tough questions raised by Moocs are not only about online learning but about what it means for the rest of the traditional campus."What is it that a student gets out of being on campus and being in the classroom?"If students on campus prefer learning online, what does it mean for the funding model for universities? What happens if a recorded online lecture is preferable to a mediocre live talk? How do universities show their "added value"?Prof Lue argues that the significance of Spocs is that online learning is now moving beyond trying to replicate classroom courses and is trying to produce something that is more flexible and more effective.Universities that ignore such developments, or think that Moocs can just be showreels for conventional courses, are putting themselves at risk, he suggests."The really big questions for university are about what students get from the classroom, what works, what could be done better.""Institutions that sit back and watch, they may be in trouble. One can imagine a large institution where there isn't much difference between online and classroom - and then you'd be silly not to realise there's a problem."</body>

      <title>UK enters online university race</title>
      <description>The UK's biggest online university project is being launched, with a partnership of more than 20 universities offering free courses.</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest online university project has been launched, with more than 20 universities offering free courses.Students will be able to follow courses on mobile phones as well as computers.The UK's project, called FutureLearn, sees UK universities entering the global market in so-called Moocs - massive open online courses.It could "revolutionise conventional models of formal education", says universities minister David Willetts.Mr Willetts, speaking at the British Library, said that the expansion of access to higher education was no longer necessarily about "bricks and mortar".He said that the FutureLearn partnership would help to serve the unmet demand for university courses, particularly overseas.The launch of FutureLearn sees 21 UK universities, plus Trinity College Dublin and Monash University in Australia, offering courses that are taught and assessed on the internet.The UK universities include Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham, Warwick, Bristol, Reading, Southampton and the Open University, which has headed the project.The British Library, British Museum and British Council will make material available to students.There are 20 short courses announced, with eight starting this year.In this experimental phase, students taking these courses will carry out multiple choice questions, without any formal qualifications.But universities are hoping that many people will be attracted by the chance to follow university-level courses without any travel or cost and at a time that suits them.It will also provide taster courses for youngsters considering their university options.When the University of Edinburgh offered Moocs through a US network it had more than 300,000 students signing up. The University of London international programme had more than 200,000 registrations.FutureLearn will see the UK taking a much bigger step into the rapidly expanding online university market - with claims that higher education is now facing its own online revolution.They are anticipating that each Mooc course will attract 20,000 students.Universities also see the project as a way of recruiting students to degree courses. Martin Bean, vice chancellor of the Open University, described it as a "digital storefront".But Mr Bean says he expects some universities to begin thinking about how to offer formal credits for Moocs.Reading University is going to offer a Mooc course about basic computer programming."Offering free taster courses online is a no-brainer," says David Bell, the university's vice-chancellor."Universities shouldn't be afraid to open up teaching and research, either in the UK or beyond. Learning never stops and as the economy's demand for higher skills rises, universities should be in the vanguard when it comes to providing new opportunities."Making courses accessible online, on mobiles and tablets means that people can fit their studying around their lives, rather than their lives around study."Southampton University is offering a course in web science, Leicester University's course looks at England at the time of Richard III and the University of Warwick has a psychology course.FutureLearn's chief executive Simon Nelson says it will offer a "fresh approach" with all its courses designed to work across all kinds of online platforms, so that a student could begin a course on a laptop at home and then continue on a mobile phone while commuting.He also promises a less isolated experience for students learning at home. He says that it can be a "solitary experience", but that FutureLearn will try to create a supportive online community, with "very strong social architecture".This will allow students to discuss their courses and ask questions, using social networking-style comment pages alongside the lesson content.This consortium will also draw upon the experience in distance learning of the Open University."Time and again we have seen the disruptive impact the internet can have on industries - driving innovation and enhancing the customer experience. I have no doubt Moocs will do the same for education," says Mr Bean.There were also suggestions from the Department for Education last week that Moocs could be used for vocational courses for students in further education colleges and sixth forms in England.Moocs have already had a major impact in the US, launching last year and spearheaded by alliances of top institutions, including Harvard, MIT and Stanford.Coursera, set up by Stanford academics in California and backed by venture capital, has signed up more than four million students in its first 18 months for courses provided by more than 80 universities.These projects have revealed a high level of demand for courses, but also exposed the difficulty in retaining students, with very high levels of drop-out rates.It has sparked a debate about the cost of higher education and what students are paying for when so much information and so many high-quality university materials are available online.These US online courses have begun to develop ways of giving students formal credits, such as students paying to take invigilated exams.Among the Mooc pioneers has been the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which set up the edX online platform with Harvard.On Tuesday, MIT announced a series of new online courses which will have an identity verification system using webcams and with plans for certification for courses.But there have also been questions asked about the long-term financial viability of online university courses.Last week, William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, challenged whether many universities could afford to invest in the type of free online courses offered by wealthy institutions such as Harvard and MIT.He suggested that online courses might work better as part of a "blended" course, where students spend some time together in the classroom as well as studying online.Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said that online universities represented an overdue technological advance."The models of higher education that marched triumphantly across the globe in the second half of the 20th Century require radical and urgent transformation. My fear is that the nature of change is incremental and the pace of change too slow."The establishment of FutureLearn represents an important step in realising this change and seizing the opportunities technology offers in creating a broader, deeper and more exciting education system."Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: "I encourage all our institutions to explore the opportunities offered by new modes of technology, such as Moocs. This will keep the UK ahead in the global race to deliver education in worldwide markets."</body>

      <title>Gordon Brown's Syrian refugee school plan</title>
      <description>Syria's refugee crisis is also threatening to become a long-term education disaster.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24034422</url>

      <body>Syria's refugee crisis is threatening to become a long-term education disaster. There will soon be 500,000 refugee children in Lebanon, with few having access to school. But Gordon Brown, former UK prime minister and UN special envoy for global education, says that lessons could be in place in weeks."A few days ago, global education campaigner Malala Yousafzai was able to speak over Skype to Zahra and Om Kolhtoum Katou, teenage Syrian twins exiled in Baalbeck in East Lebanon.As they talked, the three girls realised that they shared something in common. All three are victims of violence that threatened to destroy their youth and their future, and all three cannot do what most other girls and boys do every morning: leave the home in which they grew up and go to school.Now there is a plan that could help the biggest single group of Syrian child refugees - 300,000 of those exiled to Lebanon - which could see them in school and being fed within weeks.It has been prepared by Kevin Watkins of the Overseas Development Institute for the charity, A World at School, which campaigns to get an education for the millions of children without access to school.But this plan can only be put into practice - and this seems unlikely today - if the international community, which is financing just 2% of schooling needs in humanitarian crises, offers an additional $500m (£319m).The plan involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double or even triple shift system; hiring Syrian refugees as teachers in Arabic in community colleges; providing school meals to tackle hunger as we tackle illiteracy.This strategy is also rooted in the realistic presumption that the plight of the Syrian children is more than a short-term emergency: their exile could last years. It has the active support of the Lebanese government, but it is an open question as to whether the world community will put up the funds.Children are always the most neglected and forgotten victims of conflict. Already deprived of food and shelter, boys and girls are also denied their right to education, condemned to forfeit a childhood that, once lost, can never be re-run or re-lived.The one million Syrian children, who make up half of that country's refugees, are simply the most recent victims of this monumental gap in our global system. They are among 28 million children worldwide now being denied their right to schooling in conflict zones and under broken-down regimes.Soon small, unstable Lebanon will have absorbed 500,000 Syrian boys and girls. Already in just a few months, the refugees have grown in number to an astonishing 25% of Lebanon's child population.But today, and for the foreseeable future, there are school places for only a small fraction of them - just 30,000. If they suffer the typical exile of children in conflict they could spend 10 years in camps and without schooling.The traumas engulfing Syrian children underscores an enduring global failure. One hundred years ago, through support for the Red Cross, the world decided it would meet people's basic health needs, even in theatres of war.Forty years ago Médecins Sans Frontières established that healthcare should be available across the most dangerous and violent of war zones.Today, the concept of "Education Without Borders" still remains an unfamiliar idea, a concept yet to be built into our system of humanitarian relief.Yet the cost of inaction for young people deprived of an education, destroyed by anger, restlessness, and desperation and sentenced to tents and camps often for years, will haunt us for generations.Because these millions of young unemployed will become the adult unemployable, and many will graduate not into jobs but into violence.On 23 September in New York, organisations that have for years fought valiantly to deliver education in emergencies will build on pioneering work by UNICEF, UNHCR, UN Refugees and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) to bring to life the Education Without Borders initiative for Lebanon's Syrian refugees.In New York, young people from conflict zones around the world, joined by Malala and backed up by a petition presented to the UN Secretary General, will lead an appeal for funds.It will show that while we cannot do everything we can do something, that hope can survive even amid horror and that good can yet triumph over the worst evils, even in the most troubled and desperate parts of the world."</body>

      <title>Zombie apocalypse: The future of universities?</title>
      <description>A US university is going to create an online course based on the TV drama the Walking Dead.</description>

      <body>Can zombies be the stuff of serious academic study? And could they be shuffling towards a new type of future for higher education?In what is being claimed as the biggest ever experiment in "edutainment", a US television company is forming a partnership with a top-ranking Californian university to produce online courses linked to a hit TV show.This blurring of the digital boundaries between academic study and the entertainment industry will see a course being launched next month based on the post-apocalypse drama series the Walking Dead.Television shows might have spin-off video games or merchandising, but this drama about surviving disaster and social collapse is now going to have its own university course.Academics from the University of California, Irvine, who are setting up the online courses, say these will be academically rigorous and tackle serious scientific issues, related to events in the show.A physicist will look at the "science behind decay"; the public health department will use the series to study questions such as "What can we learn from past epidemics?" and maths lecturers will show how "post-calculus maths can be used to model population and epidemic dynamics".Showbiz lessonsThe show is made by AMC, which also produced cult series such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Killing, and AMC vice-president Theresa Beyer says this showbiz-academic partnership will create a "legitimate educational experience".She says AMC will be the "first entertainment group to make the foray into the online education arena" and wants the course to "drive a deep, sustained connection with the show".The TV series has an audience of 10 million and student numbers for the online course are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands. If this experiment proves successful, the online platform provider, Instructure, suggests there could be further TV show and university hybrids.It's not difficult to imagine an advertising course being built around a series such as Mad Men, suggests Josh Coates, Instructure's chief executive.This partnership also marks another development in the rapidly-expanding world of MOOCs - the massive open online courses - an acronym sufficiently established to have made it into the Oxford online dictionary last week.Millions of students have signed up for online courses in the past year, suggesting the scale of demand for higher education.And millions of students have failed to complete those courses suggesting the scale of the challenge of online learning.Dumbing down?This eight-module course will begin in mid-October and will be accessible without charge to anyone with an internet connection.There will be online tests and discussion groups, but students taking the course will not get any formal qualifications or credits towards a degree, so it's going to be for students who want to follow the course in their own time.But isn't there a risk of dumbing down? The University of California, Irvine, has Nobel prize-winning researchers, it contributes $4.3bn (£2.77bn; 3.3bn euro) to the local economy, does it want to have zombies on its prospectus?"When we entered this partnership it was really important to make each of the modules as academically strong as they would be in our classes at UC Irvine," says Melissa Loble, associate dean of distance learning at the university."The lessons will be academically rigorous and rich and still have connections to the show."Joanne Christopherson, social science lecturer, says that it's taking another step forward from how universities already use contemporary media examples."In all of my classes I have to bring in current issues to keep it interesting. Not just because they're young adults coming out of high school, but because it's important to make these classic theories relevant to them. What we're doing is using this series as an example through the whole course."Apocalypse studiesJosh Coates, head of Instructure, which provides the Canvas online platform, says it will present science and social science issues, using the hook of a TV show."This is real curriculum about infectious diseases, public health, nutrition, psychology and sociology. The fact that the context is this fictional world of an apocalypse is incidental.""This is very topical. We have terrorist attacks, we have Katrina, Fukushima, all these things happen in our world today, which create small vignettes of a local apocalypse. This is an opportunity to educate people about the science of these disasters."Mr Coates says a significant part of this experiment will be to see if it can crack one of the biggest weaknesses of MOOCs, the high drop-out rate. Will the pulling power of television keep people switched on to learning?"Can we get more students through because it's linked to a TV show they really like?" he says.He describes the link between the university and the TV industry as the "cross-pollination" that comes with the internet."The internet tears down walls of tradition and the isolation of different areas of research and interest," he says.Personal learningFor the university, it's a shop window putting their brand in front of a global audience. It also allows them to refine the process of putting courses online."The first MOOCs had great videos and great quizzes, but didn't help students really interact with one another," says Melissa Loble."The next step for MOOCs is to figure how to make them personal without it being overwhelming for the institution trying to deliver that."These are the type of practical questions that come with the huge numbers of online students.Dr Christopherson says that scale of the demand for MOOCs has been a "wake-up call" for universities.But it remains a challenge to provide an online structure that can allow so many students to follow a course without feeling anonymous and disconnected.William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, says there also remains a longer term question about the funding model for MOOCs.And he suggests that universities which have begun to invest in them might become wary at the extent of the drop-out rate.They might work better as part of a "blended" course, where there is a taught, classroom element as well as online study, he says.Spoiler alertAlan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, also has reservations about the value of TV-related online courses.Without formal assessment and personal content, he says it remains to be seen how this delivers more than a good television documentary."The student must be able to sift the evidence."For genuine learning, personal contact really matters," he says.Prof Smithers says such links with a popular TV show might work as a way of attracting students, but the academic element needs to outweigh the entertainment.But don't expect the march of the MOOCs to stop any time soon. And Mr Coates says he wants people to look back at the Walking Dead course as a watershed when education and entertainment connected.With the online course available globally and when different series are being shown at different stages in different countries, this could also be the first university course that has to come with its own spoiler alert.</body>

      <body>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most likely place to have studied.The Times Higher Education magazine ranked the universities attended by chief executive officers of Fortune Global 500 companies.There are four US universities in the top 10, with three from France, two from Japan and one from South Korea.The highest ranked UK university is Oxford in 21st place.This league table, described as the Alma Mater Index, shows which universities around the world taught the bosses of some of the world's biggest companies.One in 20 had a degree from a single institution, Harvard.This included Margaret C Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Jeffrey R Immelt of General Electric and Vittorio Colao of Vodafone.This academic powerhouse regularly appears at the top of university league tables, including the rich list, with an endowment worth $31bn (£20bn' 23.5bn euro).But the top 10 for producing business leaders does not contain all the usual names that appear at the top of university rankings.Oxford and Cambridge are absent, but the University of Pennsylvania in the US and Keio University in Japan are included, along with three French universities, headed by the Ecole Polytechnique.It means that in this top 10 cradles of global CEOs, there are two institutions from Paris, two from the Boston area and two from Tokyo.Across the top 100, universities from the US dominate, followed by universities in China, Japan, France and Germany. There are more CEOs who went to university in Asia than in Europe.In terms of national comparisons, UK universities produced the sixth highest number of global chief executives, with Oxford in 21st place and Cambridge in 45th place.But even though Harvard might have taught the biggest number of bosses from the top 500 companies, it was not attended by any of the heads of the biggest 10 companies, who were from a more diverse range of universities.Royal Dutch Shell is headed by a graduate of Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Wal-Mart is headed by a student of Georgia Tech and Exxon Mobil has a chief executive from the University of Texas, Austin.Three of the leaders of these biggest companies went to university in China and the head of Volkswagen went to university in Stuttgart.</body>

      <title>The scientists who escaped the Nazis</title>
      <description>A first-hand memory of the scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23261289</url>
      <date>1374016582</date>
      <body>When Gustav Born's family were advised in early 1933 that it was time to leave Nazi-controlled Germany, it was from a good authority.The advice was from Albert Einstein, who told his friend and fellow scientist Max Born to "leave immediately" with his family while they were still able to travel.They packed their bags and headed across the border, first to Italy and then to England, where they arrived as part of what must have been the best-qualified refugee trail in history.Gustav Born was 11 at the time, living in Gottingen, Lower Saxony, where his father, Max, was director of one of the world's leading centres for physics research.The Borns were Jewish, and when Hitler took power, Max Born and his Jewish colleagues were prevented from working at the university. This pioneering, elite group of theoretical scientists were turned into asylum seekers.Gustav now lives in London, a few days short of his 92nd birthday, and he looks back with great clarity on the remarkable flight of these German academics. The conversation is like opening a 1930s Mitteleuropa time capsule.He is now one of the last living links to these academic refugees, who between them went on to win 16 Nobel prizes - his father received the award for his work in quantum mechanics.Did these scientists realise the extent of the threat from the Nazis?"Yes, I think my father probably did. Among his Jewish colleagues, some did, but some didn't believe for some time. But the scale of what the Nazis were doing became apparent in the first three to six months."Gustav remembers that the ugly mood of anti-Semitism had even reached the playground, with some children not allowed to play with him.There were also positive examples of human nature, such as the academics who stood by their Jewish colleagues. The Nobel prize winner Max von Laue showed great support, says Gustav.The physicist Max Planck went to see Hitler in person to challenge the exclusion of Jewish scientists, but Hitler "foamed at the mouth and wouldn't let him talk any more".It was still tough to leave. Max Born had to give up running an institute, his wife was heartbroken at the prospect of emigrating."They hated to be uprooted in this crude and dangerous way."When the Borns left, they were not under any illusions that this would be a temporary departure. "Nazification" was happening rapidly and there were political murders."My parents were pretty sure this was a one-way journey."While the Borns were watching the swastikas appearing in Gottingen, a much more tweedily humanitarian response was being marshalled by university staff in Britain.The economist William Beveridge had set up the Academic Assistance Council, with the aim of rescuing Jewish and politically vulnerable academics.It was an organisation that would help 1,500 academics escape Germany and continue their research work in safety in Britain.It was quickly backed by academics whose names now read like a row of text books - J B S Haldane, John Maynard Keynes, Ernest Rutherford, G M Trevelyan and the poet A E Housman.Albert Einstein supported this high-brow escape committee with a highly-charged speech in the Albert Hall in London in October 1933.He set out an epic defence of Western liberal values of "tolerance and justice" against the "temptations of hatred and oppression", at a time of deepening extremism and economic and political turmoil."It is in times of economic distress such as we experience everywhere today, one sees very clearly the strength of the moral forces that live in a people."He told his audience that it was "the liberty of the individual that has brought us every advance of knowledge and invention - liberty without which life to a self-respecting man is not worth living".The council launched its "rescue operation", arranging for academics to come to Britain and providing practical support in the form of grants, accommodation and most importantly jobs.This was a remarkably talented group being cast aside by the Nazis. As well as the trawl of Nobel prizes, there were 18 future knighthoods and over 100 fellows of the Royal Society or British Academy.According to the Association of Jewish Refugees there were about 70,000 Jewish refugees who came to Britain before the outbreak of war in 1939.Max Born and his family went first to Cambridge and then to Edinburgh University. He paid his way by writing a science text book that became a school standard.There were others who moved on to the United States. Mathematician Richard Courant went to New York where one of the foremost centres for applied maths, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is named after him.Losing such intellectual powerhouses was a self-inflicted wound for the Nazi war effort.In the race to develop atomic weapons, German refugees played a key role in making sure that it was the United States that won.Even though Max Born refused on moral grounds to work on atomic weapons research, Robert Oppenheimer, the US-born "father of the atomic bomb", had been Born's PhD student at Gottingen.There were signs at one stage that the Nazis might have realised their mistake.In 1934, Max Born and his family were visited in Cambridge by Werner Heisenberg, another Nobel prize winner and old colleague who had continued working at Gottingen.Heisenberg brought a message from the Nazi government inviting Max Born to return to continue his scientific work in Germany. The invitation left Born "beside himself with fury", his son recalls.But Max Born and his wife did eventually go back to Germany, after the war was over and after he had retired. He died there in 1970 and is buried in the same cemetery in Gottingen as Max Planck and Max von Laue.Gustav, who became a professor of pharmacology at King's College London, says that his parents were committed to trying to rebuild Germany in a way that would prevent the return of such political extremism.What lessons should be learned from all this?Gustav Born remains a strong supporter of the campaign to rescue academics, which is now marking its 80th year.It has become the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara) and its current chair, Anne Lonsdale, says that after 80 years the organisation "would love to be out of a job", but the problems in Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq and Syria mean that academics still need help in places where "civil society no longer functions".There is an "urgent need for scholars from across the Middle East to get to exile in a place of safety", she said.The stories of refugees from the Nazis, with grainy photos of faces with lines like old railway maps of Europe, might seem like something from a lost world.But Gustav Born says that Cara's ongoing work shows that it is as relevant as ever. It is also a reminder not to make hasty judgements about refugees and what they might be able to achieve.His descriptions of that academic world of the 1930s are also a last glimpse of a highly cultured society. His father, remembered for his science research, played Bach on the piano every day. These were internationalists, their ideas and research moving across national and political boundaries.Such a world proved fragile in the face of the Nazis. And Gustav Born says people can too often overlook that Germany had still been a young country in the 1930s, little more than 60 years old, and that it hadn't built the institutions able to resist its own "militaristic and nationalistic" tendencies.He is very much aware that he is now one of the few remaining people who can talk first-hand about such a legacy."I'm sad that it almost ends with me."I want them not to forget that things like this, the suppression of a country by a gang of murderous crooks and the victimisation of people of good nature and good intention, it could happen again."</body>

      <body>The tinderbox mix of high youth unemployment, lack of education and the threat of extremism is turning access to school into a "security issue", says Irina Bokova, director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation.The volatile prospect of millions of uneducated, illiterate youngsters in developing countries, under pressure from the financial downturn, has brought an unprecedented political significance to the campaign to give every child a primary school education, she says.Ms Bokova was speaking ahead of a speech later this week at the United Nations from Malala Yousafzai, who will call for all children to have the right to go to school.The Pakistani schoolgirl, who will make her speech in New York on her 16th birthday, defied the bullets of the Taliban in defence of her right to an education.But behind the optimism of Malala's campaign and the creation of an annual "Malala Day" is a much more complex global story, with failure as well as success.In 2000, in the warm glow of a new millennium, world leaders pledged that universal primary education would be achieved by 2015. No child would miss out on the basics of schooling.After an initial surge, progress stalled and achieving the target in the next 18 months now seems unlikely."By 2015, it's impossible," says Ms Bokova, the Paris-based head of Unesco.But she says that rather than being a cause of pessimism, the pursuit of the target has brought "huge progress". There were 108 million children out of school when the pledge was made; the most recent figures suggest this has fallen to 57 million."If the right strategies are in place, and you put your head where your heart is, then things can be improved. In Afghanistan in 2000 only 4% of girls were in school, now there are more than 70%."Ms Bokova says that another positive outcome has been a much stronger recognition of the importance of measuring the quality of education, rather than simply counting heads going into a classroom.Among the more sobering discoveries has been that many pupils have spent years in school but remained functionally illiterate.So in the autumn, Unesco is planning to produce a new set of global metrics to measure what's actually being learned in primary classrooms around the world. "It will give a global understanding of what quality education means," says Ms Bokova.It remains unclear whether there will be more targets after 2015, but anything that emerges will be more about quality of education, rather than simply volume of places.Ms Bokova says the financial crisis delivered a major blow to achieving the goal of universal primary education. Donor countries pulled the plug and left an "alarming gap" in funding.In sub-Saharan Africa there remains a shortage of 1.7 million teachers.But despite this gloom, she says that the financial crisis has given education a "paradoxical" political importance.Youth unemployment is a major threat in many countries and education and training are seen as vital investments."Education is now becoming in some cases a security issue," she says, with examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq and across the Middle East, where there is huge pressure to provide education to promote stability and democracy and to avoid extremism."The same is true of big emerging powers. In Brazil, the government recognises that the education system is one of the biggest challenges as it moves forward to a competitive economy and an inclusive society."The social tensions of deepening inequality and a lack of social mobility are also shaped by decisions about education systems, she says.Economic and political stability are now inextricably linked to improving education, says the Bulgarian-born Unesco director general."Education is becoming the key issue now in discussions about overcoming the economic crisis."But how are we going to make this happen? Budgets and international aid are shrinking."We try to convince countries that if they want to invest in coming out of the crisis, then invest in education."Another barrier to getting all children to school is a lack of fair access, particularly for girls.Ms Bokova says it's not acceptable for countries to hide behind ideas of "cultural differences" or "tradition" as a reason for discriminating against girls.Malala Yousafzai has become a powerful emblem."One event can spark a huge reaction and understanding and I think it was the case with Malala," she says."It was a stunning example of courage and a desire to learn."And she says that getting more girls into school is the single most important goal."It's not just a human right, it's what is needed to have normal societies. If a girl goes to school, she is less likely to have an early marriage, she will have healthier children, she'll find it easier to earn an income, she's less likely to be subjected to violence, less likely to have an early pregnancy."There are so many advantages, healthier communities, less violence, more economic growth. It has such an incredible multiplying effect."This is the best thing that could happen to humanity."The pledge for education for all has also highlighted where the problem is most acute.A meeting organised by the UN in April brought together eight countries - Bangladesh, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen - which between them have about half the children in the world who are missing out on school.It was an unprecedented attempt to systematically work out what has been going wrong.A minister from the DR Congo said that about 60% of those missing out on school did so because of the cost of school fees with the other 40% blamed on armed conflict.In Ethiopia the problem was identified as being focused on rural communities and lack of access for girls. In South Sudan it was a lack of trained teachers and a low level of school participation among girls.In Nigeria, which has the most children out of school, the difficulty was not necessarily about money, but was caused by low participation among girls in some areas and problems with "infrastructure" about providing teachers. Weaknesses in state authorities delivering the plans of the national government were also blamed.The country has also seen brutal attacks on schools. Secondary schools in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe were ordered to close this week after a massacre in which suspected Islamist extremists killed 22 students.Ms Bokova says that there is now a willingness among such countries to recognise what needs to be changed.Despite the failure to make the 2015 deadline, she says the attempt has shown the international community what can be achieved. Countries such as India and Ethiopia have taken substantial steps forward.This has disproved the feeling that "education is too complex, too costly and it takes too long to show results".But there is no escaping the harsh truth that millions of children, born a decade after the world promised universal primary education, still won't have even the most basic access to school.It's been possible to launch hundreds of satellites and put a spacecraft on Mars, but not to put children into classrooms a few hours south of Heathrow."In many cases we have failed, but it shouldn't discourage us. We're winning the argument."</body>

      <title>Pupils breakfasting on energy drinks</title>
      <description>A survey suggests one in 20 teenage pupils goes to school on a can of energy drink instead of a good breakfast.</description>

      <body>One in 20 teenage pupils goes to school on a can of energy drink instead of a good breakfast, a survey suggests.A third of UK teenagers eat unhealthy breakfasts such as fry-ups or crisps, the poll of 2,000 youngsters aged between 12 and 18 suggests.Four out of 10 skip breakfast altogether to lose weight, the poll for the Make Mine Milk campaign suggests.Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the results were a worry.He said pupils breakfasting on energy drinks, which are not usually recommended for children, was something he had seen as a head teacher."When children arrive in schools having started the day eating or drinking totally inappropriate things like that, they are in no fit state to be in the classroom."They can be hyperactive, and it can have a very negative effect on their behaviour."He added that parents should be ensuring that their children were eating good breakfasts, rather than sending them off with money to buy something on the way to school.He added: "There's a lot of advertising with these drinks and they are fashionable, and teenagers love things that are fashionable."Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL), also said it was vital that children had a good and nutritious breakfast to set them up for the day and enable them to concentrate in class."A healthy breakfast is also important in stopping children become fractious and badly behaved."It is worrying to think that some children are breakfasting on energy drinks, such as Red Bull, which are stuffed full of sugar and stimulants and have little nutritional value."School breakfast clubs can play a key role in making sure children have had a good breakfast before they start school to help their learning. And we would like children to be taught about healthy eating, so they learn about healthy diets and how to cook nutritious meals."Caffeine content in such energy drinks ranges from about 8mg of caffeine - about the same as an espresso coffee - to as much as 400mg.Some of the smaller "shot style" products can contain as much as 175mg of caffeine in a 60ml bottle.Drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre (mg/l) must be labelled with the term "high caffeine content", and the Food Standards Agency recommends that children should only "consume in moderation drinks with high levels of caffeine".The makers of the Red Bull Energy Drink did not wish to comment on the issue raised but its website says: "Red Bull Energy Drink's special formula has been appreciated worldwide by top athletes, students, and when undertaking demanding work or during long drives."It adds the drink is "the ideal equipment when you are active and keen to set personal bests".Director general of the British Soft Drinks Association Gavin Partington said: "The soft drinks industry is clear that energy drinks are not suitable for children, and we want to get that message across to young people and their parents."Adults might choose an energy drink, containing about as much caffeine as a typical cup of coffee, when they want a physical or mental boost. But, like all food and drink, energy drinks should be consumed in moderation as part of a balanced diet and active lifestyle."</body>

      <title>'Childhood damaged' by over-testing</title>
      <description>Too much testing in schools risks damaging the "quality of childhood", claim academics and writers, including poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy.</description>

      <body>Children in England's schools are being damaged by a culture of "incessant testing", says a group of academics and writers, including poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy.They have written to the Times, warning that changes to the curriculum and targets are harmful for children.The letter warns of "devastating consequences" for childhood.A Department for Education spokesman said schools now had greater "freedom to innovate and inspire".The letter, with 198 signatories, argues that the increasing pressure to improve test results will create a narrowing education for children, with teachers put in a "strait jacket" of targets.The academics and writers call for a consensus among teachers, parents and politicians about the "future of education"."Competition between children through incessant testing and labelling results is a public sense of failure for the vast majority," says the letter to the Times."The drive towards ever-higher attainment in national tests leads inevitably to teaching to the test, which narrows the range of learning experiences."Harmful stress is put on young people, their parents and their teachers."These damaging developments must stop. If they go ahead, there will be devastating consequences for children's mental health, for future opportunities and, most importantly, for the quality of childhood itself."The theme of getting the balance right between academic testing and children's well-being was also raised by Tim Hands, chairman of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), which is holding its annual conference.Mr Hands, speaking on Monday, criticised political interference in education - "the long interfering arm and dead restraining hand of government" - and said that the "principles of commercial accountability" had been applied to schools in a way that was "flawed"."The story of the last 50 years is the intrusion of government and the disappearance of the child. More radically put, it is by extension the intrusion of the state, and the disappearance of love," said Mr Hands.Education Secretary Michael Gove is to address the Conservative party conference on Tuesday.And a spokesman for the education department defended school reforms as raising standards and giving more freedoms to heads and teachers."Our rigorous new curriculum, demanding GCSEs and high-quality A-levels involving universities will raise academic standards for all children."The new TechBacc means young people more suited to a vocational route will again be able to take courses we know lead to good jobs and skilled trades."Teachers now have more power than ever before to ensure discipline in the classroom."And thousands of brilliant heads and teachers now have the freedom to innovate and inspire thanks to our academies and free schools programmes."</body>

      <title>Parents 'too guilty to go private'</title>
      <description>An elite private schools leader says parents are made to feel it is morally unacceptable to pay for an education.</description>

      <body>Parents are made to feel it is morally unacceptable to pay for an education, says a private schools leader.HMC chairman Tim Hands said there was an "illogicality" about families buying a house near a good school but not being willing to pay school fees.Parents clearly felt it was more morally acceptable to buy an expensive car or holiday, the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference heard.Average fees in UK private schools are £14,000 a year.For boarders it tops £27,600 a year - more than the average yearly wage in England.Michael Pyke, a spokesman for the Campaign for State Education, said: "It's inevitable that parents will try to seek advantages for their own children and there is no point anybody arguing the reverse."If we want a fairer education system it has to be brought about by political means."But Mr Hands said parents were making illogical choices and that private schools, such as those in his association, were wrongly attacked for restricting social mobility because of the fees they charged.He stressed that 36% of pupils in HMC schools across the UK received help with their fees.And he told heads at the group's annual meeting in London: "Tony Blair, opening a London Academy in 2005, talked of the different ways in which parents could transform their child's education."Examples included moving house in order to access a better school and employing a personal tutor - one quarter of all parents in London pay for private tuition in the course of their child's school career."Moral opprobrium attached to neither of these, though the latter is of course paying for a private education, and the former is not social but postcode mobility, potentially productive of social division."He added: "Making the journey to independent education, parents are currently made to feel, is an unacceptable mobility - expenditure on purchase of a car, holiday or house is moral; expenditure on the education of the child is not. The illogicality is clear."Speaking to reporters ahead of the conference, Mr Hands, said he felt that "over the decades parents have come to feel more bothered about the concept of private education and that has been politically encouraged".He highlighted how both Tony Blair and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg had sent their children to the London Oratory - a high-achieving Catholic state school in Brompton, south-west London with a reported 6% of pupils eligible for free school meals.And he compared this with Christ's Hospital School, in West Sussex, where he said 88% of pupils were on means-tested bursaries and almost half of pupils paid 10% of full fees.</body>

      <title>Teachers 'may like performance pay'</title>
      <description>Teachers could be won over to performance related pay but need reassurance about its fairness and efficiency, claims a right-leaning think tank.</description>

      <body>Teachers in England and Wales could be won over to performance-related pay but need reassurance about its fairness and efficiency, a think tank claims.The right-leaning Policy Exchange has published a poll of teachers on the eve of regional strikes over pay, conditions and pensions.Members of the NUT and NASUWT unions will strike on Tuesday in the Midlands, East of England, Yorkshire and Humber.Teaching unions said the survey detail did not support Policy Exchange's view.Performance-related pay (PRP) came into force for teachers in England's schools this term, giving heads more flexibility over salaries.Unions say the changes are really about cutting most teachers' salaries and most parents want schools to follow a national pay system.But Jonathan Simons, head of education at Policy Exchange, claims the poll suggests "that teachers could easily be won round to the idea of performance-related pay but more needs to be done to explain how the system would work".Pollsters YouGov questioned a weighted sample of more than 1,000 teachers in England and Wales.The main question on performance-related pay received a broadly negative response from teachers, with only 16% saying they would like to work in a school where pay was "more explicitly linked" to their overall performance, 40% saying they would not and 44% that it would make no difference.However, Policy Exchange claims that answers to other questions may indicate the possibility of a change of heart if teachers could be convinced that performance-related pay would lead to less paperwork.Some 55% said they would be more likely to want to work in a school with performance-related pay "if it also resulted in a reduction in your administrative, reporting and bureaucratic workload".Some 12% said they were less likely to want to work in such a school, while 33% said it would make no difference.Teachers said they spent an average of more than 48 minutes a week on reporting their own performance, with over half (54%) saying it was the least valuable use of their time.Some (79%) complained of too much bureaucracy, target-setting and inspection.Christine Blower, of the NUT, said the survey showed that "a clear majority of teachers are far more concerned about workload than any apparent benefits of performance-related pay."According to this survey, only 2% said that it would make them significantly more likely to want to work in a school where pay was more explicitly linked to overall performance."Far more said it would make them less likely. Even under the proposal of PRP being offered in return for an imagined reduction in bureaucratic workload, only 13% said that it would make them significantly more interested in working in a school with PRP."Yet in many schools the introduction of PRP will lead to a much greater bureaucratic workload as head teachers introduce new forms and evidence gathering."Teachers work in a collaborative fashion. Young people's success depends on the interplay between the work of all their teachers."There is also every scope in linking pay to performance for the creation of unfairness."Policy Exchange said the poll also suggested that most teachers (60%) were against pay being driven by years of experience in the profession, preferring measures such as students' progress (66%) and teaching quality (89%).A third of those polled said they were dissatisfied at having to work with lower-performing colleagues, while more than half (52%) said performance pay would make it easier to dismiss poor teachers.Mr Simons said: "Policymakers should make huge efforts to talk to teachers up and down the country, even if that means bypassing their union leaders, and answer any questions they might have about the new system."</body>

      <title>UK A&amp;Es seeing 'drunk children'</title>
      <description>Nearly 300 children aged 11 or under were admitted to A&amp;E units across the UK last year after drinking too much, a BBC Radio 5 live investigation has found.</description>

      <body>Nearly 300 children aged 11 or under were admitted to AandE units across the UK last year after drinking too much, a BBC Radio 5 live investigation shows.Revealing UK-wide data for the first time, it said a total of 6,500 under-18s were admitted in 2012-13.Charities and public health bodies say fewer children are drinking overall, but those who do may be drinking more.The five years of data comes from Freedom of Information requests to 125 of the 189 UK NHS organisations.Prof Ian Gilmore, chairman of the UK Alcohol Health Alliance, told the BBC: "I think in under-11s, it's mainly experimenting, but I think we see children in the 11 to 16-year-old range who are beginning to drink regularly."He added: "There are some encouraging signs in that the numbers of under-18s drinking is probably falling, but those that are drinking are probably drinking earlier and drinking more heavily, so we certainly can't be complacent."Over the last five years AandE departments across the UK have dealt with nearly 48,000 incidents where under-18s have been admitted for drink or drug related illnesses.During 2012/13 there were 293 cases of children aged 11 or under attending AandE with alcohol-related conditions - a third more than in 2011/12 when there were 216 cases.Among teens, more girls than boys are now being admitted, a reversal of the past trend.Ayrshire and Arran Health Board dealt with the highest number of cases last year - with 483 alcohol-related attendances.Morten Draegebo, an AandE consultant at Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock, said children were exposing themselves to significant danger.He said: "The typical patient may be found in a field. They often need to hide away from any sort of adults in the area so they're picked up by the ambulance service."They have difficulty locating where they are because the description comes through from a distressed half-drunk teenager potentially saying that they're under a tree somewhere in a large park."Eventually they're found but even in summer-time in Scotland they're vaguely hypothermic."They have vomited. The vomit may go down the wrong way into the lungs. They are unable to defend themselves even from assault."Dr Draegebo added: "We have had many cases where teenage, young teenage females have come in saying that they may have been sexually assaulted and they're that intoxicated and are distressed and say, 'I may have been', but they don't even know if they have been or not."On a humane level that is very distressing. I'm a parent, I would hate for that to happen to my daughter."Elaine Hindal, chief executive of Drinkaware, said the incidence of drunkenness among under-11s was "really alarming" and parents must be vigilant."It's really unlikely that children are buying alcohol. When children talk to us in our research, they tell us they get alcohol from home, primarily from their parents and from friends," she said."But parents need to simply be aware of the dangers of drinking, particularly with younger children. Their bodies can't take it, they're more at risk of alcoholic poisoning, they are more likely to be a victim of alcohol-related violence."Across the UK, experts agree that fewer children are drinking now than several years ago, but say the amount being consumed by those underage has stayed the same - suggesting those who do drink are consuming more.Public Health England says one in four underage drinkers consumes more than 15 units a week - the equivalent of seven pints of lager.The official advice from the chief medical officers across the UK is that no children should be given alcohol until they are 16, and alcohol should only be given to older teenagers under supervision of a carer or parent, and never on more than one day a week.A Department of Health England spokesman said: "We know that fewer young people are drinking and being admitted to hospital as a result."But with more than one million alcohol-related hospital admissions overall in the last year we know too many people are drinking too much and that alcohol places a heavy burden on the NHS, costing around £3.5bn every year.

      <title>Library visits drop as cuts bite</title>
      <description>The number of people visiting public libraries in the UK has dropped by a quarter in the past eight years, according to a government survey.</description>

      <body>The number of people visiting public libraries in the UK has dropped by a quarter in the past eight years, according to a government survey.The proportion of adults using libraries has fallen from 48% to 36% since 2005, according to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS).The drop comes as some councils shut branches in an attempt to save money.Around 350 libraries are thought to have shut since April or be at risk, according to Public Libraries News.But cities including Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester have had major schemes to open or refurbish their central libraries.The decrease in library visitors has been a relatively steady trend since the DCMS' annual Taking Part survey began in 2005.The drop has been seen in all parts of the UK and all age groups, the survey found.The Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (Cilip) said the figures were "deeply disappointing".Cilip chief executive Annie Mauger pointed out reductions in staff numbers, spending and opening hours that had been felt over the past few years."Local authorities have had to make tough choices, but libraries are under pressure and cuts to services will mean that visits drop," she said.The body, which represents library workers, called for "stronger political leadership that supports a clear national vision to provide high quality, relevant and well used library services in communities across the country".The figures come days after Cilip passed a vote of no confidence in culture minister Ed Vaizey for his "failures" to intervene on library closures.In a speech in March, Mr Vaizey insisted libraries were not in crisis, saying: "I'm delighted our library service continues to thrive and modernise."Referring to the survey results, a DCMS spokesman said libraries were "still hugely important", with 4.5 million visits per week."Local authorities, of course, are best placed to decide the scale and nature of the services they provide, based on local needs," he said."But it is crucial that they understand what important resources library services are, and adapt and develop services to meet people's expectations in our rapidly changing world."There are great examples of innovation and creativity in the delivery of library services, and we want to see more local authorities doing that."Cllr Flick Rea of the Local Government Association said fewer than 5% of libraries had closed and councils were "working hard to innovate and re-design them" for the future."What is clear is that government can't keep reducing funding and expect councils to be able to keep protecting popular library services in this way," Cllr Rea said."Any further cuts would certainly result in widespread library service closures and stop this positive work in its tracks."Other figures from the survey showed that the proportion of adults visiting museums or art galleries had risen from 42% to 53% since 2005.The East Midlands and north of England have shown the biggest rises in people watching or taking part in the arts, the survey found.Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the overall figures "show once again just how important the nation's arts and culture are to people".</body>

      <title>Call for child mental health checks</title>
      <description>Children as young as seven should be tested in school for their mental health, a Cambridge academic has said.</description>

      <body>Children as young as seven should be tested in school for their mental health, a Cambridge academic has said.In an article for the British Medical Journal, Simon Nicholas Williams argues that screening pupils at that age would mean problems could be diagnosed and treated earlier.Heads say it is an "interesting idea".Mr Williams, from the university's Institute of Public Health, said three-quarters of adult mental disorders were "extensions of juvenile disorders"."If left untreated, these can lead to more serious social and economic problems in adolescence and adulthood, related to crime, unemployment, and suicide, for example," he wrote.He said early intervention and prevention of mental health problems should be aimed at young people."Introducing mental health screening in schools could enable early diagnosis and treatment of childhood mental health problems and therefore reduce many of the costs associated with adolescent and adult mental health problems," he wrote.He said mental health problems cost the UK an estimated £105bn a year."Physical health checks have been done in schools for more than a century, so why not mental health checks?", he added.Russell Hobby, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), which represents most primary heads, said the idea was an interesting one.But any such scheme would have to be carefully handled, he said, with the checks carried out by experts."I think we should be checking children for much more than whether they have mastered phonics," he said."The evidence suggests that the earlier we start checking people, the better. But schools themselves are not qualified to do this and health professionals would have to be involved."Mr Hobby added: "We would have to be quite careful about any labels and stigma attached to this. It would have to be done in a sensitive fashion."But Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said the idea was a "further reflection of the growing intrusion into our lives of the nanny state"."Children, parents and schools should be trusted. This new initiative is as likely to cause children and parents anxiety and stress as it is to help anyone," he said."Good schools, with high aspirations, inspirational teachers and a broad curriculum, will do far more to support children who may be vulnerable to mental health issues than a screening programme that will, inevitably focus on introspection and the looking for problems where none exist. God help the poor children if this latest initiative gains ground."In his article, Simon Williams said the "stigma associated with a mental health diagnosis is likely a deterrent, particularly for parents", as well as the financial costs involved."However, a programme in which all children are screened, rather than just those who are traditionally deemed at risk, would likely have a de-stigmatising effect," he said."Although many mental health disorders are more common among children from lower socio-economic groups, others, such as anxiety disorders, are just as common, if not more common, among children from higher socio-economic groups."He said such screening could be carried out in groups "cheaply", at an estimated cost of £27 per child, amounting to £18.5 million for all of the UK's seven-year-olds.Lucie Russell, from the Young Minds charity, said mental health screening was a good idea if there was good support for children "with emerging mental health problems", but current provision was "patchy"."Screening as part of early intervention is theoretically a positive step forward, but it must be backed up with comprehensive support and treatment for any identified children and their families," she said.</body>

      <body>Nearly 4,000 children in England were adopted from care in the year to March.The latest statistics from the government show an increase of 15% compared with the year before, and ministers say it is a record.The government has a drive to increase the number of children adopted, saying a child's life-chances are greatly improved if they are in a stable permanent home.Children's Minister Edward Timpson said the rise was "hugely encouraging".Between April 2012 and March 2013, 3,980 children were adopted, up from 3,470 the previous year.Officials say the figure is higher than in any year since 1992, when comparable records began.Councils are now being compared against each other in league tables showing how many children are in care and how many have been adopted.There are many supporters of the drive, but some have warned that adoption is not always the best option, and that other schemes such as children being looked after by members of the wider family group, should not be over-looked.The statistics show a continued increase in the number of children being taken in to care.In total, there were 68,110 children in care in England in March this year - a 2% rise on the same time last year and 12% up on March 2009.That trend began following the death of Peter Connelly, who was 17 months old when he died after months of abuse in 2007.Social workers were criticised for leaving the toddler with his mother and partner despite serious concerns.The pair and another man were jailed over his death.Children's minister Edward Timpson said: "It is hugely encouraging that the number of children adopted from care has risen to the highest level yet - but too many children are still waiting too long for stable, loving homes."More needs to be done to recruit adoptive parents."Of the children in care in March, 75% (nearly 51,000) were being fostered.Local councils have said they are playing their part in increasing adoption rates, but complain too many cases are held up by bureaucracy and delays in the legal system.The government is pressing local authorities to do more, saying adoption should be considered as an option for more children and encouraging them to place babies with foster families who want to go to adopt them, so that there is less upheaval.David Simmonds, from the Local Government Association, said: "It is heartening to see this record increase in the number of children being placed in loving homes. Councils have been working hard to recruit more adoptive mums and dads and are doing everything in their power to ensure that vulnerable children get the best start in life."We know that there is still much more to be done, and it will be vital that government works with local authorities and not against us."It has been estimated that about one in five adoptions breaks down, although the government's adviser Sir Martin Narey says the figure is probably "half that".No national official figures are published for this.</body>

      <title>Freshers' fun? Not for the cleaners</title>
      <description>Fun for students but not the university cleaners</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24275092</url>
      <date>1380759129</date>
      <body>Students are returning for the new university term. There will be parties, long beery nights and bleary late mornings. It's the binge-fest of freshers' week.But for cleaners at one London university, it is the "worst week of the year" when there is "double work".The students and the cleaners share the university campus; they both work here, but to very different timetables. The cleaners are on the way to work before some of the students will be on the way home.University cleaners start work from 04:00, travelling through the dark streets on buses from the edges of the capital.Mostly Spanish speakers from South and Central America, many will have begun their journey more than an hour earlier.While the new term means freshers' parties for students, there's a different kind of freshening going on for the cleaners.They will have cleaned the toilets, emptied the bins, swept the floor, wiped the desks, while the students and their teachers will have been asleep. It's a double life for this university.As the first students begin to come through the doors in the morning, holding on to their textbooks and takeaway coffees, the cleaners have already finished their shifts.But they haven't finished working. Many will have multiple jobs, a few hours at a time, criss-crossing London by bus because the Tube fares are too expensive and they're not paid for the travelling in between.One university cleaner, who wants to remain anonymous, describes his daily timetable and gives his perspective on university life.He leaves his home at 03:00 for the first of three cleaning jobs. He works shifts from 04:00 - 06:00 and then 06:00 - 16:30 in central London and then finishes with a two-hour shift in south London, between 17:30 and 19:30.Then he goes home to his three children and gets ready to start work again the next morning.He works five days a week, but he says he has colleagues who work like this six or seven days a week."Sometimes I don't want to wake up. But I can't afford to miss a single day."It's dirty. People leave their rubbish on the floor. You think they would appreciate you, but you get into the lift and they turn away from you."That affects me. When you're trying to clean the toilets, people get cross. There's a lack of respect - it's very hard."Is it because we're cleaners? Because we're foreigners and we don't speak the language?"It's easy for families to break up, he says. Children without parents around can get into trouble. With no spare cash, people have to borrow and quickly get into high-interest borrowing. Long hours are worked to pay high London rents.And before making any assumptions about who gets caught up in this cycle, he says he works alongside cleaners who in their own countries had been a lawyer, a psychologist and a teacher. He is a graduate himself, before coming to the UK more than a decade ago.What's the worst part of cleaning?He says it's the toilets. And he can't understand how people can leave the bathrooms in such a bad way.Just as crushing is the sense of not being valued, particularly in an educational institution, where students debate ideas of equality, labour rights and social justice."I thought people would behave well, they would have courtesy, good manners."Instead, he says, even when he has been taking out a bin from below someone's desk they've refused to acknowledge him.These might be corridors of learning. But someone still has to clean them.Not speaking much English, competing at the most precarious end of the temporary labour market, cleaners are vulnerable to being exploited. It's part of the reason that he doesn't want to be identified.A previous contractor owed the cleaners money for three months, he says.They can't take their concerns to the university, because they work for an international outsourcing company. And there have been long-running campaigns over pay and conditions.But without being part of the university staff, the cleaners still share the same buildings, a parallel set of footsteps in the libraries, the lecture halls, the classrooms, unseen during the hours before dawn.He says they see the photos of families on the desks each day, they prepare the rooms. Without any sign of self-pity, he says: "Some of these tables are cleaned with tears."It's a tale of two cities invisible to one another.</body>

      <title>Greece crisis: Inside the student-occupied schools</title>
      <description>Angry Greek students taking over their classrooms</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24332586</url>
      <date>1380610490</date>
      <body>Drastic public spending cuts in Greece are having severe consequences for public services including education. With teachers and students now taking direct action, some universities are warning that a whole semester could be written off.Last Monday was no ordinary school day for 17-year-old Enea Tola.At 06:00, Enea and several other senior students climbed the fence of their school and locked the doors. They informed the principal that the students had taken over the school in central Thessaloniki, Greece's second city.On the same day, hundreds of students across the country were staging or preparing to stage their own school takeovers.By the end of last week, more than 100 high schools in Greece had been occupied.The students took the baton from teachers, who had begun rolling strikes only a few days after the school year began.Teachers were protesting against the lay-offs and forced job transfers that are part of Greece's bailout agreement with international lenders.After two weeks the strikes ended and students stepped in."Our main goal is to demonstrate our solidarity with our teachers, who could not go on striking indefinitely," says Enea."It is the only way to make ourselves heard."At Enea's school, no outsiders are allowed to enter the premises. Some students guard the main entrance, while 10 to 15 others spend the night there, turning their desks into beds.In one classroom, a girl is diligently sweeping the floor."You came on cleaning day. We don't want to vindicate those accusing us of vandalising our schools," says Enea, the son of Albanian immigrants, who moved to Greece when he was four years old."We have been severely affected by the crisis. Last year many of our friends fainted from malnutrition. We cannot sit in silence."Illegal in theory, school takeovers are tolerated by the authorities.Across the street from another Thessaloniki secondary school in the suburb of Kalamaria, a policeman is watching as the students gather in the yard to debate their next moves."The police do not intervene. They do not want to go against the people," says one student.Many parents are unhappy."First it was the teachers' strikes, now the student takeovers, soon it will be Christmas vacation. No wonder our education is in such a mess," says the mother of a 16-year-old girl, who did not wish to be identified.And others believe children are learning the wrong lessons."What will happen to 12- to 15-year-old students in junior high school, who learn at this tender age how to break the law?" wrote Paschos Mandravelis in his column for the conservative daily, Kathimerini.For many teachers, however, the turmoil is only a natural consequence of austerity policies imposed by the so-called troika - the officials from the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank.Τhe number of teachers in Greek high schools has been cut by 18,000 since last year; 100 vocational schools have been closed; and thousands of teachers are placed on reserve.According to the EU Commission, education spending in Greece, one of the lowest in Europe even before the crisis, has remained steady at around 4% of GDP since 2008. But since the Greek economy has shrunk by almost 25% over the same period, education has suffered an equivalent cut in its actual funding.Thomai Pagiantza, who teaches at an elementary school in Alexandria, a town in northern Greece, says the problems are so grave that the union should have continued its strikes."We have suffered dramatic wage cuts. With 14 years of experience, my monthly salary has been cut from 1,400 to 950 euros [£1170 to £790]. But we are not fighting for money or privileges, as many Greeks think. We are fighting to save education," she says.Greek universities are also paralysed - not by student takeovers, but by the rolling strikes of administrative staff. The governing bodies of several institutions suspended their activities last week, saying they can no longer function.Greek universities have to contribute 1,349 employees to the total reserve pool of 25,000 civil servants, who will receive reduced pay and could lose their jobs if they are not transferred to other government agencies.The situation is aggravating social tensions. Thodoris Karagiannis, a postgraduate student and senior youth member of the ruling conservative New Democracy party, calls the blockades of universities "extortion, with students and parents being the victims".The government insists that the reforms will make Greek education more effective and less wasteful.But university employees say they are striking to save tertiary education and not just their jobs.Last Friday, dozens gathered outside the administrative building of Thessaloniki's Aristotle University, which is the largest in the country with approximately 100,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students.Already on strike for 14 days, they were sitting by the blindfolded statue of Aristotle which dominates the courtyard, drinking coffee and talking about their bleak future.Yannis Kourmoulis, the president of the Administrative Personnel Association, says they will keep fighting."Some department secretariats are staffed by a single employee... How on earth will universities do their job if they lose another 40% of their staff?"</body>

      <title>Nigerian students living in fear</title>
      <description>Nigerian students live in fear following dormitory massacre</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24353555</url>
      <date>1380670758</date>
      <body>Sagir Adam, 21, survived the weekend attack on his agricultural college in north-eastern Nigeria when suspected Islamist militants killed about 50 students sleeping in their dormitory."It was a night of horror," he told me, struggling to find words to describe what happened.Gunmen in military uniform in a convoy of two vehicles and motorcycles stormed the college at about 01:00 - a time when students are asleep in their hostels, surrounded by complete darkness.Yobe State College of Agriculture is down the road from Gujba village. The entrance is fenced but the rest of the campus merges with the bush that stretches from Yobe state into the deep forests of neighbouring Borno state - the stronghold of the Islamist group Boko Haram.Its fighters regard schools as a symbol of Western culture. The group's name translates as "Western education is forbidden".Despite the attack, and others like it, Mr Adam wants to go back to the college and continue with his studies as he believes an education will help him find a job.But he is now back in his home town of Nguru - a four-and-a-half-hour bus journey from Gujba - and his parents will never let him go back to any school as long as the danger of Boko Haram exists.His father has told him that his priority is to stay alive.Yobe state is one of the poorest and educationally disadvantaged states of Nigeria - it is certainly the least developed state in the north-east.Sharing a border with Niger to the north, it is arid and its inhabitants are largely farmers. But farming is becoming more difficult or impossible as a result of growing desert encroachment.Many tertiary students I have spoken to in Yobe's major towns - Damaturu, Geidam, Nguru, Gashua and Potiskum - say their parents have asked them to return home for security reasons.Three states in north-eastern Nigeria have been under a state of emergency since May when a security operation was launched against Boko Haram.Many of the militants left their bases and violence initially fell, but revenge attacks quickly followed - several on schools in Yobe."I always live imagining I can be killed. No-one is sure of what will happen," Potiskum resident Kadai Musa, who has three wives and 15 children, told the BBC about life under the state of emergency.He says none of his children have gone to school in the last six months because of fears of further attacks."We no longer care about anything else except to live and see the next day," he says.Agricultural lecturer Bukar Mustapha can testify to shrinking class sizes. He says the weekend attack may mean teaching unions will refuse to allow staff to go back into classrooms until security can be guaranteed.But there is no security in the remote area around Gujba, a village along a major road linking Yobe with Adamawa state.Apart from some mud houses sparsely strewn over an area the size of two football pitches, Yobe State College of Agriculture is the only prominent feature of Gujba.At the gate of the college there is a security guard, who is usually untrained and armed with a torch light and a bow and arrows.In the early hours of Sunday when the gunmen arrived, they demanded that the night guard show them the hostels for male and female students.He prevaricated, saying that most of the students had gone home for the weekend - only pointing out one dormitory.Other students awoke when they heard the shooting - the sleeping students were killed with guns and a hand-held saw.Some students died running, while others were killed after being mistaken for bandits by villagers as they fled.The gunfire lasted for four hours. Hostels were burnt, the college's shops ransacked.No security agents intervened during this time and the militants eventually left with the college ambulance.When dawn broke, dead bodies could be seen dotted around the hostel area.All day, wailing and tearful relatives hung around the morgue in the state capital Damaturu, 30km (18 miles) north of Gujba, where the dead bodies had been conveyed.The two sons of Ishaku Lawan, a 60-year-old driver, survived the dorm attack."I am grateful to Allah my sons survived," he told the BBC."After previous school attacks in Yobe state, we have been asking government to provide security in other schools but nothing has been done. Now the worst has happened."Most Yobe residents bemoan this precarious security situation.They have been living with on-and-off curfews for more than a year.Motorcycles were banned because of the many drive-by shootings - a trademark of Boko Haram killings.Thousands of young men who earned their living running motorbike taxis are out of work.But now life is more risky than ever.Muhammed Abba, a civil servant in Damaturu, has visited his mother in Maiduguri, in Borno state, every weekend for more than a decade.But in the last two months he has been unable to make the journey, which takes about an hour."In recent days, gunmen of Boko Haram have been blocking the road and slaughtering commuters. They killed over 100 recently," he said."They normally operate in the evenings and early mornings. My mum begged me not to come and see her because of the risk involved."Going to Maiduguri now by road is like a suicide mission."For now schools will officially remain open in Yobe, but they are likely to be abandoned as Boko Haram increasingly targets them.But Mr Lawan is desperate for his sons - Muhammed, 23, and Fusami, 25 - to get an education."I want my sons to be educated. I am 60 and a driver - I don't want my sons to be like me. I will look for a school in a state where there is security," he said.His meagre driver's salary means he will struggle financially, but he says it will be worth it to send his sons to any school outside Yobe state.</body>

      <title>Stones and apples thrown at university reformer</title>
      <description>A harsh reception for a would-be reformer in Iraqi Kurdistan</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23977422</url>
      <date>1380669333</date>
      <body>Prof Dlawer Ala'Aldeen had tomatoes, stones and apples thrown at him. He faced countless demonstrations.The reason for this hostility, facing the microbiologist from the University of Nottingham, was his controversial attempt to reform the university system in his birthplace of Kurdistan.Prof Ala'Aldeen was the architect of plans to improve the quality and to internationalise higher education in Iraqi Kurdistan.He says he was up against "deeply entrenched interests, people, institutions and long stagnant cultures".The region, autonomous for two decades in the wake of the Gulf War, had inherited a post-Saddam university system that Prof Ala'Aldeen has described as "grossly outdated" and designed for a closed, centralised country.In 2009 Prof Ala'Aldeen was given a secondment away from his job as professor of clinical microbiology at Nottingham University in the UK.He stepped from academic life in the English midlands into the role of Kurdistan's higher education minister, a post he held until last year.Prime Minister Barham Salih, a good friend, chose him for his knowledge of the higher education system and the series of critical articles on education and governance he had written in the years up to his appointment.Barham Salih's election manifesto had included significant support for higher education and training to support Kurdistan's large population of under 20 year olds.There were already plans for more scholarships to send talented students to study overseas.Within a week of being appointed, Prof Ala'Aldeen had written up a radical vision document and it was quickly endorsed by the cabinet.Higher education in Kurdistan was suffering a major crisis of quality, capacity and infrastructure.There was a consensus in support of reform and it helped that Prof Ala'Aldeen had been very critical of the government in the past.The reforms, which planned to improve the quality and accreditation of university teachers, brought considerable opposition from student and teacher organisations as well as businesses linked with the burgeoning market in private universities.Several new private universities were threatened with closure, much to the anger of their staff and prospective students who had paid fees for their courses."Many teachers had been licensed prematurely. There were 11 private universities when I started with 18 more waiting to be opened. These mushrooming private colleges were relying on the same pool of resources as the public universities which lacked staff and facilities," Prof Ala'Aldeen says.The problem of staffing was particularly acute in medicine, pharmacy and dentistry and in postgraduate studies.But Prof Ala'Aldeen faced protests and opposition.He was accused of trying to transplant the UK system onto Kurdistan, something he vehemently denies since he was educated and worked in his home region, before coming to study in the UK."I knew the system from the inside and studied what had happened in similar countries. I wanted to apply international principles of quality, but tailor-made to Kurdish traditions," he says.He responded by redoubling his efforts to communicate the purpose of the reforms, which also included curriculum development, moving beyond a single teacher delivering a lecture to a class, the introduction of an electronic admissions system and reforming the teaching of PhDs.In the end, the government closed three private universities as well as five health-related colleges, three pharmacy colleges and two dentistry ones."If we had allowed the system to keep evolving as it was it would have taken at least a generation to fix it - a generation would have been wasted. We knew we had to act fast. It was a risky policy, but it would have been far riskier to do nothing," he says.The speed of his action was criticised as were aspects of the efforts to improve teaching standards, such as student feedback being used to measure teacher performance and pay. There was also opposition to teachers being asked to engage in professional development once a week.Prof Brendan O'Leary, director of the programme in ethnic conflict at the University of Pennsylvania, says that a longer process might have worked better.But he says it was against a background when unprecedented changes were happening in Kurdish society as the region opened up to foreign investment."The Kurdistan region is going through a difficult and fast-paced transformation."Ideally a long and rich discussion is needed to agree new institutional conditions to enable higher education to flourish in a region emerging from decades of destruction, war, genocide, internal fighting, academic isolation and lack of resources."University and institutional reforms are more likely to succeed if all the stakeholders have clear ideas on what to do, when, and at what pace. One should not be surprised if people with vested interests fear reforms," said Prof O'Leary.Thomas Hill, assistant professor at New York University Center for Global Affairs, adds: "I do not believe there is consensus even now that the reforms the former minister wanted to implement would have been in the best interest of the Kurdistan region."There are many, many people with very conservative views within the higher education sector in the Kurdistan region and many did not and do not like the progressive path the former minister was plotting."There were areas in which vested interests remained unmoved. Prof Ala'Aldeen could not increase the independence of universities.The government continues to choose university leaders and universities have been totally dependent on government funding.Prof Ala'Aldeen put together draft legislation on institutional autonomy, but says the challenge to the status quo was too great to push it through.He is in close touch with the current government and is pleased that the reforms to improve quality have been maintained, despite the fact that there is still not consensus in favour of them, and says the scholarship programme is already making a difference."Almost 3,000 students have studied abroad, the majority in the UK. Half of these are or will be back by the end of this year. They will provide leadership and bring a breath of fresh air. They will link their institutions to the outside world and break Kurdistan's academic isolation."Although Kurdistan has its own particular circumstances, Prof Ala'Aldeen says that the problems facing the university system are not unique - and that the model for modernisation could be applied elsewhere in the Middle East."The problems are generic and the solutions can be implemented anywhere in the world."Commentators on Kurdistan's politics agree. Prof O'Leary says: "The Kurdistan region, Iraq and several other states in the Middle East are going through dramatic changes, and in some cases, deeply regrettable authoritarian restorations."Most institutions are highly politicised in these societies. If the Kurdistan region can successfully reform its education system, including higher education, it can provide a model for the wider Middle East."</body>

      <title>Angry Birds fires into the classroom</title>
      <description>Do video games have a place in the classroom?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24228473</url>
      <date>1380236413</date>
      <body>From Angry Birds to Minecraft, computer games are invading the classroom. But this is not going on behind the teacher's back anymore: it is part of the lesson plan.The average young person will have spent 10,000 hours gaming by the time they are 21 years old, research suggests.This has been mainly for entertainment, providing light relief from the maths textbooks and science experiments taking place in classrooms. But gaming is taking up more time of a child's life.For a child in the US with perfect attendance, 10,080 hours will be spent in school from fifth grade (age 10) to high school graduation, according to game designer Jane McGonigal.In the UK, computer games offering "stealth learning" have been used by many schools. But the big developers have generally, so far at least, not been keen to get involved.Angry Birds creator Rovio has brought Angry Birds Playground, a schools initiative devised with the University of Helsinki in Finland, into the kindergarten classroom of children, aimed at six-year-olds.With the initiative already in use in Finland, Rovio has now entered into an agreement with schools in China."With small children, the Finnish approach to education is very much play-orientated," says Sanna Lukander, vice president of book publishing at Rovio Entertainment."These characters and their world seemed to inspire children. You can't not think about how you might motivate children to do more than play."Finland is rated as having the best education system in the developed world.And it is not just the same edition of Angry Birds re-packaged: it is using the now-famous characters in new education-based games and a "full 360-degree approach to learning" involving books, teachers and digital devices.But what is it that children can learn from computer games which can really help with the hard learning needed in the classroom?"Games have a larger effect on learning than traditional materials in particular areas, like language acquisition, science, mathematics and social studies," says games scholar Professor Constance Steinkuehler, a former White House analyst."It's not just making the game, it's then about going back and assessing it - is it having the impact and educating in the way you hoped?"If you're talking about games in the classroom, games aren't the only vehicle for learning. You have a teacher, you have peer interaction and a structure of activities, that all plays a role, whether it's productive or whether it's rubbish."It's just like giving a textbook - you can have a fabulous one you can do great stuff with or not."And Rovio is keen to point out that it is not just the games having an impact in the classroom."Angry Birds Playground is not an educational game, it's an educational environment," says Ms Lukander."We couldn't put Angry Birds stickers on learning and just export it. It's a lot of careful RandD and research. It's been in the works for two and a half years."What this means is more than just using a slingshot to launch birds at pigs.Rovio has already worked with the publishers Penguin, National Geographic, Nasa, the National Geographic and others on educational books. It is not even branding itself as a games company but as a media company,But it is not the only media company in educational games.At the more avant garde end of games aimed at educating children, there are shooting games attempting to make chewing vegetables seem cool right through to combating sexually transmitted infections with a choice of superhero characters like Willy the Kid.Yes, really.More widely, Minecraft, the virtual world game, is being used in classrooms in all sorts of innovative ways."Minecraft is one of the most important games for learning right now," says Prof Steinkuehler."What kids are doing with Minecraft is mind-blowing. It's just amazing."In a classroom at Reykjavik University in Iceland, just like many others, Minecraft is used as a 3D graphical interface to help young people understand the basics of telling a computer what to do.According to MinecraftEdu, which is working with around 1,000 schools, the game is being used in every subject area across all school age groups, providing digital building blocks of what a lesson can demonstrate and teach.But interestingly, Minecraft is blocked by a number of school firewalls.And there are those who think games in the classroom do more harm than good."Gaming in the classroom might be frivolous at worst or entertaining at best," says teacher and author Dr Gary Stager.Current systems of education, Dr Stager argues, are seen as "unpleasant, tortuous and create a league table of winners and losers". But games in the classroom are not the way to fix it."The games developed for education tend to be a lot less fun, interesting and merely test prior knowledge," he says."Worst of all, they're coercive. Adults are taking something kids love - games - and using them in a coercive fashion to deliver curriculum."But the technology companies working with children see the move towards gaming and technology as inevitable. LeapFrog's LeapPad2 tablet device was one of the best-selling toys last year."Children already live in a multi-screen environment," says Sally Plumridge, LeapFrog's international marketing director."The whole world they work in is much more interactive. Bringing gaming into their lives really allows them to develop those cognitive skills.""There's still a need to learn in a traditional way; however, the way that traditional learning extends into new technologies just gives a different dimension to education and a more practical dimension."Children develop in role play and looking what their parents do. From a very early age, they see their parents with tablets and phones."Their instincts in that world of what to do and when to do it are much more enhanced than our own.

      <title>The parents' long goodbye</title>
      <description>How parents cope when children head to university</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24208545</url>
      <date>1380157439</date>
      <body>More than 400,000 youngsters are starting university in the UK this year. That means hundreds of thousands of parents saying goodbye.The approach road to the student village is a long traffic jam of family cars, stuffed full with boxes, pillows, nervous families, memories and expectations.This is the very first day at university - parents taking their children and getting ready to say goodbye.It's one of those big events that never makes the headlines but will have been ringed in the diaries of hundreds of thousands of families.On motorways and trains, more than 421,000 youngsters will be making this symbolic journey. After months of anticipation, checklists on fridge doors, last meals at home, last drink with friends, it's now here.At the University of Sheffield, a stream of parents arrive with their sons and daughters at the Endcliffe Student Village. There are balloons, music, banners and the upbeat banter of student radio in a well-orchestrated welcome.It's like the first day at an academic holiday resort. Parents and their teenage children look around the newly-refurbished student union bar as if they are about to begin one last family trip.But under the South Yorkshire autumn sunshine there's no escaping the poignancy. For parents, this is what they've always wanted for their children and many will have quietly dreaded. It's a bittersweet journey.No one wants to spoil this big first day, but it's no secret that they'll be thinking about the empty room at home.There are T-shirted volunteers all around ready to help anyone looking lost. They know the teenagers are going to have worries.And what do the new arrivals most want to know about? Internet connection, of course. It's their most urgent concern, say the helpers. Not so much Generation Y as Generation Wi-fi.Meanwhile their dads, looking misty-eyed, have the conversations that they have at times of big emotions. They talk huskily about parking problems and the fleeting nature of mobile phone signals.It's a mixture of epic understatement and Alan Partridge as parents fill the long silences by talking about the ring roads that have brought them there.Suitcases and boxes full of gadgets are lugged along neat paths in the shade of newly planted trees. There will soon be 3,000 youngsters living here. There's a beach-themed party already lined up and a whole week of ice-breaking activities.There's a long gaggle of arrivals waiting to check in. There are girls who have travelled with clingy soon-to-be ex-boyfriends; there are siblings suddenly close to each other instead of fighting.But the biggest group are mothers, fathers and a teenager now taller than them. They stand together like they might have done on the first day of primary school. If there was a Club 45 to 55, it would look like this.Their estates and people-carriers look like the cars bought a few years ago for a young family, the ghosts of child seats still pressed into the upholstery.The university has put on a friendly face to help the new students over this threshold.In fact, universities have had a major collective make-over in their bid to attract students. There has been a campus building boom since the increase in tuition fees.Alongside the rigorous academic stuff, universities are also selling a leisure experience. It's part-science park, part-theme park.The student union bar at Sheffield has been re-vamped. Forget student unions with sticky carpets and punctured leatherette. It's now all clean, airy and comfortable and the bar manager at Sheffield says these days it's driven more by food than booze.If parents want to visit, Sheffield has just opened its own campus hotel.Even on their first day, it won't be an entirely unfamiliar environment for the new students. Before they arrive they will have been using social networking to get to know their future flatmates. They're bringing enough computer technology to launch a space mission, so keeping in touch with home should be easier than ever before.There is still time for some instant re-invention. Starting at university is one of the most significant changes for any young person. They will have spent several weeks deciding the big academic questions, like what they should wear in the bar.The first night is the stuff of myth. There are people you meet and then spend three years avoiding and people you meet on a corridor and then become friends with for the rest of your life. There will be freshers' week stories of excessive drinking, ineffective cooking and misguided outfits.These new students are entering their own soap opera of romance, friendship and ambition. It's a huge adventure that they've worked hard for years to achieve and for which they'll be paying for many years afterwards.But after the small talk over cups of coffee and a constant stream of text messages, there is no escaping where this is heading. For many families, if childhood has a final moment, this is it.The door closes on a student's room and parents and children go their separate ways.</body>

      <title>Union anger at health pay proposal</title>
      <description>Unions criticise government moves to halt a 1% pay rise for all NHS staff in England, arguing they deserve to be rewarded for holding the health service together.</description>

      <date>1380991958</date>
      <body>Unions have criticised government moves to halt a 1% pay rise for all NHS staff in England.The Department of Health said the increase was unaffordable alongside the current system which sees many staff automatically receive incremental annual rises.It has urged the NHS pay review body to withhold the rise for 1.3m staff.Rachael Maskell, of the Unite trade union, said staff deserved the pay reward for "holding the NHS together".Health trusts are currently under pressure to make savings and the NHS wage bill accounts for around 40% of its budget.All public sector pay increases are capped at 1%.The Department of Health (DoH) proposes using the funding intended for the rise to "modernise" pay structures.It says automatic increments - linked to length of service and satisfactory performance - add £900m to salary costs.The DoH has stressed no decisions on changes to pay have been taken, insisting independent bodies will make their recommendations in February or March next year.But the plans, outlined in the DoH's submission to two independent pay review bodies, have been criticised by Unite and Labour.Ms Maskell, of Unite, said: "The Department of Health have got other choices. They're entering into a reorganisation which is costing £3bn, which nobody asked for and isn't adding anything to patient care."It is about choices and the NHS staff have already had two years of a pay freeze - 1% last year - and, quite frankly, are really falling behind inflation now with their wages."Staff moraleShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme motivation and morale was down among frontline health workers "at this very difficult time".However, in its submission the DoH points to a staff survey suggesting high levels of motivation and morale and says there should only be basic pay increases if there is "strong evidence" recruitment, retention, morale or motivation issues require this.Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the NHS reorganisation had taken money out of front-line services."There has to be pay restraint in the NHS as well as other public services... but the NHS has been through some very difficult years - so have NHS staff - and this was a modest increase to recognise the pressure that all families are under."To take it away, to break that promise, is just another kick in the teeth."Staff representatives have also reacted angrily to the plans."What they have done is inflammatory," said Christina McAnea, head of health at Unison and joint chairwoman of the NHS Staff Council."We are not going to negotiate while a gun is held to our head for a paltry 1% pay rise - our members will not react well to that."Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association council said this would not result in staff leaving in their "droves".However he added: "We're going to find it increasingly hard to recruit, partly for the specialist skills and partly for the numbers of staff that we'd need to bring into the health service to implement the safe minimum staffing levels."Health minister Anna Soubry defended the government 's stance telling the BBC: "This is about making sure we pay our NHS staff well and we reward their improvement in skills."This system works in other public sectors and the private sector. People want to make sure that they are getting good quality, first class services especially at a time when the NHS faces challenges."Earlier a DoH spokeswoman said: "Many NHS staff have continued to receive pay rises of up to 3.5% and we want to keep working with the trade unions and employers on affordable pay."The measures we are proposing will help increase quality for patients and help us realise our vision of an affordable seven-day service."In June Chancellor George Osborne said ministers were working to "remove automatic pay rises" for teachers, health professionals, prison and police staff.The DoH drew attention to Mr Osborne's comments and confirmed it wanted NHS pay to have "stronger links to performance, quality and productivity".</body>

      <title>Rail minister Burns stands down</title>
      <description>Transport Minister Simon Burns resigns from the government to run for the position of deputy Commons Speaker.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24396224</url>
      <date>1380897834</date>
      <body>Transport Minister Simon Burns has resigned from the government to run for the position of deputy Commons Speaker.The MP for Chelmsford has been responsible for the controversial HS2 rail link during the past year, having previously been a health minister.One of the three deputy Speaker positions is vacant after previous incumbent Nigel Evans stood down to fight sexual assault charges.Mr Burns has clashed with Speaker John Bercow several times in the past.On one occasion, Mr Burns described the man under whom he now seeks to serve as a "stupid sanctimonious dwarf".BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said the Conservative MP had apologised afterwards - but only to groups of people who felt insulted, not necessarily to the Speaker himself.Were he to be elected, relations between the pair would not be altogether comfortable, our correspondent added.There are plenty of Conservatives who do not support Mr Bercow and might vote for Mr Burns just to irritate him, he continued.MPs are elected to the role of deputy Speaker, under reforms proposed by Mr Bercow shortly after he took on his role in 2009.To stand for election, MPs need to be sponsored by at least six other MPs.One of the other candidates for the role is Nadine Dorries, who in 2009 described the Speaker as "oily" and suggested he was "mistrusted by up to half of the House".Conservative backbenchers Eleanor Laing and Brian Binley have also been named as potential candidates.The successful applicant will join existing deputies, former Labour MPs Dawn Primarolo and Lindsay Hoyle, in helping to chair Commons business.Mr Burns' decision comes ahead of an expected reshuffle of middle-ranking Conservative ministerial ranks in coming weeks.In his resignation letter to Prime Minister David Cameron, he wrote: "It has been a privilege to serve in your administration for the past three and a quarter years and I will be forever grateful to you for giving me that opportunity in both the Departments of Health and Transport."You can rest assured that I will continue to support your leadership of both the Conservative Party and the government."The PM's response described the MP as a "loyal, dedicated and committed colleague".Mr Cameron said: "I know that this will not have been an easy decision for you to make, and one you will have given a huge amount of thought to."After serving the government so ably for over three years, you will certainly be missed, but I completely understand and respect your decision."</body>

      <title>Child benefit deadline day looms</title>
      <description>A tax boss says nearly 200,000 parents must "get off their backsides" and register with the UK tax authority amid changes to child benefit.</description>

      <date>1380919790</date>
      <body>A tax boss has said nearly 200,000 parents must "get off their backsides" and register with the UK tax authority amid changes to child benefit.Saturday marks the first deadline for better-off families to sign up with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).They will need to register for self-assessment so the HMRC can claw some or all of the benefit back.Families where one parent has a taxable income of more than £50,000 are affected.They will lose some of the benefit, following the introduction of the new rules in January 2013, while child benefit has been withdrawn entirely if one parent earns more than £60,000.Eligible families receive £20.30 per week in child benefit for their first child and £13.40 a week for any further children.The new rules meant that this payment is reduced gradually for families where one parent is earning between £50,000 and £60,000.HMRC has written to people who it believes have a taxable income of more than £50,000 and so need to take some action. Taxable income is earnings from employment, as well as other income such as from savings and shares, but may not include some pension contributions.Lin Homer, HMRC chief executive, told BBC Radio 5 Live: "We think there is about 200,000 people who need to get off their backsides and do something."Some 350,000 people have opted out of receiving child benefit altogether, generally because they earn and will continue to earn a taxable income of more than £60,000 and therefore would not be entitled to the payment.HMRC says another 425,000 people were already in self-assessment, some 140,000 people have registered for self-assessment, and another 185,000 people have still to register.In theory, the deadline to register and avoid a possible penalty is 5 October. The penalty would be between 10% and 100% of the child benefit paid.However, HMRC says it is unlikely that anyone who registers and pays the tax by 31 January would be penalised."HMRC is committed to helping people pay the right amount of tax and urges parents who have been affected by the changes to child benefit to register for self-assessment," said Ms Homer."We know that lots of people leave it until the last minute."Anita Monteith, of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, said: "This adds considerable complication to the tax system for ordinary people, particularly for those brought into the self-assessment system for the first time."I would urge those affected to register for self-assessment as soon as they can."</body>

      <title>Mail's position unravelling - Labour</title>
      <description>Labour says the Daily Mail's stance is unravelling after a senior journalist said an article about Ed Miliband's father was "wrongly labelled".</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24395790</url>
      <date>1380915514</date>
      <body>Labour has said the Daily Mail's stance is unravelling after a top journalist said an article about Ed Miliband's father was "wrongly labelled".Alex Brummer, the Mail's City editor, told Channel 4 News it should have been made clearer it was a comment article.The paper has refused to apologise for a piece calling Marxist academic Ralph Miliband "The man who hated Britain" - and said its position had not changed.A Labour spokesman said the Daily Mail's defence was "crumbling".Mr Brummer's comments are the first time anyone from the Mail has suggested there might be a problem with the article.He said: "Sometimes articles which are comment should be labelled and made clear that they are comment."So perhaps it should have said 'comment' on it to make clear absolutely it was comment instead of a special report."But I think people understood that it wasn't just reporting; there was an element of commentary to it. Just maybe the labelling wasn't quite what it should have been."Labour said it showed that the Mail's strategy was unravelling piece by piece."Six days on from their original article, the Daily Mail's defence is crumbling," said the spokesman."For the first time, they have been forced to admit significant problems in the way they dealt with the article 'The man who hated Britain'."They should now finally have the good grace and decency to acknowledge their grotesque error of judgment and apologise."Earlier Mr Brummer told the BBC the Daily Mail would not say sorry to the Labour leader - and said the paper was owed an apology over claims that its Ralph Miliband articles were motivated by anti-Semitism.Mr Miliband sought to distance himself from the anti-Semitism claims.But he renewed his demand for the paper's owner Lord Rothermere to investigate its culture and practices.Lord Rothermere has apologised to Mr Miliband for a Mail on Sunday reporter intruding on a family memorial service.But he stopped short of saying sorry for the Ralph Miliband article or agreeing to a wider inquiry into the way his newspapers operate.Appearing on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Brummer strongly defended the Daily Mail's original article which questioned how far Ralph Miliband's left-wing views had influenced his son.He said: "I don't think we need to apologise for anything. This was a piece which examined somebody's views very carefully."He hit out at suggestions from the Jewish Chronicle, some Labour figures and others that there may have been "a whiff of anti-Semitism" about the coverage."I think there are people out there who need to apologise to us because there have been vicious accusations in the last couple of days, from (former Labour leader) Neil Kinnock among others, that somehow this was an anti-Semitic attack," he said.Mr Miliband told BBC Radio 5Live he was not suggesting the paper was anti-Semitic."I'm always incredibly careful about throwing around the idea that the paper or somebody is anti-Semitic or racist unless there is real evidence for that," he said."I don't believe that of the Mail; that's not been my issue."He said that while the newspaper was entitled to hold him to account for his views, the way it had attacked his father was unacceptable."They'll criticise me, they'll say my policies are wrong, that's absolutely fine. But when it comes to my dad, and saying my dad hated Britain, I'm afraid they're crossing a line," he said."In all of this, they've never apologised for the fact they said my dad hated Britain - an idea without any foundation."While acknowledging the Daily Mail - which has a circulation of more than 1.8 million - was a "popular" newspaper, he suggested many of its readers agreed with him that it had "overstepped the mark".Mail on Sunday editor Geordie Greig said a reporter had been sent to a memorial service for Mr Miliband's uncle without his knowledge and an investigation was being held into "a decision which was wrong".Mr Miliband told 5Live he had met the Daily Mail's editor Paul Dacre "two or three times" since becoming Labour leader.Mr Brummer defended the Mail's journalistic methods, saying it was "extraordinarily careful" about how it pursued a story.He said: "I hear the editor, I hear the deputy editor almost every day saying to reporters, saying to editors of their sections 'be careful how you go about getting a particular story'."That's a practice which goes to the core of the paper, and I do think there are some good ethical roots in the paper and this is the exception rather than the rule."The row comes ahead of a crucial meeting of MPs next Wednesday on press regulation.They will consider rival proposals for a new regulator to replace the Press Complaints Commission.Mr Miliband, along with the three main political parties and press intrusion victims campaign group Hacked Off, supports a form of press regulation backed by royal charter.The newspaper industry, among them the country's largest newspaper groups, including Mail publisher DMG Media, News UK, owner of the Sun and the Times, Telegraph Media Group and Trinity Mirror, have put forward a rival plan rejecting "state-sponsored regulation".A member of Lord Justice Leveson's inquiry team into press practices expressed concern that Mr Miliband's row with the Mail could be used as "a cudgel to try to beat the press" and push through tighter regulation.Former Daily Telegraph political editor George Jones said: "We were quite clear in those discussions that we did not want to get into the question of taste, we didn't want to be arbiters of what was in good taste and what was in bad taste."In my view, once you go down that road you do seriously compromise freedom of speech."</body>

      <title>CPS to decide on 'plebgate' row</title>

      <body>The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) says it has received all the evidence about the "plebgate" row and will decide if charges should be brought.Eight people have been bailed in the inquiry following a row involving ex-government chief whip Andrew Mitchell.Mr Mitchell apologised for not treating police officers with respect during the incident at Downing Street's main gate in September 2012.But he denies newspaper claims that he called police "plebs".Five police officers are among those arrested as part of Operation Alice, which is the investigation into alleged misconduct as well as the unauthorised leaking of information to newspapers about the incident, after which the Conservative MP quit the cabinet.Mr Mitchell was accused of launching a foul-mouthed tirade at officers guarding Downing Street when he was asked not to take his bike through the street's main gates.MPs from across the political spectrum - including former Home Secretary Jack Straw - have criticised how long the investigation has taken.On Friday the Metropolitan Police said that it handed its first file of evidence to the CPS on 28 March, but three pieces of information were subsequently added.The Met said the "final lines of inquiry have now been completed" and that a copy of the file of evidence had been passed to the Independent Police Complaints Commissions.A CPS spokesman said: "We have now received all of the outstanding evidence in this case and are now considering the file to determine whether charges should be brought.""We aim to make a decision as soon as is reasonably possible."In an interview on Friday with the BBC's Sunday Politics West Midlands, Mr Mitchell said it had been "an extraordinarily difficult year" that had "taken a very considerable toll on my family and on me"."But I've been getting on with looking after my constituents in Sutton Coldfield and I'd like to express my deep gratitude to them and my many friends who've given me such trenchant support throughout this difficult time," he added in the interview, which was recorded prior to the CPS' announcement.</body>

      <body>Conservative MP and cabinet minister Ken Clarke has announced that he plans to stand again at the next general election, which is due in 2015.In an interview with BBC political editor, East Midlands, John Hess, Mr Clarke also said he "hopes" to retain a place in Prime Minister David Cameron's top ministerial team."But sooner or later, I'm sure he'll ask me to retire," he added.The minister without portfolio and MP for Rushcliffe will be 74 in May 2015."I get on very well with David," he added."He's had me in the government for three and a half years, which is much longer than I expected."Mr Clarke continued: "He may have me there for the rest of this Parliament. But prime ministers need to accommodate young thrusting, ambitious men, as I used to be many decades ago."Sometimes, as prime minister, you have to cough gently and ask your colleagues to retire. I hope he'll keep me for as long as I can contribute."Ken Clarke returned to government when David Cameron entered Downing Street after the 2010 general election.The then justice secretary and lord chancellor said the coalition had brought out his "inner liberal".The justice portfolio and lord chancellorship have since been handed to Chris Grayling, but Mr Clarke retains his membership of the cabinet.Our correspondent John Hess predicted that if the Conservatives win the 2015 election, Mr Clarke would want to play a key pro-Europe role in any ensuing EU referendum campaign on UK membership.Mr Clarke was first elected Rushcliffe MP in 1970, a keen supporter of the pro-European, "one-nation" Prime Minister Edward Heath.Within two years of his election he was an assistant whip, rising to whip and then becoming a junior spokesman on the opposition benches.In 1988 he entered the cabinet as health secretary, with the job of driving through controversial and far-reaching reforms of the NHS, including the internal market.When John Major became leader in 1990 he moved Mr Clarke to education and later the Home Office.After the disastrous events of Black Wednesday, the decision to leave the European exchange rate mechanism and eight months later the resignation of Norman Lamont, Mr Clarke was made chancellor.He has run for the leadership of the Conservative party three times: in 1997, 2001 and 2005.</body>

      <title>Plans to curtail early jail release</title>
      <description>People jailed for a range of serious offences in England and Wales will lose their automatic right to early release, under government proposals.</description>

      <body>People jailed for child rape or some terror offences will no longer be automatically released from jail halfway through their sentences, under government plans for England and Wales.Justice Secretary Chris Grayling says he also wants to curtail the early release of prisoners serving extended sentences for the most serious crimes.About 600 prisoners a year are expected to be affected by the proposals.Campaigners warned of the likely impact on an "over-burdened" Parole Board.Under rules created in 2003, most prisoners serving fixed-term sentences are eligible for release on a conditional licence into the community at the halfway point of their sentence, unless they have been guilty of poor behaviour in jail.Others jailed for the most serious crimes are subjected to an extended determinate sentence (EDS), which means they are released on licence only after serving two-thirds of it.Under the new proposals, neither people serving an EDS - a system devised just over a year ago - or those convicted of child rape nor a range of terrorism offences would be automatically released on licence.Instead they would have to prove to the Parole Board that they were no longer dangerous and a risk to society before they could be freed.The Ministry of Justice said the proposals would require primary legislation that would go before Parliament in the new year.Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: "It's outrageous that offenders who commit some truly horrific crimes in this country are automatically released from prison halfway through their custodial sentence, regardless of their behaviour, attitude and engagement in their own rehabilitation."We need to teach criminals a lesson; you will be punished for your crime and you must earn your release, it is not an automatic right."In a statement, the Parole Board said that it supported "a more consistent approach to release arrangements" for the offenders who would be covered by the changes.It added: "Protecting the public is the primary concern of the Parole Board and any measures that ensure offenders are only released from custody following a rigorous assessment of risk are welcomed."But Andrew Neilson, of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: "Today's announcement may grab headlines but it will not make the public safer."When prisoners are released early, they do at least receive supervision from the probation service for the remainder of their sentence, with the threat of recall to prison always present."We fear this move will only serve to further clog up the Parole Board, which is already under-resourced and over-burdened."The terrorist offences covered by the changes include directing a terrorist organisation, inciting terrorism overseas and use of a nuclear weapon.</body>

      <body>Labour leader Ed Miliband has said he is "absolutely clear" that energy bills will be frozen if his party wins the next general election."We are absolutely confident because we've done all the figures, we've looked at all of the issues," he told the BBC's Breakfast programme.He repeated his accusation that energy companies have been over-charging businesses and consumers.Critics have warned that the plan could put future energy supplies at risk.But Mr Miliband claimed that energy companies were "unreliable witnesses" in the debate: "They're the people who would say that anyway.""There's a cost-of-living crisis in this country. Energy bills are a big part of it," he said."For too long the companies have been able to over-charge people. Somebody's got to stand up and be counted."That's why we'll freeze energy bills until the beginning of 2017 if we win the election. That will benefit 1.5 million businesses across our country, make a big difference to them."The policy was unveiled at the party's annual conference last week, and has faced strong criticism about its feasibility and the effect it would have on investment in energy infrastructure.But Mr Miliband continued: "Even if wholesale prices rise, this freeze is going to happen. I want to be absolutely clear about this."We're absolutely confident the companies can stomach this, can make this happen, and we're going to make this happen."He again dismissed predictions that energy companies might try to "collude" and hike prices before the election."If they try and do that, that is illegal," he said, "they can't do that."Labour has also released figures suggesting that British business could save £1.5bn if the price freeze came into force.The party said the estimate was based on research by the House of Commons Library.Meanwhile, two energy companies, EDF and First Utility, have unveiled plans to freeze current prices voluntarily.EDF Energy unveiled a new tariff that fixes bills until 2017, and First Utility said its current variable tariff would be frozen until March 2014.The former head of the UK's competition watchdog, John Fingleton, has suggested Labour's price-freeze policy was unlikely to work."In the long term [it] will harm consumers, and taking political responsibility for prices you cannot ultimately control is quite risky," he said earlier this month.The Conservatives have accused Labour of "bashing business" and insisted action was already being taken to ensure customers are on the cheapest tariff.Energy UK, the trade body representing the six largest energy firms, said the move could push up prices across the board and threaten the 600,000 people employed in the industry.</body>

      <description>A parliamentary candidate for a Bristol seat stands down after it emerged she owed £2,000 in parking fines and late payment fees.</description>

      <body>A Labour parliamentary candidate has stood down after it emerged she owed more than £2,000 in parking fines and late payment fees.Josie Channer accrued the penalties in the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham, where she is a councillor on a committee overseeing parking issues.She was campaigning to win the Kingswood seat near Bristol.In a statement she expressed "regret" that she could not "devote the time and resources necessary" to the campaign."It has been fantastic getting to know the residents of Kingswood and the local party members."I wish them well as they continue to fight for the Labour victory Kingswood deserves and needs in 2015," she said.Conservative-held Kingswood is a key marginal seat and one of Labour's top targets for the next General Election.The area's current MP, Chris Skidmore, said the issue was no reason for Ms Channer to "desert Kingswood"."While this is embarrassing for Labour, I think Josie Channer should reconsider her resignation," he said."It looks bad for Labour members locally who chose Josie as their preferred candidate if she is just going to walk away from Kingswood like this."Local people will be disappointed that their Labour candidate is prepared to give up on Kingswood so easily."Ms Channer, who serves on Barking and Dagenham Council's living and working select committee, was fined 10 times over three years.She said she believed the charges had been dealt with previously."Last year I learned that the charges were still live and had incurred late payment fees so I have contacted the council and agreed a repayment plan to pay off the fine," she said.Barking and Dagenham Council confirmed that Ms Channer did have outstanding parking fines and fees.Kevin Beazer, the regional secretary of the Communication Workers Union, campaigned for Labour's second-placed candidate in Kingswood, Rowena Hayward.He said: "I think questions have got to be asked about when a candidate's selected, if there is anything untoward that is going to come forward."It's unfortunate... but it has happened and people will need to move on, hopefully very swiftly, so we can get a candidate in place that tackles the Tory (Chris Skidmore MP) in Kingswood."</body>

      <title>Examine Mail culture, Miliband urges</title>
      <description>Labour leader Ed Miliband urges Lord Rothermere, owner of the Mail newspaper titles, to take a "long, hard look" at the way they are run.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24393777</url>
      <date>1380878608</date>
      <body>Newspaper owner Lord Rothermere must take a "long, hard look" at the "culture and practices" of his Mail titles, Ed Miliband has said.The proprietor has apologised to Mr Miliband for a Mail on Sunday reporter intruding on a family memorial service.The Labour leader told BBC Radio 5Live the apology was an "important step" but that he did not think his treatment was an isolated incident.Mr Miliband said he wanted to know "how these practices are allowed to happen".Last weekend, a Daily Mail article labelled Ralph Miliband, a Marxist academic who died in 1994, "the man who hated Britain".That prompted Mr Miliband to complain about his father being "smeared", but although the newspaper offered him a right of reply, it has continued to defend its coverage.In a separate incident on Thursday, the Mail on Sunday suspended two of its journalists after it emerged the paper had gate-crashed a service for the Labour leader's uncle, at which they pressed the family for reaction to the original Daily Mail article.Mr Miliband told 5Live Breakfast that Lord Rothermere "has a responsibility to take a long hard look" at the way his papers are run after the intrusion.He said: "I hope what Lord Rothermere will do is look at the wider culture and practices at the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday because I don't think it's an isolated incident."I'm interested in other families, not in public life, who've had similar experiences."Mr Miliband said he expected the papers to criticise him and his policies but that they had "crossed a line" by accusing his father of hating Britain.While acknowledging the Daily Mail - which has a circulation of more than 1.8 million - was a "popular" newspaper, he suggested many of its readers agreed with him that it had "overstepped the mark".But he said he did not agree with the Jewish Chronicle's suggestion that there was "a whiff of anti-semitism" about the Daily Mail's Ralph Miliband articles.Mail on Sunday editor Geordie Greig said the reporter had been sent without his knowledge and an investigation was being held into "a decision which was wrong".Both he and Lord Rothermere apologised "unreservedly", with the peer also writing to Mr Miliband.Neither Labour nor the Daily Mail and General Trust - the papers' parent company - have released the text of Lord Rothermere's response to Mr Miliband.Mr Miliband told 5Live he has met the Daily Mail's editor Paul Dacre "two or three times" since becoming Labour leader.He said: "My personal dealings with him have been absolutely professional. Sometimes we've disagreed about issues. We've disagreed about press standards but sometimes we've agreed on some issues."The row comes days before a crucial meeting of MPs next Wednesday on press regulation.They will consider proposals for a press royal charter with a new regulator to replace the Press Complaints Commission.The plan is backed by the country's largest newspaper groups, including Mail publisher DMG Media, News UK, who own the Sun and the Times, Telegraph Media Group and Trinity Mirror.Mr Miliband supports an alternative plan, backed by the three main political parties and press intrusion victims campaign group Hacked Off, for a form of press regulation backed by royal charter.A senior Mail executive has defended the paper's journalistic methods, saying it was "extraordinarily careful" about how it pursued a story."I hear the the editor, I hear the deputy editor almost every day saying to reporters, saying to editors of their sections 'be careful how you go about getting a particular story'," City Editor Alex Brummer told Radio 4's Today."That's a practice which goes to the core of the paper, and I do think there are some good ethical roots in the paper and this is the exception rather than the rule," he added.On Thursday's Question Time on BBC One, the Daily Mail's political sketch writer Quentin Letts defended its original reporting of the views of Ralph Miliband, a Jewish refugee who fled Belgium aged 16 to escape the Nazis and who served in the Royal Navy during WWII.Mr Letts described the socialist academic as a "useful idiot" for "people that were promoting Marxism" during the Cold War.Mr Letts added that Ralph Miliband had been "furious that we won the Falklands War. He wanted us to lose the Falklands War."Is that the behaviour of a man who loves his country? I'm not sure it is."However, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, praising Ralph Miliband's military record, told the programme: "People who haven't served their country and fought for their country should really think before deciding that they have a monopoly on determining British values."Meanwhile Ralph Miliband's biographer, Michael Newman, said the late academic "wanted a different kind of Britain" but "wasn't against Britain".</body>

      <title>Rogue investigators' clients probed</title>
      <description>Nineteen clients of rogue private eyes are to be investigated for illegal activity, the Information Commissioner's Office confirms</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24385467</url>
      <date>1380836614</date>
      <body>Nineteen clients of rogue private eyes are to be investigated for illegal activity, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has said.Five retailers and four law firms are among those suspected of commissioning the illegal gathering of information.Information Commissioner Christopher Graham said in a letter to Keith Vaz MP that there were 125 alleged victims of illegal activity.Mr Graham had previously asked MPs not to publish a list of the clients.In his letter to Mr Vaz, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs select committee, he says there is a "continued need for the committee not to take any further steps to publish the details of clients" in order to "avoid compromising" any strands of his investigation.Mr Graham's office was initially handed a list of 98 clients of allegedly corrupt private detectives by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca).He told Mr Vaz in the letter that, as well as the retailers and legal firms, three insurance companies, two financial businesses, a construction firm and a security company were being investigated, as were three further private investigators.He said the allegations related to the period 2001-2009Soca passed the names of 102 firms and individuals who had allegedly used corrupt private investigators to the select committee earlier this year.But Soca's stipulation that the names must remain confidential sparked a row over transparency.The so-called "blue-chip hacking" list was drawn up at the request of the committee and related to Soca's Operation Millipede, which led to the conviction of four private detectives for fraud last year.Following a heated evidence session last month, Mr Vaz told Soca chiefs that the committee would publish the list if Soca did not do so first.He said it was in the public interest to publish the names, which include law firms and celebrities, but Soca has consistently refused to release the document.The ICO analysed the information between 3 September and 23 September.On Thursday, Mr Vaz said: "The commissioner has kept his promise to Parliament and provided the information requested promptly and efficiently."I am, however, baffled that for over four years Soca failed to conduct a scoping exercise which has taken the ICO only two weeks to complete."He added that "the most concerning outcome is that 12 of the remaining clients are now inactive which calls into question whether the delay has allowed illegal activity to go unpunished".Eight more clients could also be added to the inquiry, says BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds.They were part of a trial which resulted in the convictions of the four private investigators at Kingston Crown Court last year.The ICO said the evidence in those cases had already been assessed by the Crown Prosecution Service, and they may also face further investigation.Mr Graham is due to appear before the committee on 8 October to provide it with more information.</body>

      <title>GCHQ attack claim 'must be examined'</title>
      <description>The European Parliament is right to investigate claims that Britain's spy agency GCHQ launched a cyber attack on a Belgian telecommunications company, a Labour MEP says.</description>

      <body>The European Parliament is right to probe claims that UK spy agency GCHQ launched a cyber attack on a Belgian telecom firm, a British MEP says.Allegations GCHQ attempted to hack into Belgacom - whose customers include the EU offices in Brussels - were revealed in documents leaked by Edward Snowden.Labour's Claude Moraes said it was "only natural" there was an inquiry.Britain said the EU did not have the power to investigate. GCHQ says it works within a strict legal framework.The head of GCHQ, Sir Iain Lobban, did not turn up to give evidence at Thursday's European Parliamentary Inquiry, which is tasked with investigating the extent of the alleged electronic mass surveillance of EU citizens.Representatives from Belgacom, which provides internet services and telecommunications across Belgium including to the EU and its institutions, did attend Thursday's inquiry.Geert Stadaert, vice president of the firm, told the inquiry its experts "sounded the alarm about anomalies in Belgacom's networks" in June.The company said it had discovered malicious software in its systems.Mr Stadaert said Belgacom had no information about the perpetrator or the motive.But German magazine Der Spiegel reported that documents provided by former US defence contractor Edward Snowden contained details of "Operation Socialist" - GCHQ's alleged code name for an attack on Belgacom's systems.Der Spiegel said the aim of the alleged operation was to enable Cheltenham-based GCHQ to launch "Man in the Middle" attacks.These could have enabled it to intercept communications between two parties, read and potentially change them without either side realising.A spokesperson for the intelligence agency said it would not comment on media stories about leaks or on intelligence matters.Mr Moraes, MEP for London, said: "In every member state, including the United Kingdom, MPs and representatives are being asked to investigate these allegations and it's only natural that in the European Parliament that happens as well."You have allegations of the UK spying on Belgian telephone systems which were part of infrastructure for the European Union."I think that's quite an unusual allegation and of course it can't just stand, it has to be investigated."Belgacom has passed its information onto the Belgian prosecutor who is investigating.Mr Snowden sought asylum in Russia after disclosing classified documents to the Guardian newspaper revealing details of US surveillance activities.</body>

      <body>Part-time judge Constance Briscoe has denied intending to pervert the course of justice in connection with the Chris Huhne speeding points case.Ms Briscoe is accused of providing police with two inaccurate statements and altering a copy of a witness statement given to police.The 56-year-old, who is a barrister, pleaded not guilty to both counts at a hearing at the Old Bailey.She will face trial at Southwark Crown Court on 14 January.Former cabinet minister Huhne was jailed in March along with his ex-wife, economist Vicky Pryce, who agreed to accept speeding points on his behalf.Both have since been released from prison.After she was charged on 12 June, Ms Briscoe said in a statement that she was "deeply distressed", adding: "I have not committed the offences alleged against me and I will fight the allegations in court."Ms Briscoe was suspended from working as a judge by the Office for Judicial Complaints following her arrest in October 2012.</body>

      <title>Blind 'trapped' by poor pavements</title>

      <body>Blind and partially sighted people are often reluctant to leave home because of the "dreadful" state of Britain's pavements, a survey suggests.Guide Dogs UK asked more than 750 blind or visually impaired people and found almost two-thirds had tripped or stumbled while walking.The charity said two out of five feared going out because of damaged surfaces, leaving them "trapped" at home.Councils said they were "committed" to ensuring pavements were "safe to use".Guide Dogs said UK councils had spent more than £46m in compensation since 2009 for injuries to pedestrians relating to poorly-maintained pavements.It called for dangerous pavements to be prioritised.Chief executive Richard Leaman said: "Guide Dogs is determined to help people with sight loss get out independently and with confidence, but this is being undermined by the dreadful state of our pavements."Councils must prioritise dangerous pavements if blind and partially sighted people, as well as people with other disabilities, are to have the same freedom as everyone else."He went on: "For many, it can be the difference between being able to set out with confidence or being trapped at home."The research also highlighted problems with advertising boards, wheelie bins and badly parked cars.Guide Dogs is calling for new laws to prohibit parking on pavements other than in specific areas permitted by local authorities.A spokesperson for the Local Government Association said: "Councils know that the condition of pavements is a key priority for residents and are committed to making sure they are safe to use by all pedestrians."The fact that pavement maintenance spending has remained at more or less the same level in the face of cuts in local government funding that will reach 43% by 2015 is proof of that commitment."The deterioration of our roads and pavements is down to decades of underfunding from successive governments, recent severe winters and widespread flooding."Councils want to bring them fully up to scratch but need a fairer funding deal and greater government investment to allow this to happen."</body>

      <title>Payday lenders face tougher rules</title>
      <description>The UK's payday lenders have been warned that tougher regulation is on its way, to protect consumers.</description>

      <date>1380799198</date>
      <body>The UK's payday lenders have been warned that tougher regulation is on its way, to protect consumers.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed that all borrowers should have an "affordability" check before being given a loan.Among other new rules, the FCA wants to put risk warnings on adverts and marketing material.The payday industry gave the plans a guarded welcome, saying irresponsible lenders would struggle to comply.Martin Wheatley, the FCA's chief executive, said: "Today I'm putting payday lenders on notice: tougher regulation is coming and I expect them all to make changes so that consumers get a fair outcome. The clock is ticking."The proposals mean that anyone taking out a loan would need to prove that they could afford to repay it.In a separate government survey, one in five customers said they were not even asked about their finances when they applied for a payday loan.Among other proposals, the FCA suggested that:The FCA said it did not want to stop people using payday lenders, as they might turn to illegal loan sharks instead."We believe that payday lending has a place; many people make use of these loans and pay off their debt without a hitch, so we don't want to stop that happening," said Mr Wheatley.Business Minister Jo Swinson said the new rules would "call time on unscrupulous payday lenders". She said the industry had "failed to self-regulate effectively"."We warned the industry months ago that if it didn't get its house in order we would step in."The FCA said the risk warnings to be attached to adverts would be similar to those used by mortgage lenders, which remind borrowers that their home may be repossessed if they fall behind with payments.After the FCA takes over as the new regulator for consumer credit, in April 2014, it will also consider whether to put a cap, or limit, on the interest rates that lenders can charge.The government has decided against such a cap for the moment, but does not want to rule it out in the future.Previously the FCA has also said it will consider making rogue payday lenders reimburse customers where necessary.It has also said it might close firms down overnight if it needs to.The current regulator, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), wrote to 50 payday lenders earlier this year to see if they were suitable to continue in business.Nineteen lenders withdrew from the market as a result.A further six companies have stopped offering payday loans since, or have had their licences suspended by the OFT.But the FCA said that, despite the OFT campaign, the industry was still failing to respond.Despite 25 companies leaving the payday loans market, it is thought there are still more than 200 firms offering short-term loans within a matter of minutes.Many belong to the Consumer Finance Association (CFA).Under the CFA's code of conduct, roll-overs are permitted three times only.If borrowers default on their repayments for longer than 60 days, the amount they owe is frozen."As major lenders in the mainstream market, CFA members have always supported well-designed, well-implemented regulation in order to protect consumers and drive up standards," said Russell Hamblin-Boone, the CFA's chief executive.He added that the FCA's proposals were "an opportunity to set a bar over which irresponsible lenders will struggle to jump".The public consultation on the FCA's proposals will be open until 3 December.</body>

      <body>A UKIP candidate has lambasted former Deputy Prime Minister Lord Heseltine for branding the party "racist".The Tory peer's comments came after rows involving their former European Parliament member Godfrey Bloom.But Amjad Bashir, running for the European Parliament, told said he was "incensed" by Lord Heseltine.Speaking on BBC Two's Daily Politics, Mr Bashir, who is of Pakistani origin, asked: "If this was a racist party, would they select me?"UKIP, which calls for withdrawal from the European Union and greater restrictions on immigration, has enjoyed much-improved opinion poll ratings in recent months and is expected to gain seats at next year's European Parliament elections.But it has come under greater media scrutiny, with much focus on the description of countries receiving overseas aid as "bongo bongo land" by MEP Godfrey Bloom, who has since had the party whip withdrawn following separate comments about women.Lord Heseltine, appearing on Daily Politics on Wednesday, compared UKIP's appeal with that of one-time Conservative minister Enoch Powell and his 1968 anti-immigration "rivers of blood" speech and with the former French National Front leader Jean-Marie le Pen.He warned against an electoral pact between UKIP and the Conservatives, saying: "Beware of what happens to your pivotal vote in the centre ground."You always have these right-wing, racist operations pandering to the lowest common denominator in politics. That is what happens."Asked if this meant he was calling UKIP racist, he replied: "Of course it is racist. Of course, who doubts that? The language, the rhetoric, the membership - who doubts it?"However, Mr Bashir, a businessman, told the show: "I'm incensed that you've given this has-been politician the chance to come and level these accusations."He added: "We are a mainstream political party. We've got 30,000 members. We got over one million votes in the last election in May. We are a serious player and you cannot treat us like this."Mr Bashir also said: "Every time it's 'racism', 'racism', 'racism'. We are trying to have a serious debate about immigration... Michael Heseltine said yesterday that everyone was a racist. Here I am. Here's my ethnicity."He went on: "We've just selected someone to run for Orpington as our potential MP. He's of Indonesian origin and Muslim. Here I am as a potential MEP for Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire. Where is the racism?"I'm of Pakistani background. I've worked hard in this country for 53 years. Where is the racism? If this was a racist party, would they select me?"Asked about Mr Bloom's "bongo bongo land" comments, Mr Bashir said: "The party has distanced itself from those remarks, those two sentences... He's no longer going to run for the party."He called recent criticism of UKIP "political correctness gone mad", which was "stifling the debate on racism"."I'm someone of Pakistani background who lives in this country. I've experience racism. Lord Heseltine hasn't experienced these things. He doesn't know anything about racism," Mr Bashir said.</body>

      <body>Tony Blair is to help the Albanian government with its campaign for the country to join the European Union.The former UK prime minister said he would "love" the former Communist nation, one of the poorest in Europe, to be accepted.Albanian leader Edi Rama said Mr Blair, who is not receiving a fee, was "totally" committed to helping.The country has been criticised by EU officials previously for not doing enough to root out corruption.The EU added its 28th member state in July, with Croatia joining.Mr Blair, whose role will include lobbying officials and politicians, said it was "right and proper" for Albania to do the same.Speaking in the capital, Tirana, he added: "The orientation toward Europe is immensely important, and personally I'd love to see this country join the family of European nations."Albania first applied to do so in 2009, but the European Commission has postponed the opening of negotiations, with officials raising concerns over organised crime and a lack of progress in bringing in democratic reforms.Mr Rama's main campaign pledge ahead of his June landslide election victory was to push for EU integration.Speaking at the same press conference as Mr Blair, he said: "I harbour no illusions. European integration is easy to speak of but very hard to attain."He added that the Albanian government would not be paying for a team of Mr Blair's assistants, who will be stationed in Tirana, and that funding for them would be sought from international institutions.Mr Blair was prime minister from 1997 to 2007 and now works as a UN Middle East peace envoy.</body>

      <title>Tories may cut under-25s' benefits</title>
      <description>David Cameron suggests that out-of-work benefits paid to people under the age of 25 could be cut so all of them are either "earning or learning".</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24369514</url>
      <date>1380745590</date>
      <body>David Cameron has suggested benefits paid to people under the age of 25 could be cut in an effort to reduce long-term worklessness.In his speech to the Conservative conference, the prime minister promised to "nag and push and guide" young people away from a life on the dole.It was later confirmed that the government is reviewing policies for 16 to 25-year-olds.But Labour accused the Conservatives of a "desperate" lack of ideas.In his speech, Mr Cameron promised to create a "land of opportunity" by boosting business and reducing reliance on benefits.He also vowed to improve the education system and told party activists that there was still much work to do to fix the economic "mess" left by Labour.The latest figures from the Department of Work and Pensions showed 1.09 million people between the ages of 16 and 24 were not in work, education or training.The problem has proved stubbornly hard to tackle across Europe, with rates of youth unemployment soaring above 50% in Spain.Mr Cameron argued that action was needed in the UK, saying: "There are still over a million young people not in education, employment, or training."Today it is still possible to leave school, sign on, find a flat, start claiming housing benefit and opt for a life on benefits. It's time for bold action here."He promised the Conservatives would consider, as they write their manifesto for the 2015 general election, whether "that option should really exist at all".A Conservative source has told the BBC the manifesto will definitely contain a commitment to end the automatic entitlement to housing benefit for the under-25s, as suggested previously by Mr Cameron.In his speech, the prime minister criticised reliance on benefits, saying: "Instead we should give young people a clear, positive choice: Go to school. Go to college. Do an apprenticeship. Get a job."But just choose the dole? We've got to offer them something better than that."He added: "And let no one paint ideas like this as callous. Think about it: with your children, would you dream of just leaving them to their own devices, not getting a job, not training, nothing?"No - you'd nag and push and guide and do anything to get them on their way… and so must we. So this is what we want to see: everyone under 25 - earning or learning."During the week-long conference in Manchester, the Conservatives have announced plans to make the long-term unemployed undertake work placements if they want to continue receiving benefits.Mr Cameron did not set out any specific changes regarding under-25s during his 50-minute speech, but Education Secretary Michael Gove offered more detail when questioned on BBC Radio 4's The World at One.He announced that Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood was already reviewing the policies in place. He is expected to report his findings by the end of the year.Mr Gove said: "It is always going to be the case that there are some people for whom you need not so much a nudge as a dunt (a firm blow or stroke) towards the workplace."It's important also that we all recognise that welfare is there explicitly to help those people through hard times that it shouldn't become habituated."He said he would not pre-empt the policy review, adding: "I don't think any of us would want to take away any form of necessary support to young or old vulnerable people."However, unions warned that any cut in benefits would hurt the worst-off.TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: "Given the government's awful track record of helping young people find jobs, the prime minister's threat to ban the dole for under-25s will simply push hundreds of thousands of young people, including those with young families, even deeper into poverty."Young people suffered most in the recession. Today the prime minister has pledged that they will suffer most during the recovery too."The general secretary of the University and College Union, Sally Hunt, said: "What we need is a real plan at local and national level which provides sustainable and secure employment opportunities for young people and access to education which is useful and mind-broadening."Cheap headlines about lazy youngsters or cutting their benefits are no substitute for a strategy which is on the side of young people and allows them to realise their potential."A Labour spokesperson said: "This is an empty and a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that there was absolutely nothing in David Cameron's speech to deal with the cost-of-living crisis facing families."If the Conservatives really wanted to get young people off benefits, they'd be backing Labour's youth jobs guarantee, giving young people who've been out of work for over a year a job they must take or lose benefits."</body>

      <body>David Cameron vowed to get behind business to create a "land of opportunity for all", in his big speech to close the Conservative conference.His 50-minute address sought to set out dividing lines with "the 1970s-style socialism" he said Labour now offered.He claimed the economy was "turning the corner" and the "land of hope is Tory", while "the land of despair was Labour".Mr Cameron also hinted that benefits for under-25s could be cut in an effort to get more young people into work.But Labour said the prime minister had failed to address the "cost-of-living crisis" and offered a land of opportunity "for just a privileged few".During the 50-minute speech, Mr Cameron contrasted his own party's philosophy with that of the opposition, saying: "If Labour's plan for jobs is to attack business, ours is to back business."He criticised Labour leader Ed Miliband, who promised in his end-of-conference address last week to freeze energy prices and increase corporate tax on big firms, telling Tory activists that "profits, tax cuts and enterprise... are not dirty, elitist words".Mr Cameron argued that adding more state borrowing and spending to ease the "cost-of-living crisis" would risk putting the UK on the economic trajectory of Greece."It's all sticking plasters and quick fixes cobbled together for the TV cameras - Red Ed and his Blue Peter economy, " said the prime minister.Earlier in the week, Chancellor George Osborne announced plans to make the long-term unemployed undertake work placements if they want to continue receiving benefits.In his speech, Mr Cameron did not make any specific policy announcements, but suggested his party was looking at further changes to the welfare system to include in its manifesto for the 2015 general election.It was wrong that young people could "choose the dole" and right to "offer them something better".Mr Cameron added: "And let no one paint ideas like this as callous."Think about it: with your children, would you dream of just leaving them to their own devices, not getting a job, not training, nothing?"No - you'd nag and push and guide and do anything to get them on their way… and so must we. So this is what we want to see: everyone under 25 - earning or learning."Mr Cameron, who did not repeat previous no-notes speeches, often looked straight into the lens of the TV camera to address directly the audience outside the Manchester conference centre.The BBC's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said it was a surprisingly sober speech in parts, with Mr Cameron stressing there was still much work to do to fix Britain's economy.It was not enough just to clean up Labour's "mess" and pay off the deficit, he wanted to "build something better in its place".He added: "In place of the casino economy, one where people who work hard can actually get on; in place of the welfare society, one where no individual is written off; in place of the broken education system, one that gives every child the chance to rise up and succeed."Mr Cameron invoked the spirit of his predecessor Margaret Thatcher, the winner of three general elections, who died earlier this year, saying she had "made our country stand tall again, at home and abroad".He also made efforts to distance his party, and himself, from the Liberal Democrats, with whom the Tories have ruled in coalition for more than three years.He promised: "When the election comes, we won't be campaigning for a coalition, we will be fighting heart and soul for a majority Conservative government - because that is what our country needs..."This party at its heart is about big people, strong communities, responsible businesses, a bigger society - not a bigger state."To cheers, Mr Cameron attacked the Lib Dems for "trying to take all the credit" for lowering the minimum earnings threshold at which people start paying income tax.He joked: "Well, memo to the Lib Dems: you lecturing us on low taxes is like us lecturing you on pointless constitutional tinkering."We are Tories, we believe in low taxes and, believe me, we will keep on cutting the taxes of hard-working people in our country."Mr Cameron received a standing ovation after the speech, his ninth to conference since becoming leader in 2005.But, afterwards, Labour leader Ed Miliband said the prime minister had offered nothing to address "the cost-of-living crisis facing Britain's hard-working families".The Lib Dems said they, not the Conservatives, had made a manifesto commitment in 2010 to raise the level at which people start paying tax to £10,000.And UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the pro-business message conflicted with the reality that membership of the EU was costing the UK "billions in red tape and direct payments from high taxes".But there was a more favourable response from business groups, with CBI director-general John Cridland saying the prime minister had "sent out a strong message about how vital British business is to the future prosperity of people across the UK".Simon Walker, director-general of the Institute of Directors also welcomed the speech, but warned that firms would "be looking for him to match the sentiment with action - if tax cuts aren't dirty, let's have a few more of them".</body>

      <title>Miliband: We'll freeze energy prices</title>
      <description>Ed Miliband tells his party conference Labour will freeze energy prices if they get into power - but energy firms criticise the plan.</description>

      <body>Labour would freeze gas and electricity bills for every home and business in the UK for 20 months if it wins the 2015 election, Ed Miliband has said.The big energy firms would be split up and governed by a new tougher regulator to give people "a fairer deal".Labour says the move will save average households £120 and businesses £1,800 - but cost the energy giants £4.5bn.But energy companies said the policy could lead to power shortages, and jeopardise investment and jobs.The Labour leader said firms had been overcharging "for too long" and it was time to "reset" the energy market.The Tories accused him of a "sleight of hand", saying people would have to "pay more for their electricity" under the plans.Speaking for more than hour without notes at his party's annual conference in Brighton, Mr Miliband set out his vision of how "Britain can do better" under Labour, with an economy that works for "ordinary people once again".In other developments at Labour's conference:Mr Miliband used his speech to pledge action on what he has called Britain's "cost of living crisis", setting out an alternative vision of Britain's economy to that pursued by the Conservatives, with higher skills and wages."David Cameron talks about Britain being in a global race. But what he doesn't tell you is that he thinks the only way Britain can win is for you to lose."Mr Miliband said that means "the lowest wages, the worst terms and conditions, and the fewest rights at work - a race to the bottom", adding: "The only way we can win is in a race to the top."In an upbeat speech peppered with swipes at David Cameron and George Osborne for being out touch and lacking aspiration for the country, Mr Miliband repeatedly used the phrase "We're Britain, we're better than this" to cheers and applause from Labour activists.He received standing ovations for defending the NHS and promising to axe "the bedroom tax" - and tackled Tory criticism that he lacks leadership skills head-on, saying: "If they want to have a debate about leadership and character - be my guest."Unlike David Cameron, he told the party faithful, he had stood up to vested interests on media regulation and the tobacco lobby and made the right call on Syria. There was no mention in the speech of Mr Cameron's coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats.Explaining what he believes has gone wrong with the economy under the coalition, he said: "Too many of the jobs we're creating in this country are just too low paid, too many of the gains in our economy are just scooped up by the privileged few, including those big bonuses, and too often you are left being charged over the odds."They used to say 'a rising tide lifts all boats'. Now the rising tide just seems to lift yachts."The Labour leader has used his week in Brighton to set out some of the policies on which he will fight the next election but saved what is likely to be one of the centrepieces of the manifesto for his big speech.He vowed to abolish energy watchdog Ofgem and replace it with a new regulatory regime that ensures customers get a "fair deal"."We will legislate for this in our first Queen's Speech and it will come into effect in 2017," the Labour leader told activists."But in the meantime I am not willing to just stand by. So the next Labour government will freeze gas and electricity prices until the start of 2017."Your bills will be frozen, benefitting millions of families and millions of businesses. That's what I mean by a government that fights for you, that's what I mean when I say: Britain can do better than this."The companies won't like it because it will cost them money. But they have been overcharging people for too long because of a market that doesn't work. It is time to reset the market."Labour says the energy giants have been overcharging customers to the tune of £3.9bn since 2010 by not passing on reductions in wholesale prices to consumers.The party denies that the policy is a return to discredited "price controls" of the 1970s, arguing it is a temporary measure aimed at helping consumers while the party sets up a new regulator, which would force firms to openly sell their wholesale energy in a pooled market.But RWE npower, one of the big six energy firms targeted by Labour, criticised what it said were "easy", "simple solutions"."In reality, there are three main factors that influence prices - fixing inefficient housing stock, the investment required to replace the UK's energy infrastructure, and the cost of the buying energy on the global market," said chief executive Paul Massara.Another firm, SSE, said bills were rising because of "well-intentioned" government initiatives, not fuel costs.Chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said: "Instead of price freezes which will lead to unsustainable loss-making retail businesses, the Labour Party should put policy costs into general taxation, taking them off energy bills."Angela Knight, of industry body Energy UK, said freezing prices could hit the sector, making "energy shortages a reality, pushing up the prices for everyone".In his speech Mr Miliband also pledged to help small firms by freezing business rates in England, paid for by halting a planned increase in UK-wide corporation tax for large companies.And he said that by 2020 under Labour 200,000 houses would be built a year, with a fresh generation of new towns and "garden cities".An incoming Labour government would also scrap the £1,3bn Energy Companies Obligation, launched earlier this year to make the energy giants improve efficiency, and replace it with a more "cost-effective" regime.Unite union general secretary Len McCluskey said he was "pleased" with some of the issues raised by Mr Miliband."The most important thing was he highlighted the problems with the minimum wage and low pay and that fact that wage depression is something that needs to be tackled," he added.But John Longworth, from the British Chambers of Commerce, said talking about "controlling prices and wages sends a very bad signal" to businesses.John Cridland, from the CBI, said the plan "will deter much-needed investment" and would be viewed by business as "a setback for Labour's pro-enterprise credentials".Every Labour activist in the hall was given a copy of a book called One Nation Economy after the leader's speech.</body>

      <title>We must stay in government - Clegg</title>
      <description>The Lib Dems must be part of a coalition government after the next election to stop the Tories or Labour "messing up", Nick Clegg tells his party conference.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24137394</url>
      <date>1379527774</date>
      <body>Nick Clegg has urged the British people to put the Liberal Democrats back in government in 2015 to curb the excesses of the Tories or Labour."We are the only party that can finish the job of economic recovery, but finish it fairly," he told the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow.After three years of coalition Britain was now a "step closer" to the death of single party government, he claimed.He also spoke at length about his family and personal values.The BBC News Channel's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said Mr Clegg stuck to the argument he has been making all week - namely that coalition government works and the Lib Dems want another go at it.In a 51-minute speech aimed at preventing the Conservatives from claiming all the credit for the economic upturn, Mr Clegg said Lib Dem policies such as infrastructure spending and more apprenticeships had made all the difference."The big question mark that has always hung over the Liberal Democrats - could we handle government? And handle it when the going got tough? - that question mark is now gone."This recovery wouldn't be happening without us."He said Lib Dems had proved wrong the critics who said coalition would never work - but he also looked ahead to the next election, saying that "left to their own devices" Labour or the Tories would "mess it up".Speaking openly about forming a power sharing deal with the two bigger parties - something he avoided doing before the last election - he said: "Labour would wreck the recovery. The Conservatives would give us the wrong kind of recovery."He listed a series of Conservative policies which he claimed the Lib Dems had blocked, including "inheritance tax cuts for millionaires, profit-making in schools, firing workers at will, regional pay for public sector workers, scrapping housing benefit for young people, ditching the human rights act and closing down the debate on Trident".But he stressed that the Lib Dems were "no-one's little brother", adding: "We have our own values and beliefs."The speech contained no new policies, following Tuesday's headline-grabbing announcement on free lunches for all children in their first three years at school in England.Saying Lib Dems would extend the scheme to all primary school children, he said: "Their (the Conservatives) priority is to help some families over others, with a tax break for married couples."That tells you everything you need to know about their values."By contrast, he said his party was helping "young children get the best possible start in life, and that tells you everything about ours".The Lib Dem leadership have seen off challenges from activists to its nuclear weapons and economic policies, although delegates voted for a review of housing benefit rules - what critics call the "bedroom tax".And he scoffed at suggestions that coalition was all about personal chemistry between the party leaders, saying any coalition depended on the result of the election.In what will be seen as a hint that he is thinking of stepping down after the next election, he told activists in Glasgow that he "will not be in politics forever".But he used the speech to set out how his liberal values came to be formed, his "privileged" childhood and his "internationalist" outlook.He said the Lib Dems had always backed "home rule" for Scotland but would be urging a "no" vote in next year's independence referendum to keep the UK together.But he hoped the cross-party consensus would continue after the referendum to push for "the next advance in Scottish devolution".And he said the Lib Dems would be the party of "in" when it came to an EU referendum.Summing up what his pitch would be at the next election, he said: "In the past the Liberal Democrats would eke out an existence on the margins of British politics."Now we hold the liberal centre while our opponents head left and right. I have spent my entire life watching the other two mess it up. We cannot stand idly by and let them do it all over again."Lib Dem colleagues praised Mr Clegg's "intensely personal speech" but Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman said that, far from restraining the Conservatives, the Lib Dems had backed them all the way."He didn't mention the million young people out of work on his watch, the tax cuts for millionaires his party helped to introduce, or the cost of living crisis that means that since he became deputy prime minister wages are down an average of £1,500 a year," she added."Nothing he said today made any difference to the fact that Nick Clegg is propping up a Tory-led government that's making things worse for ordinary families."</body>

      <title>We want Britain back, says Farage</title>
      <description>UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage calls for an immediate EU exit, telling his party's conference the UK could go it alone.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24163335</url>
      <date>1379689172</date>
      <body>Britain would flourish outside the EU, Nigel Farage has said, predicting UKIP will cause a "political earthquake" in European elections next year.Addressing the party's annual conference, he said leaving the union would "open a door to the world".He described his party as the "true Europeans" as he claimed credit for shifting the terms of the debate on immigration and holding a referendum.But the speech was overshadowed by a row over remarks by MEP Godfrey Bloom.Mr Bloom has had the whip removed after he referred to a group of female activists as "sluts" - although he maintained that it was meant and taken as a joke.UKIP has reached unprecedented heights in the opinion polls under Mr Farage, coming second in the European elections in 2009 and winning hundreds of seats in the May local elections.Mr Farage has refused to predict how the party's Westminster candidates would fare in an election in 2015 but said he wants to turn the next European elections "into a referendum on EU membership"."My ambition and my conviction is that we can come first across the United Kingdom," he told activists."Let us send an earthquake through Westminster politics and let's say we want our country back."The party has sought to broaden its appeal beyond its core message of EU withdrawal, announcing policies in recent days on energy and welfare.But, in a speech dominated by Europe, Mr Farage said the European Commission had "hijacked" the EU's original ideals and the UK would begin a process of "national renewal" by going its own way.Those who warn that British trade would be harmed by a UK exit were the "true voices of Little England", he told party members."Those 10,000 trucks a day coming in from the Continent bringing goods into this country. They won't stop coming," he said."The idea that the EU will start a trade war with Britain is simply not credible. The real reason the EU won't be able or willing to stop trading with us is that the German car industry won't allow it."UKIP was growing in strength and, by the time of the next election, Mr Farage said it would be the third largest party in the country in terms of membership, overtaking the Liberal Democrats.The party is meeting just days after one of its former deputy leaders quit the organisation, frustrated by what he had described as its "totalitarian" leadership.Mike Nattrass, West Midlands MEP and a member for 15 years, accused Mr Farage of silencing dissent and surrounding himself with "cronies".But Mr Farage, by far the party's best-known figure, outlined his popularity with voters, saying in his speech: "They are fed up to the back teeth with the cardboard cut-out careerists in Westminster, the spot-the-difference politicians... the politicians who daren't say what they really mean."While there was no mention of the members who quit in protest at his leadership, he acknowledged internal clashes.Mr Farage told party members he had a "blistering row" with Godfrey Bloom, the UKIP MEP who courted controversy recently by claiming British foreign aid goes to "bongo-bongo land".Alluding to the comments, he referred to "public pronouncements that I would not always choose myself" and urged those with passionate views to focus on the "big messages".Immigration was the "biggest single issue facing" the UK, he said, as he warned of an "even darker side to the opening of the door".He claimed London had been gripped by a "Romanian crime wave"."This gets to the heart of immigration," he said. "We should not be opening our doors on 1 January to Romanian criminal gangs."The "Establishment" had dismissed anyone wanting to debate immigration as "bad and racist", he claimed.UKIP gained 16.5% of the popular vote, second only to the Conservatives, in the 2009 European elections and returned 13 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs).But, at the 2010 general election, support dwindled to 3.1% and UKIP did not win a Westminster seat.Earlier on Friday, the party's energy spokesman Roger Helmer announced it would invest profits from shale gas extraction in a sovereign wealth fund.The two-day conference is also set to discuss plans to ensure migrants have private health insurance and for social housing to be prioritised for people whose parents or grandparents were born locally.</body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: 2013 Party conferences</title>
      <description>A guide to what goes on at the political parties' autumn conferences.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24052129</url>
      <date>1379521029</date>
      <body>The autumn political party conference season is upon us. Here is our guide to them.What are party conferences?They are annual events where MPs, local councillors and ordinary party members gather to hear speeches, debate policy and socialise with like-minded souls.Why do they have them?Party conferences used to be all about policy debates and votes on the conference floor. These days the emphasis is more on big set piece speeches and policy announcements. It is a chance for the party leadership to dominate news coverage for a few days and boost the morale of their supporters. Or, if it doesn't go to plan, fend off leadership challenges and plots. There have been proposals over the years to reduce them in size, or only hold them in the year before an election, but they are popular with the membership and a useful source of income for cash-strapped parties.So what actually happens?They are four or five day festivals of democracy. Like Glastonbury for political obsessives. At any one time there will be dozens of speeches and debates taking place - some in the main hall in the full glare of the TV cameras, but many more in stuffy hotel conference rooms and lecture theatres on the conference "fringe". The whole thing takes place within a security cordon, giving it a slightly unreal atmosphere. There is also a thriving social scene based around the bars and restaurants of the main conference hotels. Drinks receptions and dinners go on late into the night. It is the only chance grassroots members get to rub shoulders with the big names at the top of their party.Where are this year's big three conferences?The Liberal Democrats were first up, gathering in Glasgow for five days from Saturday, 14 September. Labour start their four day event on Sunday, 22 September, in Brighton. The Conservatives meet for four days from Sunday, 29 September in Manchester.Who goes to them?It is more than just politicians and party members. At each conference there is a large exhibition hall where businesses, charities, local authorities and other groups hire stalls in the hope of catching the attention of a passing decision maker. There are also mini-shopping malls, with book, food and even clothes shops. Hundreds of journalists also attend, from the Westminster press pack to local paper and trade journalists and bloggers. The big party conferences also attract visiting dignitaries from abroad and the occasional TV celebrity.Can anyone attend?No. Security is very tight and you must apply weeks in advance for a pass.How big are the events?Huge. Conservative and Labour conferences regularly attract upwards of 10,000 attendees while the Lib Dems have seen a big jump in attendance since they entered government in 2010.Aren't they normally at the seaside?They used to be. But the trend now is to hold them in one of Britain's major metropolitan cities. However, Brighton came back on to the roster in 2012 after a couple of years' absence.What difference can the conferences make?The days when conferences decided what went in the next general election manifesto are, for the most part, gone, although the amount of say ordinary members get varies between parties. Labour and the Lib Dems still hold votes on policy motions. For the big parties it is largely all about media coverage but a conference speech can still make or break a party leader or act as a springboard to a fledgling career. With so many journalists and politicians in close proximity they are also a great chance to plot and often set the tone for the next few months at Westminster.What's particularly on the agenda this year?With a general election less than two years away, the talk will be all about winning votes in 2015. Labour leader Ed Miliband is under pressure to unveil the results of a long-awaited policy review and will also be keen to prepare the ground for a special conference next year to debate his trade union reforms. The Lib Dems and Tories were expected to announce new government policies to prove the coalition has not run out of steam - but,as seen with the Lib Dems, they have also begun the process of uncoupling themselves in the minds of voters by setting out a few of their own distinctive policies.What about other parties' conferences?The UK Independence Party meets at the Westminster Central Hall, in London, for two days starting on Friday, 20 September. Plaid Cymru meets in Aberystwyth for two days, from Friday, 11 October. The Scottish National Party's annual conference is from 17 to 20 October in Perth. The Green Party of England and Wales conference was the first, being held for two days from Friday 13 September.</body>

      <title>EU body withdraws peace centre money</title>
      <description>A European Union funding programme withdraws its offer of £18m in financial support for the peace centre at the former Maze Prison in Northern Ireland.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-24399418</url>
      <date>1380902849</date>
      <body>An EU funding programme has withdrawn its offer of £18m in financial support for the peace centre at the former Maze prison in Northern Ireland.The Special European Programmes Body said it had done so after consulting with the lead partner - the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister.They said they decided, after the talks, that the centre was no longer viable.The Maze housed paramilitary prisoners during the Troubles from 1971 - 2000.Ten republican prisoners died on hunger strike there.Over the years, the scheme to redevelop the former prison site, near Lisburn in County Antrim, has been controversial.First Minister Peter Robinson said: "What the SEUPB is doing is the sensible and practical step of ensuring the money doesn't find itself going down some black hole."It allows them time to look at other projects and spend the money elsewhere."He added: "When we looked at the issue of the peace centre we made it very clear that what was required was to get support across the community, that there had to be a broad level of support, and of course if at any time that is achieved then there are other opportunities for funding."But at this stage it's very clear that the SEUPB doesn't believe that it's possible to get it within the period of time necessary."I don't think there's any difficulty whether it's Europe or whether it's elsewhere that we go for the funding - if there was the level of support that's necessary, I'm pretty sure the funding would fit into place very quickly."Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said on BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme that he was disappointed at the withdrawal of funding and added that he had not given up on the project."I still hold out hope that at some stage we'll see it constructed at Long Kesh. I will authorise no other projects (apart from Royal Ulster Agricultural Society's move to the site) on that site until people come to their senses," he said."What is at the heart of this is power-sharing. From my perspective I want to share power but I can't do it on my own."The peace centre is a government commitment which has to be honoured. If it isn't, then it damages the power-sharing project."The peace money will now be re-allocated to other projects.These will be based in either Northern Ireland or the border counties of the Republic of Ireland.BBC Northern Ireland political editor Mark Devenport said: "They may have some difficulties finding other projects because it was by far and away one of the biggest projects to be funded by that programme but they are now looking around to see how they can spend that money."During the summer, First Minister Peter Robinson stalled the plans to build the peace centre as part of the development of the site of the former Maze prison, a decision that caused tension between his party, the DUP, and Sinn Féin.Mr Robinson said there needed to be a broad consensus on how it would operate and what it would contain - and that is currently absent, in his view.On Monday, Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said there could be no development of the wider Maze site unless it was on the basis of previous agreements about the building of a peace centre.In its statement on Friday, the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) said: "The SEUPB has been in discussions with the lead partner in relation to the viability of the Peace Building and Conflict Resolution Centre."It has been agreed that the project is no longer viable at this time and the SEUPB has therefore rescinded the letter of offer. The SEUPB will now consider the re-allocation of funding to suitable projects."The European Commissioner for Regional Policy, Johannes Hahn, said: "This is a project which we supported as a contribution to the reconciliation of the communities in Northern Ireland."Sadly, due to the political conditions on the ground it cannot go ahead in this period."To be meaningful all communities have to be involved - that unfortunately is not the case. I very much hope we can try again with this project and that for the time being the money from it can be used to fund other projects."Last week, Daniel Libeskind, the architect who designed the proposed peace building and reconciliation centre, said he was convinced the scheme would go ahead.Ulster Unionist Tom Elliott, who attended a meeting on Friday morning at which the SEUPB made the announcement, said the one thing he took "significant comfort" from was that the £18m would not be lost to Northern Ireland.He said the SEUPB assured those at the meeting that there were a number of other projects that would be eligible for the funding.John Armstrong of the Construction Employers Federation (CEF) said it was another blow to the industry."Every project that is stalled or scrapped is costing jobs and hindering economic recovery," he said.</body>

      <title>Greens 'key' to securing Yes vote</title>
      <description>The Scottish Greens could play a crucial role in convincing Scots to vote for independence in next year's referendum, the party's conference is told.</description>

      <body>The Scottish Greens could play a key role in convincing Scots to vote for independence in next year's referendum, the party's conference has been told.Co-convener Patrick Harvie said "canny" voters would not be persuaded into voting Yes next September with "flags, bribes or fearmongering".He said Scots could be won over with a "radical vision" of what the country could be like after leaving the UK.Mr Harvie was speaking as the two-day conference opened in Inverness.The people of Scotland will be asked the straight yes/no question "Should Scotland be an independent country?" when they vote in the independence referendum on 18 September 2014.At last year's conference members voted to endorse the cross-party Yes Scotland campaign for independence.At the same time the party agreed to form its own pro-independence campaign, designed to promote its distinct policies.Mr Harvie, one of the Greens' two MSPs at Holyrood, said: "Many Scots remain undecided on independence and they have every right to take their time, as creating a new country is undoubtedly a radical step."These canny voters won't be persuaded by flags, bribes or fearmongering but I believe they will respond to a radical vision for a better Scotland and the Scottish Greens are crucial to outlining that vision."Taking responsibility and bringing power closer to the people is a core Green principle, and our conference is a chance for us to galvanise our party and amplify our message."He added: "This is a big decision about Scotland's long-term future."As Greens we're used to thinking big and it's in our DNA to think ahead, so let's seize the day."Mr Harvie argued that at this time the "Green vision for Scotland has never been more important", adding that his party offered "the vision of a renewed economy that works for the many rather than the few and a sustainable society that cares about future generations".He said: "The clock is ticking on the need to tackle climate change and a Green Scotland would be better placed to develop the low-carbon society we need."</body>

      <body>Language campaigners say they will start a campaign of non-violent direct action unless government policies to protect Welsh are put in place.The motion with a deadline of February 2014 was passed at the Welsh Language Society's (Cymdeithas Yr Iaith's) annual meeting in Carno, Powys.The 2011 census figures showed a drop in the number of Welsh speakers.The Welsh government said it was committed to seeing the language prosper.A Welsh government spokesperson said: "Cymdeithas must understand that those in government are as committed to growing the Welsh language and increasing the number of Welsh speakers as they are."This is not the 1960s or 70s."Welsh Language Society chairman Robin Farrar said: "Nearly a year has passed since we saw the results of the census, and since then there has been a lot of talk and discussion about the situation regarding the language."There is by now a consensus that the Welsh language is facing an emergency and that we need big policy changes."We have said since the publication of the census results that we can't sit back and accept the consequences, with positive campaigning and political will we can change our destiny and the destinies of our Welsh language communities."If the government refuses to act on the six points we have outlined we will take direct but non-violent action."We have drawn up a list of people who are willing to act - campaigns like this have worked in the past and we're ready to do it again."The Welsh government spokesperson added: "We are committed to promoting the Welsh language and since the census results we have been taking action. "He said measures included a national conversation on the language, which gave everyone a chance to have their say on how best to secure its future."We have commissioned a number of reviews and studies, and will be receiving their reports soon. This autumn we will also be launching an information campaign for Welsh medium education."Meanwhile, we will be working with all those with an interest in the language to ensure it continues to thrive throughout Wales."</body>

      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21013771</url>
      <date>1358939858</date>
      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant?What has happened?Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning.Why the big deal about the speech?Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech.So what did Cameron say?Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech.What sorts of powers does the UK want back?The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK."Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders?The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK.So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU?David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market."What has been the reaction in the UK?Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement.Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party.The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts.What about the reaction around Europe?The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction.What about the reaction from business?A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".Where can I get more detail on the speech?If you click on the link below you can read the whole text, with key bits picked out and analysed by BBC expertsAnnotated transcipt: Key excerpts</body>

      <description>The details of Labour leader Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet following the recent reshuffle.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11494915</url>
      <date>1337253895</date>
      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his wide-ranging reshuffle.The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction.Launched a two year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. Faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to phone hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire.The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton.As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later became schools secretary and narrowly held onto his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper.Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children.The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign.Best known for his stunning victory over Michael Portillo - then Defence Secretary and potential future Tory leader - in the 1997 general election. Mr Twigg himself was ousted from Enfield Southgate by a Conservative in 2005, but returned to Parliament in 2010, parachuted into the very safe Labour seat of Liverpool West Derby. Served as minister for school standards under Tony Blair and shadow Foreign Office minister in Ed Miliband's first opposition front bench, he was the first openly gay MP in the Commons. In a previous life, he was head of the National Union of Students. The then 44-year-old was promoted to the shadow cabinet in October 2011.Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. Rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. Keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet, he returned to his previous love, health in 2011.Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development.Probably best known for leaving a note to his successor as chief secretary to the Treasury before the 2010 election saying "I'm afraid there is no money left". The then 39-year-old was forced to apologise, saying he did not want to appear "flippant" about the deficit. This was an uncharacteristic slip from someone who rose smoothly through the ministerial ranks after being elected in 2004, taking on the high-profile immigration brief after the foreign prisoners scandal in 2006. One of few senior Labour figures with a business background, he was a merchant banker before launching his own technology firm. Interests include half marathons, church architecture and astronomy.A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader.As the son of former Labour cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest.One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending, but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress.A Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign, he has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football.The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing". Like many leading female MPs, the former union worker entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide. Responsible for the controversial eco-town project as housing minister before becoming Europe minister in 2008. Supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011.One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. A keen chess player, she supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leaders of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.At a youthful 31, the MP for Leeds West was elected to Parliament in 2010 and appointed shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament.Sister of Angela but chose to support Ed Miliband in the leadership contest. Ms Eagle was a solicitor in Liverpool before entering Parliament in 1997. Held a series of ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including children's minister and equalities minister. Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player.When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before. The Wakefield MP worked for the European Parliament and in academia before entering Parliament in 2005. A keen Europhile, she is fluent in French and Italian. Worked as parliamentary private secretary to Andy Burnham but voted for David Miliband in the leadership contest.Former charity worker and chief executive of the Manchester Jewish Federation, Mr Lewis held a string of junior ministerial posts in the Labour government after becoming an MP in 1997 at the age of 31. He started out as a parliamentary private secretary to then trade secretary Stephen Byers, before going on to be an education minister, Treasury minister, health minister and international development minister. Most recently, he was minister of state at the Foreign Office. His previous shadow cabinet role was as culture spokesman in which he was a vocal campaigner on phone hacking.Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. But when that constituency was torn up in boundary changes she made the move to Westminster in 2010. Under her, Labour took back Glasgow East having lost it in a stunning by-election defeat by the SNP in 2008. In Holyrood, she held various posts, including Minister for Communities, overseeing the executive's flagship anti-social behaviour laws. Before entering politics she was a lecturer in community education. The then 52-year-old took up her first full shadow cabinet role in October 2011.The West Bromwich MP rose to prominence with his dogged pursuit of the phone-hacking issue, becoming the number one thorn in News International's side. He has used his position on the influential culture select committee - something he has maintained despite his party post - to grill newspaper representatives. He has also raised the matter time and again in the House of Commons, demanding more action from police and Parliament. Mr Watson was a defence minister under Tony Blair but resigned in 2006, calling for Mr Blair to step down. That personal stand saw him accused of conspiring with Gordon Brown. An avid Tweeter and blogger, the then 41-year-old returned to government when Mr Brown became PM as digital enhancement minister.Gordon Brown's former parliamentary aide, who previously attended shadow cabinet as a junior minister, became a full member as shadow Cabinet Office minister in Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle. The then 61-year-old MP for Hemsworth took on the role from Tessa Jowell.One of Labour's true stalwarts, Ms Jowell, born in 1947, held ministerial office throughout the Blair and Brown years, holding briefs in the health and education departments. As culture secretary from 2001, she played a key role in bringing the Olympics to London in 2012 and is now shadowing that brief in the run-up to the Games. Also shadow minister for London, she supported David Miliband in the leadership election.Former BBC radio producer and special adviser who has risen quickly through the ranks. The then 40-year-old was elected in 2010 for Pontypridd, but previously stood unsuccessfully in the 2006 Blaenau Gwent by-election where he lost to independent Dai Davies. He supported Ed Miliband for the leadership and was given a role in his shadow team five months after entering the House, first as shadow Wales minister and then in the shadow Treasury team. This is his first shadow cabinet role.The MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted smoking cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip.The then 52-year-old was elected unopposed in a ballot for chief whip in 2010.

      <title>Are lobbyists taking over party conferences?</title>
      <description>How lobbyists are taking over conferences</description>

      <body>The party faithful are an increasingly rare breed at party conferences, amid an ever-growing army of lobbyists and PR people. What are they all doing there?It is probably the nearest public relations gets to rock and roll.Packing your suitcase, kissing your tearful children goodbye and heading off for a month on the road.It is the same blur of cavernous city centre venues, late nights, too much booze and dodgy hotel rooms, although rock bands probably consume fewer canapes."It is a bit of a wrench because the littlest is very little," said mother-of-four Claire Burton, speaking at the Lib Dem conference."I suppose if you are going to be doing a job, working with some of the most vulnerable people in society, then a little bit of sacrifice is OK."Claire is head of business development at Langley House Trust, which helps to resettle ex-offenders.Like thousands of other lobbyists she is going to the three main conferences this year.What does her organisation get out of it?"I think it has various uses. If you have something specific to say. If you've got a particular cause that you need to promote. But you have to be quite focused."You have to know who you want to talk to. You have to know exactly what you want to say to them and at the end of the day it might not be of any interest to them at all."Many organisations - from small charities to corporate giants - will splash out on a stand in the exhibition hall, or sponsor a fringe meeting, which can cost thousands of pounds.Many more will simply get a conference pass to hang about in the bars and restaurants, or set up private meetings with MPs."Some people say you can achieve just as much by setting up meetings with MPs or ministers at Westminster, for less expense," said Simon Butler, parliamentary liaison officer for The Sport and Recreation Alliance, at the Labour conference."But I think there is something about being at conference that makes politicians more receptive to new ideas and debate."But is all this lobbying and schmoozing strictly ethical?There are plenty who will argue it is sucking the life out of party conferences, which are, after all, meant to be festivals of democracy and political debate.Ben Harris Quinney, chairman of Tory think tank the Bow Group, is among those who believe it has gone too far."Conference is now populated by lobbyists, not members. It offers no freedom and no democratic rights to a membership who barely recognise or connect with what the Party has now become," he says.Much of the lobbying activity is, at least, out in the open. It is always fun to spot some of the less fashionable causes that have hired stands in the hope of burnishing their image in the eyes of a passing decision-maker.Tobacco giant Philip Morris had a stand at the Labour Party conference in Brighton, to make the case against smuggling, but they were not welcome at the Conservative gathering a week later in Manchester.The British Fur Trade Association, on the other hand, is at the Tory conference this week but was not welcome at Labour, apparently.It is unlikely any minister will have risked being pictured at these stands due to the controversial nature of their products but, for others, particularly those who do a lot of business with the government, the ministerial visit is a highlight of the week.In fact it is almost part of the package. The Conservative conference organisers send a photographer along to record the handshakes and grins for a souvenir CD.But just like at Westminster, the real power-broking, and influence-peddling, goes on behind closed doors in private dinners and closed fringe meetings.This happens at all party conferences, although it was still a slight surprise to see the Conservatives promoting a private lounge area, the Blue Room, where corporate guests can rub shoulders with cabinet ministers and senior party officials for a minimum fee of £20,000 plus VAT.The Conservatives have certainly got the commercial side of conference down to a fine art.They are the only one of the big three to have a mini shopping mall in the exhibition hall, with upmarket brands such as Harvey Nichols and Crombie competing for a slice of the blue pound.But it would be unfair to single the Conservatives out for using conference as a cash cow.A quick glance at the commercial opportunities available at Labour's annual conference, from £10,000 to advertise on "eco-friendly" conference bags to £450 for a quarter page ad in the conference brochure, reveals a party every bit as alive to marketing opportunities.In fact, Labour charges more for a "hotel room key drop" than the Conservatives."Have our key Conference guests wake up to your message by getting your flyer delivered overnight direct to their bedrooms," explains the Labour brochure. A snip, surely, at £2,000 (The Tories charge £1,750).The fact is, conferences are a huge money spinner for all the parties.In 2012, The Conservative Party made £4.3m from them - getting on for a third of its total income. The Lib Dems made a more modest £1.5m. Labour does not list its income from conferences in its accounts, but it made £3.4m from "commercial activity".And it is not just the "big three" London-based parties.As the Westminster press pack gets ready to head home from Manchester on Wednesday, after David Cameron's big speech, the commercial caravan moves on to Perth, in central Scotland, where the SNP are holding their annual shindig.That's rock and roll...</body>

      <description>Do people get their political views from their parents?</description>

      <body>Labour Party leader Ed Miliband is locked in a row with the Daily Mail over his father's views. But to what extent do our mothers and fathers shape our political opinions?Many people's first exposure to political debate wasn't watching Question Time or reading newspaper reports about the House of Commons or the US Congress.It was at the dinner table or in the family front room, with a parent cursing conservatives or muttering darkly about socialists.Labour leader Ed Miliband's upbringing fitted this pattern better than most. His father Ralph was a left-wing academic, his mother Marion a campaigner for progressive causes.Now this family history has become the focus of a bitter media spat. On Saturday, the Daily Mail ran a profile of Ralph Miliband under the headline: "The man who hated Britain". After offering his son the right of reply, the paper repeated the original article and ran a leader describing the deceased lecturer's legacy as "evil".For its part, the paper justified the attack by arguing that Ralph Miliband's political views had been passed down the generations."We do not maintain, like the jealous God of Deuteronomy, that the iniquity of the fathers should be visited on the sons," its leader says. "But when a son with prime ministerial ambitions swallows his father's teachings, as the younger Miliband appears to have done, the case is different."The Labour leader has reacted furiously.He insisted his politics were markedly different from those of his Marxist father: "I have pursued a different path and I have a different vision." He also said he was "appalled" by the Mail's "character assassination" of a man who had served in the Royal Navy during World War II after escaping Nazi persecution.The dispute raises the question of the extent to which people's politics are shaped by the influence of their families.Many of those who have backed Miliband in the row have followed the Mail's logic by pointing out that the first Viscount Rothermere, great-grandfather of its present owner, met Hitler and wrote an article titled Hurrah For The Blackshirts in 1934 which praised Oswald Mosley's fascists.There are plenty of political dynasties, even in countries that have long shaken off the shackles of aristocracy - the Bush family, for instance, who have accounted for two of the last four US presidents, or the Gandhis in India.In the UK, the Cecil family have been involved in Conservative parliamentary politics for more than two centuries, while four generations of Benns have sat for Labour or the Liberals in the House of Commons.But there is no shortage of examples of politicians who have rejected the views of their forefathers.Famously, the father of former Conservative cabinet minister Michael Portillo was a left-wing Spanish Republican who escaped his homeland during the civil war. Labour Prime Ministers Clement Attlee and Tony Blair both grew up in Tory households (Attlee's grandson, Earl Attlee, now takes the Conservative whip in the House of Lords).If nothing else, the process of youthful rebellion requires adopting contrary views - teenagers in the Tory shires long having irritated their mums and dads by joining the Socialist Workers Party or announcing their sympathy for the anarchist cause.It's a process the comedian Alexei Sayle understands well. He grew up in a Communist Party household in Liverpool where the only way to appear more radical than his parents was to declare himself a Maoist.Over time, however, Sayle, while retaining left-wing principles, lost his illusions about the brutality of the regimes his family supported. As a result, he feels ambivalent about the environment in which he acquired his values and moral code."My parents had a genuine hatred of injustice - they were really decent people. On the other hand, that wish for a better world led them to turn a blind eye to the two greatest mass murderers of the 20th Century, namely Stalin and Mao," he says."But I'll always value the fact that they taught me to look sceptically at the news, to question society and people's motives."It's not just among the left that parents can be crucial in shaping opinions. Margaret Thatcher often spoke of the formative influence of her father, a grocer and Methodist lay preacher, who instilled her faith in the virtues of hard work and thrift.Of course, plenty of children of politicians and the politically engaged grow up to have no interest whatsoever in parties and ideologies.Others say they became active despite, not because, of their parents' interests.Rachel Johnson belongs to one of the most notable political families in the UK - her father Stanley was a Conservative MEP while her brothers Boris and Jo serve as Mayor of London and head of the Number 10 Policy Unit respectively.But she insists that politics was rarely discussed while she grew up, not least because her parents' affiliations were split - her mother Charlotte was a Labour voter."We didn't have a politicised household," Johnson, herself a Conservative party member until recently, says. "The only thing I remember was canvassing for my father for the European Parliament. But we did that not because he was a Tory but because he was my father."Arguably the political success of the Miliband family is proof that politics aren't simply handed down from father to son.It's difficult to reconcile the Marxist dialectics of Ralph with the views of his Blairite son David, who served as foreign secretary from 2007 to 2010 and was defeated by his brother for Labour's leadership.Though Ed has often spoken warmly of "the values I grew up with", he rose to the top of the party in defiance of his father's long-standing belief that Labour could never achieve socialist transformation.Unite general secretary Len McCluskey once joked that Ralph Miliband "spent his life trying to convince our movement that there was no possibility of a parliamentary road to socialism, while his sons have been loyally putting theory into practice, and proving Ralph right".Still, when children depart from their parents' political paths delicate situations can arise.In 1994, Sir Nicholas Scott, the Conservative disability minister, left office after coming under severe criticism after the government scuppered a bill that would have banned discrimination against disabled people.One of his sternest critics was his daughter Victoria, a Labour party member who at the time worked for a disability pressure group. Memorably, on one occasion she took to the Today programme to sternly criticise him.Now Victoria says the affair did create tensions, even in a family where she had been encouraged to think independently (Sir Nicholas later told interviewers he was proud she had stood up for herself)."My dad loved arguments and had a good sense of humour - he'd rather I was left-wing and had different political opinions than that I was totally uninterested," she says."But we weren't prepared for the emotional and personal fallout, which was quite phenomenal. People in my family really felt I had betrayed my father, even if he didn't feel that himself."Her experience may be far from uncommon, according to Elias Dinas, lecturer in politics at the University of Nottingham, who has researched the impact of parental influence on opinion-forming."There's a volume of literature that says the more politicised your parents are, the more likely you are to become a politically engaged adult - but you're also more likely to abandon your parents' views," he adds.If true, this implies the best way to pass on your political opinions to your offspring is to keep quiet about them. In the Miliband household, this evidently wasn't an option.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Viewpoints: How should long-term unemployment be tackled?</title>
      <description>How should long-term unemployment be tackled?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24330111</url>
      <date>1380552793</date>
      <body>The long-term unemployed may have to undertake work placements in return for their benefits, under changes being unveiled by Chancellor George Osborne.From April 2014, people who are jobless after being on the work programme for two years will face three options - a community work placement; taking part in training; or visiting a job centre every day - or face losing benefits.Although the UK unemployment rate has fallen in recent months, the number of long-term unemployed has not fallen.How should long-term unemployment be tackled?Most would agree that people with the misfortune to be long-term unemployed need intensive, personalised help to get back into a job.International evidence shows that a full package of support and the right kind of work experience - ideally with pay and the prospect of a proper job at the end of it - is crucial.Forcing people into jobs at threat of financial sanction risks pushing them out of the system entirely and doesn't help them get a real job, which is not cost-effective.Neither can we ignore the extent of poor-quality jobs in the UK labour market. Getting on the ladder is vital but we need better and wider routes upwards out of poverty.There is nothing wrong with expecting the long-term unemployed to undertake work experience or an intensive job search, in fact it can really help.When done right, they give people the work habits and employability skills that employers are looking for.What's crucial is that schemes are designed to make people more likely to get a job, not less.Today's announcement builds on an earlier "mandatory work activity" pilot, which was found to have had no impact on future job prospects, only short-term breaks in JSA claims, and increased the numbers on disability benefit.Instead, drawing on the successful Future Jobs Fund, the government should guarantee a real job, created by the charitable sector and paid at the minimum wage, to anyone who has been out of work for a year.And insist that they take the job or lose their benefits - limiting the time someone can be unemployed.The social and economic consequences of long-term unemployment are well known.For individuals, it can mean detachment from the norms of work, skills losing currency and loss of confidence due to multiple knock-backs.Mechanisms that re-build labour market attachment are valuable but there is a need to recognise the multiple barriers faced, including the uneven geographic dispersion of work, which poses the challenge of economic regeneration.Long-term unemployment among young people is particularly problematic, and it is crucial that they receive interventions that help them to achieve traction in the labour market, which may include skills development as well as workplace experience.The longer someone is out of work the more challenging it becomes to find a job.Their skills and experience become out of date and their confidence is dented.Specialist help should kick in quickly, but currently the Work Programme is targeted at people who have been unemployed for a full 12 months.The benefits trap is also a real problem.People can be reluctant to take a temporary or part-time job even though it would be a great first step back into the workforce because they are worried that when it ends they might lose their benefits.Welfare reforms must tackle this perceived barrier.The government should tap into the expertise of professional recruiters.It's their job to have good relationships with employers and to understand their local labour markets.This can make them better placed than Jobcentre staff to provide advice about local opportunities.They can also give free, personal advice to jobseekers about how to perform well in interviews and how to make the most of themselves on their CVs.Very long-term unemployment (2+ years) is strongly cyclical, almost disappearing from 1998 to 2009, but has returned with the protracted period of poor economic performance.It is thus not a new phenomenon and a large range of policies have been tried before. We have a very good idea of what does and does not work.The effect of requiring people to go into work placements depends a lot on the quality of the work experience offered.They have three elements: first, some people leave benefits ahead of the required employment.This is called the deterrent effect and is stronger the more unpleasant and low paid (eg work for the dole) the placement is.Then, whilst on the placement, job search and job entry tend to fall off as the person's time is absorbed by working.Finally, the gaining of work experience raises job search success.This is stronger for high-quality job placement in terms of the experience gained and being with a regular employer who can give a good reference if the person has worked well.The net effect of many such programmes, including work for the dole, has often been little or even negative.But the best effects come where job search is actively required and supported when on a work placement, where the placement is with a regular employer rather than a "make work" scheme and where the placement provider is incentivised to care about the employment outcomes of the unemployed person after the work placement ends.Long-term unemployment is a major problem for many jobseekers, as those who have been out of work for a long time can lose confidence and feel that they have become unattractive to employers.George Osborne does sound as though he is unfairly trying to shift the onus onto the unemployed, when the government aren't really doing enough to generate new jobs.Despite this, the work placements outlined should help the long-term unemployed in theory, by giving them the chance to develop work-related skills and so on.The most important thing for those out of work is the development of new skills and experience, whether this is through work placements, free courses or taking on new responsibilities, along with maintaining their confidence and believing in their ability to get a job.</body>

      <title>EU law and budget: a video guide</title>
      <description>Matthew Price explains EU laws and budget</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23782683</url>
      <date>1377100903</date>
      <body>The EU has a reputation for being slow and cumbersome - largely because of the difficulty of getting agreement among 28 member states with different languages and traditions.Here BBC Europe correspondent Matthew Price gives a video guide to the complex bargaining that results in new EU laws and the EU budget.The right to initiate legislation in the EU belongs to the European Commission - the union's civil service and rule-enforcer.Usually Commission proposals go through many amendments before becoming law - a process that takes years.In most policy areas the Council of Ministers - representing EU governments - and the European Parliament reach joint decisions through negotiation. Their role is called "the ordinary legislative procedure". During their negotiations they come under pressure from lobby groups, for example industrial firms or environmentalists.Often EU laws arise because national governments and MEPs tell the Commission that there is a need for them. Public consultations, scientific research and impact assessments also feed into the legislation.Once a measure becomes EU law the member states have two years to adopt it nationally - "transpose" it, in the jargon. The Commission can fine them for failure to do so.The budget is one of the most contentious policy areas among the member states, whose priorities differ greatly. The 2013 EU budget is 132.8bn euros (£113bn; $178bn).The size of the budget has to be decided annually, but there is also a seven-year budget framework, agreed in advance so that money can be set aside for long-term projects.This year for the first time EU leaders agreed to cut the multi-year budget (for 2014-2020), under pressure from the UK and some other countries, including the Netherlands and Sweden.The eurozone crisis has exacerbated tensions in the budget negotiations. Net contributors to the budget - the richer countries including the UK - argue that it should reflect the tough austerity policies adopted nationally. But net beneficiaries, such as the new member states in Central and Eastern Europe, oppose EU cuts to key areas like agriculture and infrastructure projects.EU spending is a small fraction of what the national governments spend in total, but those governments have to pay for big public sector areas like education and health, which are largely outside the EU's remit.</body>

      <title>Sarwar pledge over Pakistan murder</title>

      <body>The new governor of the Punjab, Mohammad Sarwar, has told the family of an Inverclyde woman that he will do everything possible to have her killers brought to justice.Mumtaz Sattar, 38, from Port Glasgow, was murdered just hours after arriving in Pakistan last month.Her relatives have petitioned the High Court in Lahore, naming a suspect.Her brother Sarfraz Ali and family solicitor Aamer Anwar met Mr Sarwar in Glasgow on Saturday.Mr Sarwar, who became Britain's first Muslim MP in 1997 when he won the Glasgow Govan seat, renounced his British citizenship in August ahead of his inauguration as governor of Pakistan's most populous province.Speaking after the meeting, he told BBC Scotland he had been in contact with the Punjab police almost every day since Mrs Sattar's murder, and had told them he wanted the case investigated by senior officers.He added: "I want to assure the family and the people of Scotland that justice will be done."Senior police officials are doing the investigations on the case and I have confidence in our police force in Punjab and the legal system that they will do their best to make sure that the person who has committed this heinous crime is brought to justice."Mr Anwar said the meeting with Mr Sarwar had been "extremely valuable".He added: "Mr Sarwar arranged a conference call with senior police officers and formal requests have now been made for the police to co-operate with Police Scotland and with ourselves in order that this murder inquiry can be solved."He has been able to cut through the bureaucracy. He has also put the spotlight on this case and said that every pressure must be brought to bear in order to bring the killers of Mumtaz Sattar to justice."Mrs Sattar's husband Abdul, 40, is in police custody.He told officers he and his wife were drugged and attacked by two men during a taxi ride on the way from the airport to see his parents in Punjab on Saturday 21 September.He said they were thrown out of a moving car and that his wife died from the head injuries she suffered.Scottish Police are helping Pakistani authorities with their investigation.On Friday, Mr Anwar told BBC Scotland Mrs Sattar's relatives had serious concerns about the Pakistani police investigation into Mrs Sattar's death.He said: "A serious allegation has been made of bribery of police officers that are involved in the case."At each and every turn the family appears to have been obstructed, as a result of which advocates lodged a petition at the High Court in Lahore yesterday in which they name one murder suspect and ask for the authorities to bring the police officers concerned to the High Court to answer questions."</body>

      <body>The Scottish Greens could play a key role in convincing Scots to vote for independence in next year's referendum, the party's conference has been told.Co-convener Patrick Harvie said "canny" voters would not be persuaded into voting Yes next September with "flags, bribes or fearmongering".He said Scots could be won over with a "radical vision" of what the country could be like after leaving the UK.Mr Harvie was speaking as the two-day conference opened in Inverness.The people of Scotland will be asked the straight yes/no question "Should Scotland be an independent country?" when they vote in the independence referendum on 18 September 2014.At last year's conference members voted to endorse the cross-party Yes Scotland campaign for independence.At the same time the party agreed to form its own pro-independence campaign, designed to promote its distinct policies.Mr Harvie, one of the Greens' two MSPs at Holyrood, said: "Many Scots remain undecided on independence and they have every right to take their time, as creating a new country is undoubtedly a radical step."These canny voters won't be persuaded by flags, bribes or fearmongering but I believe they will respond to a radical vision for a better Scotland and the Scottish Greens are crucial to outlining that vision."Taking responsibility and bringing power closer to the people is a core Green principle, and our conference is a chance for us to galvanise our party and amplify our message."He added: "This is a big decision about Scotland's long-term future."As Greens we're used to thinking big and it's in our DNA to think ahead, so let's seize the day."Mr Harvie argued that at this time the "Green vision for Scotland has never been more important", adding that his party offered "the vision of a renewed economy that works for the many rather than the few and a sustainable society that cares about future generations".He said: "The clock is ticking on the need to tackle climate change and a Green Scotland would be better placed to develop the low-carbon society we need."</body>

      <body>An Inverness-shire man has been named the world's best porridge maker for the second time in three years.John Boa took the prize at the 20th Annual Golden Spurtle World Porridge Making Championships in Carrbridge, Inverness-shire.The trophy goes to the maker of the best traditional porridge using only oatmeal, salt and water.Mr Boa told BBC Scotland his win was "a little overwhelming".He said this was only the third time he had entered the competition. He also won in 2011."I'm very proud and privileged. And it does make it a little bit special that it's a landmark year for the competition," he added.Mr Boa, who formerly lived in Edinburgh but now lives on Skye, said the trick to producing a world-class porridge was to "keep stirring", using a spurtle - a rod-shaped tool, traditionally used to stir porridge.He also said adding the salt was "always a key moment"."You have to make sure you don't oversalt or undersalt," he said. "It has to be just right."This year the speciality award was won by London-based Nick Barnard.Past recipes in the speciality section have included the use of curry powder, sausages and seafood.</body>

We are delighted so many turned out to make Super Saturday such a great success, and hope to see many of them here tomorrow cheering on the old ones."</body>

      <body>An Andy Warhol exhibition has opened at Holyrood - the first exhibition of the artist's work to take place in a parliamentary building.Andy Warhol: Pop, Power and Politics includes a number of iconic works that have never been shown in Scotland.The exhibition is a result of a collaboration between the Scottish Parliament, the Carnegie UK Trust and the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.It coincides with a week of events celebrating Andrew Carnegie's legacy.The Andrew Carnegie's International Legacy: Shaping the Future festival celebrates the Scottish philanthropist and the centenary of the formation of the Carnegie UK Trust.The Warhol exhibition features portraits of Carnegie, as well as Lenin, Chairman Mao and The Queen.Presiding Officer Tricia Marwick said: "It gives me real pleasure to open this exhibition of iconic images, depicting politicians and political events from across the globe."It is important to me that the Scottish Parliament hosts exhibitions that encourage people to discuss and explore political issues, and few artists can get people talking like Warhol does."In association with the exhibition, two portraits of Andy Warhol taken by Scottish photographer Harry Benson, will be on loan to the Parliament Art Collection and displayed in the UK for the first time.A number of works made by Warhol for political and environmental campaigns are also being loaned from Artist Rooms, jointly owned and managed by Tate and National Galleries of Scotland.Angus Hogg, chairman of the Carnegie UK Trust, said: "Andy Warhol holds a special place in our hearts at Carnegie, not only because the trust has a long history of promoting access to arts and culture, but also because Warhol received his first formal training in art through free classes offered by the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh."As many will already know, Andrew Carnegie envisioned a world of peace, well-being and opportunity, and this sentiment still rings true over 100 years on."This collaborative exhibition, which kicks off a celebration of Andrew Carnegie's legacy, provides a once-in-a-lifetime chance for the public to get an up-close look to some of society's most impactful pieces of art."Matt Wrbican, chief archivist at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, said: "The Warhol is thrilled to share many truly exceptional works from our collection with the Scottish Parliament and the Carnegie UK Trust."The items represent the full scope of Andy Warhol's life and art. This exhibition features Warhol paintings, sculptures, and prints from our permanent collection and allows visitors to the stunning parliament building to have the opportunity to see many top-rate original Warhols."In addition, we're pleased to once again unite Pittsburgh and Scotland through the very rare display of Warhol's Andrew Carnegie portrait."The Andy Warhol exhibition will run from 5 October to 3 November.</body>

      <date>1380902460</date>
      <body>Police are investigating the theft of a 12ft fibreglass crocodile from an Edinburgh square.The sculpture is believed to have been stolen from the gardens in the centre of St Andrew Square between 14:00 on Thursday and 08:00 on Friday.It is owned by the National Library of Scotland.It is believed to have been removed via the west gate of the gardens and onto George Street. Police are appealing for witnesses.The crocodile was St Andrew Square to promote the National Library of Scotland's current exhibition celebrating the African adventures of the explorer David Livingstone.The life-size replica has been named Davy by staff. They are now very keen to get him back.Darryl Mead, National Library of Scotland's deputy national librarian, said: "Davy has proved a popular attraction in the gardens since he moved in three weeks ago."We suspect he may have been taken as a prank late at night and we appeal for his safe return."The crocodile was filled with sand and weighed around 180 kilos to make it difficult to move him.The sand was removed before he was taken which would have taken some time and it would still have needed at least two people to carry him off, said police.He went missing when the garden's gate were closed to the public.PC Caireen Stewart, of Police Scotland, said: "This crocodile is the property of the National Library of Scotland and is very unique."Due to its size, it is believed that someone may have seen something regarding its disappearance."</body>

      <body>A 15-month-old baby was close to death after a series of blunders by a senior Edinburgh children's doctor, a tribunal has heard.Dr Kiran Patwardhan was the consultant when the baby arrived at The Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh with scolds to the face and neck.He has admitted a string of mistakes relating to his treatment of three children at the hospital in 2011.However, he denies a number of factual elements of the allegations.The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service was told Dr Patwardhan allowed a junior doctor to remove a breathing tube and made a series of mistakes when things went wrong.It was told a colleague was called to take control of the situation and the child, known as Patient LS, was unharmed by the incident.Dr Gale Pearson, a specialist in paediatric intensive care, told the tribunal: "This situation reads as if it is completely chaotic and were it not for the arrival of a doctor the child would have died, in my opinion."There are a number of common features to the three cases."Concerns were raised by nurses when Dr Patwardhan bungled the changing of a breathing tube on a five-year-old patient in June 2011, the tribunal was told.Dr Pearson said: "I think this incident is seriously below the expected standard."Dr Patwardhan denies his re-intubation technique was "poor".On 5 August 2011, Dr Patwardhan was transferring a two-week-old baby with heart problems from Edinburgh to Glasgow for an operation.Minutes after they left the hospital in an ambulance the condition of patient NS began to deteriorate as the level of oxygen in the blood dropped rapidly.Dr Padwardhan admits coming to the wrong conclusion about the cause, a problem with the breathing tube, but denies he failed to adequately monitor or assess the infant.The hearing was told a nurse was forced to take control of the situation and the patient's condition improved as a result.Dr Patwardhan admits his preparation and approach to the change of Patient MA's breathing tube lacked adequate structure, but denies his technique to replace the tube was poor.He admits further errors during the transfer of Patient NS to a hospital in Glasgow, but denies he failed to assess or monitor the condition and wrongly decided to return to Edinburgh.He also admits several failures in his treatment of Patient LG, but disputes he failed to properly prepare for the procedure.The hearing continues.</body>

      <date>1380894798</date>
      <body>Police have launched an investigation into the vandalism of Edinburgh statue Greyfriars Bobby after repair work to its nose was removed.The statue of the world famous dog underwent restoration work on Tuesday to turn his shiny nose back to its original black.However, less than 48 hours later, his nose was shiny again.Police said an abrasive material had been "intentionally used" on the nose, stripping the repaired area.The statue, located close to George IV bridge in the city's Old Town, is popular with tourists, many of whom have taken to rubbing the Skye Terrier's nose for luck.Edinburgh City Council confirmed it called the police after experts said the repair paint used should have lasted several years.Police Scotland said the statue was damaged sometime between 13:00 on Tuesday and 17:00 on Wednesday.The estimated cost of the damage is believed to be between £200 and £300.Officers are conducting inquiries and urged witnesses to come forward.PC Nick Davies, of Police Scotland, said: "This crime is as unusual as it is disappointing to observe."The statue is a beloved tourist attraction and is also very popular with Edinburgh's local residents."The nose has recently been touched up to restore it following years of wear and at first it was believed the repair had not adhered correctly to the monument."However, we are now treating this as an act of vandalism after discovering that an abrasive has been used to remove the material from the repaired area."As such, anyone who remembers seeing any suspicious activity around Greyfriars Bobby in the past few days is asked to contact police."Richard Lewis, Edinburgh City Council's culture and sport convener, said: "The work carried out should have lasted for a number of years and it is highly unlikely that it would have worn away naturally in such a short space of time."We will, of course, organise the repair work to be undertaken again and hope that in future people respect the statue of Greyfriars Bobby."</body>

      <body>A faulty sewage system at a new North Lanarkshire housing development has left dozens of residents complaining about foul smells and blocked toilets.About 30 householders have experienced problems over the past four years at the site in Wishaw that was developed by Bett Homes and Stewart Milne.Both firms blame "foreign matter" from outside their sites "entering the foul water system" and causing blockages.They have said they "remain committed to resolving these issues".One resident, Jacqui Milne, told BBC Scotland that she bought her new house from Bett Homes in 2009.She said she expected luxury and convenience but instead had faced ongoing problems with the estate's sewage system."It got to the stage where we couldn't flush the toilet, we can't use the washing machine because the washing machine drains up the way out the kitchen sink," she said"I was told at one point to go to Asda to use the toilets."It's very disappointing when you've bought a new home that you don't have basic functions in your house."North Lanarkshire Councillor Robert McKendrick said had been aware of residents' concerns at the Wishaw development "for quite some time" and they way they had been treated was "a scandal".Referring to the developers, he said: "I would like to see them come on site and speak to the people and let them know what they're doing and get it fixed immediately."I think we need to involve all agencies here and get them on board and get this resolved as soon as possible."A spokesman for Bett Homes said that the foul water system which services its Aspect development in Wishaw includes a waste water pumping station.This handles sewage from the Bett Homes and Stewart Milne Homes developments and from neighbouring residential properties and a private residential care home.The spokesman said: "Bett Homes and Stewart Milne have had the foul water system - including the pumping station - examined and it has been confirmed that it is built to the necessary standard and is not the cause of the breakages."It is our understanding that these breakages are caused by foreign matter from outside of the Bett Homes and Stewart Milne developments entering the foul water system."Bett Homes and Stewart Milne Homes have been consulting with Scottish Water and managing the situation over a sustained period."Bett Homes and Stewart Milne Homes remain committed to resolving these issues and are hopeful that a solution can be realised soon."A spokesman for Stewart Milne Homes added: "Stewart Milne Homes is absolutely committed to resolving the drainage issues at the Wishaw development."We are working closely with Bett Homes, and the construction directors from both companies are meeting with John Pentland MSP, along with residents of both developments, to discuss the future maintenance of the pumping station."Following the meeting, all residents will be notified of the planned course of action."The meeting, which will also be attended by North Lanarkshire Council and Scottish Water, is due to take place on Friday.</body>

      <title>Kelvin Hall revamp gets £4.5m grant</title>

      <body>A £4.5m lottery grant has been awarded to transform Glasgow's Kelvin Hall into a major museum facility.The site will revamped to provide public access to 1.5 million pieces from Glasgow's civic collection and Glasgow University's Hunterian Museum.The venue will also house the National Library of Scotland's Scottish Screen Archive and have a new role as a cultural, research and training centre.Kelvin Hall housed Glasgow's transport collection up until 2010.It has since been moved to its new home at the Riverside Museum.The Kelvin Hall development is a joint project between Glasgow City Council, Glasgow Life, Glasgow University and the National Library of Scotland.One of its primary aims is to create safe, secure and publicly accessible museum storage for the internationally-important Hunterian and Glasgow museum's collections.About 1.5 million objects, currently stored in various locations around the city, will be relocated to the redeveloped Kelvin Hall.Among the many exhibits is the only surviving complete suite of interiors by Charles Rennie Mackintosh for Mrs Cranston's Ingram Street tearooms.The new development will allow these to undergo conservation works in public view.The National Library of Scotland's Scottish Screen Archive - with more than 100 years of Scottish history on film and video - will also be housed at the venue.Plans are also being developed for a new digital portal so that all three partners will be able to bring their collections together online.Colin McLean, head of the Heritage Lottery Fund in Scotland, said: "The Kelvin Hall is a hugely popular building, much-loved by the people of Glasgow and beyond so it is fitting that the lottery-playing public have had a hand in securing its future."This is a groundbreaking project which brings together civic, university and national heritage collections for the first time in the UK."Throughout the revamp, the Kelvin Hall will continue to house sports facilities which will be upgraded as part of the scheme.Cllr Archie Graham, deputy leader of Glasgow City Council and chair of Glasgow Life, said: "The Kelvin Hall is a historic Glasgow institution which has been home to world-class sporting events and housed our outstanding transport collection."This ambitious project will breathe new life into what is already a vibrant museums quarter with Kelvingrove, the Hunterian and Riverside museums nearby."</body>

      <title>Concerns delay schools' flu vaccine</title>
      <description>A programme to vaccinate children against flu is delayed in Glasgow after concerns from Muslim parents that it contains products derived from pork.</description>

      <body>A programme to vaccinate schoolchildren against flu has been delayed in Glasgow after concerns from Muslim parents that it contains products derived from pork.About 100,000 primary school pupils in Scottish health board areas taking part in a pilot programme are being offered the Fluenz vaccine.It is given as a nasal spray rather than the traditional jab.But parents in Pollokshields, which has a high number of Muslim pupils, have complained the spray contains gelatine.A letter sent to Glasgow schools in the wake of concerns cites a World Health Organisation study in 2001 which indicated that Islamic and Jewish scholars had agreed pork gelatine was permissible within a vaccine.However, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC), whose area contains most of Scotland's Muslims, said it had put back the rollout of the vaccinations "following concerns raised by a small number of parents".The programme is due to resume next week when parents will be offered a choice of the nasal spray or the more traditional jab.Scottish government public health minister Michael Matheson said flu was a "very serious infection" which needed to be vaccinated against.He said: "That is why, for the new programme for children, we are using a quick and painless nasal spray Fluenz, which has proven to be more effective in children and avoids the use of needles."Parents should be reassured that the existing guidance issued in 2001 from the World Health Organisation, prepared by religious scholars, advises that gelatine of porcine origin used in vaccines and other medicines is judicially permissible as the gelatine in the final product is a completely changed substance."Vaccination is voluntary and we want all parents to have the information they need to make an informed choice."If parents continue to have any concerns, children can be given an alternative safe injectable vaccine which does not contain any porcine gelatine but provides less protection than the nasal spray."He added: "The Scottish Government very much appreciates the help and advice provided by Muslim councils in response to these concerns and a letter has been issued to parents of children in Glasgow to offer reassurance about the use of the Fluenz vaccine."A fifth of the Scottish population will be offered a free flu vaccine, including people aged over 65 and those with conditions that put them at greater risk.For the first time, all two and three-year-olds - about 120,000 children - will be offered the vaccine, as well as 100,000 primary school pupils in health board areas which are taking part in a pilot programme.The programme will be rolled out to eventually see about one million children aged between two and 17 have the chance to be immunised towards the end of 2015.</body>

      <body>A man accused of causing a car crash in November 2011 which led to his father's death may not be fit to stand trial.James Mowat, 47, of Croy, near Inverness, has missed a number of court dates because he is still in hospital.Defence advocate Shahid Latif told the High Court in Edinburgh that he showed signs of "cognitive impairment" and had difficulty with his speech.It is alleged that as a result of the smash his father, also called James, was fatally injured.Judge Lord Pentland has fixed another hearing for later this month, allowing prosecution and defence to make further inquiries.He said: "I hope it will be possible for parties to reach a considered view about where this case is going."Mr Mowat faces a charge of driving carelessly while unfit through drink or drugs, or an alternative charge which alleges his alcohol level was three and a half times the legal limit when he was driving carelessly.The indictment alleges that as a result of the crash on the B9091 Croy to Nairn road, near Clephanton, passenger James Mowat was fatally injured.Mr Mowat's car is said to have failed to take a bend, left the roadway and hit an embankment and a tree.He also faces charges of failing to report the accident and possessing cannabis.</body>

She has never been found.Fraser was found guilty of murder in 2003 but started a lengthy appeal process which led to a retrial.He was found guilty of murder for a second time last year.Relatives of Mrs Fraser welcomed the appeal decision, and said their message to Fraser was: "He should do his time."Fraser was jailed for a minimum of 17 years but his defence team argued at the appeal that remarks made by a trial witness may have led jurors to carry out online "research" into the background to the case.They blamed a so-called "Google-factor".The appeal judges ruled: "The trial judge provided clear and repeated directions to the jury during the trial and again at its conclusion in the charge itself, shortly before the jury retired to consider their verdict."In the absence of material which would tend to demonstrate the contrary, the court must proceed on the basis that the directions were followed."In this case the appeal court considered that the trial judge took into account all the relevant factors before deciding upon the appropriate course of action. He reached a balanced and reasonable decision based upon these factors."In such circumstances the court was unable to find fault in his decision."Mrs Fraser's mother Isabelle Thompson said afterwards of the appeal: "Hopefully we can get on with our lives, it's been never-ending."Her father, Hector McInnes, said: "Obviously we are happy it's all finished."We have had to come here too often. He should do his time."</body>

      <body>An attempt by a husband to be buried alongside the wife he was convicted of murdering has been rejected.Malcolm Webster, 54, originally from Surrey, was jailed for a minimum of 30 years for murdering Claire Morris in a car crash in Aberdeenshire in 1994.He was also convicted of staging a similar attempt to murder his second wife in New Zealand.Aberdeenshire Council said he had no right to be buried in the same plot as Ms Morris.An Aberdeenshire Council spokeswoman said: "The murder conviction against Malcolm Webster has rendered his contract with the council, as relating to the lair at Tarves, void."As such, he would have no right to be buried in the same lair as Claire Morris."We are monitoring the ongoing appeal proceedings."Webster's appeal against his conviction is currently being considered by judges.The council last year gave Ms Morris's family permission to remove the headstone at her grave, as it referred to a "dear wife" and displayed her married name.Webster was found guilty in 2011 of murdering Ms Morris, 32, who was originally from Kent, in a faked car crash.The jury at the High Court in Glasgow accepted that he set fire to the vehicle with his unconscious wife inside it, before later receiving an insurance payout.The appeal judges will issue their ruling, in writing, at a later date.</body>

      <title>Scots soldiers given bravery awards</title>
      <description>Several Scottish soldiers are honoured for acts of bravery carried out while they were serving in Afghanistan.</description>

      <body>Scottish soldiers have been honoured for acts of bravery while serving in Afghanistan.The awards included a George Medal for a bomb disposal expert who helped save the lives of Danish and Afghan troops.Also honoured was a soldier who took "decisive action" after a rogue member of the Afghan Army killed a Scottish officer during a football match.And a platoon leader was recognised for his "conspicuous bravery" under heavy fire.Warrant Officer Andy Peat, a high threat explosive ordnance disposal operator, received the George Medal for his role when he was attached to a task force of a Danish Special Forces unit with Afghan partners.The George Medal is awarded to civilians for acts of great bravery, but also to military personnel for acts of great bravery not in the presence of the enemy.WO Peat, 39, from Edinburgh, was on an operation to search a suspected homemade explosive factory when one of the Danish soldiers triggered a device on a compound roof.He was credited with saving the lives of several other Danish soldiers and members of the Afghan police.He cleared a route to the injured man while urging the other Afghan and Danish soldiers to stay still to avoid triggering other bombs.When he reached him he realised there was another wire underneath him - tracing it to another IED hidden under a nearby stone, he disarmed it and cleared a safe route.WO Peat, of 33 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiment Royal Engineers, said: "Working in the dark with night vision equipment does make it more difficult but we train for those situations."I was aware that there was a potential threat from insurgents and further devices. In those circumstances you remain focused, prioritise and work logically."It is hard to suppress your emotions, knowing someone has been gravely injured. Your first instinct is to run to them and do everything you can to help but if you do that, you could make things a lot worse."Oversergeant Rene Brink Jakobsen later died of his wounds, leaving behind a wife and three children.WO Peat's citation stated: "Although a Danish serviceman was fatally injured, the calm, determined actions and bravery demonstrated by Peat without doubt prevented further casualties and death to both Afghans and Danish alike."The Commander on the ground is adamant that Peat protected seven lives that night. At no time did Peat show regard to his own safety and his selfless actions are tribute to a truly professional soldier."In August, WO Peat became the first soldier outside Denmark to receive the Anders Lassen Award for his bravery.Pte Ryan Houston, of 1st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, was two-and-a-half months into his first tour of duty in Afghanistan when an Afghan soldier starting firing at troops as they played football in November last year.The 22-year-old, from Hamilton, was on duty as a Guardian Angel, patrolling the Forward Operating Base in Nad-e Ali to protect his fellow troops, when he heard gunfire.As Afghan and British troops scattered, he took on the rogue soldier who was firing at him, then followed him as he fled the pitch.The incident fatally wounded Capt Walter Barrie, 41, from Penicuik in Midlothian, who was playing in the match.His killer was stopped when Pte Houston, joined by another soldier, gave chase and opened fire.The 22-year-old was awarded a Mention in Despatches in the latest round of Operational Honours, announced at the Tower of London.Pte Houston's citation described how he and his colleague were exposed to more than 50 bullets which passed within centimetres of them.Once the Afghan soldier had been shot, they searched him, and Pte Houston was then said to have expressed "extraordinary humanity and control" by protecting fellow soldiers who were giving first aid to the man who had only minutes before been trying to kill them."Houston's valour, decisive action and his exhibition of the highest standards to which the British Army aspires, are out of all proportion to that expected of such a junior soldier," the citation added.Also mentioned in dispatches was Cpl Richard Cook, from Selkirk, who was recognised for his "repeated gallantry and inspirational leadership" while acting above his rank as a Platoon Sergeant in Afghanistan.Cpl Cook, also of 1st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, led his platoon on an operation to search a known insurgent command post and improvised explosive device factory in central Yakchal in February.As the Scots and members of the Afghan National Security Force Tiger Team approached the compound they came under "accurate and heavy small arms fire" with rounds striking the ground among his soldiers.He immediately took control, directing his men to what little cover there was and ordered return fire to enable an extraction of his men and the Tiger Team.The 26-year-old said: "We knew it was coming. Rounds started cracking around us. I ordered rapid fire. The machine gunner got a stoppage and just as he ducked behind a wall a bullet struck the top of it."With suppressive firing failing to quell the insurgent attack, he took a significant risk and moved out of cover to an exposed and vulnerable position to draw the insurgent fire and identify their position.Upon doing so, he fired a 66mm rocket, ending the contact successfully without sustaining any casualties.He said: "I knew I had to do something to stop them firing on us. At the time I didn't think about putting myself in the firing line. It was only afterwards I wondered what the hell I was doing".Over the course of the day, his platoon was engaged a further eight times by accurate small arms, grenades and rocket propelled grenades from multiple firing points.His citation read: "Throughout, he led from the front showing outstanding grit and determination which proved to be an inspiration to his young soldiers and the Afghan Tiger team."</body>

      <body>A senior Scottish Fire and Rescue Service officer has admitted its handling of moves to close a Dumfries control room could have been better.The centre is one of five being considered for closure.Assistant Chief Fire Officer Dave Boyle issued an apology directly to members of Dumfries and Galloway Council's police and fire committee.He said the service could have handled the issue much better and would learn from the mistake.However, he said there would be no rethink on the decision taken by the board."The SFRS, myself and the strategic leadership team and the board need to learn lessons from community engagement, from local authority engagement and all the rest of it," he said."We will be examining where we have gone through this process and what we could do better and, more importantly, how we change our actions for the future."He said there had been issues with the Dumfries control room for a number of years and it would have needed significant investment in order to continue."What the board have decided has actually just brought the final chapter down on that," he said."We will now start to invest money with the local stations to make sure that they are retained to be mobilised in the way they should be."Once the fire control centre in Dumfries is shut, all emergency call handling for the region will be transferred to Johnstone in Renfrewshire.Labour councillor Ronnie Ogilvie, who sits on the local authority's police and fire committee, said he remained deeply concerned about the impact of the closure - both operationally and in terms of employment.However, he said the fact the SFRS had recognised that it had made a major error in not consulting was at least something."To be fair to the fire board they have acknowledged that - and it is not just in Dumfries and Galloway," he said."Other people are jumping up and down as well."They have realised they have made a major mistake and they are going to address that - but it doesn't change the decision though."</body>

      <body>Chemicals firm Ineos has written down the value of its petrochemical assets at Grangemouth from £400m to zero.The company said it had "no option" but to write down the value of property, plant and equipment at the site following repeated annual losses by the petrochemical business.The move has come as members of Unite prepare to start a work-to-rule and overtime ban at Grangemouth on Monday.The dispute centres on the treatment of a union convener.In a statement, Ineos repeated that its site at Grangemouth would close by 2017 if they did not find savings and fresh investment.The company said it had invested more than £1bn since taking over at Grangemouth in 2006 but the site had lost more than £150m over the past four years.Calum MacLean, chairman of the Grangemouth petrochemicals business, said: "We had no option but to write down these assets. After four years of heavy losses, the petrochemicals business is effectively worthless."Without lower costs and an alternative source of additional raw material, it will close in 2017 at the latest."He added: "The petrochemical business at Grangemouth is at a crossroads."The current financial position is unsustainable and this write-down simply confirms the stark choices that we have ahead of us."Workers at Grangemouth recently voted in favour of industrial action over the treatment of union convener Stevie Deans, who was also involved in the row over the selection of a Labour candidate in Falkirk.Mr Deans, who is chairman of the constituency party, faces an investigation by Ineos over issues linked to the Falkirk row.</body>

      <body>Shadow chancellor Ed Balls has criticised SNP plans to keep the pound in an independent Scotland, as he hit the by-election trail in Dunfermline.But also campaigning in the Fife town, Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said Sterling belonged as much to Scotland as the rest of the UK.The Tory and Lib Dem leaders, Ruth Davidson and Willie Rennie, said Scotland was better off in the UK.The by-election is being held after the resignation of sitting MSP Bill Walker.The former independent member was jailed for a year after being convicted for assaults on three ex-wives and a step-daughter.He was elected for the SNP in 2011, but thrown out of the party when the charges came to light.Hitting the campaign trail and speaking ahead of next year's independence referendum, Mr Balls said the rest of the UK wanted Scotland to remain part of it.In the event of a "yes" vote, the Scottish government wants to keep the pound and retain the services of the Bank of England under a currency zone.'Fresh start'But the shadow chancellor said: "The idea that Scotland could simply keep the pound - that would mean restrictions on budget policy, on interest rates, on financial regulation which would be very hard for Scotland - the idea that the rest of the UK would sign up to a Euro-style gamble on a Sterling zone, I don't think that is very likely."Mr Salmond officially launched the SNP's by-election campaign by setting out the party's record in government.He highlighted the council tax freeze and the SNP's commitment to maintaining universal benefits.Responding to Mr Balls' comments about currency in an independent Scotland, the first minister said: "We think sharing the pound, which is as much our pound - Scotland's pound - as Ed Balls' pound, is in the interests of Scotland, but it's also overwhelmingly in the interests of the rest of the UK and that's what will prevail after a 'Yes' vote in the referendum."Meanwhile, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Mr Rennie, who was campaigning for local jobs in Dunfermline, added: "The best way to get the best bits of the United Kingdom is to stay entrenched in the United Kingdom - the idea that you can somehow leave, but still benefit from all the good bits is nonsense."And Scottish Conservative leader Ms Davidson, who called for a "fresh start" in the town after the Bill Walker saga, said: "Alex Salmond's pronouncement about just taking the pound after having been a flag-waver for the Euro for so many years is another example of his 'say anything, do anything, promise anything for a coupe more votes' approach."Voters go to the polls on 24 October to elect one of seven candidates as MSP for Dunfermline.</body>

      <body>The Scottish government has said its expert commission on energy could consider the feasibility of a price freeze on gas and electricity prices in an independent Scotland.But Energy Minister Fergus Ewing said he thought the move was "unfeasible".On Thursday, he attacked Labour leader Ed Miliband's promise to make energy firms freeze prices for two years if he won the next General Election.Mr Ewing warned it could lead to the lights going out.The energy minister told BBC Scotland that the SNP government in Scotland had delivered a price freeze for the council tax because it was within its control.He said: "The trouble about the energy price freeze is that the international gas price is set by global markets and therefore it is not within the control of the Labour party, and they have not published any plan showing how it would work."The Scottish government recently announced the setting up of an expert commission to look at how the gas and electricity industry might be regulated in an independent Scotland.It will be chaired by Robert Armour, an energy lawyer working in the power sector in Scotland for 30 years.Mr Ewing said: "We have asked the energy commission to look at all the options, including the options which we think are unfeasible, such as a price freeze."Labour accused the SNP of siding with big business against hard-pressed consumers.Scottish Labour's finance spokesman Iain Gray said: "The choice is very clear."If we stay part of the United Kingdom, Scotland stands to benefit from a price freeze and strong regulation of the markets and prices."If we were to leave the United Kingdom we would have no price freeze and the energy companies would be able to continue to raise their prices willy-nilly while their profits go up far more."</body>

      <title>Procurement reform bill published</title>
      <description>Public sector bodies could be allowed to consider issues such as blacklisting when awarding work to firms, under proposed reforms.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-24398997</url>
      <date>1380900795</date>
      <body>Public sector bodies could be allowed to consider issues such as blacklisting and zero-hours contracts when awarding work to firms, according to planned reforms.The move is among changes to public procurement rules being proposed by the Scottish government.The Procurement Reform Bill aims to improve the way the public sector buys goods, works and services.Ministers said it would make it easier for small firms to bid for contracts.Guidance under the bill would allow public sector bosses to consider the inappropriateness of awarding contracts to companies using controversial zero-hours contracts, which allow employers to hire staff with no guarantee of work.Public sector bosses could also consider, when deciding on a contract award, whether firms use blacklisting.The issue of blacklisting has angered unions and politicians, following disclosures about a UK-wide database of names used by major construction firms to vet workers.Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the legislation promoted an approach that was "both business friendly and socially responsible".The proposed new rules could also lead to greater use of community benefit clauses.These clauses could require companies to provide training, apprenticeships or opportunities for disabled people as part of the contract."Changes to public procurement rules will ensure Scotland retains its place as a world leader in public procurement reform, promoting an approach that is both business friendly and socially responsible," Ms Sturgeon said.Responding to the bill, Scottish Trades Union Congress general secretary Grahame Smith said: "The STUC enthusiastically welcomes parts of this important bill, especially its provisions to disqualify firms engaging in tax avoidance and blacklisting from the public procurement process and the commitment to introduce further guidance on workforce matters."But Mr Smith described parts of the legislation as "very disappointing", adding: "It is difficult to believe that community benefits will be extended and improved by simply handing contracting authorities a duty to 'consider' whether to impose as part of the contract."The STUC is also sceptical that the significant additional requirements placed on local authorities and other contracting agencies will have 'no overall net impact on costs'."Scottish Building Federation managing director Vaughan Hart welcomed the publication of the bill.He said: "With a growing pipeline of publicly funded infrastructure projects planned over the years ahead, this bill offers the potential to transform the efficiency of public procurement - and to encourage many more particularly smaller building companies to bid for public sector contracts."We will look forward to scrutinising the detail in the months ahead."CBI Scotland said the bill contained "a number of encouraging measures", but added that ministers risked missing out on an opportunity to open up the delivery of public services to independent providers.Assistant director David Lonsdale added: "The bill should enshrine in legislation a 'right to bid' for private and third sector organisations, so that any provider who can demonstrate the capacity and wherewithal to deliver a public service more effectively, innovatively, and for better value is given the opportunity to do so."</body>

      <body>Newly-released scientific evidence shows mackerel stocks in the north east Atlantic are in "good health", Scottish fishing leaders have said.The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea has recommended an increase in quotas of more than 60% for 2014.The Scottish Pelagic Fishermen's Association (SPFA) welcomed the news.Scientists said analysis had been hampered by the wrangle with Iceland and the Faroe Islands over quotas.SPFA chief executive Ian Gatt said: "The scientific advice confirms what Scottish fishermen have repeatedly been saying, that the stock remains in good health and that consumers can continue to eat Scottish mackerel safe in the knowledge that the fish are abundant in the sea and being sustainably caught by our fishermen."He said he hoped a resolution with Iceland and the Faroes could be reached over disputed quota levels.Fisheries Secretary Richard Lochhead said: "The increase in quota advised for 2014 is tremendous news for the Scottish fishing industry."Mackerel is our most valuable stock, worth £131m to the Scottish economy last year."He added: "This scientific advice also provides a fresh opportunity to try and resolve the ongoing dispute with Iceland and the Faroes."Iceland's Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, said: "With our focus on sustainable fisheries, Iceland will continue to work hard for an agreement between the coastal states in order to secure sustainable management of the mackerel stock."</body>

      <body>Textile services firm Fishers saw losses narrow last year, as turnover and operating profits increased.The Fife-based company reported pre-tax losses fell by nearly £500,000 last year to just over £3m.It said the losses stemmed from finance charges and interest payments relating to a previous funding structure.The business has since refinanced on improved terms and attracted £5m in funding from existing investor Caird Capital.Cupar-based Fishers provides linen rental, workwear hire and cleanroom garments to the hospitality, leisure, manufacturing and pharmaceuticals sectors.According to accounts filed with Companies House, turnover rose 4% last year to £33.3m, while operating profit increased by 38% to £2.9m.Employee numbers peaked at more than 800 in 2012.Fishers managing director Bruce McHardy said: "Our 2012 growth was achieved against a challenging background and is all the more pleasing for that."The refinancing of the business in 2013 represents a new chapter in the Fishers story and provides the long-term funding which allows us to continue to invest in the business and look forward to further success in 2013 and beyond."Founded in 1900, Fishers cleans, irons and delivers more than two million items of linen every week in Scotland and the north of England.</body>

      <body>Celtic moved to the top of the Scottish Premiership table after a confident home win against Motherwell.Anthony Stokes blasted in Celtic's opener from a tight angle after Motherwell keeper Lee Hollis failed to clear midway through the first half.Immediately after the interval, Kris Commons outstripped the Motherwell defence to lob Hollis.Fraser Forster again underlined his goalkeeping credentials by denying 'Well's John Sutton's late header.After the midweek disappointment of narrowly losing out to Barcelona in their Champions League group match, Neil Lennon's men enjoyed a return to form while Stuart McCall's Motherwell should remain fairly contented to hold on to third place, largely thanks to Aberdeen's defeat by Ross County.The hosts set out their intentions almost immediately when Emilio Izaguirre clipped the ball in to the penalty area and Hollis came out for the cross but ended up swiping at fresh air. Scott Brown pounced with a shot towards goal but it failed to find a way through the Motherwell defence.Lennon was forced into an early substitution when Adam Matthews found himself on the wrong end of a sliding challenge by Motherwell captain Keith Lasley and had to be stretchered off, James Forrest replacing him.Charlie Mulgrew then blasted a right-footed shot from 25 yards that deflected off a Motherwell body for a corner.Commons flicked on a cross into the Motherwell penalty area and, with the bobbling ball around, Hollis was in total disarray before it landed favourably for Stokes to drive home.Shortly after the half-hour mark, Commons' effort from Virgil van Dijk's cross was kept out by Hollis.Motherwell pressed as the interval approached but Lionel Ainsworth's effort was high over the crossbar.Shortly after the break, Commons netted a fine solo effort following a run that took him past Stephen McManus and Lasley.Van Dijk soon embarked on an unstoppable run of his own down the inside-left channel and drifted past the Motherwell defence only to fire off target.Substitute Henri Anier, on for Iain Vigurs, had an opportunity to drag Motherwell back into the match after some poor communication in the Celtic defence allowed him to line up a shot but his effort was wayward.In the closing stages, England squad keeper Forster made a fantastic save, diving low to deny Sutton from close range.</body>

      <title>Hearts 0-2 St Mirren</title>
      <description>St Mirren claim their first win of the season and leave Hearts further isolated at the foot of the table.</description>

      <body>St Mirren secured their first win of the season to push Hearts deeper into relegation trouble and ease the pressure on Buddies boss Danny Lennon.John MGinn headed a powerful opener and Paul McGowan stabbed the second over the line after a parried clearance from goalkeeper Jamie MacDonald.Hearts piled on the pressure but the visitors always looked like holding on.And the Paisley club extend the gap between themselves and the Premiership's bottom side to 12 points.It ended St Mirren's run of eight games this season without a win and burst the pre-match optimism around Tynecastle after they had already reduced the 15-point penalty imposed for going into administration.And it justified Lennon's decision to name an unchanged side after Monday's draw against Aberdeen.A cup-tie atmosphere and a healthy crowd of 14,769 was ensured for a match talked up by both sides as a vital game even this early in the battle to avoid the drop.Hearts' loyal support, who have done so much to keep the club in business through administration with their fund-raising, arrived in expectation of delivering a killer blow to Lennon's troubled time as St Mirren manager.The packed stands will have been a daunting sight for the visiting side and their inspired young opponents soon forced them back on their heels.Chris Dilo leaped athletically to tip over a Danny Wilson header, the goalkeeper was also tested by Callum Paterson from long range, while the fit-again Ryan Stevenson fired into the side netting.However, uncertainty within Hearts' back-line overshadowed their lively forward play and breathed confidence into fluttering Buddies hearts.MacDonald's chest came to the rescue after Dylan McGowan's short pass-back presented Kenny McLean with a one-on-one with the goalkeeper.McLean flashed a 25-yarder just wide then McGowan pounced on another moment of hesitancy to send a lob over the goalkeeper and just past the post.McGowan should have done better than fire over after cleverly finding room for himself on the edge of the penalty box, while McLean had a curling free-kick beaten away by MacDonald.Paterson's lack of composure led to a good opening ending high in the stand before the Buddies broke through at the other end.Conor Newton's curling cross found McGinn powering in at the back post to head into the roof of the net.Hearts were first out the traps again after the break and Paterson once more failed to hit the target when found in acres of space only 16 yards from goal.St Mirren breathed another sigh of relief before marching down the other end to extend their lead.MacDonald could only parry David van Zanten's low cross-come-shot into a crowded six-yard box and McGowan looked like he knew little about it as it struck his shin before trundling over the line.Apart from a McLean header tipped over by MacDonald, St Mirren were camped in their own half thereafter.For all their pressure, with Jamie Walker leading the way with some jinking runs into the box, Hearts were unable to avoid their own run without a win extending to seven games.</body>

      <description>A St Johnstone defeat of Inverness knocks the Highland side off the top of the Scottish Premiership.</description>

      <body>St Johnstone ended a run of five matches without a win in stunning style to knock Inverness Caledonian thistle off the top of the Premiership.The opener came through Stevie May's finish from Gary McDonald's cross.May then turned provider, Dave Mackay striking home from the centre of the penalty area.And Steven MacLean benefitted from two more May assists to net Saints' third and fourth goals in the second half as the visitors toiled in Perth.The hosts' first victory since a 4-0 rout against Ross County was another emphatic win for manager Tommy Wright and deserved a bigger audience than the 3,020 inside McDiarmid Park.For Inverness, their second defeat of the season drops them down to second, three points behind Celtic and seven ahead of sixth-place Saints.St Johnstone's play was quick and slick straight from kick-off and they deservedly went ahead when Caley Thistle could not cope with the superior passing and movement that led to May stabbing home his seventh goal of the season.That lead was doubled when a carbon copy build-up again opened up the Inverness defence and Mackay burst through for a shot which goalkeeper Dean Brill got a hand to but could not keep out.Caley Thistle blasted out of the blocks at the start of the second half to try to turn things around but it was St Johnstone who threatened again with a Nigel Hasselbaink shot which was tipped over the bar by Brill.And there was a similar save at the other end from Alan Mannus to deny Aaron Doran's 25-yard effort.St Johnstone put the match out of the reach of Inverness when 20-year-old May picked out MacLean at the edge of the penalty box and he placed a shot into the corner of the net.And MacLean struck again to complete the scoring. It was all down to the persistence of the outstanding May, who won a tussle with Graeme Shinnie at the corner flag and knocked the ball across goal for MacLean to tap.</body>

      <title>Feeding 5,000 highlights food waste</title>
      <description>Edinburgh chefs cook up meal to highlight food waste</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-24406749</url>
      <date>1380931482</date>
      <body>Feeding up to 5,000 people in a day is no easy task but a team of chefs and volunteers are hoping to do just that in Edinburgh on Saturday to highlight the issue of food waste.They will be creating free meals using ingredients which might otherwise not have been used.Scottish households throw away 566,000 tonnes of food waste every year, according to Zero Waste Scotland.In the small kitchen of an Edinburgh restaurant preparations are under way for lunchtime service. Freshly baked sourdough bread comes out of the oven, meanwhile the chef is examining lobsters, mussels and potatoes from their allotment."I dug these up on Sunday," says Neil Forbes, chef director at Café St Honore."These are a variety called pink fir apple potatoes, which are just sensational, look how nutty and knobbly they look. Incredible."He is passionate about kitchen traditions, but on Saturday he will be swapping his own kitchen for a marquee as he oversees the cooking by a team of other chefs of up to 5,000 meals. He believes the issue of food waste is crucial."You have to put your business hat on sometimes and think well if I could sell that and there's nothing wrong with it, why would I throw that away if it's perfectly edible and good to eat."It may not be attractive to look at, it may be a wonky carrot or a misshapen courgette but there's nothing wrong with it taste-wise, so by the time you've cut it up or made it into a pot of soup or a stew, then surely it's just madness to throw it away."The most wasted foods are fresh fruit and vegetables, salads, bread and cakes, with the average Scottish household throwing out something like £430 worth of food a year"In Scotland we throw away 566,000 tonnes of food waste every year from our homes, that's the equivalent of 38,000 double-decker buses," says Ylva Haglund of Zero Waste Scotland."Three quarters of this could have been avoided if we managed our food a little bit better, for example using it up in time or not over-cooking and ending up throwing out food afterwards."But is that message getting through?"I'm pretty good at using what I buy," says one woman shopper in the centre of Edinburgh.Another woman, hurrying along with bags under her arms, admits she is rather less efficient: "Vegetables that I haven't got through, stuff that's in the fridge, after a week, you just clear it all out."I should really watch what I buy."The vegetables being used to cook up Saturday's meals are mainly ones which might not meet the specifications for retail in supermarkets and could go to other parts of the food chain or even cattle feed.The Scottish Retail Consortium says the major grocery retailers "have been at the forefront of ensuring that EU fruit and vegetable marketing regulations were relaxed so that the strict marketing conditions on 26 types of fruit and vegetables were loosened so that more 'wonky' fruit and vegetables could be sold in dedicated value ranges."They are also working with farmers to make more of the crop by, for example, using 'wonkier' fruit and vegetables in basic lines or using it in processed products."It also says it is working to reach targets "agreed with the Scottish government to reduce food waste in the supply chain and help consumers reduce household waste."Saturday's event, organised by the group, Edible Edinburgh is also trying to touch on wider issues of food sustainability in the city and the public will be asked for their views on developing a strategy to advance that."The amount of food that we waste in the north, the developed world is more than the amount of food people eat in sub-Saharan Africa," says Pete Ritchie, director of the group Nourish Scotland. He is also a member of the Edible Edinburgh project."It's pretty poor, it shows how disconnected we've become from the value of food."One of the dishes on offer on Saturday will be a vegetable curry, cooked with a glut of coriander and tomato puree nearing its use by date."I'm hoping we will have created discussion and debate," says Charlie Cornelius, the chef-proprietor at Iglu restaurant in Edinburgh. He will be in charge of that curry kitchen which could turn out about 830 meals."That people will have had fun coming out, coming together through food, creating community through food. There's nothing more important than that."</body>

      <description>New flavours catapult porridge to a healthy breakfast staple</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/0/24082660</url>
      <date>1380900821</date>
      <body>Porridge's exact origins have "been lost in the mists of time", but new flavours, different grains and its nutritional benefits have catapulted it into a modern healthy breakfast staple.The simplicity of porridge is also its beauty.There are few foods that can be made as easily as a bowl of water mixed with oats, perhaps with a sprinkle of salt (the traditionally Scottish way) or sugar.Or that can be transformed with the addition of berries or fruit, spices, nuts, honey, syrups, milk, cream or even booze.Couple this with its healthy appeal, and sales of oats and ready-made porridge in the UK are skyrocketing.However aficionado John Boa's attempts at blending flavours in the annual World Porridge Championships in Carrbridge, in the Scottish Highlands have not always been successful."Keeping it simple is my philosophy when it comes to the speciality section," he says."The first year [I added] beer and nuts and called it my all day porridge. It didn't go down at all well."With wooden stirring tools known as spurtles at the ready, enthusiastic cooks from as far afield as Sweden and America must prepare their porridge using oatmeal, water and salt, with the option to add flavours in a speciality section.John Boa, is a previous winner of the coveted golden spurtle prize, and in 2012 his honeyed hazelnut porridge swirl won the people's choice award.This year he is entering his recipe for a toffee sauce and nut version at the 20th annual competition.The interest in porridge is not confined to a few die-hard enthusiasts in the Highlands.In fact 49% of people in the UK eat porridge, according to market research firm Mintel, with 23% of people eating it daily.It says sales of hot cereals - largely made up of porridge - have almost doubled since 2008, hitting £241m in 2013, and volume sales rising by 25% to 81 million kg.Cafe chain Pret A Manger's sales of hot pots have doubled since it began selling them in 2010, and it now sells more than 60,000 each week.Why the increase in popularity? It could be put down to successive cold winters or a growing awareness of porridge's nutritional value.Heidi Lanschuetzer, food and drinks analyst at Mintel says: "While porridge has found a way to tap into the out of home breakfast occasion, the segment has also benefited from oats' inherent health benefits, notably the fact that they can lower cholesterol, as well as their widely held associations with satiety - a factor which is of particular importance when it comes to buying breakfast cereals."Oats, which form the basis of traditional porridge are often called a "superfood" because of the many nutrients they contain.Oats are a wholegrain product, rather than a refined one says Dr Frank Thies of the Rowett Institute of Nutrition and Health."If you compare that with white bread, wholemeal bread contains lots of good vital chemicals, nutrients and vitamins that are removed from the grain when you process the flour to make white bread."Like any other wholegrain product, oats are very good for you."Oats contain protein, magnesium, potassium, iron, calcium, Vitamin E, and Vitamin B, and have no sodium or cholesterol.In addition, they contain large amounts of soluble fibre including beta-glucan, which is known to lower cholesterol.Professor Derek Stewart, from the James Hutton Institute, says in Britain's Favourite Supermarket Foods porridge is "outstanding"."Beta-glucan is soluble dietary fibre - beta-glucan dissolves the water and forms a gloopy thick mass," he says.This can help the stomach feel fuller, for longer - but does it actually suppress appetite and prevent snacking?Dr Thies advises that studies are still ongoing."We don't know if it's due to the effects of food or just because you have a [full] feeling in your stomach due to the viscosity of the material."More research is needed, but it might be the case that oats affect the signal telling your body that it should stop eating," says Dr Thies.Dr Izhat Khan, a consultant with NHS Scotland is competing in the World Porridge Championships for the first time.He regularly extols its benefits to diabetic patients who must control levels of glucose in their blood (glycaemia)."Oatmeal offers very good glycaemic control," says Dr Khan. "If you have a bowl of porridge in the morning then you do not have the craving for elevenses and you avoid the snacks that can be quite unhealthy."There are no big insulin surges and you have satiety that lasts until lunchtime."For those on a gluten-free diet a daily bowl of oat porridge may not be an option, though some gluten-free brands are on sale.Pure oatmeal does not contain gluten, but can often be contaminated with wheat or barley during factory production.However "pseudo-cereals", plants that produce grains such as amaranth or buckwheat, can be substituted for oats in a dish of porridge.Oats form the basis of what we think of as traditional porridge in Britain but many other countries can also lay claim to the name, albeit with variations."[Claiming porridge as their own] is a pretty clever trick that the Scots have pulled off," says Guthrie Hutton, author of A Bowl of Porridge."They have managed to get oatmeal porridge recognised as the one true porridge and to have it identified with Scotland. [But] people make porridge using different grains in different countries around the world."Varieties of porridge made with ingredients other than oats have been eaten around the globe for thousands of years.Quinoa has been used in porridge for more than 3,000 years while in China, according to legend, rice porridge or congee has been eaten since 2500BC.According to Mr Hutton, oats have been a staple of the Scottish diet for so long their origins are "lost in the mists of time"."The oat crop was brought into Scotland possibly even [as far back as] Roman times, nobody really quite knows when."It was derived from natural grasses that probably originated somewhere like the Middle East but found in the cold, wet climate of Scotland a fairly ideal habitat."The important role of porridge in history was recently highlighted by academic Alistair Moffat, who claimed the invention of porridge changed the world.He suggested that feeding youngsters porridge allowed mothers to stop breastfeeding earlier, freeing them to bear more children, in turn increasing the world's population.Meanwhile some think that its health benefits could be exploited even more.Heidi Lanschuetzer, from Mintel says: "Given that the usage of porridge stands at half of all Brits, the hot cereals segment still offers strong potential for future growth in areas such as vitamin or mineral fortification or flavour innovation."At the World Porridge Championships, innovation is celebrated - and Dr Khan plans to introduce Eastern flavours."I'll be using cinnamon, cardamom seeds, ground, skinned almonds and pistachio for garnish," he says. "I'll be using French honey for the flavour."Author Guthrie Hutton is more of a traditionalist, preferring his to be served with water and salt.But he also recommends one other daily traditional taste of Scotland: "My recipe for long life is a bowl of porridge in the morning and a tot of whisky at night."Follow BBC Food on Pinterest and on twitter: @BBCFood</body>

      <title>For Those In Peril shows Scottish films still buoyant</title>
      <description>Scottish films proving to be very buoyant</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-24363250</url>

      <body>For Those In Peril is one of three Scottish films getting a cinematic release in the same week.It is such a rare situation that the producers of the low-budget independent movie have decided their film, which will be in cinemas in the rest of UK on Friday, should wait a few weeks before being viewed in the country in which it is set.For some odd reason, two other high-profile Scottish films are being released across the UK on 4 October.Filth, an 18-certificate film version of Irvine Welsh's novel about a corrupt Edinburgh police officer, which stars James McAvoy, began screening in Scotland a week ahead of its official release to avoid a direct clash with Sunshine on Leith.The considerably more feelgood film, which is also set in Edinburgh, uses Proclaimers songs to drive the plot and lists young actor George MacKay as one its stars.Mackay also takes the lead role in For Those In Peril, in which he plays Aaron, a young misfit who is the lone survivor of a fishing tragedy.In Scottish director Paul Wright's debut feature five young men from a small north east Scotland village are killed but for some inexplicable reason Aaron survives.Wright says he never imagined when he was casting the role of a troubled young man from an Aberdeenshire fishing village he would end up giving the part to a public schoolboy from London.However, the 32-year-old director says the whole film is based on the "incredible performance" from 21-year-old Mackay and they were very lucky to get him "while we could afford him".Wright says they saw lots of talented Scottish actors but as soon as Mackay auditioned they knew he was something special.The director says he worked closely with the young actor to create the character of Aaron, whose post-traumatic anguish and survivor's guilt means he struggles to come to terms with the death of his brother in the fishing tragedy.Wright says of Mackay: "He gave 100% and we couldn't have done it without him. He was in practically every scene."Mackay, who also stars in the new film How I Live Now, spends more time than could have been good for him up to his neck in the North Sea as Aaron continues his quest to find his brother.Wright says: "It was us that had to tell George to stop rather than the other way around."He was wanting to go in again. Through mild hypothermia, he was saying 'I'll go again'. That's the kind of guy he is. He's such a talent."The director, whose short film Until the River Runs Red won a Bafta in 2011, grew up in the East Neuk of Fife and says the script was written with his own home village in mind."When we came to the film, for whatever reason, Gourdon in Aberdeenshire felt more like the village I grew up in than the actual village I grew up in," he says.Wright says during his childhood he heard lots of stories and myths about the ocean and these loom large in Aaron's story.In the film, the anguished youngster, brought up on local folk fables about sea monsters that eat people, struggles to deal with finality of death and desperately clings to the belief his brother could still be alive in the body of a devil in the deep.Wright, whose own father died when he was 15, says the theme of coping with death keeps recurring in his work."It was not a starting place that I'm going to write a film about my past but it comes through in the film," he says."Not to self-analyse myself too much, I was of that age where I could not totally accept death."It was my first real experience with death and I was of that age when the mind does wander, thinking about what is and isn't possible. Not accepting death as the final thing."The film is the last production under the Warp X banner, which was set up for new film directors to create movies on a lower budget, with less expectation for high box office revenues.Its successes include Paddy Considine's Tyrannosaur, Ben Wheatley's Kill List and Berberian Sound Studio by Peter Strickland.For Those In Peril has already been a critical success on the festival circuit, including at Cannes earlier this year.Wright says: "Although it's a very Scottish film, it does have themes in it that hopefully do translate around the world."We aren't kidding ourselves that we have made a commercial blockbuster but it was always important that people who did connect with it, really connected with it."For Those in Peril will be released in most of the UK on 4 October and in Scotland on 8 November.</body>

      <body>Sir Bruce Forsyth has dropped out of hosting Saturday's Strictly Come Dancing after falling ill with flu.The showbiz veteran, who fronts the show with Tess Daly, has hosted the series since it launched in 2004.Sir Bruce, 85, last missed a programme because of illness in 2009. He will be replaced by Claudia Winkleman.The BBC said: "Sir Bruce Forsyth has the flu and therefore isn't feeling well enough to present tomorrow's Strictly Come Dancing on BBC One."The show looks forward to his return next week."Winkleman usually hosts the Sunday evening results show with Daly, and and has stood in for Sir Bruce in the past.Saturday will see 15 celebrity couples, including Vanessa Feltz and Hairy Biker Dave Myers, take to the dance floor and face the public vote for the first time.Model Abbey Clancy and new professional dancer Aljaz Skorjanec topped the leader board last week, scoring 32 points from the judges for their waltz. TV chef Myers and golfer Tony Jacklin were bottom of the table, with just 16 points each.The points accrued last week will be carried over to this weekend, when one couple will leave the series.</body>

      <body>Pop star Miley Cyrus has hit back at Sinead O'Connor, after the Irish singer warned her not to be exploited by the music business.In a series of tweets, Cyrus mocked O'Connor, comparing her to US actress Amanda Bynes before alluding to O'Connor's mental health problems.O'Connor responded with another open letter to the singer, accusing her of "irresponsible" behaviour.The Irish singer told her to "remove her tweets immediately".The tit-for-tat conversation began after Cyrus, 20, cited O'Connor's video Nothing Compares 2 U as an inspiration for her explicit Wrecking Ball video.O'Connor, 46, said she was prompted to write, "in the spirit of motherliness" after "phone calls from various newspapers" who wanted the singer-songwriter to comment upon similarities between the two videos.In the video for Nothing Compares 2 U, O'Connor sheds a single tear as she performs the Prince-penned break-up ballad.Cyrus cries in the promo clip for Wrecking Ball, which shares similar lyrical themes to O'Connor's song. But the video also finds her licking a sledgehammer and swinging naked on a metal demolition ball.O'Connor said she was "extremely concerned" that those around Cyrus had led or encouraged her to believe "that it is in any way 'cool' to be naked and licking sledgehammers in your videos".Cyrus, who found fame as the child star of Disney children's show Hannah Montana, has been criticised in recent weeks for her controversial performances, particularly at the MTV Video Music Awards in Brooklyn last month.O'Connor continued: "The message you keep sending is that it's somehow cool to be prostituted.. it's so not cool Miley... it's dangerous."It is in fact the case that you will obscure your talent by allowing yourself to be pimped, whether it's the music business or yourself doing the pimping," added O'Connor.Responding on Twitter, Cyrus wrote: "Top of the mornin to ya."She added a screen shot of O'Connor's tweets from 2012 in which the Irish star, who has bi-polar disorder, referred to her own mental health problems, asking for Twitter followers to recommend a psychiatrist.She compared the singer to former child actress Amanda Bynes, who is currently undergoing psychiatric treatment."I don't have time to write you an open letter cause I'm hosting and performing on SNL this week," Cyrus continued.Cyrus also tweeted a picture of O'Connor ripping up a photograph of the pope, an infamous on-stage stunt by the singer, before asking her to "meet up and talk".Responding to Cyrus in a third open letter, O'Connor said she would take legal action against her if she did not remove the tweets."You have posted today tweets of mine which are two years old, which were posted by me when I was unwell and seeking help so as to make them look like they are recent."In doing so you mock myself and Amanda Bynes for having suffered with mental health issues and for having sought help," said O'Connor.She added: "It is most unbecoming of you to respond in such a fashion to someone who expressed care for you," O'Connor added.</body>

      <title>C4's Hunt denies age discrimination</title>
      <description>Channel 4's Jay Hunt denies racing pundit John McCririck claims that she was a "serial age discrimination offender".</description>

      <date>1380898859</date>
      <body>Channel 4's Jay Hunt has denied racing pundit John McCririck's claims that she was a "serial age discrimination offender".Speaking at an employment tribunal in London, Ms Hunt said she felt there was "no correlation" between younger presenters drawing younger audiences.She accused Mr McCririck of making "false allegations".The 73-year-old - who was dropped by the channel last year - is accusing his former employers of age discrimination.Ms Hunt - chief creative officer at Channel 4 - told the tribunal she had instigated voluntary training courses on discrimination at the broadcaster after she joined from the BBC, adding that she had "learned her lesson" from the Miriam O'Reilly case.Ms O'Reilly, who was in her 50s when she was dropped from the BBC's Countryfile programme, won an age discrimination case against the corporation in 2011.Mr McCririck had cited Moira Stuart's decision to leave the BBC while Ms Hunt was the BBC's controller of daytime. Ms Hunt said she had no involvement in the Stuart decision.In a statement, Ms Hunt noted: "John McCririck's allegation that I am a 'serial age discrimination offender' is untrue."I have been responsible for a channel or part of a channel for the past eight years. In that time, hundreds of on-screen talent decisions have been run past me by those making them."Only one of those decisions has ever led to a claim of age discrimination and, contrary to what John McCririck says, I have learnt from that case."She added: "I had no reason to believe that anyone in the team which worked up the new programme had acted on the grounds of John McCririck's age, and that remains the position."'Chauvanistic extraordinaire'Jamie Aitchison, Channel 4's commissioning editor for sport - who was responsible for dropping Mr McCririck from the channel's horse-racing coverage - told a tribunal earlier this week that the pundit's "exaggerated tone" was "out of step" with the channel's coverage.His opinion was echoed by a senior television producer, giving evidence on Friday, who had previously called for Mr McCririck to be dropped from the revamped racing line-up.Carl Hicks, part of production company IMG - which is also being sued by Mr McCririck - told the central London hearing that the commentator "was not appropriate and there was not an appropriate role for him"."John was an eccentric and seen, at worst, as a loud-mouthed and chauvinistic extraordinaire which was not what I wanted to be part of the team to broaden racing."He also told the hearing that Mr McCririck was inclined to upset his fellow colleagues.In his tribunal witness statement, he said: "My view remained that John McCririck was not right for the programme and I thought he should not be included in any capacity."I was fully aware that John was one of the most recognisable faces in horseracing," adding that he held the pundit's expertise for the subject in the highest regard."However, I did not think his exaggerated presentation style was consistent with a more serious programme and was aware that he had a potential to offend and alienate viewers and potential viewers.In March 2012, Channel 4 secured the rights to broadcast all UK horse racing events for the following year, including "crown jewel" events such as Royal Ascot and the Grand National. A new-look team, fronted by Clare Balding, took over last year.The hearing continues.</body>

      <title>Shankar addresses Delhi gang rape</title>
      <description>Musician Anoushka Shankar says she decided to reveal her own experiences of sexual abuse after the gang rape and murder of a woman in Delhi.</description>

      <date>1380907941</date>
      <body>Musician Anoushka Shankar says she was prompted to reveal her experience of sexual abuse after learning of the gang rape and murder of a woman in Delhi.Shankar, daughter of legendary Indian sitar player Ravi Shankar, said in February she had been abused by "a man my parents trusted" in her childhood.Her revelation followed the fatal attack on an Indian student, for which four men have been sentenced to death."Her story is the apex of millions of stories," Shankar told BBC Radio 4.Speaking on the Front Row programme, she said: "No-one I knew could help being affected by the gravity and intensity of that attack - and if it resonates with something in our experience then obviously it doubles the impact of hearing a story like that."I felt quite conscious as an Indian woman that there was a very unique moment happening where the entire world's attention was on sexual violence and on the role and position of women in India."I felt almost an obligation [to talk about my experience]. It didn't feel dragged out of me. If I was ever going to talk about my story, that felt like the right moment."Shankar, 32, took the decision to talk about her experiences in a video, recorded in her London home, in which she appealed for people to support a campaign in memory of the gang rape victim."As a child I suffered sexual and emotional abuse for several years at the hands of a man my parents trusted implicitly," she said.She added the attacks had included "groping, touching and verbal abuse".Reflecting on the statement, the musician told Front Row's John Wilson: "It was something I never spoke to the media about."It had never felt like something relevant in a public context until this moment where I thought 'hang on, it's important for people to realise that this kind of thing can happen to anyone, anywhere'."I think there's a class issue in India where there can be an assumption that things like this don't happen to people from upper classes or who are privileged. I think part of what shocked people within India was that [the victim] was a middle-class girl. It's so ridiculous."The musician has responded to the attack, and tried to address its causes, with a track on her new album, Traces Of You.She said the song, which references the 23-year-old victim's name in its title, tries to capture a sense of the horror of the attack.The album, recorded with producer Nitin Sawhney and her sister Norah Jones, also addresses the death of her father last year.Shankar said her experiences had informed the spirit of the record, and brought a sense of "resilience" to the music."It's not necessarily about the passing of my father, it's about me passing through the passing of my father."There's a way that we all go through horrible and painful things and I'm not nullifying it in any way when I say we do go on."My childhood experiences were one of the big experiences for me [but] I know as a woman I've come through that."At some cost, but I've come through it."You can hear the full interview with Anoushka Shankar on BBC Radio 4's Front Row at 19:15 BST on 4 October, 2013. It will then be available on the iPlayer.</body>

      <body>Photojournalist Bill Eppridge - who took images of the aftermath of Robert Kennedy's assassination - has died aged 75.Eppridge died in hospital in Connecticut from a blood infection caused by a fall.His image of Kennedy lying on the floor of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles is widely considered one of the greatest news photos of all time.He worked for Life Magazine at the time of the shooting in 1968.Friend and fellow photographer David Hume Kennerly said: "He extended a helping hand and a bushel of inspiration to me, and his kindness shaped the course of my career.Born in Buenos Aires, Eppridge moved to the US with his family as a young boy.Working as a staff photographer for Life Magazine from 1964, he covered a wide variety of stories from revolutions in Latin America to the Beatles' arrival in the US.Eppridge followed Kennedy from a campaign event at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles into the back kitchen where a 24-year-old Palestinian Christian, Sirhan Sirhan, shot and killed the 42-year-old presidential hopeful.Eppridge took several black and white images that night, but the most enduring and haunting depicted Kennedy lying on the floor, with a halo of light in the background, with a hotel worker at his side."You are not just a photojournalist, you're a historian," he once explained when asked how he could keep snapping pictures while someone was lying injured in front of him.Commenting on his unforgettable image of Kennedy, he said: "I never hung it on my wall."His 1965 photo essay about a drug-addicted New York couple inspired the Al Pacino film The Panic in Needle Park.After leaving Life in 1972, Eppridge worked for other magazines including Time and Sports Illustrated.Before his death, he and his wife, Adrienne Aurichio, had been putting the finishing touches to a book on the Beatles, to mark next year's 50th anniversary of their arrival to the US.</body>

      <description>Crime writer Alexander McCall Smith becomes the latest contemporary writer invited to reinterpret the work of Jane Austen for a modern audience.</description>

      <date>1380853304</date>
      <body>Crime writer Alexander McCall Smith has become the latest contemporary writer invited to reinterpret the work of Jane Austen for a modern audience.The Edinburgh-based author said being asked to write a 21st Century version of Emma was "like being asked to eat a box of delicious chocolates".McCall Smith's take on Emma will be published next autumn, 199 years after the original's debut.Joanna Trollope's version of Sense and Sensibility is due out this month.Val McDermid's interpretation of Northanger Abbey will follow next year, while a new version of Pride and Prejudice by US writer Curtis Sittenfeld comes out in 2015.The names of two more writers who are taking part in the six-book Austen Project will be announced later this year."Writing a contemporary version of Emma is both a privilege and a real challenge," said McCall Smith, best known as the author of The No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency."Not only is Emma one of the finest novels in the English language, but it is possibly Jane Austen's most thought-provoking and interesting book."Trollope said it was "wonderful to hear" that McCall Smith was taking on Emma, a heroine she said would "benefit" from being "handled by a man".The project's authors have to stick with their individual novel's existing plot and characters, but are free to make some changes.Emma tells of an immature young woman whose attempts to play matchmaker backfire both on herself and those she attempts to bring together.Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Beckinsale are among those to have played the character on screen, while the story was successfully transplanted to a modern setting in 1995 film Clueless.Mansfield Park and Sense and Sensibility are the other two titles that will be adapted as part of the Harper Collins project, one of several attempts to adapt or continue Austen's works.Others include Death Comes to Pemberley, a 2011 sequel to Pride and Prejudice by P D James that is currently being turned into a BBC TV series.</body>

      <body>Morrissey's autobiography is to be published later this month after the former Smiths singer resolved a dispute with his publisher that had threatened to derail the book's release.Last month, the singer claimed "a last-minute content disagreement" with Penguin had led the deal to "collapse".Despite initially saying he was seeking a new publisher, Morrissey has now patched up relations with Penguin.Penguin Classics said Autobiography by Morrissey would come out on 17 October.That is a month later than the original publication date of 16 September.A Penguin spokesperson declined to comment on the cause of the dispute and the delay.The memoir is expected to lift the lid on the 54-year-old's life growing up in Manchester and his relationship with his former bandmates in The Smiths, one of the most important bands in British music.He has enjoyed a successful solo career since the band split up in 1987 and is also known for outspoken views on animal cruelty, politics and the royal family.This year, the singer suffered a series of what he referred to as "medical mishaps" which led to him cancelling his US tour.He was also forced to cancel part of his South American tour in July due, he said, to a "lack of funding".</body>

      <body>Oscar-winning actress Jane Fonda is to be recognised with the American Film Institute's lifetime achievement award.She follows in the footsteps of her father, Henry Fonda, who was handed the AFI's highest honour in 1978.Fonda has made more than 40 films, winning Academy Awards for both Klute in 1971 and 1978's Coming Home.She returned to acting in 2005 after a 15-year hiatus and has recently been seen in HBO drama The Newsroom and as Nancy Regan in Lee Daniels' The Butler."Jane Fonda is American film royalty," said chair of the AFI board, Howard Stringer, in a statement."A bright light first introduced to the world as the daughter of Henry Fonda, the world watched as she found her own voice and forged her own path as an actor and a cultural icon."Today she stands tall among the giants of American film."Off screen Fonda is well known as a political activist, protesting against the war in Vietnam in the 1970s, and campaigning for other causes such as equal rights and the environment.The actress was also a prominent figure in the aerobics craze of the 1980s, releasing two dozen workout videos and numerous books.She received an Emmy nomination earlier this year for her role as Leona Lansing in Aaron Sorkin drama The Newsroom, which also stars Jeff Daniels and Emily Mortimer.Her autobiography, My Life So Far, topped the New York Times bestseller list.The Fondas are the first father and daughter to both be recognised by the AFI, although several other families have received double honours, including father and son Kirk and Michael Douglas and brother and sister Warren Beatty and Shirley MacLaine.Fonda made her film debut in 1960 comedy Tall Story but it was her performance in 1969 depression-era drama They Shoot Horses, Don't They? that earned her her first Oscar nomination.The actress, whose other film credits include Barbarella, The China Syndrome and The Morning After, will be presented with the honour at a gala ceremony in Los Angeles next year.</body>

      <title>Beatles memorabilia price gap probed</title>
      <description>An inquiry is launched after £2m of public money was used to buy Beatles memorabilia later revalued at £300,000.</description>

      <body>An inquiry has been launched after £2m of public money was used to buy Beatles memorabilia later revalued at £300,000.The review of the 2008 purchase by Merseytravel began when auditors found a conflict of interest between the valuer and seller.KPMG said "serious failures" occurred when the transport authority bought items including John Lennon's glasses for The Beatles Story museum.Merseytravel said "due process" was not followed but changes had been made.The authority took over the running of the museum in 2008.It bought Lennon's wire-rimmed glasses for a permanent exhibition at The Beatles Story museum which it runs along with two other Merseyside visitor attractions.The glasses and other exhibits including handwritten studio notes from Beatles producer George Martin were revalued as part of an internal scrutiny process.When the valuation was put at £300,000, Merseytravel started its own investigation. The auditor, KPMG, also found two areas of concern over the purchase.The combined report said: "The person carrying out the valuation had been a company director with the person selling the Beatles' items."Although the conflict was identified, the lawyers were still instructed to proceed with using this valuer."Both issues represent a serious failure in corporate governance."KPMG recommended a "full investigation into the Beatles memorabilia valuation and the authority should take appropriate action".Merseytravel chairman Liam Robinson confirmed its initial investigation showed elements of "due process" were not followed.He said: "We will look to take action if we establish that we were let down by those we were relying on at the time and that the interests of the taxpayer were not well served in the original negotiation."This could not happen now. Our new governance and scrutiny processes would not allow it."Mr Robinson added The Beatles Story was "unaffected by this revaluation" and "remains profitable".KPMG concluded it was "satisfied" that Merseytravel had "proper arrangements in place for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in their use of resources."</body>

      <body>More than £2.3m has been raised for charity as dozens of Gromit statues were auctioned in Bristol.All 81 of the sculptures were sold for Wallace and Gromit's Grand Appeal, which is raising £3.5m for an expansion of Bristol Royal Hospital for Children.One lot, Gromit Lightyear, designed by animation studio Pixar and based on the Toy Story character, sold for £65,000.Nick Park, who created the Gromit character, said he was "stunned" by how much had been raised."I couldn't wait to see the Pixar Gromit Lightyear go because obviously that was a top runner," Mr Park said."It just kept going up. When the first few started climbing I started tingling. It was double the target."It is obviously for the children's hospital, everyone has been so generous, the people in the room, on the internet and the artists," he added.Bidders packed into a specially erected pavilion at Bristol's Cribbs Causeway shopping centre, with almost 2,000 more taking part in the action online.One of the unsuccessful bidders was five-year-old Thom Clarke from Fishponds.He wrote a letter to the "Gromit keepers" to say he had visited all of the statues over the summer and Blossom was his favourite."I have £11.57 saved up and I would like to bid my money on Blossom please."I hope I win," he said.The Grand Appeal hopes to fund state-of-the-art equipment, family facilities and child-friendly artwork to complement a £31m investment by the NHS.Last month a pre-auction show of the Gromit sculptures, called The Greatest Dog Show On Earth, drew crowds of about 22,000.They had previously been displayed around the city during the summer and quickly became a popular tourist attraction.While the majority of the sculptures were based around Bristol, there were others at London Paddington station, Westonbirt Arboretum in Gloucestershire, Cheddar Gorge in Somerset and Hawkesbury Upton, South Gloucestershire.The trail attracted visitors from numerous countries across Europe, the Americas and Asia.</body>

      <title>Fewer children 'read in spare time'</title>
      <description>Fewer children in the UK are reading in their own time and one in five says they are embarrassed to be caught with a book, a survey suggests.</description>

      <body>Fewer children across the UK are reading in their own time and one in five is embarrassed to be caught with a book, a survey suggests.Just over a quarter of 35,000 children from 188 schools told the National Literacy Trust that they read outside of school.About the same number said they did not think their parents cared if they read.The trust says a similar survey in 2005 found one in three children read in their own time.The survey for the trust involved children filling in online questionnaires last winter.Half of those taking part said they enjoyed reading either "very much" or "quite a lot" and a high proportion (four out of five) agreed with the statement "the more I read, the better I become".Nearly two in five agreed reading was "cool", but about one in three said they only read when they had to.Report author Christina Clark, from the Literacy Trust, said young people who enjoyed reading very much were four times as likely to read above the level expected for their age compared with those who did not enjoy reading at all.Those who read outside of class every day were five times as likely to read above the expected level compared with those who never did.And children who do not think "reading is cool" were four times more likely to be below-average readers, the report says.National Literacy Trust director Jonathan Douglas said: "Our research not only reveals that children are reading less and developing more negative attitudes towards reading, but also that there is a clear correlation between this and their performance in reading tests."The study, of children aged from eight to 16, found that the proportion who read e-books outside of school had doubled since 2010 to 12%.Reading is most popular among eight to 11-year-olds, the survey suggests, although teenagers are more likely to read for longer.The charity released the research to coincide with a new campaign to find the UK's "literacy heroes".It is asking the public to name people who might have inspired a love of books or helped to improve reading skills.Anyone from a parent, teacher or young person who has overcome a personal literacy problem to a favourite author or celebrity can be nominated, the Literacy Trust said.The campaign is being supported by the Duchess of Cornwall, who said: "I firmly believe in the importance of igniting a passion for reading in the next generation."In a world where the written word competes with so many other calls on our attention, we need more literacy heroes to keep inspiring young people to find the pleasure and power of reading for themselves."</body>

      <title>Crystal Palace £500m plans unveiled</title>
      <description>Plans to build a replica of the Crystal Palace on the site of the original Victorian building in south London will create 2,000 permanent and temporary jobs, say investors.</description>

      <date>1380805135</date>
      <body>Plans to build a replica of the Crystal Palace on the site of the original Victorian building in south London have been unveiled.ZhongRong Group wants to build a new cultural attraction and restore the surrounding park in Bromley.The original was built in 1851 in Hyde Park but moved to Crystal Palace in 1854. It burnt down in 1936.The Chinese investment group announced its plans at an event with the mayor and leader of Bromley Council.The project is expected to create more than 2,000 permanent and temporary jobs as well as attract wider investment into the local high streets.ZhongRong Group chairman Ni Zhaoxing said: "London is renowned across the world for its history and culture and the former Crystal Palace is celebrated in China as a magnificent achievement."This project is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to bring its spirit back to life by recreating the Crystal Palace and restoring the park to its former glory."Mayor of London Boris Johnson welcomed the announcement and said together with Bromley Council, he would work closely with the ZhongRong Group to progress the plans.However, London assembly Green Party member Darren Johnson said it was a "poorly-timed" proposal.He said: "While I'm sure many people would love to see the Crystal Palace raised from the ashes, this precious parkland isn't the right place for it."When the palace was moved there in the 1850s the newly-laid out park was near countryside, but today it's an urban park with a lot of space already taken up by the national sports centre, car parks, roads and the caravan site."Labour London assembly member Val Shawcross said: "I would be particularly concerned about the impact of two million additional visitors per year on local transport and road networks."It is anticipated the new building will be the same size and scale as the original palace, which was designed by Joseph Paxton.The cast-iron and plate-glass building housed The Great Exhibition, which featured more than 14,000 exhibitors from around the world showing off Britain's industrial achievements.The palace and the grounds became the world's first theme park, offering education, entertainment, a rollercoaster and cricket matches, and even staged 20 FA Cup Finals between 1895 and 1914.While the palace was in existence it was the largest glass structure in the world.There will be a year of consultation and design development before plans are formally submitted in autumn 2014.</body>

      <body>Prince Charles has recorded one of his favourite Dylan Thomas poems for a special broadcast to mark National Poetry Day.The prince chose Fern Hill, the Welsh poet's reminiscences of childhood visits to an aunt's farm in Carmarthenshire.Prince Charles described the poem as "poignant and moving".He is Royal patron of the Dylan Thomas 100 Festival, which will mark the centenary of the poet's birth in 2014."For National Poetry Day, I was very glad, if somewhat hesitant - to be able to record a reading of one of my personal favourites, Fern Hill, with its poignant and moving evocation of a rural west Wales childhood," said Prince Charles."I cannot help feeling this is one of the great legacies of Thomas's poetry - that it inspires people to appreciate the incomparable landscape of Wales."The heir to the throne has made a number of broadcasts over the decades including appearing on the BBC children's programme Jackanory in 1984, reading his own book The Old Man Of Lochnagar, and in recent years making documentaries about the composer Sir Hubert Parry and royal artists.Last year, the prince visited the poet's home at Cwmdonkin Drive in Swansea, and then this year to Thomas's boathouse at Laugharne in Carmarthenshire where many of his major works were written.Thomas's granddaughter, Hannah Ellis Thomas, who is also a patron of the centenary celebrations, said: "It's fantastic that he is closely involving himself in our centenary celebrations with a reading that my grandfather would have loved, of a poem that meant so much to him and our family."The festival itself is being led by the Welsh government. First Minister Carwyn Jones added: "The festival will resurrect a passion for literature and inspire people of all ages to connect more actively with our rich cultural heritage."It is an opportunity to showcase Wales and to raise further the iconic status of this great literary figure."The prince's full recording of Fern Hill is available on the Dylan Thomas 100 official website.</body>

      <title>Diana reviews 'devastated' director</title>
      <description>The director of Diana says he has "no regrets", despite the film's "devastating" reviews in the UK.</description>

      <date>1380793310</date>
      <body>The director of Diana says he has "no regrets", despite the film's poor reception in the UK.Oliver Hirschbiegel told the BBC that the movie's critical mauling was "devastating, but when you make a film you don't think about the reactions".The Telegraph described the film "a special class of awful", while the Mirror called it "cheap and cheerless".Hirschbiegel admitted the reviews had put off audiences, but he still hoped people would "make their own minds up"."In all the other places where it's opened - in Poland, the Czech Republic, Turkey and Slovakia - it's been very strong," he said."I think for the British, Diana is still a trauma they haven't come to terms with."Starring Naomi Watts, the film depicts Princess Diana in the final years of her life, with a focus on her affair with heart surgeon Hasnat Khan, played by Lost's Naveen Andrews.It entered the UK chart at number five in its opening weekend, taking £623,000 at the box office. This week, it dropped to number nine.Hirschbiegel, who previously made Downfall, a German-language film about the last days of Hitler, called his experiences with Diana "deja vu, because it has the same reactions in the UK as Downfall had in Germany on release"."I hope it is a matter of stepping back and looking at it afresh in a year or so, because it is a very British story and I am a very German director."He added that Diana "was the most complex character I have ever tried to depict - more complex than Hitler. The one thing they both had in common was they were born actors".Earlier this week, at the Zurich Film Festival, Hirschbiegel described the film as "very un-British" and described the critical reaction as harking back "to what newspapers like the Daily Mail would write about her back then - really vile things. So I guess I succeeded."The film has been sold to distributors in more than 40 countries and will be released in the US on 1 November, 2013.</body>

      <title>Farrow paternity story 'absurd'</title>
      <description>Speculation that Frank Sinatra and not Woody Allen may be the father of Mia Farrow's 25-year-old son Ronan is dismissed by both Allen's spokesman and Sinatra's widow.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24379383</url>
      <date>1380797137</date>
      <body>Speculation that Woody Allen may not be the father of Mia Farrow's son Ronan has been dismissed as "absurd" by the director's spokesman.The claims are "so fictitious and extravagantly absurd that he is not going to comment," said his spokesman.Farrow's admission to Vanity Fair that Ronan may "possibly" have been fathered by ex-husband Frank Sinatra has also been rubbished by the singer's widow."It's just a bunch of junk," Barbara Sinatra told the Desert Sun newspaper."There's always junk written - lies that aren't true," the 85-year-old said on Wednesday. "It sounds like a phony to me."Ronan Farrow, 25, has made his own comment on the story, tweeting: "Listen, we're all *possibly* Frank Sinatra's son."Mia Farrow's comments came in a lengthy article in Vanity Fair's November issue, which also contains quotes from eight of the actress's children.In excerpts released ahead of its publication, Farrow claims she and Sinatra "never really split up" following the end of their two-year marriage in 1968.Farrow subsequently married, and divorced, the composer Andre Previn, with whom she had three children and adopted three more.The actress went on to have both a professional and personal relationship with Allen, with whom she had Ronan - originally named Satchel - in 1987.The revelation that Allen was having a secret affair with Farrow's adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn caused the break-up of their 12-year relationship in 1992.This led to a bitter custody battle in which Allen was accused of molesting their adopted daughter Dylan, charges Allen denied and which have never been proved.Dylan, who now goes under the name Malone, refers to the alleged molestation in the Vanity Fair article, claiming she had been "scared" and had "wanted it to stop"."I have never been asked to testify," she is quoted as saying. "If I could talk to the seven-year-old Dylan, I would tell her to be brave, to testify."The article offers further insights into how Farrow and Allen's acrimonious break-up has impacted on their biological and adopted children.Fletcher Previn, it is revealed, used Photoshop to remove Allen from every family photo and edited him out of the Farrow's home videos.Speaking in 2005, Allen confirmed he no longer had relationships with the three children from his relationship with Farrow.Ronan Farrow, now a human rights campaigner and journalist, is reportedly in talks to host his own show on US channel MSNBC.</body>

      <body>Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal's new film Prisoners has repeated its US success by topping the UK box office in its opening weekend.The kidnap drama made £1.37m, overtaking the Formula One film Rush, which took second place with £987,549.Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine came third despite only opening across 188 screens, compared to Prisoners' 400 and Rush's 512 screens.Filth, starring James McAvoy, enjoyed a strong start in Scotland.Based on Irvine Welsh's book of the same name, the film has been praised for McAvoy's powerful performance as a hard-drinking, morally repugnant Edinburgh policeman.It took £247,860 across just 38 locations in Scotland, coming 12th overall, but ending up as the biggest movie of the week in terms of attendance.The per cinema average of £6,523 was nearly double the figure achieved by Prisoners - but the film may struggle to replicate that performance in the rest of the UK, where it is released on Friday.Fourth place in this week's chart went to Runner Runner, starring Justin Timberlake, Ben Affleck and Gemma Arterton, while Horror sequel Insidious 2 rounded out the top 5.Prisoners stars Jackman as a father who takes matters into his own hands when his daughter and her friend go missing, while Gyllenhaal plays the small-town police detective working the case.Cate Blanchett has already been tipped for Oscar success after critics praised her performance in Blue Jasmine.The film, Allen's 46th as a writer-director, recalls Tennessee Williams' classic play A Streetcar Named Desire, with Blanchett playing a depressed New York socialite whose wealthy husband (Alec Baldwin) ends up in jail.Richard Curtis's time travelling romance About Time was in sixth place, with action movie White House Down in seventh.Animations Justin and the Knights of Valour and Monsters University both stayed in the top ten; while controversial biopic Diana, starring Naomi Watts, slipped to ninth place in its second week of release.</body>

      <description>The family of Michael Jackson loses a negligence case brought against concert promoters AEG Live over the death of the star.</description>

      <date>1380781661</date>
      <body>The family of Michael Jackson has lost a negligence case against concert promoters AEG Live over the death of the 50-year-old pop star.A jury concluded the doctor looking after Jackson ahead of his concert tour was not unfit for his job - and so AEG had not been negligent in hiring him.Jackson died in 2009 after taking an overdose of a surgical anaesthetic.Dr Conrad Murray was jailed for four years for involuntary manslaughter for administering the drug.To reach its verdict, the jury of six men and six women had to go through five key yes-no questions seeking to establish whether AEG was responsible for Murray's hiring in the first place and concerning his competence for the job.The jury decided that AEG Live did hire Murray but found that he was not unfit or incompetent for the job.Delivering the verdict, jury foreman Gregg Barden said: "That doesn't mean we felt he was ethical."The ruling was welcomed by AEG Live, who argued that they hired Murray at the request of Jackson and had no knowledge of the star's drug dependency."I counted Michael Jackson a creative partner and a friend," said AEG Live executive Randy Phillips, who had testified at the trial."We lost one of the world's greatest musical geniuses, but I am relieved and deeply grateful that the jury recognised that neither I, nor anyone else at AEG Live, played any part in Michael's tragic death."Jackson's 83-year-old mother Katherine was in court for the verdict, and appeared emotional as it was read out, Reuters news agency reports.Her lawyer, Kevin Boyle, said the family was "of course.. not happy with the result as it stands now. We will be exploring all options legally and factually and make a decision about anything at a later time."In closing arguments, the Jackson lawyers had suggested the damages they were seeking could exceed $1bn - amounts AEG Live had described as "absurd".Michael Jackson died on 25 June 2009 at his rented home in Los Angeles where he was rehearsing for a series of 'This Is It' concerts in London.It was billed as his comeback tour, coming four years after he had been acquitted in a high-profile child molestation case that took a toll on his reputation and his finances.But the five-month civil case heard about his battles with chronic pain and insomnia and a reliance on powerful painkillers.He died after Murray administered an overdose of the hospital anaesthetic propofol to help him sleep.Katherine Jackson and the star's three children had argued that AEG Live were negligent in failing to properly investigate Murray before hiring him and ignoring signs that the singer was in poor health.The concert promoters said only Jackson and Murray knew he was taking the drug and they would have pulled the plug on the tour if they had known.More than 50 witnesses testified during the trial, including Katherine Jackson and the star's eldest son, Prince.Murray is due to be released later this month after serving two years in jail.</body>

      <description>Glee star Cory Monteith died of a fatal cocktail of heroin and alcohol, a coroner's report concludes.</description>

      <body>Glee star Cory Monteith died of a fatal cocktail of heroin and alcohol, a coroner's report has concluded.The 31-year-old star, who played Finn Hudson on the hit TV show, was found dead in a Vancouver hotel in July.Investigators at the scene found drug paraphernalia, including "a spoon with drug residue and a used hypodermic needle, along with two empty champagne bottles and multiple glasses".Coroner Claire Thompson concluded that Monteith's death was "accidental".The final findings support the initial coroner's report into the death of the Canadian actor on 13 July.At the time of his death, Monteith had an alcohol level of 0.13 percent, with a "moderate" level of intoxication. The report also pointed to the presence of morphine, codeine and "6-monoacetylmorphine," a by-product of heroin.Hotel video footage showed the actor returning alone to his room in the early hours of 13 July, marking the final time he was seen alive."He had checked in to the hotel on July 6 and had been expected to check out on the 13th," the report stated. "When he had not done so, hotel staff checked his room and found him unresponsive on the floor."The report concluded the actor had been dead for several hours: "Mr Monteith was clearly deceased and resuscitation was not attempted."Monteith, who had been in Glee since its inception in 2009, was admitted to rehab earlier this year having struggled with addiction since he was a teenager. The coroner's report said the actor's "periods of abstinence ranged from years to months in duration".The report found that his erratic drug use contributed to his death, adding that "after a period of cessation from opiod drug use, a previously tolerated drug concentration level may become toxic and fatal".Glee, which follows a group of American high school misfits who form a singing club, will pay tribute to Monteith in a special episode to be broadcast in the US next week."[The] third episode will deal with the Finn Hudson character being written out of the show," Fox's Kevin Reilly told reporters at a Television Critics Association meeting in August.The show - now in its fifth series - is known for its upbeat pop covers and cameo appearances by celebrities.</body>

      <title>McAvoy: 'I toy with the audience'</title>
      <description>James McAvoy says his new film is "not for the fainthearted"</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24373354</url>
      <date>1380933124</date>
      <body>James McAvoy's latest role as a drug-fuelled corrupt Scottish police officer in Filth will not be for everyone - but the actor tells the BBC that's exactly why he signed up."It's full on and definitely not for the fainthearted, and there's not a lot of that in the film industry," he explains."The character represented an opportunity to take an audience and really toy with them."Filth sees McAvoy as detective sergeant Bruce Robertson, a man whose average day involves casual drug-taking, obscene phone calls, blackmailing young women into sex or sleeping with his friends' wives."You're making somebody laugh, and they know they shouldn't be. And then you're kind of wagging your finger going, 'Shame on you for laughing!'" he continues."Then, when they're feeling bad about themselves, you try and make the audience feel some sympathy. And they're like, 'Oh, there's depth to him! Of course, of course!'"And then you just go, 'No, there's not any depth to me! And you should feel bad about yourself for liking me again'."That just seemed really good fun. To be able to toy with whether they were enjoying it or were repulsed by it or not," he says.Based on the 1998 novel by Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh, some cinema-goers will find plenty to be repulsed by in McAvoy's immoral copper, whose antics become more and more outrageous as he loses touch with reality.Jamie Bell and Imogen Poots play colleagues competing for a promotion, while Jim Broadbent is his psychiatrist and Eddie Marsan a tormented friend.Originally branded "un-filmable", it was relative newcomer Jon S Baird's screenplay that finally convinced Welsh that Filth could be brought to the big screen. But neither was convinced McAvoy was suitable the role."He looked very young this particular day," remembers director Baird, sitting in the very seat at London's Soho Hotel where McAvoy first changed his and Welsh's minds."But 20 minutes after talking to him, he had morphed into this middle-aged, grizzled, alcoholic divorcee. It was pretty mad."He started talking about his experience with mental illness, and that's the thing that bonded us. He had experience of that with somebody he grew up with."As soon as I knew he understood that, it was game over. It was like, 'He is the guy'. We offered him the part the same day."For The Last King of Scotland and Atonement star, it was "a cathartic experience" to portray Bruce as he slowly unravelled.But the star, who recently took a beating in Danny Boyle's psychological thriller Trance, found himself being roughed up again for Filth - except this time he was in drag."I hated being in that outfit," grimaces McAvoy."There's something about being covered in blood and cold and you're having to act all mashed up - it makes me feel abused and not nice."Then he laughs: "And yeah, you look at yourself with a wig on and a beard and blood all over your face and just go, 'How am I ever going to get my wife to fancy me again?'"The pain was worth it - if you believe the cinema-going public in Scotland, where the film was released a week ahead of the rest of the UK and took £250,000 at just 38 screens."Trying to get this thing made over the years, I'm so relieved now that it didn't get made earlier, because it would never have been as good," confesses Welsh, who calls McAvoy's performance "off the scale"."I'm still astonished by it, to be honest. Thinking about all the great iconic solo performances that I've seen in my lifetime, I just can't think of anyone that betters it."He's got to convey loss and pathos, aggression and violence, hatred and manipulation. It's like watching a great Shakespearean."As one of the film's many producers (who also include Trudie Styler), McAvoy got to see that fearless performance of his up close in the edit suite - and even sent some scenes to the cutting-room floor."I'd be saying to Jon, 'Get rid of that bit. I know you love it, I know you think that's great but it's slowing everything down,'" he says."And you're like, 'I've just told him to cut a bit of my performance!' I never thought I'd see the day that happens, you know?"Filth also provided McAvoy with another first - acting alongside his sister, Joy."It was amazing, she's an amazing actress. She's got her own approach and her own on-screen and on-stage charisma, which I'm in thrall of at times," he says."Once the camera started rolling she was there, she was in it; and I was there and I was in it; and we just kind of went for it. That's the McAvoy way, maybe!"Next May, audiences will see McAvoy return to the land of big budget blockbusters in his second X-Men film, Days of Future Past, which he finished shooting around a month ago.He plays a younger Charles Xavier alongside the likes of Hugh Jackman and Michael Fassbender, and has a scene with the "original" Charles, Patrick Stewart."It was good, it was really good," says McAvoy. "We got to almost physically, but still metaphorically a little bit, pass the baton."The star has already moved on to his next film - a new take on Mary Shelley's classic novel Frankenstein, in which he plays Victor Von Frankenstein to Daniel Radcliffe's Igor."Me and him met last week," reveals McAvoy. "We had our first rehearsal, it was awesome.""The monster isn't so much trying to come to terms with his existence as he is in the Kenneth Branagh one," he explains."It's an adventure, and the backbone of the adventure is the relationship between me and Daniel. It's more about those two - brothers in science and brothers in adventure."He pauses, and laughs: "It sounds like I'm pitching 'Weird Science: The Movie' here!"</body>

      <description>Paul McCartney on how happiness inspired new album</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24388317</url>
      <date>1380881740</date>
      <body>As Sir Paul McCartney prepares to release his first solo album in six years he tells of how his happiness with his wife Nancy Shevell has inspired his writing, how he struggles not to repeat the past and how his wedding DJ ended up as a producer on the album New.Is New a joyful album?This is a happy period in my life, having a new woman - so you get new songs when you get a new woman. But in actual fact there is a lot of sadness mixed in on the record - the more you listen to it you'll find pain getting changed to laughter - there is quite an undercurrent of that. But generally I'm having a good time so I hope that's made it onto the record.Why did you chose the four producers for this album?Mark Ronson DJ'd at our wedding. He's a really good DJ and we like to dance and a lot of our friends do - so we had a little dance floor and there was kind of disco situation at the reception. He was DJing and putting on great music and it just kept us all going and I knew I liked him. I'd also met him on and off because he's friends with Sean Lennon.I've known Giles Martin (son of Beatles producer George Martin) since he was a little kid. Ethan Johns (Ryan Adams and Kings of Leon) was the son of Glyn Johns one of my Beatles and Wing's producers. Paul Epworth (Adele, Florence and the Machine) I didn't really know but I knew his work.But I was mainly really looking at their work and if you look at any of those producers they've all done great work recently. It's not just something they did in the past and that's what I was looking for. I just really enjoyed working with each one of them, but in a different way every time.Could they say no to you?I always make it one of the first things we talk about when we're sitting down and just settling in and I say OK lets get this straight everyone in this room has got an opinion and don't be frightened to tell me, particularly the producer because that's his job.I say 'tell me if you don't like it or I'm doing it lousy' and I will refer to them and say 'was that any good?' So they do have a voice and I encourage the voice. I say 'please don't be frightened just because I've done that or I've done that, don't worry about it let's just start fresh and you tell me'.But can they challenge you as much as John Lennon did?No. We were just kids that had grown up together, so any of the guys in the Beatles just could tell each other 'I don't like that' and then it meant it had to go.Do you wish you could release this album without people knowing your past work?In an impossible world it would be nice if no-one knew what I had done - and there are a lot of young people who don't know what I've done. But mainly people are looking at what I'm doing now as a continuation of all the other stuff.But I don't really worry about it. The main thing I try and do is not copy what I've done in the past. I've found myself once or twice, picking up a guitar and thinking I'm going to write a new Eleanor Rigby - I have to stop myself trying to do that.There is the past but I don't see it as a burden, I see it as something I'm very lucky to have. But when you do a show - you can't just do new songs, if I don't do Hey Jude I've missed an opportunity. In Las Vegas (performing at the iHeartRadio music festival) we were mainly doing our new songs and it was going down well, but man when we got to Live and Let Die the audience responded - we basically blew them up and they loved that.Are you trying to make a statement with the track Early Days?When I write songs I don't always think I'm going to make a statement. On the day (I wrote the track Early Days) I was thinking about the past, particularly me and John in Liverpool in the early days so I just ran with that. I started to get images of us in the record shop listening to early rock and roll and looking at the posters and the joy that that gave me remembering all those moments.So that song just evolved around that and then I found that one of the things that came was - you can't take it away from me, even though you can say 'hey this is what happened in Liverpool in the late 1950s but I'm going to say 'were you there or did you just read about it?' Because I was there and I was walking down that street - so it's that kind of song. It gets a bit of a dig at people who say they know what it was all about but they weren't there - but mainly it's just fond memories for me.Are you going to open the World Cup in Brazil, as has been rumoured?That's just a rumour - there's no truth to it. I know somebody asked me to be involved in the (Rio) Olympics. Every time these great occasions come up it's great that they think about me, I love it and I'm very flattered, but you can't just be the guy on all of them. It's going to get boring for the audience 'oh no not him again here we go again na na na na, nananana'.Are you cool?I never feel cool. I'm just me. I recently went to Las Vegas to do iHeartRadio (music festival) and there's a lot of cool people on that and so because they're in Las Vegas they all walk around with their entourage and their security and everyone's very serious about how cool they are.And course there's me and I'm going 'Hi Miley' and I think 'oh god what am I doing I sound like a fan, I should try to be cool'. But they didn't even notice me. Actually, the security noticed me and they doubled back and she came and said hello.New is released on 14 October (15 in US)</body>

      <title>The bumpy road to the National Theatre</title>
      <description>Did its early difficulties aid the National Theatre's vibrancy?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24382746</url>
      <date>1380846771</date>
      <body>The National Theatre may be approaching its 50th anniversary on 22 October, but did the delays and obstacles it encountered during its creation result in a more versatile and creative establishment than elsewhere in Europe?Disdain and hostility are not uncommon responses to major new cultural projects in the UK, but the venomous attacks levelled, over two centuries, against the idea of a national theatre leave a sour taste in the mouth even today.Seymour Hicks, an early 20th Century dramatist and star of musical comedies, was against it being created and said: "The National Theatre! I wonder if there are really half a dozen people insane enough to think it will ever come into existence. We have national taxes, national schools, national horrors of every kind - spare us a national theatre!"France has had a national theatre since 1680, Denmark since 1748 and Greece since 1901. The National Theatre in London is a youngster by comparison, which seems surprising, perhaps, for the country of Shakespeare. But this is a complex and singularly British story in which the arts, history, politics and changing ideas about national identity share the stage.The story begins in 1848, when the radical publisher Effingham Wilson published a pamphlet called A House for Shakespeare.His passionate plea for a national theatre seized the imagination and support of figures such as Charles Dickens and Matthew Arnold, but there was fierce opposition from powerful West End actor-managers who liked the non-subsidised status quo.National Theatre associate director Michael Blakemore said the real reason there was not a national theatre earlier was because the language was English."Now, if you run a theatre in say Denmark, then the performances and the productions' lives end at the border, since very few people in Europe speak your language, so the only way you can support a national theatre is with public money," he said."But in England, what happened was that a great actor like Henry Irving and all the great 19th Century actors had another market for their work and that market was the US and Australasia. They all went on tour and made a fortune so they didn't need to be supported by public money."Meanwhile, in the countries where there was a theatre subsidised by the state or court - such as the Comedie Francaise in France - the same classic plays tended to be performed again and again in the same old way.So, perhaps it helped that the London National was not established earlier by the state?Nicholas Hytner, the outgoing artistic director of the National, is proud of the range of its productions and wholeheartedly agrees."It was a very good thing that it was never set up by the court or by competing principalities looking to express their prestige through their theatres and opera houses and orchestras and dance companies. It's a good thing that it always bubbled up organically from underneath," he said.This bubbling up still took a surprisingly long time - with two World Wars intervening.Playwright Michael Frayn says the optimism of the period immediately after World War Two when other national institutions were established may have been key in getting the National Theatre off the ground."The war fostered the idea that you could actually collaborate as a nation, you could get together to think about how to live your life," he said."And this made possible after the war a lot of things like the National Health Service and the so-called welfare state which would have been impossible in the context of the 1930s, and maybe the National Theatre rode on the back of that."James Naughtie, the presenter of BBC radio programme Road to the National Theatre, believes in the powerful symbolic value of a third event."Post-war Britain was austere but exciting. From the rubble and the broken homes something better had to emerge. The National Theatre would become part of that process," he said,"The Festival of Britain, the centrepiece of post-war culture, was erected in 1951, on the anniversary of the Great Exhibition, intended as a symbol of recovery and a confident trumpet call."At long last, during that year, a foundation stone was laid. It still took until 1963 for the establishment of the National Theatre, and the Denys Lasdun building on the South Bank did not open its doors to audiences until 1976.What would Seymour Hicks - with his notion that less than half a dozen people believed in the idea of National Theatre - make of its success today?Last year, one and a half million people attended National Theatre shows, either on the South Bank or at West End transfers such as War Horse, One Man, Two Guvnors or The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.And that is not to mention the latest venture - National Theatre Live - which last year beamed performances of productions such as Frankenstein and Hamlet to more than three million people in cinemas across the globe.The road may have been long, hard and boulder-strewn but, at a youthful 50, the National Theatre is more vibrant than ever.Listen to the Road to the National Theatre on BBC Radio 4 on 6 and 13 October at 13:30 BST, or hear it on iPlayer.</body>

      <title>Obituary: Tom Clancy</title>
      <description>Author Tom Clancy remembered</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24362892</url>
      <date>1380734127</date>
      <body>Tom Clancy, who has died aged 66, was one of the world's best-selling - and wealthiest - thriller writers.His books - which included The Hunt for Red October and Patriot Games - inspired both blockbuster films and best-selling video games.The American author's other bestsellers included Red Storm Rising, Clear and Present Danger, The Sum of All Fears and Without Remorse.Clancy once said his dream had been to publish a book so he could be "immortal" in the Library of Congress catalogue.Born in Baltimore on 12 April 1947, Clancy studied physics at college but switched to English, saying later that he wasn't clever enough for the challenges of science.His novels, however, were rich with authoritative scientific and technical detail, something Clancy put down to his enthusiasm for reading military journals.Clancy joined the US Army Reserve at university, but poor eyesight thwarted his ambition to serve in the Vietnam war. After graduation in 1969, he married and joined his wife's family's insurance business.Writing in his spare time as an insurance salesman, Clancy had an immediate success in 1984 with his first novel The Hunt for Red October. He sold the manuscript to the Naval Institute Press, which had never ventured into original fiction.President Ronald Reagan, who received the book as a Christmas present, said it was his favourite thriller, an endorsement that Clancy said helped put him on the New York Times best-seller list.Red October told the Cold War story of a Soviet navy captain who decides to defect to the United States with his nuclear submarine.It was made into an Oscar-winning film in 1990, starring Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan - a recurring hero of Clancy's - and Sir Sean Connery as Soviet submarine captain Marko Ramius.Clancy followed it up with Red Storm Rising and Patriot Games, which told of a fictional IRA splinter group that plots to kidnap the Prince and Princess of Wales.The latter title became the second Jack Ryan novel to be filmed, this time with Harrison Ford as the CIA analyst who, in Clancy's later works, was eventually elevated to President of the United States.Clancy's thrillers - he usually turned out one a year - made him one of the wealthiest writers in the world, with annual earnings of about $30m (£19m) in the mid-1990s.In a 2007 interview with US TV network AMC, Clancy attributed his success to dogged persistence and deep research."You learn to write the same way you learn to play golf," he said. "You do it, and keep doing it until you get it right."A lot of people think something mystical happens to you, that maybe the muse kisses you on the ear. But writing isn't divinely inspired - it's hard work.""I don't write about super-heroes," he told Verbosity magazine. "I want my protagonists to be recognisably human, with real human concerns."Some of my characters are based on real people. One's even based on me."Clancy also ventured into the world of video gaming, spawning best-selling titles that included the Ghost Recon and Splinter Cell series."What happened to me was pure dumb luck," Clancy told AMC TV. "I'm not the new [Ernest] Hemingway."Of course, fortune does favour the brave. In battle, you forgive a man anything except an unwillingness to take risks. Sometimes you have to put it on the line."What I did was take time away from how I earned my living. My wife gave me hell - 'Why are you doing this?' - but she doesn't complain anymore."I wanted to see my name on the cover of a book. If your name is in the Library of Congress, you're immortal."Despite several of his books making it to the big screen, Clancy admitted to having a sometimes rocky relationship with Hollywood."Books and movies are different art forms with different rules. And because of that, they never translate exactly," he said in an interview on CNN."Their view of my books frequently takes different paths from the way I think about it. But that's to be expected."They pay me money and buy the book. When they buy the book, they buy rights to play with the plot."The only person who has artistic control is the director, and 'director' is how you spell God in Hollywood."</body>

      <body>The city of Sao Paulo would provide a rich setting for a book, offering infinite possibilities to an author, writer Ian McEwan has told the BBC World Service.McEwan was giving a rare interview ahead of a festival of Brazilian literature, FlipSide, in Suffolk this weekend.It has been co-founded by former director of Bloomsbury publishing Liz Calder, as a British counterpart to the original Flip festival, which takes place in the pretty coastal town of Paraty.In the past it has attracted the likes of Martin Amis, Margaret Atwood, Salman Rushdie, Hanif Kureishi and Will Self - as well as McEwan himself - to Brazil.The author of Atonement and Enduring Love began his interview by singing the praises of a young Brazilian writer Tatiana Salem Levy.Her story, Lost Time, is included in an anthology of Brazilian writers which will be launched during the Suffolk event.What appealed to you about Tatiana Levy's story, Lost Time?I thought it was a wonderful story that wears its symbolism very lightly.It's about a woman who is invited to a funeral: She is 60 years old, the funeral is without a body. It is [the funeral] of her lover who died 40 years ago. They were both fighters in the resistance.He's died, disappeared, there are no documents about him, so the family and friends have gathered to bury him in a coffin that is empty.She returns to the coffin a little amulet that he gave her on the night that he disappeared. And yet she drives away smiling, full of a sense that she is in charge of time.I was very touched by that, I thought in the space of six, seven pages, this writer, a young writer, catches something quite profound about a country that has come out of a dictatorship, a totalitarian, military state and is now on the edge of being a world power.You've been friends with Liz Calder for many years. Can you remember the first time she spoke about Brazil?It was about 12 years ago. I was very surprised when she told me she had bought a place just outside Paraty. Then, the next thing, I find myself with my wife and our younger son Greg in Paraty. Then the fun started.Greg said at breakfast, after the first night: "I have found my second country. This has been the best 12 hours of my life!" He later went back to Brazil and became fluent in Brazilian Portuguese.We had an amazing week at this festival. It had only been going one year but it was already apparent that the festival was going to turn around the fortunes of this rather sleepy, colonial, extremely pretty, coastal town.How much impact does Brazilian culture have in the UK?It is difficult to quantify but things are about to change, with the World Cup and the Olympics. There will be a fantastic focus on all things Brazilian.We have watched the protests in Brazil with interest. And there is a huge Brazilian community in London.But there is an age-old problem - translation. We don't even read much French modern literature and they [the French] are only a few miles away.We have both the fortune and misfortune to speak a world language and with that comes a kind of blindness. If you are at the centre of an empire, you become incurious. But I think it will change.You are a fan of the work of American poet Elizabeth Bishop. Have you read the poems she wrote about Brazil? Have any of them stayed with you?We had a private tour of her house in Ouro Preto. There's a poem that she wrote as if she is catching snatches of conversations from her window (Under the Window: Ouro Preto). A wonderful celebration of a place, it couldn't be anywhere else. Rather like when one reads the poetry of Wordsworth in a particular location.She used to call herself shy. Yet in her letters to friends she said she felt very welcome in Brazil, and surrounded by the warmth of the people. Did you feel the same?I'm cautious about dealing in cliche, but it is the case that any visitor to Brazil almost immediately feels this warmth. It's a very good country to be a traveller in. People are so immediately pleasant, it is quite extraordinary.Would you ever set one of your books in a foreign land?Only if I needed to and in the terms of staying within the circle of my ignorance. In other words, I couldn't pretend to inhabit and understand from the inside a foreign culture.But to send a character through a landscape with the impressions that might be mine or invented, absolutely, one needs that freedom.So, imagine a character travelling through Brazil. What would he see through the window?My first thought is about the city. I think 85% of the Brazilian population lives in cities. I spent a few days in Sao Paulo and felt almost as if I was on another planet. Almost twenty million people, maybe only Mexico City is bigger. You are looking at a human agglomeration on another scale from London or New York. So, to make this thought experiment I would have one of my characters get lost in Sao Paulo. Get lost and either get frightened or full of wonder, or possibly both.There are two lines of thought about these colossal cities. One line is that they contain a vast human and social tragedy of slums and so on. The other view, more optimistic, is cities are the great engines of vitality and innovation. That there is more organisation in a slum than social anthropologists ever dream.That paradox is one that a foreigner would be interested in. Some time in the late 80s, on planet Earth, suddenly more people lived in the cities than in the countryside. It was a huge turning point and we are still living through a big revolution in human consciousness: the vast flight from the countryside to the city.This has certain positive aspects. Women tend to have fewer children when they move to the cities, so they can flourish more, and children tend to get better education in the cities, even in poorer circumstances, than in the countryside. Also, this leaves open a lot of land, for agriculture and wilderness. Yet, at the same time, there are gangs, violence, drugs, deprivation, homelessness and so on.We still face a population explosion but sometime in the 21st century the population will age and shrink. That, too, may be a fantastic opportunity. It's an open question.That book of yours sounds very interesting. So, to finalise, there will be music at the festival. Have you heard any Brazilian music?I bid at a charity auction for a wonderful classical guitarist, Craig Ogden, to play at my house. We had friends come around and after he played, he gave his guitar to our friend, who sang these beautiful Brazilian love songs. Everyone was a bit tearful around the table. Well, they were softened up by some very good red wine!I thought: "Yes, it's time to get back to Brazil."The Flipside Festival begins on Friday 4 October.Radio 4's short story series Brazilian Bonanza also kicks off on Friday with Lost Time by Tatiana Salem Levy at 1545.</body>

      <body>He has made a career as the loud, garish and eccentric face of Channel 4's racing coverage, and is as recognisable for his signature deerstalker hat as his reality TV appearances.John McCririck, 73, once described by television critic Nina Myskow as having "all the charm of an armpit", was a waiter, bookmaker and British Press Award-winning journalist before going on to become a racing pundit for ITV.In 1984, Channel 4 took over TV racing coverage and he went on to become the flamboyant figurehead of Channel 4 Racing for 29 years and 5,000 broadcasts.The fast-talking, wildly gesticulating tipster was raised in Jersey by wealthy parents and educated at Harrow.Known for his energetic dispatches from the racecourse - clad in tweed and gold jewellery, clutching giant Havana cigars - to his followers he is "Big Mac" and the punter's friend.However, he told The Guardian in 2001 that he was only on television because he "failed at everything else" - including being sacked by the Dorchester Hotel for spilling soup over a customer, and being dismissed by Sporting Life in 1984.He was, he declared, "a failed punter, a failed bookmaker, a failed journalist". But he also insisted that his on-screen character was "the real me"."You are as you are on the telly," he said. "I think it's the real me. Anyone who tries to put on an act on telly over the years wouldn't get away with it."At his tribunal, though, he also said he played a "pantomime villain" during appearances on reality TV programmes Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity Wife Swap."This is a different persona," he said of his bombastic and "domineering" image. "You are putting on a performance, you are doing a pantomime act."Celebrity Wife Swap revealed his recumbent lifestyle at home in London with his wife Jenny - referred to by McCririck as "the booby".He told the Guardian in 2004 that this was in reference to a South American bird that is "stupid and pathetically easy to catch and squawks a lot".He appeared with Jenny on Celebrity Coach Trip in 2011, becoming the only couple to be voted out unanimously, twice.Before that he lasted just 12 days in the Celebrity Big Brother house in 2005, before being evicted amid accusations of sexism and misogyny.Yet McCririck has denied allegations he is "anti-women", saying he was never asked to tone down his language on air.''It's a very public school thing, it's a bit immature but it lightens up the programme," he said at the end of the first tribunal hearing.Five Live presenter and former Channel 4 racing commentator Derek "Tommo" Thompson worked with McCririck - also known as "Big Mac" - for 30 years before also being dropped from Channel 4 in October."John is without doubt the most professional man I've ever worked with," he said. "He does his homework. He has two race cards in case he loses one, and two watches in case one stops. He is meticulous."Thompson described McCririck as "on the ball" and maintained that his views were "provocative but not far-fetched"."He's razor sharp," he said. "He talks a lot of sense. His ideas have helped punters across the world."Fellow former racing presenter Lesley Graham - who told the tribunal on Tuesday that she believed a reduction in her working hours was because of her age - also pointed to a difference between McCririck's on- and off-screen personas."He's not like he appears," she said. "He's no shrinking violet, but off-camera he is quite quiet and private."However, she added: "I wouldn't go as far as to say it's all an act. There's a reasonable male chauvinist in there! But Mac is just more open about expressing that than other people."When I first joined Channel 4 there were not many other women on TV, and John was the one person to call me and wish me luck."He is very much like Marmite - but whether you love him or hate him, he did give our sport a wider profile. TV is entertainment and what Mac brought to our sports programme was colour and controversy."McCririck was replaced in October by a new presenting team headed by Clare Balding.Yet he has historically described himself as "the face of racing alongside Frankie Dettori"."I acknowledge I antagonise people, as twice in the Celebrity Big Brother House proved," he told the Daily Telegraph last October."Yet as Clare Balding, a terrific choice to head the new young team, said recently, I've become the face of racing alongside Frankie Dettori and now, of course, Clare herself."</body>

      <title>Union anger at health pay proposal</title>
      <description>Unions criticise government moves to halt a 1% pay rise for all NHS staff in England, arguing they deserve to be rewarded for holding the health service together.</description>

      <date>1380991958</date>
      <body>Unions have criticised government moves to halt a 1% pay rise for all NHS staff in England.The Department of Health said the increase was unaffordable alongside the current system which sees many staff automatically receive incremental annual rises.It has urged the NHS pay review body to withhold the rise for 1.3m staff.Rachael Maskell, of the Unite trade union, said staff deserved the pay reward for "holding the NHS together".Health trusts are currently under pressure to make savings and the NHS wage bill accounts for around 40% of its budget.All public sector pay increases are capped at 1%.The Department of Health (DoH) proposes using the funding intended for the rise to "modernise" pay structures.It says automatic increments - linked to length of service and satisfactory performance - add £900m to salary costs.The DoH has stressed no decisions on changes to pay have been taken, insisting independent bodies will make their recommendations in February or March next year.But the plans, outlined in the DoH's submission to two independent pay review bodies, have been criticised by Unite and Labour.Ms Maskell, of Unite, said: "The Department of Health have got other choices. They're entering into a reorganisation which is costing £3bn, which nobody asked for and isn't adding anything to patient care."It is about choices and the NHS staff have already had two years of a pay freeze - 1% last year - and, quite frankly, are really falling behind inflation now with their wages."Staff moraleShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme motivation and morale was down among frontline health workers "at this very difficult time".However, in its submission the DoH points to a staff survey suggesting high levels of motivation and morale and says there should only be basic pay increases if there is "strong evidence" recruitment, retention, morale or motivation issues require this.Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the NHS reorganisation had taken money out of front-line services."There has to be pay restraint in the NHS as well as other public services... but the NHS has been through some very difficult years - so have NHS staff - and this was a modest increase to recognise the pressure that all families are under."To take it away, to break that promise, is just another kick in the teeth."Staff representatives have also reacted angrily to the plans."What they have done is inflammatory," said Christina McAnea, head of health at Unison and joint chairwoman of the NHS Staff Council."We are not going to negotiate while a gun is held to our head for a paltry 1% pay rise - our members will not react well to that."Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association council said this would not result in staff leaving in their "droves".However he added: "We're going to find it increasingly hard to recruit, partly for the specialist skills and partly for the numbers of staff that we'd need to bring into the health service to implement the safe minimum staffing levels."Health minister Anna Soubry defended the government 's stance telling the BBC: "This is about making sure we pay our NHS staff well and we reward their improvement in skills."This system works in other public sectors and the private sector. People want to make sure that they are getting good quality, first class services especially at a time when the NHS faces challenges."Earlier a DoH spokeswoman said: "Many NHS staff have continued to receive pay rises of up to 3.5% and we want to keep working with the trade unions and employers on affordable pay."The measures we are proposing will help increase quality for patients and help us realise our vision of an affordable seven-day service."In June Chancellor George Osborne said ministers were working to "remove automatic pay rises" for teachers, health professionals, prison and police staff.The DoH drew attention to Mr Osborne's comments and confirmed it wanted NHS pay to have "stronger links to performance, quality and productivity".</body>

      <title>Call for early bone cancer diagnosis</title>
      <description>A charity is urging GPs to do more to diagnose bone cancers early in order to help to improve the survival rate.</description>

      <body>A charity is urging GPs to do more to diagnose bone cancers early in order to help to improve the survival rateThe Bone Cancer Research Trust says the survival rate of 54% has barely changed in the last 25 years.It says early diagnosis is key to spotting the condition, which mainly affects young people.Symptoms include painful bones or swollen joints, which can be misdiagnosed as sporting injuries or "growing pains".Primary bone cancer is cancer which starts in the bones rather than spreads there.The two most common types are osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma.The condition is rare - there were just 531 new cases in the UK in 2010.But it is an aggressive cancer, and those who survive are often left with significant disabilities.The trust has teamed up with the Royal College of GPs to launch a specialist e-learning module to help doctors spot the symptoms and diagnose patients earlier.Prof Andy Hall, chairman of BCRT's independent scientific advisory panel, said: "Primary bone cancer is, thankfully, very rare but it is vital that it is diagnosed early to give patients the best chance of survival."He added: "The average length of time it takes for a patient to receive a correct diagnosis is 16 weeks from the time when the patient first noticed their symptoms."A simple X-ray, performed early, can make all the difference."Callum Flynn, 18, from Leigh in Greater Manchester, experienced knee pain for 18 months before being diagnosed with osteosarcoma - on his 14th birthday."I would wake up with my knee locked. I couldn't stand up. That would last for about two weeks at a time - and it happened five or six times over an 18-month period."We kept going to the walk-in centre, because it seemed to be something that just happened overnight, and they thought it was a virus each time."But eventually I went to my GP who felt behind my knee and obviously felt the tumour, though I wasn't told then. I had an X-ray and a biopsy in the space of a week and a half."His diagnosis came as a shock. "I'd never heard of it. I didn't think you could get cancer when you were young."Callum had to have chemotherapy and a full knee replacement at the time, and has recently had to have a further operation on his knee.He cannot play all the sports he used to, although he is part of the England physical disabilities cricket squad, and toured with them in Dubai last year.Callum also works to raise awareness of bone cancer and funds for research.He says his experience of going undiagnosed for 18 months means he feels it is vital to raise awareness about early diagnosis.And in the end, he says, it is simple to check: "It just took one X-ray."</body>

      <title>New measles case prompts concerns</title>
      <description>Pupils are being offered MMR jabs at a Neath Port Talbo school after a case of measles was confirmed three months after outbreak in area ended.</description>

      <date>1380914917</date>
      <body>More than 200 children are being offered MMR vaccinations at a Neath Port Talbot high school after a fresh case of measles there.Public Health Wales (PHW) said it has received two notifications of measles in pupils at Cwmtawe School with one case laboratory confirmed.It comes three months after Wales' biggest measles outbreak ended.The first cases in Swansea were reported last November before spreading to mid Wales.More than 75,000 were vaccinated during the outbreak throughout Wales.But experts say more than 30,000 children in the 10 to 18 age group still remain unvaccinated.Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board is arranging for MMR vaccinations to be offered next week to all pupils at the school who are not fully vaccinated.Of 1,260 pupils, 62 are recorded as having received no doses of the MMR vaccine and 142 have received only one dose.Two doses are needed to provide the maximum 99% protection against measles, say experts.PHW communicable disease control consultant Dr Jorg Hoffmann said: "This case of measles comes only three months after the end of Wales' biggest ever measles outbreak... so we are obviously concerned and want to act quickly."Although we vaccinated more than 75,000 people during the outbreak, we are aware of more than 30,000 children in the 10 to 18 age group who remain unvaccinated in Wales and have always warned that this could lead to another outbreak."We have written today to all parents of unvaccinated children in Cwmtawe School to urge them to arrange for their children to be vaccinated."In the meantime, to prevent the spread of infection, we would urge parents of any children who become unwell with measles-like symptoms over the weekend to keep them at home and seek medical advice, and not to allow them to attend events where other children will be present."The symptoms of measles include a fever, fatigue, runny nose, conjunctivitis and a distinctive red rash.By the time the outbreak was declared over after six months, it had resulted in 1,219 notifications of measles cases in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, Hywel Dda and Powys health board areas.Some 88 people visited a hospital due to measles during the outbreak.Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, from Swansea, died from pneumonia after contracting measles at the height of the epidemic.</body>

      <title>Walking 'cuts breast cancer risk'</title>

      <body>Post-menopausal women who walk for an hour a day can cut their chance of breast cancer significantly, a study has suggested.The report, which followed 73,000 women for 17 years, found walking for at least seven hours a week lowered the risk of the disease.The American Cancer Society team said this was the first time reduced risk was specifically linked to walking.UK experts said it was more evidence that lifestyle influenced cancer risk.A recent poll for the charity Ramblers found a quarter of adults walk for no more than an hour a week - but being active is known to reduce the risk of a number of cancers.This study, published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention followed 73,615 women out of 97,785 aged 50-74 who had been recruited by the American Cancer Society between 1992 and 1993 so it could monitor the incidence of cancer in the group.They were asked to complete questionnaires on their health and on how much time they were active and participating in activities such as walking, swimming and aerobics and how much time they spent sitting watching television or reading.They completed the same questionnaires at two-year intervals between 1997 and 2009.Of the women, 47% said walking was their only recreational activity.Those who walked for at least seven hours per week had a 14% lower risk of breast cancer compared to those who walked three or fewer hours per week.Dr Alpa Patel, a senior epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society in Atlanta Georgia, who led the study, said: "Given that more than 60% of women report some daily walking, promoting walking as a healthy leisure-time activity could be an effective strategy for increasing physical activity amongst post-menopausal women."We were pleased to find that without any other recreational activity, just walking one hour a day was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer in these women."More strenuous and longer activities lowered the risk even more."Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breast Cancer Campaign, said: "This study adds further evidence that our lifestyle choices can play a part in influencing the risk of breast cancer and even small changes incorporated into our normal day-to-day activity can make a difference.She added: "We know that the best weapon to overcoming breast cancer is the ability to stop it occurring in the first place."The challenge now is how we turn these findings into action and identify other sustainable lifestyle changes that will help us prevent breast cancer."</body>

      <title>'Digital baby' screen for sperm donors</title>
      <description>A service that digitally weaves together the DNA of prospective parents to check for potential disease in thousands of "virtual babies" is set to launch in the US by December.</description>

      <body>A service that digitally weaves together the DNA of prospective parents to check for potential disease in thousands of "virtual babies" is set to launch in the US by December.New York start-up Genepeeks will initially focus on donor sperm, simulating before pregnancy how the genetic sequence of a female client might combine with those of different males.Donors that more often produce "digital children" with a higher risk of inherited disorders will be filtered out, leaving those who are better genetic matches.Everything happens in a computer, but experts have raised ethical questions."We are just in the business right now of giving prospective mothers, who are using donor sperm to conceive, a filtered catalogue of donors based on their own underlying genetic profile," Genepeeks co-founder Anne Morriss told BBC News."We are filtering out the donor matches with an elevated risk of rare recessive paediatric conditions."Ms Morriss, an entrepreneur, gave a presentation on the company at the Consumer Genetics Conference in Boston last week.She was motivated in part by her own experience of starting a family. Her son was conceived with a sperm donor who happened to share with Morriss the gene for an inherited disorder called MCADD.MCADD (medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency) prevents those affected from converting fats to sugar. It can be fatal if it is not diagnosed early. Luckily, in Ms Morriss's case, the condition was picked up in newborn screening tests."My son has a pretty normal life," Ms Morriss said, "but about 30% of children with rare genetic diseases don't make it past the age of five."Genepeeks has formalised a partnership with a sperm bank - the Manhattan Cryobank - and has a patent pending on the DNA screening technology.The start-up benefits from the rapid pace of change in genetic technology.Indeed, six months ago, Genepeeks' founders decided it was able to use a superior system for DNA analysis (called "targeted exon sequencing") than the one originally envisaged - a result, says Anne Morriss, of falling costs and increased flexibility.For couples planning babies, other companies already screen one or both partners for genes that could cause disease if combined with a similar variant - so-called "carrier screening".One academic who studies the use of genetic technology commented: "This is like that, but ramped up 100,000 times."Ms Morriss's business partner, Prof Lee Silver, a geneticist and expert on bioethics at Princeton University, New Jersey, told BBC News: "We get the DNA sequence from two prospective parents. We simulate the process of reproduction, forming virtual sperm and virtual eggs. We put them together to form a hypothetical child genome."Then we can look at that hypothetical genome and - with all the tools of modern genetics - determine the risk that the genome will result in a child with disease. We're looking directly for disease and not carrier status. For each pair of people that we're going to analyse, we make 10,000 hypothetical children."The process will be run for the client and each potential donor one by one, scanning for some 600 known single-gene recessive conditions. In this way, the highest-risk pairings can be filtered out.Anne Morriss added: "At this stage our clients won't be receiving any genetic information back. We're very much focused on the practical utility of helping prospective parents who want to protect their future kids, giving them the option of additional analysis to what is currently being offered in the industry."But the company's founders have plans to expand the screening beyond single-gene recessive disorders to more complex conditions in which multiple genes play a part.Indeed, going to the trouble of simulating thousands of digital children deliberately lays the ground for this: "[It's] impossible to get towards an accurate risk calculation in any other way," said Anne Morriss.And in a video produced by the company, Prof Silver says: "My hope for the future is that any people who want to have a baby can use this technology to greatly reduce the risk of disease being expressed in their child."To some, such a prospect might appear like a step towards designer babies - until now the preserve of science fiction literature and films such as Gattaca, which envisaged a future of genetic "haves" and "have-nots".Bio-ethicists approached by the BBC said Genepeeks was a logical outcome of the increasing demand for more information when making reproductive decisions.However, some raised potential concerns about risk communication and the expansion of screening beyond rare single-gene disorders. But they suggested there were few, if any, regulatory barriers.One ethicist told BBC News: "The biggest question for me, just from the outset, is the understanding of uncertainty. Even people who have been doing genomics for years still have a hard time figuring out exactly what a risk for a particular genetic predisposition really means for a family."Gene-environment interactions can lead to people either having disease or not having disease."Dr Ewan Birney, associate director of the European Bioinformatics Institute in Hinxton, UK, echoed the point: "It's good that they're focusing on the carrier status of these rare Mendelian disorders where it's potentially more clear-cut. That said, these things are more complex than they first seem," he said."I'm sure the scientists appreciate that complexity. But when transmitting that complexity to everyday people, these things can sound more absolute than they really are."He added: "The thing I would want to stress here is just how complex this is. It's great that people are thinking of using this technology in lots of different ways, but our knowledge gap is very large."Risk communication to clients was, said Anne Morriss, "absolutely critical to anyone in this industry"."We have to be crystal clear about what we're testing for, what risks we're helping to reduce; that there's no guarantee you won't give birth to a sick child," she said.Prof Mildred Cho, associate director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics in California, raised questions over whether the sperm donor should also receive information about their genome gleaned from the screening process."Unlike hair colour, occupation or family history - those are things, presumably, the donor already knows - the thing that's different about this that I see is it could create information that the donor doesn't already have. It also has implications for the donor's other biological family members," Prof Cho told BBC News.This week it also emerged that California-based consumer genetics company 23andMe had submitted the patent on a DNA analysis tool for planning a child.Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter</body>

      <title>Cosmetic surgery study centre opens</title>
      <description>Cosmetic manufacturers asked to donate one pound from implant sales to research centre</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24403286</url>
      <date>1380902510</date>
      <body>A new centre for cosmetic surgery research, partly funded by the industry, is being set up in the UK.The National Institute for Aesthetic Research is a response to the scandal over PIP breast implants in 2010.But women affected by the faulty devices say it has taken too long to establish the facility.The launch follows a review of plastic surgery by the NHS Medical Director Sir Bruce Keogh, who criticised the absence of data surrounding operations.The centre is being set up by the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) and the charity The Healing Foundation.Kate Ward from Leeds had breast enlargement surgery with PIP implants in 2004.She paid £9,000 to have the implants removed and replaced with new ones.Ms Ward told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours: "The cynic in me just sees this as very reactive. The management of the people still affected by this scandal remains very inconsistent and in some cases non-existent."She believes the three years it has taken to establish the centre suggests the women affected have not been a priority, adding: "It's difficult to not feel as though you are stigmatised as someone who has elected to have this surgery in the first place."But it is good that lessons are being learnt and changes are being made. I hope by setting up this institute it will stop women being placed in the situation thousands are in at the moment."Rajiv Grover, president of the BAAPS, agreed it was embarrassing that this was the world's first institute related to aesthetic research.He said: "We have been campaigning for this institute for 10 years but there is now a willingness to endorse this."Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS medical director, believes it will make a difference.He said: "This joint initiative is the first recommendation of my review to be implemented and I know it will provide a major contribution to patient safety."The institute will be partly funded by manufacturers who are being asked to donate a pound from the sale of every breast implant.So far two have signed up, Nagor (the UK's only manufacturer of implants), and Eurosurgical, distributors for Silimed based in South Africa.BAAPS says this will raise a minimum of £25,00 to £30,000 a year. Women affected by PIP implants say all the manufacturers should sign up to the institute.</body>

      <title>Over-50s men 'not symptom aware'</title>
      <description>Men aged over 50 across the UK are less likely to know the symptoms of serious diseases than women, suggests an online survey by Saga.</description>

      <body>Men aged over 50 are less likely to know the symptoms of serious diseases than women, suggests a survey by Saga, a company focused on that age group.Fifty-five per cent of men said they were aware of the symptoms of bowel cancer, compared with 72% of women.More than 11,000 UK men and women were asked about their knowledge of diseases and what makes them go to their GP.Men whose partners or children put pressure on them to get a check-up were more likely to see a doctor.From a survey of 11,729 men and women aged 50 and over, 41% of men surveyed said they were unaware of the symptoms of prostate cancer.Men were also less likely than women to know the symptoms of lung cancer, skin cancer, arthritis and dementia while 82% of women surveyed said they knew the symptoms of breast cancer.When asked how they knew about the signs of different diseases, government health campaigns were cited as the main way of learning about symptoms, particularly those of cancers.People who were aware of the symptoms of dementia and arthritis, however, were more likely to have learned about the condition through family members who had been affected.The survey found that men were most likely to go and see their GP when they found blood in their urine (82%) or in their stool (78%) and when they felt severe pain (74%). These were all important triggers for women to see their doctor too.But men (59%) were much less likely than women (80%) to go to the GP when they found a new lump in their body.If men over 50 needed encouragement to see a medical professional, they were more likely than women to go for a check-up when faced with pressure from their partner or children.A recent study by Cancer Research UK found that bowel cancer rates among men have increased by more than a quarter in the last 35 years.This contrasts with a rise of just 6% in the rate for women over the same time.At the same time, bowel cancer survival rates are improving with half of all patients living for at least 10 years after being diagnosed.Deborah Alsina, chief executive of charity Bowel Cancer UK said: "It is deeply worrying that men remain less aware of the symptoms of bowel cancer and are less likely to take part in the NHS bowel cancer screening programme than women."Bowel cancer is preventable, treatable and curable and should not be the UK's second biggest cancer killer, yet currently only around 50% of people are living longer than five years."She added that targeted campaigns were the key to raising awareness among men.</body>

      <title>Concerns delay schools' flu vaccine</title>
      <description>A programme to vaccinate children against flu is delayed in Glasgow after concerns from Muslim parents that it contains products derived from pork.</description>

      <body>A programme to vaccinate schoolchildren against flu has been delayed in Glasgow after concerns from Muslim parents that it contains products derived from pork.About 100,000 primary school pupils in Scottish health board areas taking part in a pilot programme are being offered the Fluenz vaccine.It is given as a nasal spray rather than the traditional jab.But parents in Pollokshields, which has a high number of Muslim pupils, have complained the spray contains gelatine.A letter sent to Glasgow schools in the wake of concerns cites a World Health Organisation study in 2001 which indicated that Islamic and Jewish scholars had agreed pork gelatine was permissible within a vaccine.However, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC), whose area contains most of Scotland's Muslims, said it had put back the rollout of the vaccinations "following concerns raised by a small number of parents".The programme is due to resume next week when parents will be offered a choice of the nasal spray or the more traditional jab.Scottish government public health minister Michael Matheson said flu was a "very serious infection" which needed to be vaccinated against.He said: "That is why, for the new programme for children, we are using a quick and painless nasal spray Fluenz, which has proven to be more effective in children and avoids the use of needles."Parents should be reassured that the existing guidance issued in 2001 from the World Health Organisation, prepared by religious scholars, advises that gelatine of porcine origin used in vaccines and other medicines is judicially permissible as the gelatine in the final product is a completely changed substance."Vaccination is voluntary and we want all parents to have the information they need to make an informed choice."If parents continue to have any concerns, children can be given an alternative safe injectable vaccine which does not contain any porcine gelatine but provides less protection than the nasal spray."He added: "The Scottish Government very much appreciates the help and advice provided by Muslim councils in response to these concerns and a letter has been issued to parents of children in Glasgow to offer reassurance about the use of the Fluenz vaccine."A fifth of the Scottish population will be offered a free flu vaccine, including people aged over 65 and those with conditions that put them at greater risk.For the first time, all two and three-year-olds - about 120,000 children - will be offered the vaccine, as well as 100,000 primary school pupils in health board areas which are taking part in a pilot programme.The programme will be rolled out to eventually see about one million children aged between two and 17 have the chance to be immunised towards the end of 2015.</body>

      <title>Deleted genes 'offer autism clues'</title>
      <description>The discovery of "missing" genes could help scientists understand how autism develops, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>The discovery of "missing" genes could help scientists understand how autism develops, a study suggests.US researchers looked at the genetic profiles of more than 431 people with an autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) and 379 without.They found those with an ASD were more likely to have just one copy of certain genes, when they should have had two.UK experts said genetic factors were one promising area of research into the causes of autism.About 1% of the population has an ASD. They can run in families - but scientists have not identified a cause.Gene deletions or additions happen in everyone - it is why people are different.It is which genes are affected that determines what the effect is.There were far more gene deletions in the ASD group, and they were more likely to have multiple deletions.Writing in the American Journal of Human Genetics, the team from Mount Sinai suggests this "mis-wiring" could alter the activity of nerve cells in the brain.Prof Joseph Buxbaum, who led the research team, said: "This is the first finding that small deletions impacting one or two genes appear to be common in autism, and that these deletions contribute to risk of development of this disorder."The researchers found many of the most common deletions in the autistic group were linked to autophagy - kind of waste-disposal and renewal process for cells,Prof Buxbaum said: "There is a good reason to believe that autophagy is really important for brain development because the brain produces many more synapses [connections through which brain cells communicate] than it needs, and the excess needs to be pruned back."He added: "Too many, or too few, synapses have the same effect of not making communication work very well. It could mean that some synaptic connections come in too late and may not solidify properly."Difficulties communicating and interacting with others are common in people with an ASD.The researchers suggest these genetic variations could be targets for genetic testing.Carol Povey, director of the Centre for Autism at the UK's National Autistic Society said: "The causes of autism are still being investigated."Many experts believe that the pattern of behaviour from which autism is diagnosed may not result from a single cause."There is strong evidence to suggest that autism can be caused by a variety of physical factors, all of which affect brain development."Genetic factors may be responsible for some forms of autism, but it is likely to have multiple genes responsible rather than a single gene."This study provides interesting insights into autism and genetic factors."More research needs to be done before any concrete conclusions can be drawn about the causes and what this might mean for future developments, so it will be interesting to see how this research is built on to further enhance our knowledge of the condition."</body>

      <body>A US patent for a database that uses DNA testing to tell prospective parents which traits their future offspring may inherit has been criticised by experts.23andMe says its Family Traits Inheritor Calculator can predict the risk of inheriting specific diseases as well as details such as height, weight, eye colour and even personality.Couples send the firm a saliva sample to see what their babies might be like.But critics have called the project "ethically and socially treacherous".The patent suggests the database could also be used by fertility clinics to find appropriate donors.But the Mountain View, California-based firm was quick to say this was no longer part of its plan."At the time 23andMe filed the patent, there was consideration that the technology could have potential applications for fertility clinics so language specific to the fertility treatment process was included in the patent," it said in a blog post."The company never pursued the concepts discussed in the patent beyond our Family Traits Inheritance Calculator, nor do we have any plans to do so."Instead it described the tool for prospective parents as "an enjoyable way to dip their toes into genetics".But critics remain concerned that such technology could be misused."It would be highly irresponsible for 23andMe or anyone else to offer a product or service based on this patent," said Marcy Darnovsky, executive director of the Center for Genetics and Society."It amounts to shopping for designer donors in an effort to produce designer babies."We believe the patent office made a serious mistake in allowing a patent that includes drop-down menus for which to choose a future child's traits."A project like this would also be ethically and socially treacherous."</body>

      <body>Scotland's largest health board has yet to fully assess the financial cost of a two-day IT systems crash which saw 709 appointments and procedures cancelled.NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (GGC) said it would be premature to speculate what caused the problem while diagnostic checks were continuing.The crash meant that 599 outpatient appointments were postponed along with 62 planned inpatient procedures and day cases and 48 chemotherapy treatments.The system was restored on Thursday.Problems with the health board's computer system were identified on Tuesday following the local September holiday weekend.Despite round-the-clock efforts from NHS GGC's own IT teams, with input from suppliers at Microsoft and Charteris, the issue was not resolved until Thursday.The delay and widespread nature of the problems saw NHS GGC chief executive Robert Calderwood issue an "unreserved apology" to patients who had appointments and treatments at 11 hospitals postponed.In the aftermath of the crash, BBC Scotland asked the health board how much the problem was likely to cost, who would pay and the likelihood of any legal action.In reply, a spokeswoman for NHS GGC said: "Our IT teams and our external experts are running full diagnostic checks to try and understand exactly what caused the problem in the first place and until a cause it identified it would be premature to speculate on what element of the system was responsible."The focus to date has been on resolving the issue and getting our systems back online and as such the cost implications have yet to be fully assessed."The input by our main IT suppliers is covered under existing contractual arrangements."</body>

      <title>CQC official cleared over 'cover-up'</title>

      <body>One of the officials at England's health regulator accused of a cover-up has been cleared of wrong-doing in an internal inquiry.The Care Quality Commission said media manager Anna Jefferson had not supported an alleged decision to delete a critical report.It had been suggested the CQC tried to conceal failings in its investigation at Furness General hospital in Cumbria.Ms-Jefferson said she was "relieved that her name has now been cleared".She added that it had been "an extremely difficult time".The spotlight fell on the CQC when it published a review in June by consultants Grant Thornton which looked at how the organisation had investigated Furness General Hospital in Cumbria.This review had been ordered by the CQC's new chief executive, David Behan, after he took over the regulator in 2012.The CQC had given Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, a clean bill of health in 2010 despite problems emerging in relation to its maternity unit - since then more than 30 families have taken legal action against the hospital in relation to baby and maternal deaths and injuries from 2008.In 2011 - with more concerns arising - the CQC ordered an internal review into how those problems had been missed.But when this report was finished, officials decided not to make the findings public and the author was allegedly been told to "delete" it, the Grant Thornton review said.The officials alleged to have been involved in this decision were initially not named by the CQC.The organisation came under immediate pressure from ministers and the information commissioner, who accused them of hiding behind the Data Protection Act.Within a day the identities of the three - former chief executive Cynthia Bower, her deputy Jill Finney and media manager Anna Jefferson - had been revealed.All three strongly disputed the allegations made against them.Ms Jefferson is the only one of the three to still work for the CQC - she is now its head of media - and therefore the only one subject to an internal investigation.The CQC says no disciplinary action will be taken.In a statement, it added Anna Jefferson had "not used 'any inappropriate phrases' as attributed to her by one witness quoted in the Grant Thornton report" and "had not supported any instruction to delete an internal report prepared by a colleague."It added: "The CQC regrets any distress Anna Jefferson has suffered as a consequence of this matter and is pleased to welcome Anna back to the organisation following a period of maternity leave."The independent report had suggested that Ms Jefferson had said of the critical internal review: "Are you kidding me? This can never be in the public domain."A spokesman for Grant Thornton said it fully supported and stood by its findings.</body>

      <title>GP services 'face cuts catastrophe'</title>
      <description>The GP system in England is facing a "catastrophe" because of cuts in funding that represent a £400m drop in real terms, doctors' leaders warn.</description>

      <date>1380809032</date>
      <body>The GP system in England is facing a "catastrophe" because of cuts in funding, doctors' leaders are warning.Analysis by the Royal College of GPs suggests that over the past three years, investment in general practice has fallen by £400m in real terms.That is equivalent to a 7% cut in spending per patient, it says.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the RCGP, which is meeting in Harrogate, he government wanted to increase access to GPs by extending opening hours.On Tuesday, the prime minister said he wanted more patients to be able to get help in the evenings and at weekends, as he set out details of a £50m pilot programme in nine areas of England to widen access.But the college said its analysis - based on official data from the Health and Social Care Information Centre - showed the government was taking money away from GPs despite claiming it wanted to move care away from hospitals.The RCGP's chairwoman Dr Clare Gerada said the cuts meant doctors were being required to do more work with fewer resources, damaging services for patients.In 2012-13, £8.5bn was invested in general practice, when everything from spending on pay, IT, tests and drugs was taken into account, it said.That compared with £8.3bn in 2009-10, which is the equivalent of £8.9bn in 2012-13 prices.In terms of spending per patient, that represents a fall from £168.40 a year to £156.45 - a drop of 7%.Dr Gerada also pointed out that the investment represented 9% of the entire NHS budget, even though GPs had 90% of the contacts with patients.She said: "Our figures should send out a warning to government and the rest of the NHS that we will soon have a catastrophe on our hands if urgent action is not taken to reverse the decline in funding."GPs are keen to do more for their patients, but we are heaving under the pressure of ever-increasing workloads and diminishing resources."Some of us are routinely working 11-hour days with up to 60 patient contacts in a single day and this is not safe or sustainable."You do not want a tired GP seeing you. You do not want a tired GP any more than you want a tired pilot or a tired surgeon."Dr Gerada also expressed concern about the season ahead and said general practice was close to reaching a "tipping point" which would see the profession "fall over"."We're trying to squeeze more and more activity out of a smaller and smaller pot of money," she added."If we have a cold winter, I'm really afraid that patients will suffer considerably."The front door of the NHS is the GP's surgery. If that gives, the rest of the NHS will give and very rapidly."Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who addressed the conference on Thursday afternoon, did not object to the figures.But he said the problems with investment in GPs "goes back further than three years"."In the NHS we have invested in hospitals, in AandEs and we have not had a parallel investment in primary care."He added the government was now looking to invest in programmes that increased access to GPs - hence the announcement this week to extend opening hours and increase the use of technologies such as email and Skype.Patients Association chief executive Katherine Murphy said: "This chimes with what patients are saying to us. They are finding it harder to access GPs both in and out of hours."The mantra is about moving care out of hospitals and into the community, but if we are going to achieve that we have to stop throwing money at hospitals and invest in GPs so they can provide quality care."Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: "These figures are embarrassing for a prime minister who got elected on a promise not to cut the NHS."They make a mockery of yet more promises he has made on GP access this week and show he simply can't be trusted on the NHS."</body>

      <title>Body clock 'reset button' found</title>
      <description>The prospect of drugs to rapidly reset the body clock to avoid jet lag and the pains of shift work has moved a step close after research in Japan.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24387491</url>
      <date>1380823371</date>
      <body>Drugs that rapidly tweak the body clock in order to avoid jet lag and the pains of shift work have moved a step closer after research in Japan.The team at Kyoto University has found the clock's 'reset button' inside the brain.Their study, published in the journal Science, showed the button could be used to switch the clock to a new time zone in a single day.Experts said the team was "close to the money" in the hunt for a jet lag cure.There are clocks throughout the body and a "master clock" in the brain, keeping the body in sync with the world around it to make people sleepy at night.Anyone who has ever done shift work or a long-haul flight has experienced the disrupted sleep and hunger patterns of a body clock which is out of tune with the rising and setting of the sun.The clock uses light to help keep track of time, but it is naturally stubborn and adjusts slowly.The rough rule is that for every time zone crossed it takes a full day for the body to catch up. Fly from London to Beijing and it would take a week for the body clock to fully adapt.The team in Japan have come up with a way to get the master clock to be a bit more flexible.It is a group of 10,000 brain cells - about the same size as a grain of rice - which constantly talk to each other to keep a strict control over the time.The scientists found that interfering with the vasopressin receptors, essentially a brain cell's ears that allow it to keep in touch with its neighbours, let the clock shift rapidly.Genetically modified mice which had no vasopressin receptors were able to adjust to the clocks being put back eight hours within a single day, while normal mice took six days.When the clocks were put forward eight hours then it took normal mice eight days to adapt, but those without vasopressin receptors adjusted in two.Similar results were then achieved in normal mice using a drug.The study's authors concluded: "Studies have shown that chronic jet lag and rotating shift work can increase an individual's risk of developing hypertension, obesity, and other metabolic disorders."Our results identify vasopressin signalling as a possible therapeutic target for the management of circadian rhythm [body clock] misalignment."Dr Michael Hastings, a Medical Research Council body clock researcher, told the BBC's Science in Action programme: "It's a remarkable study, it really is very exciting for our field."There's been many false dawns when it comes to a cure for jet lag, but I think this time they're close to the money."However, he cautioned that vasopressin receptors were also heavily involved in kidney function so any drug developed would need to be designed carefully to target the body clock without disrupting the kidneys.Dr Hastings added that with an increasingly 24-7 society a drug which can adjust the body clock could, in theory, improve the health of shift workers."The issue here in terms of public health is rotational shift work, the epidemiological evidence that we have now shows that if a worker has spent a working life doing rotational shift work they're at higher risk of contracting certain forms of cancer, cardiovascular disease or metabolic syndrome like diabetes."</body>

      <body>Legionella bacteria appears to be "common" in many compost brands sold in the UK, a study has found.A team from Strathclyde University in Glasgow tested 22 different brands of compost and found that 14 contained a variety of Legionella species.It says a larger survey is needed to determine the extent of the issue.The study, "Legionella spp. in UK composts - a potential public health issue", is published by Clinical Microbiology and Infection.Dr Beattie, one of those who conducted the study, said: "Disease causing micro-organisms are widespread in the environment, and therefore it is not too surprising that species of Legionella that can cause human disease are present in compost."Any environment where you have pathogenic bacteria could be a source of infection, and we already know that compost has been linked to human Legionella infection in countries such as Australia and New Zealand."Dr Beattie said European produced composts have traditionally been composed of peat, whereas those from Australia and New Zealand had more often used sawdust and bark."It may be that the change in composition of composts in the UK, moving away from peat-based products, could be resulting in species such as Legionella longbeachae being present in compost and therefore more cases of infection could occur," she said.Dr Beattie wants a larger scale survey, covering a wider range of compost products, to be carried out to see if Legionella bacteria are as widespread in composts as her study suggests.She added: "It should be emphasised though, that although Legionella seem to be common in compost, human infection is very rare, especially if you consider the volume of compost sold and used."But with any potential source of infection precautions should always be taken."The occurrence of these bacteria in composts in Australia and New Zealand, and the cases of infection that have been traced to compost has resulted in hygiene warnings on compost packaging in these countries, and this is something manufacturers in the UK may wish to consider."The study was conducted by Dr Tara Beattie, fellow academic Dr Charles Knapp, Strathclyde PhD student Sandra Currie and Dr Diane Lindsay of the Scottish Haemophilus, Legionella, Meningococcus and Pneumococcus Reference Laboratory.</body>

      <title>'Sleep - key to tackling obesity'</title>
      <description>How a good night's rest could be the key to the fight against obesity</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24162508</url>
      <date>1380240353</date>
      <body>The focus in the fight to tackle obesity tends to be diet and exercise. But what about sleep?In this week's Scrubbing Up, Dr Neil Stanley argues getting a good night's rest is just as important.It is an undeniable fact that we have a problem with obesity in the UK. The government and the NHS rightly believe that for the health of the nation, levels of obesity need to be reduced.So we have campaigns based on eating less and more healthily, such as "5-a-day" and exercise - "10,000 steps a day" and the "Change for Life" initiative.However, given recent reports, these efforts, whilst very well-meaning, are seemingly having absolutely no effect on reducing levels of obesity or increasing rates of exercising.The conventional line is that this is because we are all victims of the "aggressive advertising" and "easy availability" of sugary and fatty foods and/or that we are addicted to computer games/TV/Facebook etc.It is possibly true that in the past we did move a bit more than modern children, but I seem to remember that sugary and fatty foods were just as "aggressively" advertised and easily available.My "bog-standard" comprehensive school had a tuck shop and there were plenty of local shops selling a myriad of sugary and fatty comestibles for our delectation.Perhaps there is some other reason why the "eat less, move more" advice is not working.What if we simply cannot help ourselves? And that, from a physiological point of view, we actually crave junk food and don't want to exercise?So what might be the answer?Numerous studies have shown a significant association between short sleep duration and being overweight or obese in both children and adults.And I believe that it is more than coincidence that, over the last 40 years, as there has been a reduction in our sleep duration, there has also been a rise is the number of people who are overweight or obese.Using fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), poor sleep has been shown to affect the brain areas responsible for complex decision-making and response to rewards causing us to favour unhealthy foods.Poor sleep also causes changes in the levels of our hunger hormones.There is a decrease in the level of leptin - which regulates food intake and signals when we have enough food, while the level of ghrelin - which stimulates appetite, fat production and body growth - rises.Research suggests this causes 24% higher feelings of hunger, a 23% increase in overall appetite but a 33% increased desire for high-fat, high-carbohydrate foods making us feel that we have had insufficient food and thus encouraging us to increase food intake.Short sleep has also been shown to increase our urge to snack between meals and causes us to excessively season our food, eat fewer vegetables, buy more junk food and buy more food overall.So the availability and advertising of junk food is seen as the problem.However, the simple fact is that because of poor sleep, you may actually physiologically want to eat these foods regardless of the efforts of the multi-national purveyors of junk food - though this is in no way trying to absolve them of their responsibilities.But be honest - when you are sleepy, which would you prefer: an apple or a cupcake?The "eat less, move more" message, no matter how it is presented and how much money is spent on its promotion, is obviously not working - and I would contend that, in isolation, it cannot work.Up until now, there has been no serious government or NHS advice or guidance about sleep, no multi-million pound campaigns - they haven't even appointed a scientist off the telly as a "Sleep Tsar".I believe that if we are serious about reducing the weight of the nation and increasing rates of exercise, we need to address the issue of poor sleep.Isn't it is time for a new approach - "eat less, move more, sleep well"?</body>

But could a mobile phone app be the answer?Birth and death are perhaps the most significant moments of any human life - worth writing down for posterity.But in many countries around the world, the systems set up to collect vital data about citizens have such low coverage that many deaths slip through the net.Not knowing who has died, and what they have died of, makes it impossible to build an accurate picture of a nation's health.Now technology - in the form of a specialist mobile phone app - could make all the difference.Using a technique known as "verbal autopsy", field workers visit relatives to ask them about the circumstances of a family death.By collecting the information digitally from currently hard-to-reach places, it has the potential to revolutionise our understanding of global health.In Malawi, any death that occurs outside a medical facility is not recorded.Dr Carina King, a fellow at University College London, is overseeing the implementation of the mobile phone autopsies in the Malawian district of Mchinji."We found everyone surprisingly open, and I think they find the phone quite an interesting thing when we go for interviews," she told the BBC.Verbal autopsies have been in use for about 20 years but the information was traditionally recorded on a paper questionnaire.These often lengthy documents were supposed to be analysed by two doctors, who would use the answers to deduce the likely cause of death.However the sheer scale of the task was often too great, meaning that many of the questionnaires ending up languishing in dusty rooms, completely unread."The mobile phone has been very good and means we don't have lots of paper forms," says Dr King."We have very quick access to the data and we can analyse it quickly to get the causes of death."The phone software, known as MIVA, presents a series of questions that a trained field worker uses to find out information from the family.Each question has a range of possible answers and the software intelligently skips to the next relevant question depending on the response.Most important of all is that it is designed to quickly compute the most likely cause of death.The result is stored in the phone and can be sent to a central database either by text message or internet upload.Dr Jon Bird of City University, London, who was part of the team involved in creating the software, says mobile phones provide a particularly convenient way of collecting data."Mobile phones are probably one the most widespread technologies in the world. They're cheap, they're robust and everyone knows how to use one," he told the BBC."The everyday nature of mobile phones also makes them really valuable because the people that are being interviewed don't find them intrusive."In Malawi, mobile phone autopsies are currently being used to record the cause of death in children.The project is called MaiMwana, meaning mother and child in the local Chichewa language, and it focuses on children who died before their fifth birthday.The under-five mortality rate in Malawi is 71 per 1,000 live births according to 2012 figures from the World Bank - compared to just five per 1,000 live births in the UK.Lazaro Cypriano lives in the village of Mzangawa in Mchinji district, central Malawi with his wife Magdalena and their toddler.The couple lost their first two children.Their second child died about a year ago, after a series of hospital visits due to fever. It is this death that will be the subject of the verbal autopsy.Outside urban areas, one of the main problems for collecting data is finding out when a death has occurred.To get around this, field reporters from the local community take on the responsibility of alerting the MaiMwana team of people who have died in their area.This is how Lazaro's family was identified, and the visit now affords him his first opportunity to narrate what happened to his son and have that information recorded.The interviewer asks the couple standard questions and matches their answers to the choices provided in the application's template.It's a highly sensitive and skilled job - and one which field interviewer Nicholas Mbwana can see is made easier by using a mobile phone."We go to the households, ask about the causes of death - what really happened - and we also record the GPS in order to trace the household in future," he told the BBC.Dr King says the system is key to the success of the project."GPS gives us the location of every household in the district so we can actually plot out on a map where people are dying of what, which means that you could design more sophisticated programs for targeting specific interventions."Mobile phone autopsies are being used on a limited scale at present. But the long term aim is to roll out the technique much more widely."The beauty of the system is that it's standardised and can be translated into any language you want," says Dr Bird."It's important when you're collecting data on a large scale that everyone is answering the same question, so that you know that the results are directly comparable from town to town and country to country."The World Health Organization (WHO) is already supporting the initiative and is working with institutions from the UK to Sweden to develop the technology further.The data is currently being collected in a range of databases that can be accessed by researchers interested in public health.As the project grows, researchers from the University of Umea in Sweden will co-ordinate the growing number of translations and the distribution of the technology around the world.The government in Malawi is already keen to see the results of the project."It is important for us as a ministry to know what is killing Malawians out there so that we can plan ahead and put appropriate interventions in place to prevent that - and also to put out health messages," says Dr Charles Mwansambo, Malawi's Health Secretary.The Ministry of Health has so far only been using information collected from medical facilities, which the health secretary concedes is biased data."We need comprehensive data from the hospitals and the community to plan well. We find ourselves planning for the small community that comes to hospital, not realising there is a bigger community out there that we need to budget for," he adds.Dr Mwansambo also acknowledges that a cultural practice of burying health documents with the dead makes it difficult to collect important information about deaths."When somebody dies people want to forget everything about them - those memories that will remind them of their loved ones. So unfortunately they bury the health passport along with their clothes and other possessions and we lose vital information in the process," he explains.The health passports are documents issued to parents, which record the birth weight of the baby and its gain over time, as well as which immunizations were administered and when.An elder at Mzangawa village, Kangkwamba Piri, is already talking to members of his community to drop that cultural practice."We've been doing this for a long time but it is wrong. What needs to be done is not to bury the documents and that's what we're encouraging people to do," he says.For now, it is likely that millions of deaths will still go unnoticed by official figures. But verbal autopsies recorded on mobile phones are making small but significant inroads into solving the problem.And for and his wife Magdalena, the chance to give information about what killed their child to an official is important.Magdalena says: "What I have learnt from this interview will help me take care of my third baby so he can be healthy and live long."</body>

      <title>Awake under the knife</title>
      <description>Can you be conscious but feel no pain under the knife?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24357476</url>
      <date>1380930754</date>
      <body>Having a general anaesthetic is a routine part of many operations. But what happens if you are still conscious after you close your eyes?You are in the operating theatre. Anaesthetic has been administered and the countdown to unconsciousness begins.For most people, the next thing they will remember is being roused from a deep sleep.But in a small minority of cases, complete unconsciousness never comes.Being awake during surgery and not being able to do anything about it is every patient's worst nightmare.But according to one of the country's leading anaesthetists, it may not be as simple as saying that someone is either asleep or awake.Prof Jaideep Pandit, consultant anaesthetist at the Oxford University Hospitals, believes there is an alternative "third state" of consciousness somewhere between sleeping and waking that patients under general anaesthetic can and do experience."I call it dysanaesthesia," he explains. "A type of awareness where the patient is aware of the surgery but is neither conscious nor unconscious."Despite being used around the world on a daily basis, no-one is exactly sure how a general anaesthetic acts upon the body.Anaesthesia is a complicated business requiring many years of training and a proper understanding of which drugs to give, and how much.However in general, a patient can be expected to receive an anaesthetic to make them unconscious and a painkiller to numb the pain.A specialist doctor will then monitor a whole host of measurements throughout the operation to make sure that the patient really is out for the count.Even so, in an estimated 1 in 15,000 surgeries patients experience what is known as accidental awareness where they remember aspects of their surgery after waking. Around a third of those will feel pain.The question whether someone is conscious or not is mind-bogglingly complex.But Professor Pandit is investigating something that goes one step further - a twilight state that lies between conscious and unconscious states - and one that his experiments show happens much more frequently than accidental awareness.He has been able to show this through the use of something known as the Isolated Forearm Technique.Before the advent of carefully calibrated monitoring equipment, anaesthetists were able to use this technique during surgery to check whether someone was fully unconscious.The method uses a tourniquet to prevent any muscle relaxants from paralysing the forearm. This means that if the patient becomes conscious during surgery, they can move their arm to alert the surgeon.Professor Pandit has used the technique to show some fascinating aspects to human awareness.In repeated tests, one third of patients who are seemingly unconscious are able to squeeze the experimenter's fingers on command using their non-paralysed forearm. But none of them will move spontaneously to show that they are awake or in pain during surgery."To all extents and purposes, these patients are unconscious," says Prof Pandit. "But they are clearly in a state where they can respond to some stimuli like verbal commands but not to others like the surgery, possibly because they are not distressed by it."According to Prof Pandit, this suggests there is a third level of consciousness.But analysing the concept remains extremely difficult."Mainly when patients come round they will have no recall of the event or if they do they do it's just vague memories. They're unable to remember anything with clarity," he told the BBC.One way doctors frequently explain general anaesthesia to patients is to compare it to being asleep. But that is technically inaccurate says Dr Emory Brown, a professor of anaesthesia at Harvard Medical School."What we need to do to safely and humanely operate on you - to perform a procedure which is indeed, very invasive and certainly traumatic - is to put you in a state which is a coma that we can readily reverse," he told the BBC.This coma-like condition potentially protects the patient from pain and memory of the surgery. But it also helps the surgeons to operate by keeping the patient still and maintaining bodily functions at a stable level.However, what's happening in the brain as it slips from conscious into unconsciousness is still uncertain.In 2011, a research team at Manchester University were able to watch for the first time the effects on a human brain as it lost consciousness under anaesthetic.Using a novel method of brain imaging, they were able to construct real-time 3D images of the brain - rather than the 2D slices of standard brain scans.It enabled them to see how electrical activity in the brain changed as the patients went under.Interestingly, activity in the brain appeared to hot up as the patient became unconscious. This suggests that rather than switching off, the brain works hard to dampen down or inhibit consciousness while they are under the influence of anaesthetic.But scientists are still a long way off from understanding the impact on the brain as unconsciousness occurs."We are still unable at this time to define what human consciousness is, so trying to find a box of tricks that's going to monitor its absence is difficult," says Dr Kevin Fong, a consultant in anaesthesia at University College London Hospitals."But awareness during anaesthesia is something we've learnt to guard against through layers and layers of monitoring. We check surrogates of awareness such as heart rate, blood pressure and rates of respiration, and also constantly monitor the exact concentration of drugs in the blood."Indeed having memory of your surgery is one of the most important complications that both anaesthetists and patients wish to avoid.Although a national survey this year found the risk of waking up under the knife was extremely low, the effects for patients who do experience it can be acutely traumatic.For Prof Pandit, the ultimate aim of understanding human unconsciousness is to prevent such episodes from occurring."The risk of experiencing pain or distress during accidental awareness is very low at around 1 in 45,000," he explains. "But when it does happen it can have a very bad effect on the individual.""So it's not just the numbers that are driving us to research dysanaesthesia, but also the impact."</body>

      <description>The two-year-old to leave hospital for the first time</description>

      <body>A two-year-old girl born with a condition which means her brain forgets to tell her to breathe is about to leave hospital for the first time.Maisie Harris from Gillingham, Kent has been at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London since being transferred from Medway Maritime at three months old.She has congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), also known as Ondine's Curse.A new, portable ventilator has enabled Maisie to go home.The machine knows when she is able to take her own breaths and when she is likely to have a CCHS episode and require support.It has batteries and a carry case, so Maisie, who is three on 23 October, will be able to go on outings with her family and go to school when she is older.Staff on Great Ormond Street's Miffy Ward held a party for her on Friday, before she leaves hospital on Monday."We cannot wait to bring Maisie home and enjoy being a normal family," said her mother Rachel Bridger, 23."It's felt as though we have been in hospital for a lifetime."Everyone here has become like a second family to us - they know Maisie inside out."She knows her own mind but she is a really happy little girl - she's hardly ever upset."I don't think it will take her long to get used to playing with her toys at home and sleeping in her own bed for the first time."Maisie, who featured in BBC2's Great Ormond Street series last year, also has malacia of the airways, so her airways are floppy like the top of a balloon and do not hold their shape properly.Consultant Colin Wallis said: "We have been working on ways to allow a greater number of long-term ventilated children to go home."The family home is the best place for a young child to grow and develop, and Maisie will now be able to go out and about with her family, make new friends and experience everything the outside world has to offer."Dr Wallis treated Ms Bridger when she was younger. She also has CCHS, although her condition is less complex.She and Maisie's father Andrew Harris, 26, have been trained on how to use her ventilator and will be supported by a team of local carers.</body>

      <title>Can a drug make you tell the truth?</title>
      <description>Did powerful drug make Michael Mosley tell the truth?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24371140</url>
      <date>1380759219</date>
      <body>In movies and TV dramas, sodium thiopental is shown as a sinister truth serum used to get information out of captured people. Michael Mosley tried it out.One of the great challenges of living in our society is knowing when people are telling the truth or not. We lie all the time and are remarkably bad at detecting when other people are deliberately deceiving us.There are lots of urban myths about lie detecting, such as the claim that liars tend to look away, twitch their feet or touch their noses when lying (the so-called Pinocchio effect).In study after study, it has been shown that professionals such as policemen are no more reliable at detecting liars than the rest of us. So it's not surprising that for many years scientists have been working to develop "truth drugs" - drugs that will make you open up and tell all you know to an interrogator.One of the oldest and best known of these truth drugs is sodium thiopental. Although it was first developed in the 1930s, it is still used today in a range of settings, including, in some countries, by the police and the military.I was intrigued but also extremely sceptical about the claims that sodium thiopental, originally developed as an anaesthetic, could make people speak the truth if they chose not to. So I decided, as part of a series I've been making on the extraordinary history of pharmaceuticals, to try it out.Sodium thiopental is part of a group of drugs called barbiturates, drugs widely used in the 1950s and 60s to help people sleep better. They are no longer used for that purpose because they are extremely addictive and potentially lethal - Marilyn Monroe famously died from a barbiturate overdose.I decided to take a low dose of sodium thiopental under proper medical supervision, with anaesthetist Dr Austin Leach monitoring my vital signs throughout. Barbiturates work by slowing down the rate at which messages travel through the brain and spinal column. The more barbiturates there are, the harder it is for chemical messages to cross the gaps between one neuron and the next.Your whole thinking process slows down until you fall asleep. With thiopental, that happens very quickly indeed.Although it was originally developed as an anaesthetic, it was soon noticed that when patients were in that twilight zone halfway between consciousness and unconsciousness, they became more chatty and disinhibited. After the drug had worn off, the patients forgot what they had been talking about.It was decided that sodium thiopental might form the basis for a truth drug, an interrogation tool. But does it really work?I decided that I would have a go at trying to maintain the fiction that rather than being Michael Mosley, science journalist, I would be Michael Mosley, famous heart surgeon. We started with a very low dose. Immediately I felt extremely light-headed, intoxicated. But would this make me more inclined to speak the truth?There is an expression, "in vino veritas" (in wine there is truth). Alcohol is an anaesthetic and it depresses some of our higher centres, areas like the cerebral cortex where a lot of thought processing occurs. It reduces inhibitions but also slows thought processes, making it difficult to think clearly. The Roman historian Tacitus claimed that Germanic tribes held their important councils while drunk, as they thought it made effective lying harder.One theory about sodium thiopental is that it works in much the same way. Because lying is generally more difficult and complicated than telling the truth, if you suppress higher cortical functions you are more likely to speak the truth, simply because it's easier.I'm not sure if I lied effectively while under the influence of low dose thiopental, but I found that I could still lie."I am a cardiac - ha ha ha! - cardiac surgeon, a world famous cardiac surgeon," I shouted out when Dr Leach asked me what I did for a living."Would you like to tell me what the last operation you carried out was?" he enquired, politely."It was a heart bypass," I improvised. "They survived, yeah, I was awesome."Not convincing, but I had just about managed to stick to my fictional story. But what would happen when the dose was upped?At this point I felt some trepidation. There was a risk that I might say something that I really didn't want the world to know, but, confident in my ability to keep on lying, I told Dr Leach to go ahead.I was given another slightly larger dose of sodium thiopental and this time I actually felt more sober, more in control. So what happened next was a complete surprise.Again Dr Leech asked me my name and my profession. This time there was no hesitation."I'm a television producer. Well, executive producer, well, presenter, some, mix of the three of them.""So you don't have any history of performing cardiac surgery?" he asked gently."None whatsoever. None whatsoever"I'm still confused about what happened because one effect of the drug is to distort short-term memory. But I think the reason that I spoke the truth on this occasion is because the thought of lying never occurred to me.So does it work? Well my conclusion after trying it out and speaking to experts is that it will certainly make you more inclined to talk, but that when you are under the influence you are also in an extremely suggestible state. The reason you become more suggestible is probably because the drug is interfering with your higher centres, like your cortex, where a lot of decision making goes on. There is a serious risk you will say what your interrogator wants to hear rather than the truth.The truth is we don't have a reliable truth drug yet. Or if there is one out there, nobody's telling.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>How many redheads are there in the world?</title>
      <description>Can it be true that a fifth of the world's redheads are Scottish?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24331615</url>
      <date>1380669889</date>
      <body>About 200 people took part in the UK's first Ginger Pride march in August, and the world record for the largest gathering of natural redheads was broken last month when 1,600 attended the Redhead Day Festival in the Dutch town of Breda. But how many redheads are there in the world - and where do they live?Scotland is thought by some to have the highest concentration of redheads in the world, so maybe it was an appropriate location for the Ginger Pride march, led by Canadian comedian Shawn Hitchins.While they marched through the streets of Edinburgh, he made a startling claim."It's a great opportunity to bring together all the redheads in the country that holds 19% of the world's population of redheads," he told BBC Radio.The claim was initially reported on BBC News too. But can it really be true that Scotland is home to almost a fifth of the world's redheads?"I can't really believe that figure," says Jonathan Rees, professor of dermatology at the University of Edinburgh and one of a team of scientists to identify the gene responsible for red hair - the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R).So where did Hitchins get the figure from? It turns out it was a mistake."It must have been in confusion," he says. "I was walking through Edinburgh with 200 redheads behind me and I was mostly trying not to lead people into traffic. Nobody really knows the exact [number]. There was someone from Glasgow saying it was 19% in just the population of Scotland."In the heat of the moment, it seems, he simply got his words muddled, and that proportion of redheads in Scotland became something very different."I am very sorry. This is what happens when you let comedians be spokespeople," says Hitchins. "Also, I'm a ginger so I'm 10 times more likely to make up a statistic."So if we can now confidently say that a fifth of the world's redheads do not live in Scotland, do we know what proportion actually do?"It's fair to say we don't have very detailed information about what the frequency of people with red hair is throughout the world," says Rees."I wouldn't say there are no reliable estimates, but the ideal way to do this would of course be like the census, where everybody's examined at various ages and you have robust data."We don't have that sort of data, but many different researchers have carried out smaller studies where the selection has not been entirely random in the way you would like."It is often said that between 1% and 2%, or 70 to 140 million people around the world, have red hair.In purely numerical terms, it is highly likely that the US has the highest number of people with red hair, because of the size of its population. If just 1% had red hair, for example, that would mean it had three million redheads.According to Rees, the figure for the UK is about 10%.If that was the case in Scotland, that would suggest that the country with its population of 5.3 million was home to just over half a million redheads - less than 1% of the global total.The prevalence of red hair may be slightly higher in Scotland than in England, Rees says, adding that it may be even higher in the Republic of Ireland.Overall, Northern European countries have a greater proportion of redheads than anywhere else in the world."If you're in northern Europe, you get used to seeing people with different hair colour," says Rees."But most of the people on this planet don't live in Europe and if you just think about Asia, it's very, very rare to see somebody with red hair. And in most of Africa it is exceedingly rare to see somebody with red hair. It is an unusual trait globally."To explain this, you have to go back tens of thousands of years, says Rees."When humans moved out of Africa… skin lightened and people developed hair with different colours. There seems to be some advantage in having pale skin if you live in parts of the world where there isn't much sunshine," he says."The probable reason for that is that we make vitamin D in our skin. We rely on sunshine to make vitamin D and if you have very dark skin, it's harder to make that vitamin D."Being pale, redheads are more efficient at making vitamin D and do not need so much sunlight in order to get the amount they need, he says.So, in certain places in the world at least, there's a big advantage to being in this minority.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <description>BBC's Panorama returns to Syria to visit school attack burns victims</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-24288698</url>
      <date>1380502493</date>
      <body>Footage of a napalm-like attack on a school in Syria filmed by a team working for Panorama shocked the world. Now the BBC has returned to find out what happened to the children who suffered horrific burns.We had travelled to Syria to film two British doctors from the UK charity Hand in Hand for Syria providing care to parts of the country where the medical system is barely functioning.The British medics had stopped off at a hospital in Aleppo Province. It was set up by the charity to provide general medical care, but in a climate of war it is just as likely to be casualties of the conflict who are carried through the door.Within an hour of being there we received the first sign of what was to come.A seven-month old baby boy arrived, his pink face was blistered and raw. His father was also burnt and sat helplessly on a stretcher clutching his son as the staff rushed to help.The British doctors were hearing rumours that there were more cases on the way.Soon, dozens of people, mostly teenagers, were being rushed in on stretchers with napalm-like burns. Their clothes were burnt, their bodies charred and in some cases their hair had melted.Their faces were brutally disfigured with huge blisters forming over their bodies. Almost in slow motion they lumbered in; shocked and in pain. The smell of burnt flesh was overpowering.Within minutes the hospital was overwhelmed. Dr Rola Hallam and Dr Saleyha Ahsam began treating the casualties.There were no shrapnel injuries or loss of blood typical of most aerial bombs.We did not know for sure what the device contained but it caused appalling burns consistent with an incendiary device, containing a substance like napalm or thermite.The pressure group Human Rights Watch has documented the use of similar bombs elsewhere in Syria.All of this unravelled in a climate of fear. It happened just days after the chemical attack in the eastern suburbs of Damascus that killed hundreds of people and many were terrified that the same had just happened here.Doctors ripped open packets of saline fluid and poured the liquid over the victims. The few beds in the emergency room quickly filled up and many of the teenagers were writhing in agony on the floor.Thick white cream was applied to their bodies to treat the burns, while yet more patients were brought in.Outside in the hospital courtyard, a water tanker sprayed the crowd so they could clean themselves - terrified that this had been a chemical attack.Fathers and mothers desperate for news fought to be allowed into the hospital, cursing their president, Bashar al-Assad.Eyewitnesses described the same thing - a fighter-jet circling overhead, apparently looking for targets. A large crowd had gathered at the school where the incendiary bomb was dropped.Eighteen-year-old Siham Kanbari had terrible burns to much of her body.She had been in a maths class when the blast ripped through the window.One of the youngest victims was 13-year-old Ahmed Darwish.When he arrived at the hospital he was shaking uncontrollably. The emergency ward was so full he was told to wait in the corridor.Dr Saleyha described the scene."Out of all the war zones I have ever been to, today has been by far the worst," she said."I have never seen anything like that - the fact that they were children, teenagers, same ages as my nieces and nephews."The hospital admitted 30 patients that day.Most had more than 50% burns - which meant their chances of survival were less than half.The injured needed intensive care therapy but none was available in Aleppo's field hospital.By dusk the chaos began to subside as patients were rushed across the border to Turkey for treatment. Some died on the way."I thought it was never going to end," Dr Rola said. "We lost a gentlemen on transfer to Bab-al-Hawa, he had extensive third degree burns."We tried to stabilise him and refer him as soon as possible but we weren't able to rescue him. I've never seen a burn that bad."I think his face is going to stay with me for quite a long time."Two days after the attack we went to the school.It had been one of the few to remain open in this part of northern Syria. But when we visited the classrooms were empty.The smell at the scene and the debris suggest it was an incendiary bomb. It is not a chemical weapon but is classed as a conventional one.More than 100 countries have banned their use against civilians but Syria has not signed the treaty.The air at the scene was still thick with the smell of whatever was dropped that day; it is hard to imagine or to describe the horrors of what the pilot did.The headmaster said he felt helpless. He was too afraid to give his name."The worst thing in life is for someone to die before our eyes."People burning in front of you. People dying. People running. But where will they run to?"They're not safe anywhere. This is the fate of the Syrian people."Ten children died in the attack and many more have been left struggling to survive terrible burns.We visited Ahmed, in a Turkish hospital, a few weeks after the incident. Described as a hard working boy with a smiley face, he now has 40% burns to his body."I'm in a lot of pain," he said. "I had a fever all last night. I'm in pain on my neck and my shoulder."Why bomb us while we are at school. Why?"When we last saw Siham, in the Aleppo hospital, she was screaming in pain. She is now in a ward alongside Ahmed, in Turkey. She told us the day we visited that her body still feels like it is burning.She was in her final year of school. Described as one of the smartest in her class she is now suffering with 70% burns."Please let it be over now", she said. "We need to find a way out. We've had all we can take."As the controversy over chemical weapons dies down, the world's attention will once again move on from Syria.But for those whose lives are being torn apart by war, the suffering continues.Panorama: Saving Syria's Children, is available in the UK on the BBC iPlayer. It will be broadcast on BBC World News on 5 October at 0910 and 2110 GMT, and on 6 October at 0210 and 1510 GMT.</body>

      <title>'My mum had dementia at 29'</title>
      <description>The teenage fundraiser whose mother had dementia at 29</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24223897</url>
      <date>1380501003</date>
      <body>When Louise was three, her mother Zoe, who was then 29, was diagnosed with dementia. She is now 42, and living in a care home unable to walk or talk.Zoe is one of the 17,000 people in the UK living with "early-onset dementia", which is defined as cases diagnosed before the age of 65.For Zoe's family, the first signs something was wrong came when Louise and her sister were on holiday with their grandmother.While they were away, another relative noticed Zoe - clearly confused - out in the park searching for her children.Louise's grandmother, Julie, says she still misses the everyday moments she can no longer share with her daughter - going shopping or a day at the beach."It's one of the worst diseases going," she says. "It's all been wiped away."After being in and out of hospital for some time, Zoe was eventually diagnosed with early onset dementia.Doctors could not say why it had happened to someone so young."Right at the outset, when she was first diagnosed, they said unfortunately sometimes these things happen," says Julie."They're like a one-off and Zoe's the one-off."Zoe managed to live with her daughters at the start of her illness, but soon became too ill to cope.She now lives in a care home in Ashford, and is on a special early onset ward, where she is by far the youngest person.Louise was only a baby when Zoe became ill, so has few memories of living with her mother.But she now raises funds for the Alzheimer's Society, and recently took part in one of the charity's Memory Walks. She hopes research will help prevent the same thing happening to another family."I can't help my mum now it's too late - there's nothing anybody can do to help her. But if it means I can help other people then it's worth it."It's also to raise awareness. When I meet new people and I tell them how my life is, and I explain my mum's got dementia, no-one I've met has ever really known what it is and how it affects people."The family is also having to cope with dementia striking again.Julie's mother Ruby, 85, was found to have Alzheimer's five years ago, and is now in a care home.She was diagnosed after slipping out of the house at night and walking several miles along the local canal.Julie - who has therefore seen both her daughter and her mother battle the disease - now focuses on supporting her granddaughters."The miracle we've been waiting for, hoping to happen hasn't happened," says Julie."When the girls were little and asking, 'Why is mum ill and when will she get better?' we just had to say, 'We're hoping for a miracle'."We haven't got our miracle, so perhaps we can help in other ways."</body>

      <title>Union anger at health pay proposal</title>
      <description>Unions criticise government moves to halt a 1% pay rise for all NHS staff in England, arguing they deserve to be rewarded for holding the health service together.</description>

      <date>1380991958</date>
      <body>Unions have criticised government moves to halt a 1% pay rise for all NHS staff in England.The Department of Health said the increase was unaffordable alongside the current system which sees many staff automatically receive incremental annual rises.It has urged the NHS pay review body to withhold the rise for 1.3m staff.Rachael Maskell, of the Unite trade union, said staff deserved the pay reward for "holding the NHS together".Health trusts are currently under pressure to make savings and the NHS wage bill accounts for around 40% of its budget.All public sector pay increases are capped at 1%.The Department of Health (DoH) proposes using the funding intended for the rise to "modernise" pay structures.It says automatic increments - linked to length of service and satisfactory performance - add £900m to salary costs.The DoH has stressed no decisions on changes to pay have been taken, insisting independent bodies will make their recommendations in February or March next year.But the plans, outlined in the DoH's submission to two independent pay review bodies, have been criticised by Unite and Labour.Ms Maskell, of Unite, said: "The Department of Health have got other choices. They're entering into a reorganisation which is costing £3bn, which nobody asked for and isn't adding anything to patient care."It is about choices and the NHS staff have already had two years of a pay freeze - 1% last year - and, quite frankly, are really falling behind inflation now with their wages."Staff moraleShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme motivation and morale was down among frontline health workers "at this very difficult time".However, in its submission the DoH points to a staff survey suggesting high levels of motivation and morale and says there should only be basic pay increases if there is "strong evidence" recruitment, retention, morale or motivation issues require this.Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the NHS reorganisation had taken money out of front-line services."There has to be pay restraint in the NHS as well as other public services... but the NHS has been through some very difficult years - so have NHS staff - and this was a modest increase to recognise the pressure that all families are under."To take it away, to break that promise, is just another kick in the teeth."Staff representatives have also reacted angrily to the plans."What they have done is inflammatory," said Christina McAnea, head of health at Unison and joint chairwoman of the NHS Staff Council."We are not going to negotiate while a gun is held to our head for a paltry 1% pay rise - our members will not react well to that."Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association council said this would not result in staff leaving in their "droves".However he added: "We're going to find it increasingly hard to recruit, partly for the specialist skills and partly for the numbers of staff that we'd need to bring into the health service to implement the safe minimum staffing levels."Health minister Anna Soubry defended the government 's stance telling the BBC: "This is about making sure we pay our NHS staff well and we reward their improvement in skills."This system works in other public sectors and the private sector. People want to make sure that they are getting good quality, first class services especially at a time when the NHS faces challenges."Earlier a DoH spokeswoman said: "Many NHS staff have continued to receive pay rises of up to 3.5% and we want to keep working with the trade unions and employers on affordable pay."The measures we are proposing will help increase quality for patients and help us realise our vision of an affordable seven-day service."In June Chancellor George Osborne said ministers were working to "remove automatic pay rises" for teachers, health professionals, prison and police staff.The DoH drew attention to Mr Osborne's comments and confirmed it wanted NHS pay to have "stronger links to performance, quality and productivity".</body>

      <title>MoD to examine US base attack report</title>
      <description>The Ministry of Defence is to examine a US review into a Taliban attack on Camp Bastion in Afghanistan which criticised Britain for the way it handled security.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24415371</url>
      <date>1380997926</date>
      <body>The Ministry of Defence is to examine a US review into a Taliban attack on Camp Bastion in Afghanistan which criticises the British military for the way it handled security at the base.Two US marines were killed and over $200m (£124m) worth of aircraft destroyed in the September 2012 attack.This week, two US generals were forced to retire after an investigation.The MoD said it would "consider" the US findings to confirm its own assessment that no further UK action was required.The UK's own inquiry into the attack has not been released.But the US investigation was partially declassified and has been published online.It looks into the actions of US personnel but points out security was the responsibility of British officers.Up to 28,000 troops and contractors worked at Camp Bastion at the time of the attack, but the US investigation found only half of the guard towers on Camp Bastion were manned, including including the one closest to the breach.A similar proportion at the US Marines' Camp Leatherneck section were also left unguarded.A concertina wire, a ditch, obstacle and a 30ft (10m) high boundary chain link fence were in place around Camp Bastion.One of the US generals who was forced to retire, Major General Gregg Sturdevant, said in his statement that his impression had been that some of the enhanced security which commanders had asked for had been refused on cost grounds both in the UK and US.In a statement to investigators, he said it was only after the attack that he found out there were unmanned towers at the base, because he said the "information flow was slow and the Brits were embarrassed".He added that after the attack, "the Brits desperately wanted" to continue to be in charge of security, "but I told them that we were no longer willing to accept not being in charge of overall security. The attack definitely changed the environment. They knew that they had screwed up".The conclusion of the American investigation was that, while the US commanders had correctly delegated their responsibilities, in the end, they alone were accountable.But an MoD spokesman pointed out that the US review found a separate internal perimeter fence would likely not have presented "any serious challenge, barrier or impediment to the enemy" on the day of the attack.He added: "Force protection measures at Camp Bastion have been reviewed and are appropriate to current threat levels."The insurgents were repelled by US Marines and Royal Air Force Regiment personnel whose courageous actions prevented greater loss of life and equipment."While the US review was intended to examine US actions only and not those of coalition forces, the UK will consider its findings in detail to confirm our earlier assessment that no further UK action is required."</body>

      <body>Prince Harry has begun his first official trip to Australia by joining centenary celebrations to mark its navy's arrival at Sydney Harbour.He was greeted by huge crowds as he embarked on survey ship HMAS Leeuwin at the city's Garden Island naval base, before inspecting the flotilla.The International Fleet Review involves some 40 warships from 17 countries.The event is the only scheduled public appearance for the prince, who is representing the Queen.A 100-gun salute marked the start of the celebrations, and Prince Harry was joined by Australia's Governor-General Quentin Bryce on board the Leeuwin to officially review the fleet.Some 16 tall ships and 8,000 sailors from around the world have been taking part in the event, with warships from countries including the US, China, France and India. Britain sent one of its largest ships, the Type 45 destroyer HMS Daring, to represent the Royal Navy.An estimated 1.4 million spectators were expected to line the banks of Sydney harbour for the celebrations, which finished with a light show and display involving 7.7 tonnes of fireworks.After the fleet review, Prince Harry posed for photographs with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, his wife Margie, and two of their three daughters, Frances and Bridget.The prince changed from his white army dress uniform to a grey suit and blue tie to meet the public and there were shouts of "give us a wave Harry" from the crowd.One spectator, Sinead Kirrane, 23, originally from Ireland, said: "He (Prince Harry) seems fun, I'm a big fan."We are excited to see him and maybe get a smile from him."Giving a speech to an audience that included disabled war veterans, Paralympians and young entrepreneurs, Mr Abbott broached Australian republicanism and said: "Prince Harry, I regret to say not every Australian is a monarchist."But today everyone feels like a monarchist today."You grace us as your family has graced our nation from its beginning, as the Crown is a symbol of our stability, continuity and decency in public life."The prince, whose short Australian tour features a one-day trip to Sydney ahead of a brief visit to the Western Australia capital of Perth on Sunday, is not the only British Harry causing excitement in the country.Singer Harry Styles is currently in Sydney with his band, One Direction.After he leaves Australia, Prince Harry will head to Dubai to attend a fundraising event for the aids charity, Sentebale.</body>

      <body>A hospital worker has been arrested on suspicion of murder by officers investigating the death of a patient at a Norfolk hospital.James May, 76, from Great Yarmouth, died at the James Paget University Hospital in Gorleston, on 20 September.Ten days later, the hospital reported an allegation of medical malpractice in connection with his death.A middle-aged member of the hospital's medical staff has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is in custody.Det Ch Insp Paul Durham, from the Norfolk and Suffolk Major Investigation Team, said: "We are investigating an allegation that a drugs overdose was administered to a patient, leading to his death."A Home Office post-mortem, carried out earlier this week, determined the cause of Mr May's death as heart failure and we now await the results of further toxicology tests which will help inform our inquiry."In a statement, the hospital said: "The James Paget University Hospital has called in the police following the suspicious death of a 76-year-old man."This follows an allegation of medical malpractice made by a member of staff after the patient's death. This matter was investigated internally and subsequently referred to the police."Christine Allen, the hospital's chief executive, said: "Our priority is patient safety and we understand that this news will cause concern."At this time, we believe it is an isolated incident and relates to the alleged action of a single member of staff."The member of staff against whom the allegation has been made is absent from the trust and will not return until the investigation is completed."She added: "Our thoughts are with the family of this patient at what is a very difficult time."</body>

      <title>Legal aid protests held in England</title>
      <description>Hundreds of demonstrators hold events across England in opposition to the government's proposed changes to the legal aid system.</description>

      <date>1380986507</date>
      <body>Demonstrators have staged events across England in opposition to planned changes to legal aid.Campaign group UK Uncut said hundreds had protested in town and cities such as London, Manchester and Northampton.It said plans aimed at saving £220m from the criminal legal aid bill in England and Wales would "block access to justice for millions of people".The Ministry of Justice says legal aid costs too much and can not be "immune" to efficiency commitments.Proposals for possible savings include stopping defendants with a disposable income of more than £37,500 from automatically receiving legal aid, and curbing prisoners' right to legal aid.Legal aid costs taxpayers about £2bn every year, with criminal defence making up more than half of the expenditure.The government says the situation is unsustainable and wants to see fewer, bigger organisations providing legal aid as part of a streamlined system.However, the Bar Council has argued this would result in the end of the long-standing right of a defendant to choose a legal aid solicitor, saying people would effectively be allocated a representative on the basis of cost.Some groups have also expressed fears that the changes could deny justice to the poorest in society.UK Uncut said protests had taken place in London, Manchester, Hull, Liverpool, Northampton, Cambridge and Norwich on Saturday.In London, demonstrators gathered on the Strand at about 12:00 BST to set up a roadblock.Many protesters sat on the road and others put their bicycles in the way of traffic.The area was reopened around two hours later when the demonstration was contained in a smaller area.Protesters also held a mock trial for Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, and attached a banner to the fence of the court building which warned: "No justice, no peace."The Metropolitan Police did not comment when asked about the number of protesters.But the City of London Police said it had warned the group they were stopping the emergency services from travelling around the capital.UK Uncut said roadblocks had also been set up in Manchester, Northampton and Cambridge.Spokesman David Conway said: "The government's plans will block access to justice for millions of people."We're blocking roads to make a stand against that and to make it clear how strongly people around the country oppose these outrageous plans."People will have to represent themselves in court and get compensation much later than they should."An MoJ spokesman said: "We have one of the best legal professions in the world, but cannot close our eyes to the fact that - at around £2bn - legal aid is costing too much."He said the government's planned reforms would create a sustainable legal aid system that would "still be one of the most generous in the world".The spokesman added: "At a time when major financial challenges are being felt by businesses and households across the country, the legal sector cannot be immune from the government's commitment to getting better value for every penny of taxpayers' money we spend."Plans to remove the right for defendants in criminal cases in England and Wales to choose their solicitor under the legal aid system were scrapped in July.The government had planned to put the onus on lawyers competing for contracts, but has said it now recognises that choice is seen as "fundamental".Send your pictures and videos to yourpics@bbc.co.uk or text them to 61124 (UK) or +44 7624 800 100 (International).

      <title>Clegg backs gender pay gap openness</title>
      <description>Women should "feel free" to ask their employers how much they earn in comparison to their male colleagues, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg says.</description>

      <body>Women should "feel free" to ask their employers how much they earn in comparison to their male colleagues, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg says.Mr Clegg told Elle UK Magazine he supported its campaign for more openness on the matter of equal pay.Women and Equalities Minister Jo Swinson also called on women to "confront" the issue.Firms have been warned they could be forced by law to reveal pay differences if voluntary measures to be open fail.The government's Think, Act, Report scheme encourages companies to publish as much information on pay as possible.Both Mr Clegg and Ms Swinson have spoken out in support of the Make Them Pay campaign - a joint project supported by Elle, The Feminist Times and advertising agency, Mother London.The project urges women to ask men about their salaries to ensure they are not being paid less to do the same job.In his interview, Mr Clegg told the magazine: "Women should feel free to ask male colleagues how much they earn in the same jobs and I'm sure most men would want to help."This is a simple step which could have a big impact. But the gender pay gap is a stubborn problem."The Liberal Democrat leader said men also needed to do more of the "heavy lifting" in childcare, so women were not forced to put their careers on hold.The government has not enacted plans, inherited from Labour, to make pay audits mandatory.However, it has given employment tribunals the power to force employers that break equal pay laws to carry out reviews.In a separate interview with Elle, Miss Swinson said the British reluctance to talk about money "holds women back".While being open about salaries could be uncomfortable, it could also be the "catalyst" for female workers to seek pay rises, she suggested."I would agree that while the pay gap is reducing a bit, it's not reducing enough," she said."We're 40 years on from the initial legislation to say that men and women ought to be paid equally."I think we need to recognise the government does have the power to impose equal pay audits, and it may well be that if we do not see success through Think, Act, Report, that might be the only way to make this happen."</body>

      <body>Actor Jude Law and musician Damon Albarn have joined hundreds demonstrating in London over piracy charges brought by Russia against 30 Greenpeace activists.Six Britons were among those arrested last month as they protested against oil drilling in the Arctic at a rig owned by Russian firm, Gazprom.Relatives of the activists protested outside Russia's London embassy.It was one of a number of events being held in more than 40 countries.The entire crew of the ship, Arctic Sunrise, was arrested on 18 September after two activists tried to board the Russian state-controlled oil platform in the Pechora Sea.They have all been charged and are being held in the port of Murmansk, in northwest Russia, facing prison terms of up to 15 years.The Britons who have been charged include freelance video producer, Kieron Bryan, and logistics co-ordinator, Frank Hewetson - both from London.UK activists Anthony Perrett from Newport in Wales; Alexandra Harris, originally from Devon; Philip Ball from Chipping Norton; and Iain Rogers, from Exeter, have also been charged.In London, Saturday's protesters stood behind banners declaring, "Free the Climate Defenders", "Journalist and Not Pirate", and "Free The Arctic 30".Law, who knows Mr Hewetson, said he was "exercising my right to peacefully protest".He added: "I am just adding my face and body to the mass of support. What is ludicrous is that they have been charged with piracy."Actors Imelda Staunton and Jim Carter also turned up in front of the embassy in west London to show their support for the activists.Carter described the arrests as "a ludicrous situation" and urged Prime Minister David Cameron - along with the leaders of the other 18 countries which made up the nationalities of the 30 activists - to apply pressure on Russia.Foreign Secretary William Hague has raised the case with his Russian counterpart and said British officials would continue to raise specific concerns Greenpeace had about the legal process with Moscow.The Netherlands has also launched legal action to free the activists. Two of its citizens are among those charged, along with people from countries including Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, Russia, and the US.Other Greenpeace protests took place in cities including Madrid, Moscow, Mexico City, Sao Paulo and Istanbul.</body>

      <title>Courts 'failing child abuse victims'</title>
      <description>Some sexual abuse cases are collapsing because children are being denied the support they need to give evidence against abusers, the NSPCC warns.</description>

      <date>1380967927</date>
      <body>Some sexual abuse cases are collapsing because children are being denied the support they need to give evidence in court, the NSPCC has warned.It said fewer than 25% of 23,000 child sex offences recorded in England and Wales last year ended in prosecution.The charity said all children who testify should have access to a registered intermediary who can help them with hostile questions.New guidelines on child sex abuse cases are due out later this month.Ministers say measures to help vulnerable witnesses are already available, but they acknowledge that more needs to be done.Research carried out by the NSPCC indicated that more than 50% of child witnesses experienced symptoms of stress such as difficulty sleeping and eating, depression, panic attacks and self-harm in the lead-up to a trial.The charity found at least half were unable to understand some of the questions they were asked in court.However, it said just 2% of all children giving evidence in criminal court cases received guidance from registered advisors to help them understand criminal proceedings and legal language.Last year, the charity's ChildLine service conducted more than 1,000 counselling sessions with children worried about attending court.Peter Wanless, chief executive of the NSPCC, said: "These children have to publicly relive the most traumatic, upsetting and humiliating experience of their lives in order to try and get justice."A victim of child sex abuse is usually the sole witness to the crime and the strength of the case lies in their testimony."He added: "It is vital that children are supported by a registered intermediary when they are interviewed by the police and if they give evidence in a trial. Justice can only be served if they are able to give their best evidence."Lisa McCrindle, senior policy analyst for the NSPCC, said intermediaries needed to be brought in to show courts how much children were "struggling"."Barristers interview witnesses in quite an aggressive manner," she said. "The courts are concentrating on the point of law, which is correct, but it means there is often little or no communication between the courts and the child."But she said that she was "hopeful" that new Crown Prosecution Service guidelines on prosecuting child sexual abuse cases, which are due out later this month, would work on prioritising children as "credible witnesses" and bringing about successful prosecutions.Professor Penny Cooper, chair of the Advocates Gateway, which provides guidance on vulnerable witnesses and defendants, said intermediaries were a "vital resource" for helping people communicate with children in court.She said: "If you take a witness who's three or four years old... the advocates and indeed the judges need specialist advice about how to construct their questions in the right way, how often to give the child a break, that sort of thing."The organisation sited examples of over-complex sentences posed to children, such as: "Where were you born and where do you reside?".It also highlighted the use of idioms and metaphors in court, for example, "that's put it, as it were, into the long grass", and leading questions, such as: "Now, this happened on a Friday, was it not?"Justice Minister Damian Green said everything possible should be done to "support child witnesses to give their best possible evidence to bring offenders to justice".He said: "There are a range of measures available to help reduce the anxiety of attending court, including giving evidence behind a screen or the use of a registered intermediary, which has increased significantly over recent years."We are also trialling pre-recorded evidence for young and vulnerable witnesses."Mr Green said he had ordered an investigation into how best to reduce the distress felt by victims during cross examination "without compromising the fundamental right to a fair trial".</body>

      <body>Language campaigners say they will start a campaign of non-violent direct action unless government policies to protect Welsh are put in place.The motion with a deadline of February 2014 was passed at the Welsh Language Society's (Cymdeithas Yr Iaith's) annual meeting in Carno, Powys.The 2011 census figures showed a drop in the number of Welsh speakers.The Welsh government said it was committed to seeing the language prosper.A Welsh government spokesperson said: "Cymdeithas must understand that those in government are as committed to growing the Welsh language and increasing the number of Welsh speakers as they are."This is not the 1960s or 70s."Welsh Language Society chairman Robin Farrar said: "Nearly a year has passed since we saw the results of the census, and since then there has been a lot of talk and discussion about the situation regarding the language."There is by now a consensus that the Welsh language is facing an emergency and that we need big policy changes."We have said since the publication of the census results that we can't sit back and accept the consequences, with positive campaigning and political will we can change our destiny and the destinies of our Welsh language communities."If the government refuses to act on the six points we have outlined we will take direct but non-violent action."We have drawn up a list of people who are willing to act - campaigns like this have worked in the past and we're ready to do it again."The Welsh government spokesperson added: "We are committed to promoting the Welsh language and since the census results we have been taking action. "He said measures included a national conversation on the language, which gave everyone a chance to have their say on how best to secure its future."We have commissioned a number of reviews and studies, and will be receiving their reports soon. This autumn we will also be launching an information campaign for Welsh medium education."Meanwhile, we will be working with all those with an interest in the language to ensure it continues to thrive throughout Wales."</body>

      <body>The new governor of the Punjab, Mohammad Sarwar, has told the family of an Inverclyde woman that he will do everything possible to have her killers brought to justice.Mumtaz Sattar, 38, from Port Glasgow, was murdered just hours after arriving in Pakistan last month.Her relatives have petitioned the High Court in Lahore, naming a suspect.Her brother Sarfraz Ali and family solicitor Aamer Anwar met Mr Sarwar in Glasgow on Saturday.Mr Sarwar, who became Britain's first Muslim MP in 1997 when he won the Glasgow Govan seat, renounced his British citizenship in August ahead of his inauguration as governor of Pakistan's most populous province.Speaking after the meeting, he told BBC Scotland he had been in contact with the Punjab police almost every day since Mrs Sattar's murder, and had told them he wanted the case investigated by senior officers.He added: "I want to assure the family and the people of Scotland that justice will be done."Senior police officials are doing the investigations on the case and I have confidence in our police force in Punjab and the legal system that they will do their best to make sure that the person who has committed this heinous crime is brought to justice."Mr Anwar said the meeting with Mr Sarwar had been "extremely valuable".He added: "Mr Sarwar arranged a conference call with senior police officers and formal requests have now been made for the police to co-operate with Police Scotland and with ourselves in order that this murder inquiry can be solved."He has been able to cut through the bureaucracy. He has also put the spotlight on this case and said that every pressure must be brought to bear in order to bring the killers of Mumtaz Sattar to justice."Mrs Sattar's husband Abdul, 40, is in police custody.He told officers he and his wife were drugged and attacked by two men during a taxi ride on the way from the airport to see his parents in Punjab on Saturday 21 September.He said they were thrown out of a moving car and that his wife died from the head injuries she suffered.Scottish Police are helping Pakistani authorities with their investigation.On Friday, Mr Anwar told BBC Scotland Mrs Sattar's relatives had serious concerns about the Pakistani police investigation into Mrs Sattar's death.He said: "A serious allegation has been made of bribery of police officers that are involved in the case."At each and every turn the family appears to have been obstructed, as a result of which advocates lodged a petition at the High Court in Lahore yesterday in which they name one murder suspect and ask for the authorities to bring the police officers concerned to the High Court to answer questions."</body>

      <body>The Scottish Greens could play a key role in convincing Scots to vote for independence in next year's referendum, the party's conference has been told.Co-convener Patrick Harvie said "canny" voters would not be persuaded into voting Yes next September with "flags, bribes or fearmongering".He said Scots could be won over with a "radical vision" of what the country could be like after leaving the UK.Mr Harvie was speaking as the two-day conference opened in Inverness.The people of Scotland will be asked the straight yes/no question "Should Scotland be an independent country?" when they vote in the independence referendum on 18 September 2014.At last year's conference members voted to endorse the cross-party Yes Scotland campaign for independence.At the same time the party agreed to form its own pro-independence campaign, designed to promote its distinct policies.Mr Harvie, one of the Greens' two MSPs at Holyrood, said: "Many Scots remain undecided on independence and they have every right to take their time, as creating a new country is undoubtedly a radical step."These canny voters won't be persuaded by flags, bribes or fearmongering but I believe they will respond to a radical vision for a better Scotland and the Scottish Greens are crucial to outlining that vision."Taking responsibility and bringing power closer to the people is a core Green principle, and our conference is a chance for us to galvanise our party and amplify our message."He added: "This is a big decision about Scotland's long-term future."As Greens we're used to thinking big and it's in our DNA to think ahead, so let's seize the day."Mr Harvie argued that at this time the "Green vision for Scotland has never been more important", adding that his party offered "the vision of a renewed economy that works for the many rather than the few and a sustainable society that cares about future generations".He said: "The clock is ticking on the need to tackle climate change and a Green Scotland would be better placed to develop the low-carbon society we need."</body>

      <description>Manchester City come from a goal down to end Everton's unbeaten Premier League start in a gripping game.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24350210</url>
      <date>1380981807</date>
      <body>Manchester City ended Everton's unbeaten Premier League start with a stylish attacking victory that was the ideal response to the Champions League humbling against Bayern Munich.Everton led a gripping match when Romelu Lukaku slipped the ball past under-pressure City keeper Joe Hart.But Alvaro Negredo equalised with a cool finish from Yaya Toure's pass.Sergio Aguero's low strike made it 2-1 and his penalty, which went in off Tim Howard's head, sealed the win.The spot-kick, awarded after Seamus Coleman tangled with Pablo Zabaleta but hotly disputed by the visitors, was credited as an own goal to the unfortunate Howard as the ball hit the diving goalkeeper and crossed the line after it hit the post.It helped ensure City's fourth consecutive home league win, and the victory was a much-needed boost after the painful 3-1 defeat by Bayern on Wednesday and last week's shock league loss against Aston Villa.But, as impressive as they were in attack, the defensive display in a thrillingly open first half will once again be questioned.Vincent Kompany was the only player to keep his place in the starting back four from Wednesday and they also lost their inspirational captain to what looked like a leg muscle injury after 33 minutes.Everton had already looked a threat before then with the ever-impressive Ross Barkley, Steven Naismith and James McCarthy having the better of the midfield battle.But it was the pace, power and direct running of Lukaku that was the focal point for their attacks.England keeper Hart - so heavily criticised for his recent performances - did well to prevent Lukaku giving the visitors the lead with an early chance, but he was then beaten by the Belgian when the on-loan Chelsea striker nipped past Joleon Lescott and curled the ball home.Hart got a strong touch but concerns over his attempt were soon forgotten as the home side levelled within 60 seconds.Toure played a delightful pass behind Coleman and Negredo slipped the ball home via a big deflection off the scrambling figure of Howard.Gareth Barry's absence had deprived Everton of their defensive shield and City began to exploit it ruthlessly.A superb quick free-kick involving Toure and a beautiful first-time pass from David Silva should have seen City go ahead soon after, but Aguero placed his effort narrowly wide of the far post.Argentine striker Aguero then made a mess of a great opportunity to get through one-on-one with Howard when he hopelessly miscontrolled a simple pass.However, after the hugely impressive Lukaku had a strong shout for a penalty ignored, Aguero made amends by giving City the lead with seconds of the first half remaining.The excellent Silva, who was making his first league start since August, slid a perfectly weighted pass down the right-hand side of the box and Aguero struck a first-time shot across Howard and into the net.Everton were unlucky to be trailing at the interval but that goal changed the complexion of the match and City's defensive display improved considerably.The visitors would have gone up to second in the table with a win but barely threatened and it was the hosts who posed the far greater threat.Howard's own goal from Aguero's low penalty gave them breathing space and they could have added to their margin of victory had the keeper not made fine saves from Negredo and Samir Nasri during a relatively incident-free second period.Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini"I am very pleased by the character the team showed today. We really needed this victory because at the start of the game we five points behind Arsenal and it is important to continue wining here at home."Equalising immediately was important but more important was the character, playing against Everton - the only unbeaten team in the league."After a defeat on Wednesday it was important for me to see how the players reacted after that defeat."I don't think the score of this game was for a penalty kick or not a penalty kick. We had at least four or five clear chances to score and I don't remember Everton having too many chances to score, so I don't think the difference between the two teams was the penalty."Everton manager Roberto Martinez"We made it a really open game and to score the first goal was important. Then you have to be very superior when the calls are not going for you. Unfortunately, on the day, we didn't have that luck that we needed."I thought the penalty awarded is a football disaster. Jon Moss [referee] needs to watch it again and see why he gave it. Contact doesn't mean a penalty. If you are going to give a penalty for that it is going to make the game very difficult."Romelu's is more of a penalty."</body>

      <body>Great Britain's Max Whitlock had to settle for a silver medal in the men's pommel horse World Championships final.Whitlock - a double Olympic bronze medallist in 2012 - saw his score of 15.633 beaten by the 15.833 of Japan's Kohei Kameyama in Antwerp.The 20-year-old from Hemel Hempstead was looking to become Britain's first male gymnastics world champion.He told BBC Sport: "I am really happy with that, my routine was a big risk but to come out with a medal is good."Dan Purvis, the 2010 world bronze medallist in the floor event, narrowly missed repeating the feat as he came fourth.Japan's Kenzo Shirai, 17, became the first athlete to perform a quadruple twist at a major event as he won gold.Shirai's full routine included some two dozen twists. He kept the groundbreaking quadruple for last to score 16.000 for victory.Fellow countryman Kohei Uchimura, the all-around champion, took bronze with 15.500 behind American Jacob Dalton (15.600), while Purvis scored 15.400.The 22-year-old from Liverpool said: "Going into it I just wanted to enjoy it and then, as it progressed, I thought, 'I can get quite close here'."I've been strong all week and I'm really satisfied and proud of my World Championships."Whitlock had only tried his upgraded pommel-horse routine in competition once before - during Thursday's all-around final - and was relieved to come through it without falling."There were bits in the routine where I thought I could have fallen off but overall I am happy," he said."It was a little bit scruffy and there's room for improvement but I really can't complain with a World Championships silver medal to cap a great year for me."Kameyama, who had been seventh in qualifying, was the surprise winner of a final which took place without world and Olympic champion Krisztian Berki, who had fallen from the apparatus in qualifying. GB's European champion Daniel Keatings also suffered the same fate.Whitlock's score left him tied with Mexico's Daniel Corral Barron for second place with no bronze medal awarded, unlike the Olympics, where the rules dictate a gymnast's execution score must be used as a tie-breaker.China's Huang Huidan won an uneven bars final which featured only two of the London 2012 Olympic line-up, while Britain's Ruby Harrold and Rebecca Downie finished seventh and eighth respectively.Huang's 15.400 took her past all-around silver medallist Kyla Ross of the United States. Harrold scored 14.333 and Downie a frustrating 13.800, falling in the final stages of what had otherwise been an exceptional routine.Olympic silver medallist McKayla Maroney successfully defended her vault world title with a score of 15.724, edging out American compatriot and all-around champion Simone Biles (15.595).And Olympic rings champion Arthur Zanetti, of Brazil, won his first world title on the apparatus with a score of 15.800, ahead of Russia's Aleksandr Balandin.Kristian Thomas will be the final Briton to compete in the event when he takes part in Sunday's vault final.The men's parallel bars and high bar titles will also be decided, alongside the women's beam and floor competitions.</body>

      <title>Why is a children's book about rabbits being read at weddings?</title>
      <description>More and more people are including children's books in their wedding readings. Why?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24379830</url>
      <date>1380845753</date>
      <body>More and more people are including children's books in their wedding readings. Why?When Hannah Larkin married her husband Jason, she had three readings, but one stood out - a reading from Guess How Much I Love You by Sam McBratney.In her late teens, Larkin had fallen in love with the story of Big Nutbrown Hare and Little Nutbrown Hare and their attempt to articulate their love. It remained one of her favourite books.Said hares try to outdo each other in their hyperbolic declarations of love for each other.A sample section runs: '"I love you all the way down the lane as far as the river," cried Little Nutbrown Hare. "I love you across the river and over the hills," said Big Nutbrown Hare.'It might seem saccharine stuff to a hardened cynic but many brides and grooms seem to feel differently."Although it's a children's book, it resonates with adult life because it's about the infinite nature of genuine love," says Larkin. At the wedding at a hotel in the New Forest, her sister read the entire book. Her husband's goddaughter Amelia looked up at her, mesmerised by the story.The "classic" Christian wedding reading is 1 Corinthians 13, with its ruminations on faith, hope and love (or charity), but modern couples are varying their readings, says Bernadette Chapman, director of the UK Alliance of Wedding Planners."That's the big thing with weddings now... it's about [the couple's] personalities," says Chapman. Children's literature has become so popular because it's inter-generational and everyone can relate to it."They're trying to choose readings that are easy to understand, that are fun to read and fun to listen to and just bring a smile to people's faces."Chapman says readings from children's books have become popular among remarrying couples who want to give children from previous relationships a key role by reading from a favourite story.One of the most popular readings is taken from The Velveteen Rabbit by Margery Williams. It tells the tale of a small stuffed rabbit and its longing to become real through the love of a human.When actress Drew Barrymore married Will Kopelman in 2012, Kopelman's sister read a passage from the book. Prince William and Prince Harry read alternate lines from it at the wedding of Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall.The growing popularity of wedding blogs has prompted more creativity in the choice of reading, Chapman says.But why does children's literature continue to have such resonance? Prof Maria Nikolajeva, director of the University of Cambridge-Homerton Research and Teaching Centre for Children's Literature, says that children's books give us a shared experience.Nikolajeva's daughter had a reading from The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery at her wedding and Nikolajeva read from The Velveteen Rabbit during the ceremony.She says children's books are adept at expressing profound thoughts and philosophy about life in a very concise manner, which makes them ideal for wedding readings.Books like The Velveteen Rabbit take on existential questions, such as what it means to be a human being, in a way that we can connect with."As we grow up we are exploring the world and we very often explore the world through the characters of literature because it offers us an experience that we cannot always find in the everyday world," says Nikolajeva.She says children love to revisit books as they grow older because as they change, they "interact with the text each time, understanding it more and getting involved with it more".Children's books can be harder to write than longer form fiction, the theory goes, because an author has to articulate a concept in a way that can be reinterpreted as we develop.Even as adults, we can find new meaning in children's literature.When Andrea Dell married her husband Robert at a hotel in Wigan, she opted for a reading from The Owl and the Pussycat by Edward Lear, a poem she remembered from childhood. For Dell, it took on new meaning with its references to getting married."It was just an opportunity to make everybody smile and something that was familiar to them and also was quite evocative with the imagery in it, and also I'm a huge cat fan," says Dell.She says it is something they can share with their children in years to come and might even be a reading her daughter chooses for her wedding."People are moving away from the traditional; they like to mix things up a bit. We had some music from Star Wars in our proceedings," says Dell, whose husband is a big Star Wars fan."I think there is so much variety in children's literature. I think people are looking a bit further afield to try and make it a bit more interesting and a bit more unique to them."You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>A lost city captured on film</title>
      <description>Photographer Andrei Pandele captured a dramatic period of change for Romania under communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. For many, his pictures are now a painful reminder of what they lost.</description>

      <date>1380929064</date>
      <body>Andrei Pandele was a young architect when he began photographing his home country, Romania, in the 1970s. His camera captured a period of huge change under communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. For some, his stunning photos are now a painful reminder of a time of destruction, and a life lost."It's cool! I really like it." Born in the year of the 1989 Revolution, Paul is one of a new generation of Romanians - multilingual, well-educated and ambitious for his country.He is understandably proud of the giant House of the People, once Ceausescu's palace. After all, it's now home to Romania's fledgling democracy and only trumped in size by the Pentagon building in the US.We are hovering in one of its many airless, pointlessly large halls, waiting for a conference on sustainable tourism to finish in the never-ending room next door.I don't share Paul's sentiments. The vast slabs of marble feel suffocating - we may as well be stuck in the centre of an outsized wedding cake.Photographer Andrei Pandele is emphatic: "The Palace? Ha! It is a wall in the way of the people. A dam, even."We have met in a tea shop in the old Jewish quarter of Bucharest. There are photographs from his collection on every wall.They're exceptional images rarely caught on camera, but then Andrei is an exceptional man - tall, dignified and handsome at 65.It is thanks to his fearless vision that Ceausescu's relentless attack on Bucharest can be seen stage by stage - as if peeling away the layers of an onion."I was an architect," he explains. "I could find plans [and] approximate what they would destroy. Not exactly, no-one knew that. They were wild, totally out of control."Seven square kilometres of the city centre were destroyed to make way for the Palace of the People. Andrei wanted to take some pictures before old Bucharest disappeared altogether.I've been coming to Romania for 20 years but I have never seen images like these.A city caught in its very own Armageddon. Andrei preserved a Bucharest that no longer exists - the exquisite glass-covered market, the archways, cobbled streets, the vine-clad villas, the city once called the "little Paris of the East".But in many of the pictures the mighty onslaught has already begun - innumerable cranes chewing their way through people's lives, the facade of the crazy palace looming up over the threatened cityscape. And then, in some others, there's just snow or dust and the desert of demolition.Not a verbose man, in front of his pictures, Andrei becomes almost chatty."After two years of photographing the architectural destruction I decided that it was very bad, but it was even worse that they were ruining the lives of 22 million people. So I began to take pictures of everyday life. I think they are much more striking."The next series of photographs showing everyday life under Ceausescu is like a haunting silent movie. We see desolate streets when there was no petrol, queues for food that never came, trams straddled by desperate commuters, useless cars buried under snow and a wedding party picking their way through the streets. No-one is smiling.I can't decide which is more astonishing - the photographs or the photographer? How did he get away with taking pictures which so openly "denigrated the socialist reality", a crime that carried a six-year prison sentence in communist Romania?Andrei explains that he was a part-time sports photographer, so he had a state-sanctioned excuse to carry a camera.And he tells me I must understand the strange psychology of the state policemen: "Tessa, they are very aggressive with those who are afraid, but much less aggressive with people who are not at all afraid. I was confident. Don't hide if you don't want to get caught."Andrei's brazen behaviour captured a vital slice of Romania's painful past.Yet it took a full 18 years before he could show his photographs to an astonished Romanian public.The people in power did not want to be reminded of what they had got so wrong. He had to wait.Andrei shrugs: "I have seen women over 40 exploding in tears in front of my photographs, because they saw their life had been destroyed, but they realised it 20 years too late. And a lot of teenagers laughed neurotically - because they recognised something in the pictures that their parents had told them, but they had never seen for themselves."My young friend Paul represents the generation that escaped that hell.He's silenced by Andrei - his experience, his audacity, his pictures.Later, as we walk back through the centre of Bucharest, taking in its schizophrenic appearance with fresh eyes, Paul quietly concedes: 'It is a pity Ceausescu had to build the palace complex right in the middle of the old city."From Our Own Correspondent: Listen online or download the podcast.BBC Radio 4: Saturdays at 11:30 and some Thursdays at 11:00BBC World Service: Short editions Monday-Friday - see World Service programme schedule.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>The man who dreamed of the atom bomb</title>
      <description>Lisa Jardine tells the story of Leo Szilard, physicist and key pioneer in the development of the atomic bomb.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24395740</url>
      <date>1380905125</date>
      <body>Leo Szilard was the man who first realised that nuclear power could be used to build a bomb of terrifying proportions. Lisa Jardine considers what his story has to say about the responsibilities of science.The figure of Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard loomed large in our house when I was a child. He was held up to me as an exemplary figure in science - a man who had made fundamental breakthroughs in nuclear physics, but whose acute sense of moral probity led him in the end to denounce the very advances he had helped make. Only later did I learn an alternative version of his story.Almost exactly 80 years ago, in early October 1933, Szilard was in London, in transit from Nazi Germany, when an idea came to him that would lead directly to the ultimate weapon of war - the atomic bomb.An article in the Times two weeks earlier had reported a lecture at the British Association by Lord Rutherford - the Nobel prize-winning British physicist and head of the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. Rutherford had described splitting the atom by bombarding it with protons, but had gone on to say that any suggestion that the energy released might be harnessed as a source of power was "talking moonshine".The report caught Szilard's attention. He pondered it obsessively. Surely Rutherford was wrong? Then, early on a dismal, grey morning, as he waited on foot at a traffic light to cross busy Southampton Row near his hotel, the answer came to him in a flash.If a neutron, fired at an atom, produces the release of (say) two neutrons, each of which hits another atom, which both in turn release two more neutrons, which each go on to collide with two further atoms, a nuclear chain reaction would take place, releasing unimaginable amounts of energy.Szilard tells this story twice, with slightly differing details. But the tale itself is consistent and delightfully vivid. The challenge of Rutherford's remark, the heavy cold that had prevented Szilard's attending the lecture, the days spent thinking about it and the flash of inspiration just as the traffic light changed.Szilard immediately recognised the importance of his idea. To ensure its security he patented it in the name of the British Admiralty. The patent included a clear description of "neutron induced chain reactions to create explosions".In August 1939, by which time Szilard had moved on to America, he wrote to President Franklin Roosevelt to inform him that "a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium" was undoubtedly possible, and could lead to the construction of "extremely powerful bombs of a new type". Germany, he warned, might even now be developing such a weapon. "A single bomb of this type," he wrote, "carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory."The letter was signed by Szilard and Albert Einstein. By the time it reached Roosevelt, Germany had invaded Poland. With war now a certainty, the urgency was not lost on the US president. A committee was set up to pursue the nuclear initiative, out of which emerged what came to be known as the Manhattan Project - the hugely ambitious and massively funded programme to develop a functioning atomic bomb in the shortest possible time.But less than six years later in 1945, Szilard campaigned with equal passion to persuade the American government not to use the atomic bomb against a civilian population. He understood better than anyone the enormity of the devastation such a weapon could cause. But his petition, although signed by a large number of nuclear physicists, never reached the president.So devastated was Szilard at his failure to avert the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (the story I was brought up on concluded) that he refused to do any further work in nuclear physics. Instead he moved research areas entirely, to molecular biology - a field concerned with the origins of life rather than its destruction. To my father this audacious step captured the essence of scientific moral responsibility. And I carried Szilard's story with me as I grew up.Today, however, I know that inspiring as it is, there are problems with this tale. As often happens with history, we have to treat with caution a narrative that fits so neatly the interests and preoccupations of the age in which it is written.At the time I was being told this story, Britain was in the depths of the Cold War. In the post-war years it turned out that Szilard (and indeed my own father) found it impossible to obtain work on any scientific project that involved nuclear physics. Though they were barely aware of the stigma themselves, the communist sympathies of their youth barred them from getting the necessary security clearance.So Szilard did not leave physics of his own accord. At the end of the war he was abruptly dismissed from the Manhattan Project by its military head, Gen Leslie Groves. Groves had always suspected him of having Russian sympathies, and now deemed him too high a security risk. Forced to change field, Szilard was indeed prescient in choosing molecular biology, which less than a decade later would uncover "the secret of life" in the form of the structure of DNA.My father's exemplary tale unravels further when we consider the way it presents the progress towards a functioning atomic bomb. It narrates a smooth development from Rutherford's lecture in London, through Szilard's (and his fellow-emigres') journey from Nazi Germany via London to the United States, and Szilard's single-minded preoccupation with the potential threat of nuclear weapons, to the Manhattan Project, and finally to its very American triumphant - or tragic - outcome.But actually Szilard the Hungarian had carried out the crucial early research with the Italian emigre Enrico Fermi, continuing it with him in the early years of the Manhattan Project, where the two of them succeeded in creating a controlled chain reaction - a prerequisite for a functioning bomb. Meanwhile, independently in Britain considerable progress was being made towards a nuclear weapon (a project code-named "Tube Alloys") with the direct encouragement of the prime minister Winston Churchill (who as Graham Farmelo tells us in a recent book, was surprisingly up-to-date himself in nuclear physics). In September 1940 the so-called Tizard mission delivered the top secret work of Tube Alloys to the Americans, to be developed with the greater manpower and financial resources available in the US. The British work made its own vital contribution to the project.Here is a much more fragmented, syncopated and international story, in which it is entirely unclear whether any one nation ultimately takes the credit or blame for the science and engineering behind the atomic bomb. Nor does it carry the clear didactic message of my original.There is one final twist to what started out as a simple story. Some of you will have noticed that I gave the date of Szilard's eureka moment at that traffic light on Southampton Row as October 1933. You may have had a date in September in your mind. The truth is, Szilard tells the story twice, as I mentioned. In one version he records reading the Times report and immediately having the idea of a chain reaction (on 12 September). In the other he recalls fretting over the problem for weeks in his hotel room and pacing the streets of London deep in thought, until the idea eventually came to him (in early October).So although the beginning of the story comes from the mouth of the man himself, we cannot be certain which version is correct. As a historian I have chosen the second as the more plausible, particularly in view of that heavy cold which Szilard tells us prevented his attending Rutherford's lecture on 11 September. But that remains surmise.Historical narratives are never without their agendas. My father's generation lived under the shadow of Hiroshima and Nagasaki - he had been sent to do reconnaissance there only a few months after the bombs were dropped and had seen the consequences all too close up. He told me a story which redeemed the scientist from the enormity of events brought about by fundamental research in physics. It was a story that held the scientist responsible for lethal applications of "pure" research, and proposed Szilard as an iconic figure, for recognising and taking that responsibility upon himself.My father's story of Leo Szilard may not have been the truth. But it taught me, as a child, a lasting, salutary lesson about science and human values.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Rail minister Burns stands down</title>
      <description>Transport Minister Simon Burns resigns from the government to run for the position of deputy Commons Speaker.</description>

      <body>Transport Minister Simon Burns has resigned from the government to run for the position of deputy Commons Speaker.The MP for Chelmsford has been responsible for the controversial HS2 rail link during the past year, having previously been a health minister.One of the three deputy Speaker positions is vacant after previous incumbent Nigel Evans stood down to fight sexual assault charges.Mr Burns has clashed with Speaker John Bercow several times in the past.On one occasion, Mr Burns described the man under whom he now seeks to serve as a "stupid sanctimonious dwarf".BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said the Conservative MP had apologised afterwards - but only to groups of people who felt insulted, not necessarily to the Speaker himself.Were he to be elected, relations between the pair would not be altogether comfortable, our correspondent added.There are plenty of Conservatives who do not support Mr Bercow and might vote for Mr Burns just to irritate him, he continued.MPs are elected to the role of deputy Speaker, under reforms proposed by Mr Bercow shortly after he took on his role in 2009.To stand for election, MPs need to be sponsored by at least six other MPs.One of the other candidates for the role is Nadine Dorries, who in 2009 described the Speaker as "oily" and suggested he was "mistrusted by up to half of the House".Conservative backbenchers Eleanor Laing and Brian Binley have also been named as potential candidates.The successful applicant will join existing deputies, former Labour MPs Dawn Primarolo and Lindsay Hoyle, in helping to chair Commons business.Mr Burns' decision comes ahead of an expected reshuffle of middle-ranking Conservative ministerial ranks in coming weeks.In his resignation letter to Prime Minister David Cameron, he wrote: "It has been a privilege to serve in your administration for the past three and a quarter years and I will be forever grateful to you for giving me that opportunity in both the Departments of Health and Transport."You can rest assured that I will continue to support your leadership of both the Conservative Party and the government."The PM's response described the MP as a "loyal, dedicated and committed colleague".Mr Cameron said: "I know that this will not have been an easy decision for you to make, and one you will have given a huge amount of thought to."After serving the government so ably for over three years, you will certainly be missed, but I completely understand and respect your decision."</body>

      <title>Child benefit deadline day looms</title>
      <description>A tax boss says nearly 200,000 parents must "get off their backsides" and register with the UK tax authority amid changes to child benefit.</description>

      <body>A tax boss has said nearly 200,000 parents must "get off their backsides" and register with the UK tax authority amid changes to child benefit.Saturday marks the first deadline for better-off families to sign up with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).They will need to register for self-assessment so the HMRC can claw some or all of the benefit back.Families where one parent has a taxable income of more than £50,000 are affected.They will lose some of the benefit, following the introduction of the new rules in January 2013, while child benefit has been withdrawn entirely if one parent earns more than £60,000.Eligible families receive £20.30 per week in child benefit for their first child and £13.40 a week for any further children.The new rules meant that this payment is reduced gradually for families where one parent is earning between £50,000 and £60,000.HMRC has written to people who it believes have a taxable income of more than £50,000 and so need to take some action. Taxable income is earnings from employment, as well as other income such as from savings and shares, but may not include some pension contributions.Lin Homer, HMRC chief executive, told BBC Radio 5 Live: "We think there is about 200,000 people who need to get off their backsides and do something."Some 350,000 people have opted out of receiving child benefit altogether, generally because they earn and will continue to earn a taxable income of more than £60,000 and therefore would not be entitled to the payment.HMRC says another 425,000 people were already in self-assessment, some 140,000 people have registered for self-assessment, and another 185,000 people have still to register.In theory, the deadline to register and avoid a possible penalty is 5 October. The penalty would be between 10% and 100% of the child benefit paid.However, HMRC says it is unlikely that anyone who registers and pays the tax by 31 January would be penalised."HMRC is committed to helping people pay the right amount of tax and urges parents who have been affected by the changes to child benefit to register for self-assessment," said Ms Homer."We know that lots of people leave it until the last minute."Anita Monteith, of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, said: "This adds considerable complication to the tax system for ordinary people, particularly for those brought into the self-assessment system for the first time."I would urge those affected to register for self-assessment as soon as they can."</body>

      <title>Mail's position unravelling - Labour</title>
      <description>Labour says the Daily Mail's stance is unravelling after a senior journalist said an article about Ed Miliband's father was "wrongly labelled".</description>

      <date>1380915514</date>
      <body>Labour has said the Daily Mail's stance is unravelling after a top journalist said an article about Ed Miliband's father was "wrongly labelled".Alex Brummer, the Mail's City editor, told Channel 4 News it should have been made clearer it was a comment article.The paper has refused to apologise for a piece calling Marxist academic Ralph Miliband "The man who hated Britain" - and said its position had not changed.A Labour spokesman said the Daily Mail's defence was "crumbling".Mr Brummer's comments are the first time anyone from the Mail has suggested there might be a problem with the article.He said: "Sometimes articles which are comment should be labelled and made clear that they are comment."So perhaps it should have said 'comment' on it to make clear absolutely it was comment instead of a special report."But I think people understood that it wasn't just reporting; there was an element of commentary to it. Just maybe the labelling wasn't quite what it should have been."Labour said it showed that the Mail's strategy was unravelling piece by piece."Six days on from their original article, the Daily Mail's defence is crumbling," said the spokesman."For the first time, they have been forced to admit significant problems in the way they dealt with the article 'The man who hated Britain'."They should now finally have the good grace and decency to acknowledge their grotesque error of judgment and apologise."Earlier Mr Brummer told the BBC the Daily Mail would not say sorry to the Labour leader - and said the paper was owed an apology over claims that its Ralph Miliband articles were motivated by anti-Semitism.Mr Miliband sought to distance himself from the anti-Semitism claims.But he renewed his demand for the paper's owner Lord Rothermere to investigate its culture and practices.Lord Rothermere has apologised to Mr Miliband for a Mail on Sunday reporter intruding on a family memorial service.But he stopped short of saying sorry for the Ralph Miliband article or agreeing to a wider inquiry into the way his newspapers operate.Appearing on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Brummer strongly defended the Daily Mail's original article which questioned how far Ralph Miliband's left-wing views had influenced his son.He said: "I don't think we need to apologise for anything. This was a piece which examined somebody's views very carefully."He hit out at suggestions from the Jewish Chronicle, some Labour figures and others that there may have been "a whiff of anti-Semitism" about the coverage."I think there are people out there who need to apologise to us because there have been vicious accusations in the last couple of days, from (former Labour leader) Neil Kinnock among others, that somehow this was an anti-Semitic attack," he said.Mr Miliband told BBC Radio 5Live he was not suggesting the paper was anti-Semitic."I'm always incredibly careful about throwing around the idea that the paper or somebody is anti-Semitic or racist unless there is real evidence for that," he said."I don't believe that of the Mail; that's not been my issue."He said that while the newspaper was entitled to hold him to account for his views, the way it had attacked his father was unacceptable."They'll criticise me, they'll say my policies are wrong, that's absolutely fine. But when it comes to my dad, and saying my dad hated Britain, I'm afraid they're crossing a line," he said."In all of this, they've never apologised for the fact they said my dad hated Britain - an idea without any foundation."While acknowledging the Daily Mail - which has a circulation of more than 1.8 million - was a "popular" newspaper, he suggested many of its readers agreed with him that it had "overstepped the mark".Mail on Sunday editor Geordie Greig said a reporter had been sent to a memorial service for Mr Miliband's uncle without his knowledge and an investigation was being held into "a decision which was wrong".Mr Miliband told 5Live he had met the Daily Mail's editor Paul Dacre "two or three times" since becoming Labour leader.Mr Brummer defended the Mail's journalistic methods, saying it was "extraordinarily careful" about how it pursued a story.He said: "I hear the editor, I hear the deputy editor almost every day saying to reporters, saying to editors of their sections 'be careful how you go about getting a particular story'."That's a practice which goes to the core of the paper, and I do think there are some good ethical roots in the paper and this is the exception rather than the rule."The row comes ahead of a crucial meeting of MPs next Wednesday on press regulation.They will consider rival proposals for a new regulator to replace the Press Complaints Commission.Mr Miliband, along with the three main political parties and press intrusion victims campaign group Hacked Off, supports a form of press regulation backed by royal charter.The newspaper industry, among them the country's largest newspaper groups, including Mail publisher DMG Media, News UK, owner of the Sun and the Times, Telegraph Media Group and Trinity Mirror, have put forward a rival plan rejecting "state-sponsored regulation".A member of Lord Justice Leveson's inquiry team into press practices expressed concern that Mr Miliband's row with the Mail could be used as "a cudgel to try to beat the press" and push through tighter regulation.Former Daily Telegraph political editor George Jones said: "We were quite clear in those discussions that we did not want to get into the question of taste, we didn't want to be arbiters of what was in good taste and what was in bad taste."In my view, once you go down that road you do seriously compromise freedom of speech."</body>

      <description>The two-year-old to leave hospital for the first time</description>

      <body>A two-year-old girl born with a condition which means her brain forgets to tell her to breathe is about to leave hospital for the first time.Maisie Harris from Gillingham, Kent has been at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London since being transferred from Medway Maritime at three months old.She has congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), also known as Ondine's Curse.A new, portable ventilator has enabled Maisie to go home.The machine knows when she is able to take her own breaths and when she is likely to have a CCHS episode and require support.It has batteries and a carry case, so Maisie, who is three on 23 October, will be able to go on outings with her family and go to school when she is older.Staff on Great Ormond Street's Miffy Ward held a party for her on Friday, before she leaves hospital on Monday."We cannot wait to bring Maisie home and enjoy being a normal family," said her mother Rachel Bridger, 23."It's felt as though we have been in hospital for a lifetime."Everyone here has become like a second family to us - they know Maisie inside out."She knows her own mind but she is a really happy little girl - she's hardly ever upset."I don't think it will take her long to get used to playing with her toys at home and sleeping in her own bed for the first time."Maisie, who featured in BBC2's Great Ormond Street series last year, also has malacia of the airways, so her airways are floppy like the top of a balloon and do not hold their shape properly.Consultant Colin Wallis said: "We have been working on ways to allow a greater number of long-term ventilated children to go home."The family home is the best place for a young child to grow and develop, and Maisie will now be able to go out and about with her family, make new friends and experience everything the outside world has to offer."Dr Wallis treated Ms Bridger when she was younger. She also has CCHS, although her condition is less complex.She and Maisie's father Andrew Harris, 26, have been trained on how to use her ventilator and will be supported by a team of local carers.</body>

      <title>At school with a guide dog</title>
      <description>How a guide dog at school helped bring one teen out of her shell</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-ouch-24366887</url>
      <date>1380932632</date>
      <body>Three years ago, the Guide Dogs charity changed its rules so children with visual impairments could get assistance dogs. So what do pupils gain from a dog - and can this partnership work in a hectic school environment?Hannah Burgess is 15. She attends Stantonbury Campus in Milton Keynes which, with almost 3,000 students, is the second largest comprehensive school in the UK. She has been taking her guide dog Rory into school since qualifying as a young handler two years ago. Previously she had used a white cane."The first day [with Rory] was quite scary, I didn't know what to expect," she says."I had only been out on training routes with him on streets - I didn't think he'd just flop on the floor and sleep for ages in my classes like he does. His first day at school showed me how good he was going to be."Everyone on campus seems to know Hannah's dog. Two young lads walk past pointedly singing the theme tune to Roary the Racing Car."Now, I don't think he's a racing car, do you?" replies Gerry O'Neill, head of inclusion at the school.Hannah ignores it. "Most people have got over a dog being there now. I get a bit of grief but it's not too bad. Some people start screaming and run away because they think it's funny to. It gets better, then a new lot of year sevens come in September and I get it all over again. But it's OK."Hannah is not completely blind, but has albinism and associated nystagmus, which severely affects her focus. Rory helps locate kerbs, avoid lampposts and Hannah no longer mistakes staircases for slopes with the dog's help. And Rory has stopped her from walking out in front of many cars: "I put full trust in him."But he has also helped her to connect with those around her."I actually have friends now," Hannah laughs. "He's given me confidence to go up and talk to people - he's a great conversation starter."Before Rory I was friendly with people in school but I didn't ever want to go out. I wouldn't go to the cinema with them, for instance. I didn't want to be seen with my cane or holding my mum's arm."At break time, she has special dispensation to remain in one of the halls so Rory doesn't have to go on the noisy and crowded playground.Hannah's friends benefit from having a pal with a dog because they are also allowed to stay indoors at break with her so they can all hang out together, after Rory has been "spent" - guide dog lingo for a toilet stop.But, no matter how well trained, dogs will be dogs."The first day I brought him here he was sick on the floor and my English teacher walked in it," says Hannah. "Also, I took him out to spend, there was fox poo on the floor, and he rolled in it and I had to go back into class with him."Her friends, all present, groaned at the memory. "I think people put up with it quite well actually," says Alice, also 15.O'Neill says he's never heard anybody say the dog shouldn't be at school but has helped advise on issues of safety. Rory doesn't attend science lessons, food practicals or PE lessons because they would give him "unfair distractions"."Most teachers are excited by the idea of a dog in class," says O'Neill. "There's a feeling that it adds something. And most teachers report that he calms the room."Any problems that arise tend to be easily surmountable.Graham Kensett, Coventry mobility team manager for Guide Dogs, has been involved in the organisation's projects with children and young people. He says teachers always worry that a dog may make pupils more excitable, but then find the opposite.But are all schools as welcoming of dogs as Hannah's school has been?Kensett says there have been challenges but the majority of schools have been willing to work with them to allow a dog in."Children with allergies are sometimes raised as a concern but we have to encourage the school to make reasonable adjustments - maybe a dog could go into the admin office for that period. But allergies are fairly rare."In the past, school children weren't allowed guide dogs because it was felt that they were not mature enough to be in charge of an animal with routines such as feeding, walking, toileting important for its welfare.Hannah says a dog is a big responsibility, and she realised early on she'd need to sharpen up if she wanted to keep Rory. She believes it forced her to be more mature."He keeps me in a routine, he keeps me from being late all the time, he keeps me from forgetting things. Because I have to do everything for him, it reminds me of doing things for myself."Twice a week Hannah goes to army cadets where she learns new skills, shoots at (enlarged) targets and teaches younger cadets to march - all whilst accompanied by her dog.On the last two Remembrance Sundays, Rory has paraded with his young owner down Newport Pagnell High Street. "He steps off on his left foot and he's always in time, so it looks really good," Hannah says.She would like to join the Army as her career, but with her sight loss that's not possible. So she wants to pursue her second love and qualify as a pastry chef.O'Neill is pleased at the outcome for Hannah and says that you have to look at the holistic effect of having a dog."The difference he's made to Hannah's life outside of school has transformed her as a student. She's going to get better grades because she is a more self-confident young woman with self-esteem and social skills and that will translate into the quality of her work."Hannah is now out all the time, doing what she wants to be doing - things that a girl her age would normally do. "It's changed so much for me that my mum has recently given me the lecture about treating her house like a hotel."Her friends say they're so used to Hannah walking independently alongside them now that it can be easy to forget she sometimes needs a bit of help."We've left her behind once or twice when she's not got Rory with her," says friend Megan, laughing. "And when we realise, we've gone 'OMG, we've lost the blind girl!'"Would your child benefit from an assistance dog at school?

      <title>Breeding tigers in a rural shire</title>
      <description>The former circus owner who bred 120 of the big cats</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-24387281</url>
      <date>1380996795</date>
      <body>Following the birth of the first tiger at London Zoo in 17 years, a former circus owner talks about his life breeding tigers in rural Lincolnshire.At the height of his career in the 1970s, Martin Lacey was known as the "man that fear forgot" - being the only one to put his head inside a lion's mouth.That was just part of his work to run the now-closed Great British Circus, which has also included breeding more than 120 tigers at his home in Keal Cotes.Now aged in his 70s, Mr Lacey plans to retire, with most of the tigers will now go to his sons' circus in Germany.His work has included starring in the children's TV show Magpie and training some of the tigers used in the Esso adverts.He said he had enjoyed a fantastic career and "had certainly done his bit" to help with tiger conservation."This year we've had 12 cubs in Lincolnshire and 12 in Germany," he said."Most will go to my sons' circus, but we are able to let any surplus go to zoological gardens, which reduces the need to bring in any animals from the wild."We are definitely doing well in the conservation stakes - we also bred reindeer here this year, and that's not easy."However, changes in public attitudes to performing animals mean he has faced criticism in recent years.The UK government has announced that a ban prohibiting the use of wild animals in circuses in Britain would come into effect in 2015.Under the terms of the draft Wild Animals in Circuses Bill, the ban will cover any creature not normally domesticated in Britain.The RSPCA said public opinion has been against the practice for some time because "lions and tigers performing do not have a place in today's society."However, Mr Lacey says his tigers enjoy the highest standards of care and described the animal's time in the circus ring as "organised play"."They run and jump - just as they would in the wild," he said."I believe there is a mass of support for animals in entertainment and people should have the freedom of choice - you can only watch so many jugglers before it gets a bit boring."We are breeding them specifically for work and are looking for intelligent animals."Just as some strains of Alsatian look fantastic but are a little bit thick - our animals have to be intelligent and look good as well."However, the closure of the Great British Circus in 2012 was welcomed by the Captive Animals Protection Society.Director Liz Tyson said: "The door is firmly closing on the inherently cruel and unethical practice of using animals in circuses in this country."But, Mr Lacey said: "We've wiped out 90% of the wild population of tigers, so the only place you are going to find these wonderful creatures is in a zoo or circus."The only other alternative is stuffed in a museum and I know which I'd like my great, great grandchildren to see."The Lacey family currently has about 80 big cats in its care, including Indian tigers and white lions.He said: "As well as providing shade for them during the summer months, I've got a very good slaughterhouse which lets me take things like pig's heads, hearts, liver and trotters."He also described security at his home as much better than "Parkhurst"."We've never had an escape and we can't ever have an escape," he stressed.Mr Lacey, who was training up until the age of 70, said he was retiring because "[the tigers] are moving a little bit faster than I am these days".</body>

      <body>If you are already missing the sunshine then here is something to consider.The pound is having a revival on the currency markets, thanks to the strengthening British economy.It is a welcome change for British tourists who saw the pound slump after the 2008 financial crisis.But the economy has perked up and sterling has seen a spectacular rise against some currencies this year.And there are other trends in the currency market which are making a difference.Now obviously changes in the value of the pound are not the top priority when it comes to choosing a holiday destination, not least because some cheap countries are not particularly safe.And it is impossible to predict exactly what's going to happen on the markets.(You can check travel advice from the Foreign Office here.)But after years of suffering the effects of a weak pound, travellers may be tempted by countries that are once again looking like good value.Currency experts in the City of London have given their views on where that value can be found over the next 12 months.South Africa is one of a group of nations which, in economic circles, are called the Brics.Along with Brazil, Russia, India and China, it was favoured by investors for its fast-growing economy.But it has run into trouble recently.Prices for its main exports such as gold, platinum and diamonds have fallen and the mining industry has also been hit by labour trouble.As a result the South African rand has plunged 25% this year."There are question marks over the economy," says Jeremy Stretch, market strategist at CIBC."Even if sterling does badly I expect the rand to underperform."Another nation that has fallen out of favour with international investors is India.Economic growth has been weak and the government has struggled to push through reform that economists say would lift growth.This year the rupee has fallen 12% against the pound.Analysts say the situation is unlikely to change in the near future."India will always be vulnerable," says Jane Foley, senior forex strategist at Rabobank in London."India has disappointing growth and a lack of reform and other emerging markets will be seen as better bets."The Australian economy has become tied to the fortunes of China.Much of its iron ore and other commodities are exported there.But prices and volumes have fallen and so has the Australian dollar.It is down more than 10% against the pound this year, currently trading at around 1.73 Australian dollars to the pound."The Oz dollar has been overvalued since mid-2010," says Jeremy Stretch."It (the pound) will probably get to 1.85, maybe 1.90, but not as high as 2. That overvaluation is dissipating."Turkey's economy has been a success story in recent years.But protests against the government in June have unsettled investors. Confidence in Turkey is also vulnerable to unrest in Syria and to a lesser extent Egypt.The Turkish lira is down 12% against the pound so far this year. But since the worst of the financial crisis in 2008, the lira has fallen 50% against the pound."It's been a very, very big move," says Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon in London."But it's very hard to know with emerging markets because they are illiquid. If political tensions ease there would be a rapid move back."If I was going to to Turkey I would buy my lira now."Anyone considering a visit to Turkey should check on the latest advice from the Foreign Office.</body>

      <title>McAvoy: 'I toy with the audience'</title>
      <description>James McAvoy says his new film is "not for the fainthearted"</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24373354</url>
      <date>1380933124</date>
      <body>James McAvoy's latest role as a drug-fuelled corrupt Scottish police officer in Filth will not be for everyone - but the actor tells the BBC that's exactly why he signed up."It's full on and definitely not for the fainthearted, and there's not a lot of that in the film industry," he explains."The character represented an opportunity to take an audience and really toy with them."Filth sees McAvoy as detective sergeant Bruce Robertson, a man whose average day involves casual drug-taking, obscene phone calls, blackmailing young women into sex or sleeping with his friends' wives."You're making somebody laugh, and they know they shouldn't be. And then you're kind of wagging your finger going, 'Shame on you for laughing!'" he continues."Then, when they're feeling bad about themselves, you try and make the audience feel some sympathy. And they're like, 'Oh, there's depth to him! Of course, of course!'"And then you just go, 'No, there's not any depth to me! And you should feel bad about yourself for liking me again'."That just seemed really good fun. To be able to toy with whether they were enjoying it or were repulsed by it or not," he says.Based on the 1998 novel by Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh, some cinema-goers will find plenty to be repulsed by in McAvoy's immoral copper, whose antics become more and more outrageous as he loses touch with reality.Jamie Bell and Imogen Poots play colleagues competing for a promotion, while Jim Broadbent is his psychiatrist and Eddie Marsan a tormented friend.Originally branded "un-filmable", it was relative newcomer Jon S Baird's screenplay that finally convinced Welsh that Filth could be brought to the big screen. But neither was convinced McAvoy was suitable the role."He looked very young this particular day," remembers director Baird, sitting in the very seat at London's Soho Hotel where McAvoy first changed his and Welsh's minds."But 20 minutes after talking to him, he had morphed into this middle-aged, grizzled, alcoholic divorcee. It was pretty mad."He started talking about his experience with mental illness, and that's the thing that bonded us. He had experience of that with somebody he grew up with."As soon as I knew he understood that, it was game over. It was like, 'He is the guy'. We offered him the part the same day."For The Last King of Scotland and Atonement star, it was "a cathartic experience" to portray Bruce as he slowly unravelled.But the star, who recently took a beating in Danny Boyle's psychological thriller Trance, found himself being roughed up again for Filth - except this time he was in drag."I hated being in that outfit," grimaces McAvoy."There's something about being covered in blood and cold and you're having to act all mashed up - it makes me feel abused and not nice."Then he laughs: "And yeah, you look at yourself with a wig on and a beard and blood all over your face and just go, 'How am I ever going to get my wife to fancy me again?'"The pain was worth it - if you believe the cinema-going public in Scotland, where the film was released a week ahead of the rest of the UK and took £250,000 at just 38 screens."Trying to get this thing made over the years, I'm so relieved now that it didn't get made earlier, because it would never have been as good," confesses Welsh, who calls McAvoy's performance "off the scale"."I'm still astonished by it, to be honest. Thinking about all the great iconic solo performances that I've seen in my lifetime, I just can't think of anyone that betters it."He's got to convey loss and pathos, aggression and violence, hatred and manipulation. It's like watching a great Shakespearean."As one of the film's many producers (who also include Trudie Styler), McAvoy got to see that fearless performance of his up close in the edit suite - and even sent some scenes to the cutting-room floor."I'd be saying to Jon, 'Get rid of that bit. I know you love it, I know you think that's great but it's slowing everything down,'" he says."And you're like, 'I've just told him to cut a bit of my performance!' I never thought I'd see the day that happens, you know?"Filth also provided McAvoy with another first - acting alongside his sister, Joy."It was amazing, she's an amazing actress. She's got her own approach and her own on-screen and on-stage charisma, which I'm in thrall of at times," he says."Once the camera started rolling she was there, she was in it; and I was there and I was in it; and we just kind of went for it. That's the McAvoy way, maybe!"Next May, audiences will see McAvoy return to the land of big budget blockbusters in his second X-Men film, Days of Future Past, which he finished shooting around a month ago.He plays a younger Charles Xavier alongside the likes of Hugh Jackman and Michael Fassbender, and has a scene with the "original" Charles, Patrick Stewart."It was good, it was really good," says McAvoy. "We got to almost physically, but still metaphorically a little bit, pass the baton."The star has already moved on to his next film - a new take on Mary Shelley's classic novel Frankenstein, in which he plays Victor Von Frankenstein to Daniel Radcliffe's Igor."Me and him met last week," reveals McAvoy. "We had our first rehearsal, it was awesome.""The monster isn't so much trying to come to terms with his existence as he is in the Kenneth Branagh one," he explains."It's an adventure, and the backbone of the adventure is the relationship between me and Daniel. It's more about those two - brothers in science and brothers in adventure."He pauses, and laughs: "It sounds like I'm pitching 'Weird Science: The Movie' here!"</body>

      <title>The secret refuge for victims of forced marriage</title>
      <description>The refuge set up for victims of forced marriage in Pakistan</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24397026</url>
      <date>1380935591</date>
      <body>Almost half of forced marriages involving Britons come from the Pakistani community. Amid calls from charities for the government to do more to keep track of how many children are forced into marriage during school holidays, a shelter in Pakistan is providing refuge for some of those who have managed to escape.At a secret address in Islamabad surrounded by security, Khalina Salimi runs a refuge that has become a lifeline to girls and boys who have escaped forced marriage in Pakistan.Ms Salimi is the director of Sach (Struggle for Change) - and she and her team of caseworkers deal with the rescue, rehabilitation and repatriation of girls and boys from around the world.In the last year they have helped approximately 40 children and young people - 21 of whom came from the UK.Recent estimates suggest more than 5,000 people from the UK are forced into marriage every year and more than a third of those affected are aged under 16.Some of the calls for help that Sach receives come from embassies and consulates that need assistance. Others come from the children themselves."No one case is the same," says Ms Salimi. "Sometimes we might get a call from them and if they are able we ask them to go to a shop and then we will go and get them," she says."Sometimes we are alerted to a wedding which is being held in public. We would not take a car there because we might be noticed, so we take public transport to the event, and then we grab the girl and run, run, run."Ms Salimi, a sociologist, set up Sach in 1994. Initially the victims were too scared to come and seek their help - now they receive thousands of calls annually.Nineteen-year-old "Nazia" is typical of the young people helped by Sach. She was brought to Pakistan from the UK by her parents, ostensibly for a holiday. But when she arrived, they asked her to marry her cousin.When she refused, Ms Salimi said, "She was kept in solitary confinement for a couple of days without food." When she still refused to marry him, they gave her an overdose of pills, so that it would appear that she had taken her own life.However, her boyfriend in the UK had grown suspicious when he had not heard from her - and contacted the police. They liaised with the authorities in Pakistan and she was brought to Sach.The living room at Sach is bright and airy - furnished to make new residents feel at home. Connected to the living room is a kitchen, which Ms Salimi says can also be a therapeutic tool for the girls and boys, who are often devastated by their experiences."If they like cooking then they can do that to make themselves a bit happier. They can cook for themselves and give themselves some structure and feel busy."In the bedrooms, the beds are neatly made with a teddy-bear nestled between two pillows, ready to comfort the next resident."They don't know how long it is going to be that they will have to stay here, so we try and make it as homely as we can," says Ms Salimi.Many of the young people will be traumatised from their experiences - and Sach uses psychologists, physiotherapists and doctors to help determine what the young person might need."The effects are very long-lasting and certainly they need psychological counselling," says Ms Salimi."It is not just about their escape. The abuses they have been going through are similar to those you might see in prisons - but carried out by parents."Ms Salimi says the children do love their parents and are often confused that they are being forced to marry against their will."They might say, for example: 'My dad is really good to me and provides me with a good education - but then why is he not letting me study further, why is he pushing me to marry a boy who is illiterate, who is not compatible?'"The choice to leave the family is not easy, especially in a country where the only people you may know are the people trying to force you to marry. It can also be very dangerous, which is why the location of the refuge is kept secret.Ms Salimi says that the safety of the girls or boys, as well as the staff is paramount. Sometimes it is necessary to change their appearance."If they look modern, then we might give them a makeover to make them look more traditional. If they are more traditional with the hijab, we try to take them to the parlour and change their hairstyle, change their shoes, everything."It is very, very dangerous for them escaping from home and there is always a danger of being identified."Other than makeovers they have to be careful when travelling to the airport. When they arrive back in the UK, the next stage of their uncertain future will begin.But those - like Nazia who is now back in the UK - are the lucky ones. The organisation has been involved in investigations around the murder of teenagers who were being forced into marriage.The UK's Forced Marriage Unit and charities working in the field say that although Pakistan may have the biggest number of forced marriages it is by no means the only country. This is an issue that crosses every border, religion, race, age and class.Teenagers like Sara - not her real name - are all too aware of this. She was meant to be married off to a man twice her age in India over the summer."In exchange for [a] dowry he was going to give me land, a house, gold and all the wedding expenses," she said.Sara says it made her feel like an object - "like being sold or exchanged".She managed to escape to a refuge in the UK before the wedding.Aneeta Prem from the Freedom Charity, which helps raise awareness of forced marriage in schools, says it is vital that the government keep accurate numbers of children who fail to return after school holidays."At the moment the records are really sketchy - last year we asked for the figures and we were told by the education authority that no figures were being kept nationally," she says."They need to be collated nationally for us to know the scale of the problem and what we are really looking at."This report was featured on Radio 4's PM programme, the BBC World Service and the Six O'Clock News.If you've been affected by any of the issues in this story you can contact the BBC's Action Line or the Forced Marriage Unit.</body>

      <body>You can split Warrington and Wigan by a fingernail.Everybody is sitting on the fence and rightly so, it is that close. You look at the different styles of the two teams but on their day they can beat anybody and both know that.It is about who turns up in the best shape. The side in the best frame of mind and with clarity of purpose will seize the day, but they are both fabulous teams.One of the key match-ups will be Wigan's Michael McIlorum and Logan Tomkins versus the two nines of Warrington - Micky Higham and Michael Monaghan.Warrington have a lot of players they can go to, like Monaghan and Higham, people who can play football. Half-backs Richie Myler and Lee Briers are in the mix and you have Stefan Ratchford chiming in from backfield, or wherever he happens to play.Then there are the Wigan halves, Matty Smith and Blake Green, who are very solid, very durable. They know the system instantly, they know what they want to do and when they want to do it. Warrington will have to disrupt that process and the way that Wigan play.If you look at the Warrington back row, Trent Waterhouse and Ben Westwood have been very strong all year so Harrison Hansen has to step up and the question mark is over Sean O'Loughlin and whether he will play after making the squad. Plus, let's not forget Wigan have a decent pack themselves.I have not even mentioned him yet but Sam Tomkins is going to want to leave [for New Zealand Warriors] on a high. He's an unbelievably gifted full-back who can change any game, so I am sure Warrington are aware of all of that.Wigan are losing Tomkins, Pat Richards and Lee Mossop to the NRL, while Adrian Morley, Brett Hodgson, Garreth Carvell and Mike Cooper are all exiting Warrington at the end of the season.While it may be a motivation for them to win that is all it is, because if you focus on who is leaving and where they're going to be, you will come unstuck. That's the golden rule.The focus has to be on the game, the performance and the clarity of message to the players. Once you start talking about the emotions, although it is emotional, if you focus on that you forget about the game, it goes by you and you don't give the people the send-off they deserve.Players like Hodgson, Morley, Tomkins, Mossop, need to move on in the best possible style and the only way they will really do that is if they concentrate on how well they have played all year and what they have achieved at the clubs.The two finals [Challenge Cup and Grand Final] are a lot closer in time than when I won the double with Bradford in 2003. Bulls won the cup in April and then the Grand Final in October, now it is August and October so it makes it more difficult for Wigan, it raises the intensity.You have five or six really intense games on the bounce. You win at Wembley, then there is a bit of jiggery-pokery in the regular season, then it is semi-final football and then another final.There is no doubt the incentive and will is probably stronger on the Warrington side because they have had the disappointment of being knocked out of the Challenge Cup.Since then they have got themselves into a decent position where they could focus on this one trophy.Meanwhile, Wigan's focus on the Grand Final has only come in the last week, because they are there now. To do the double would be an amazing achievement and they are very capable of doing that, but the Wire are probably really focused.The great football that Warrington play and the lovely structured stuff that Wigan play is pleasing on the eye, and while both teams pride themselves on defence I think it will be somebody in the attacking stakes who will break this game open.Warrington have two different styles - a hybrid of structure and a little bit of freestyle stuff that Tony Smith likes to play - while Wigan are very structured.It is not a clash of cultures, but it is certainly a clash of styles.It may end up being the kicking game that separates the two teams - who is to bank against a Briers or Smith drop-goal to do it?Brian Noble was speaking to BBC Sport's Matt Newsum</body>

      <body>Last month's deadly attack on a Kenyan shopping centre is revisited by two of Saturday's papers as the Mail and Times explore alleged UK connections to the siege.The Times leads on suspicions that a 24-year-old from north London developed chemical weapons for the militants behind the attack.It says Madhi Hashi is a leading figure in al-Shabaab and was captured preparing to fly to Yemen to discuss the group's campaign.The Mail reports on what it claims is the "secret diary" of Brit Samantha Lewthwaite - labelled by the press as the "white widow".It says the hand-written document was found in a Kenyan safe house and repeats the allegation that she is linked to the Westgate siege.Meanwhile the Daily Mirror continues what it says is its "world exclusive" interview with a Taliban warlord.The commander tells the newspaper his fighters tried to kill or capture Prince Harry when he was serving in Afghanistan.After a quiet few days for UKIP, the party is back in the headlines.Controversial MEP Godfrey Bloom has given his first interview since being suspended for joking a group of female activists were untidy "sluts".He tells the Times UKIP will abandon supporters like him at their peril.And while he accuses leader Nigel Farage of being out of touch with voters, he reveals he expects to be "having a pint of bitter" with his Brussels flatmate when the saga has died down.According to the FT Mr Farage - seeking to become the party's first MP - is eyeing up a Kent seat at the general election.Meanwhile, two of the government's consumer-friendly policies could be in trouble.According to the Times, banks are refusing to cut mortgage rates significantly under the coalition's Help To Buy scheme - despite a government pledge to protect lenders against potential losses.And the Daily Express reports problems on energy pricing.Utility companies are planning "a bonfire" of cheap tariffs, the paper says, as experts warn the plan to cut the number of confusing deals available could have unintended consequences.According to its report, critics say the move could actually leave "struggling families facing soaring bills this winter".The Telegraph carries better news, for fish lovers at least.It says those who enjoy mackerel can now do so guilt-free after scientists announced that the fish are flourishing.But it could be the end of the road for analogue radio, the Independent says, predicting a switch to digital by early 2018.On the back of the prime minister's recent revelation that he bakes his own bread, rather than buying a value loaf, the Guardian reports he's not alone.Britons are buying fewer sliced supermarket loaves than ever - and making their own instead, the paper says.The Mail has bad news for anyone enjoying a weekend lay-in, citing a study's findings that staying in bed too often could speed up memory loss - and possibly increase the risk of dementia.Finally, the Sun is one of many papers to report on the ill-health of Sir Bruce Forsyth.It says fans of Strictly Come Dancing fear for his future on the series after he pulled out of Saturday's show with a bout of flu.</body>
