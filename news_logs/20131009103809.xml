      <body>NHS and care services patients need to become more demanding and fight for their rights, a new watchdog body says.Healthwatch England, which heads up a network of 152 local patient bodies, urged the public to become "savvy consumers" rather than "grateful patients".To help, the watchdog set out eight core rights for patients.It comes after polling indicated half of people who experienced poor care did not report it.The survey of more than 2,000 people found one in five had experienced poor care - but of those, 54% had not complained.Healthwatch England was created under the shake-up of the NHS earlier this year.It is envisaged that the organisation will act as a patients' champion, carrying out its own investigations and speaking out about issues of concern.This is its first report to Parliament, and it has used it to highlight the deference shown by patients.Healthwatch England chairwoman Anna Bradley said: "We all need to stop acting like grateful patients and care users and start to see ourselves as savvy consumers, insisting on our right to safe, dignified and high quality care."To help achieve that, the organisation has set out its list of rights:Ms Bradley added: "Consumer rights are second nature to us on the High Street, but by thinking this way we can ensure people have a voice at the heart of the health and social care system."Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb said he welcomed the initiative."Without real and meaningful input from patients, it is impossible for health and care services to improve and move forward in the future," he added.</body>

      <title>Plane noise 'link' to heart disease</title>
      <description>The risks of stroke, heart and circulatory disease are higher in areas which have a lot of aircraft noise, researchers have found.</description>

      <body>The risks of stroke, heart and circulatory disease are higher in areas with a lot of aircraft noise, researchers say.Their study of 3.6 million residents near Heathrow Airport suggested the risks were 10-20% higher in areas with the highest levels of aircraft noise.The team's findings are published in the British Medical Journal.They agreed with other experts that noise was not necessarily to blame and more work was needed.Their work suggests a higher risk for both hospital admissions and deaths from stroke, heart and circulatory disease for the 2% of the study - about 70,000 people - who lived where the aircraft noise was loudest.The lead author, Dr Anna Hansell, from Imperial College London, said: "The exact role that noise exposure may play in ill health is not well established."However, it is plausible that it might be contributing - for example, by raising blood pressure or by disturbing people's sleep.""There's a 'startle reaction' to loud noise - if you're suddenly exposed to it, the heart rate and blood pressure increase."And aircraft noise can be annoying for some people, which can also affect their blood pressure, leading to illness."The relative importance of daytime and night-time noise from aircraft also needs to be investigated further."The study used data about noise levels in 2001 from the Civil Aviation Authority, covering 12 London boroughs and nine districts outside of London where aircraft noise exceeds 50 decibels - about the volume of a normal conversation in a quiet room.The authors say fewer people are now affected by the highest levels of noise (above 63 decibels) - despite more planes being in the skies - because of changes in aircraft design and flight plans.The researchers - from Imperial and also King's College London - adjusted their work in an effort to eliminate other factors that might have a relationship with stroke and heart disease, such as deprivation, South Asian ethnicity and smoking-related illness.They stressed that the higher risk of illness related to aircraft noise remained much less significant than the risks from lifestyle factors - including smoking, a lack of exercise or poor diet.In an accompanying editorial, Prof Stephen Stansfeld, from Queen Mary University of London, said: "These results imply that the siting of airports and consequent exposure to aircraft noise may have direct effects on the health of the surrounding population."Planners need to take this into account when expanding airports in heavily populated areas or planning new airports."The study covered 12 London boroughs in the centre and west of the capital - and nine council districts beyond London, including Windsor and Maidenhead, Slough and Wokingham.Heathrow Airport's director of sustainability, Matt Gorman, said: "We are already taking significant steps to tackle the issue of noise."We are charging airlines more for noisier aircraft, offering insulation and double glazing to local residents and are working with noise campaigners to give people predictable periods of respite from noise."Together these measures have meant that the number of people affected by noise has fallen by 90% since the 1970s, despite the number of flights almost doubling."A government spokesman said: "The number of people affected by high levels of noise around Heathrow has been falling for years due to improvements in aviation technology, better planning of flight paths and other factors. We would expect to see this trend continue."A separate study, also published on Wednesday in the BMJ, demonstrates a higher rate of admission to hospital with cardiovascular problems for people living near 89 airports in the US.Prof Kevin McConway, from the Open University, said: "Both of these studies are thorough and well-conducted. But, even taken together, they don't prove that aircraft noise actually causes heart disease and strokes."A major difficulty in interpreting what these studies tell us is that they are based on data for geographical areas, not for individual people."Over the coming months, Public Health England will recruit experts to further examine the public health issues around exposure to noise.</body>

      <title>Toddler brain scan language insight</title>
      <description>The brain has a critical window for language development between the ages of two and four, brain scans suggest.</description>

      <body>The brain has a critical window for language development between the ages of two and four, brain scans suggest.Environmental influences have their biggest impact before the age of four, as the brain's wiring develops to process new words, say UK and US scientists.The research in The Journal of Neuroscience suggests disorders causing language delay should be tackled early.It also explains why young children are good at learning two languages.The scientists, based at King's College London, and Brown University, Rhode Island, studied 108 children with normal brain development between the ages of one and six.They used brain scans to look at myelin - the insulation that develops from birth within the circuitry of the brain.To their surprise, they found the distribution of myelin is fixed from the age of four, suggesting the brain is most plastic in very early life.Any environmental influences on brain development will be strongest in infanthood, they predict.This explains why immersing children in a bilingual environment before the age of four gives them the best chance of becoming fluent in both languages, the research suggests.It also suggests that there is a critical time during development when environmental influence on cognitive skills may be greatest.Dr Jonathan O'Muircheartaigh, from King's College London, led the study.He told the BBC: "Since our work seems to indicate that brain circuits associated with language are more flexible before the age of four, early intervention for children with delayed language attainment should be initiated before this critical age."This may be relevant to many developmental disorders, such as autism, since delayed language is a common early trait."Early childhood is a time when language skills develop very rapidly.Babies have a vocabulary of up to 50 words at 12 months but by the age of six this has expanded to about 5,000 words.Language skills are localised in the frontal areas of the left-hand side of the brain.The researchers therefore expected more myelin to develop in the left-hand side of the brain, as the children learned more language.In fact, they found it remained constant, but had a stronger influence on language ability before the age of four, suggesting there is a crucial window for interventions in developmental disorders."This work is important as it is the first to investigate the relationship between brain structure and language across early childhood and demonstrate how this relationship changes with age," said Dr Sean Deoni from Brown University, a co-researcher on the study."This is important since language is commonly altered or delayed in many developmental disorders, such as autism."Commenting on the study, Prof Dorothy Bishop of the department of Developmental Neuropsychology at the University of Oxford said the research added important new information about early development of connections in brain regions important for cognitive functions."There is suggestive evidence of links with language development but it is too early to be confident about functional implications of the findings," she said."Ideally we would need a longitudinal study following children over time to track how structural brain changes relate to language function."The study was funded by the National Institutes for Mental Health (US) and the Wellcome Trust (UK).</body>

      <title>Stillbirth rate 'poor' says doctor</title>
      <description>More must be done to tackle Scotland's poor record on stillbirths, according to the Scottish government's advise on maternity and women's health.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-24452867</url>
      <date>1381273847</date>
      <body>More must be done to tackle Scotland's poor record on stillbirths, according to the Scottish government's adviser on maternity and women's health.Dr Catherine Calderwood told BBC Scotland: "Other countries are doing very much better than us."She said: "At the moment one in 200 babies are stillborn in Scotland. Our rate ranks Scotland 31st out of 33 high income countries in the world."Three hundred babies are stillborn every year in Scotland.That is 10 times as many as those who die through cot death.A stillborn child is defined as a baby born dead after 24 weeks gestation.Dr Calderwood said Scotland is about to begin a programme to try to reduce the rate.She said: "We need to make sure women are as healthy as possible before starting a pregnancy."We also know that we can improve things when we're looking after them."We know that small babies are more at risk and so there is various monitoring we can put in place so that we can pick those babies up and hopefully deliver them in time"Gavin Moir and his wife Kirsty lost their first child when Kirsty was 38-and-a-half weeks pregnant.Kirsty mentioned at a routine appointment that she had not felt the baby move much in the last day.An ultrasound test revealed there was no longer a heartbeat."The baby's room was all ready," said Mr Moir."The bags were all packed. To be told that there's nothing there anymore was absolutely devastating for us all. To this day I don't know how we managed to cope."The Take That star and X-Factor judge Gary Barlow and his wife lost a baby daughter as a result of a stillbirth in August last year.Dr Calderwood said that there had been a general assumption that nothing much could be done to reduce the number of stillborn children, but that has now changed.She said: "We have always perhaps believed that some bad things will happen when women are pregnant and we don't want to worry women because most babies will be fine."But in fact evidence from other countries shows us that, far from not being able to do something about it, we know that we actually can."Ann McMurray, Scottish network co-ordinator for the stillbirth charity SANDS, has been working with the Scottish government to increase awareness amongst pregnant women.In particular, it is interested in following the example of Norway which reduced its stillbirth rate by a third by encouraging women to get a check-up if they noticed their baby was not moving.Ms McMurray said: "We've been telling people they should get reduced foetal movements checked out."Also it's just about making people aware that stillbirth does happen because it's not really spoken about at antenatal clinics."It's not that we're scaremongering, because people are told that other things can go wrong."Gavin and Kirsty Moir have had another son but say they do not think they'll ever get over the trauma of their stillborn first child, whom they named Fraser."We still look back and think there could have been more done," said Mr Moir."Kirsty had to go to hospital to have tests on the levels of her waters, which had dropped quite considerably."It's only with hindsight that we're wondering if there was a problem which should have been monitored more closely."</body>

      <title>Hope for malaria vaccine by 2015</title>
      <description>UK drug maker GlaxoSmithKline will seek approval for the world's first malaria vaccine after trials showed that it had reduced cases in African children.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24431510</url>
      <date>1381206650</date>
      <body>British drug maker GlaxoSmithKline is seeking regulatory approval for the world's first malaria vaccine after trial data showed that it had cut the number of cases in African children.Experts say that they are optimistic about the possibility of the world's first vaccine after the trial results.Malaria, a mosquito-borne parasitic disease, kills hundreds of thousands of people worldwide every year.Scientists say an effective vaccine is key to attempts to eradicate it.The vaccine known as RTS,S was found to have almost halved the number of malaria cases in young children in the trial and to have reduced by about 25% the number of malaria cases in infants.GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is developing RTS,S with the non-profit Path Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI), supported by funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation."Many millions of malaria cases fill the wards of our hospitals," said Halidou Tinto, a lead investigator on the RTS,S trial from Burkina Faso."Progress is being made with bed nets and other measures, but we need more tools to battle this terrible disease."The malaria trial was Africa's largest-ever clinical trial involving almost 15,500 children in seven countries.The findings were presented at a medical meeting in Durban, South Africa."Based on these data, GSK now intends to submit, in 2014, a regulatory application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA)," GSK said in a statement.The company has been developing the vaccine for three decades.The statement said that the hope now is that the Geneva-based World Health Organization (WHO) may recommend the use of the RTS,S vaccine from as early as 2015 if EMA drugs regulators back its licence application.Testing showed that 18 months after vaccination, children aged five to 17 months had a 46% reduction in the risk of clinical malaria compared to unvaccinated contemporaries.But in infants aged six to 12 weeks at the time of vaccination, there was only a 27% reduction in risk.A spokeswoman for GSK told the AFP news agency that the company would file its application to the EMA under a process aimed at facilitating new drugs for poorer countries.UK politician Lynne Featherstone, International Development Minister, said: "Malaria is not just one of the world's biggest killers of children, it also burdens health systems, hinders children's development and puts a brake on economic growth. An effective malaria vaccine would have an enormous impact on the developing world."We welcome the scientific progress made by this research and look forward to seeing the full results in due course."</body>

      <title>Euro MPs tighten anti-tobacco laws</title>
      <description>The European Parliament votes to tighten tobacco rules to curb smoking among young people, but avoids restricting e-cigarettes.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24439474</url>
      <date>1381239856</date>
      <body>Euro MPs have voted to tighten tobacco regulations aimed at putting young people off smoking, but some measures do not go as far as originally planned.They rejected a European Commission proposal to treat electronic cigarettes as medicinal products - a move that would have restricted sales.They backed a ban on cigarette flavourings - but with a five-year delay in the case of menthol.Slim cigarettes will not be banned. EU ministers must now consider the plans.Among other measures, MEPs voted on Tuesday to put health warnings on 65% of each cigarette pack, as opposed to the proposed 75%.Linda McAvan, the Labour MEP steering the legislation, said 65% was still "a long way towards plain packaging".The current requirement for health warnings is for 30% minimum coverage on one side and 40% on the other.Packs of 10 cigarettes, considered popular among younger smokers, will also be banned.Fourteen EU states already have 20 as the minimum, four stipulate a minimum of 19, and in the UK and Italy the minimum is 10.Smaller than normal packs of roll-your-own tobacco will still be allowed under the new rules.It was the European Parliament's first reading of a draft tobacco directive which could become law in 2014. It would then take two more years to become law in each of the 28 EU member states.There has been intense lobbying of MEPs by the tobacco industry and health campaigners.The Commission says almost 700,000 Europeans die from smoking-related illnesses each year - equal to the population of Frankfurt or Palermo. The costs for healthcare in the EU are estimated to be at least 25.3bn euros (£20.6bn; $33.4bn) annually.Conservative and Liberal MEPs welcomed the amendments made to the original proposal from Labour's Linda McAvan.Speaking to the BBC, Ms McAvan said she was disappointed that slim cigarettes were not banned.But cigarette packaging made to look like lipstick or perfume containers - attractive to girls - will disappear, she noted.There will now be further negotiations with the Council - the grouping of relevant EU ministers. MEPs may manage to avoid a second vote and fast-track the legislation so that it is adopted before the May 2014 European elections.The proposals also include a ban on words like "light", "mild" and "low tar", deemed to be misleading, and a ban on oral tobacco - called snus - although Sweden would retain its exemption.EU Health Commissioner Tonio Borg called the vote "positive". "I am confident that the revised Directive on Tobacco Products can still be adopted within the mandate of the current Parliament," he said.But Carl Schlyter MEP, health spokesman for the Greens, called it "a shameful day for the European Parliament, as a centre-right majority, led by the EPP group, has done the bidding of the tobacco industry and voted for weaker rules".Angela Harbutt of the pro-tobacco organisation Forest criticised the legislation, saying "prohibition doesn't work and products that are banned will almost certainly be available on the unregulated black market."Law-abiding consumers will be at a serious disadvantage and it won't help children because criminal gangs don't care who they sell to," she said.The UK has already said e-cigarettes will be licensed as medicine from 2016.Sales of the tobacco-free devices have boomed worldwide since bans on smoking in public places were introduced.But campaigners say their growing popularity is dangerous.They argue that e-cigarettes undermine years of anti-smoking efforts and could be especially damaging to children and non-smokers.The devices are designed to replicate smoking behaviour without the use of tobacco. They turn nicotine and other chemicals into a vapour that is inhaled.Manufacturers of e-cigarettes say the products have the potential to save millions of lives.Anti-smoking campaigners say young people especially are being tricked into taking up smoking.Prof Martin McKee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine says tobacco firms have simply extended their advertising techniques to e-cigarettes.Commissioner Borg, presenting the proposals, said tobacco products "should look and taste like tobacco products".In 2009‐10, sales of tobacco products generated nearly £9bn ($14.6bn; 11bn euros) in taxes for the UK government, about 2% of all receipts from taxation, a government report said.</body>

      <body>Excessive pressure on AandE consultants has the potential to put patients at risk, doctors are warning.The College of Emergency Medicine said increased demand and the complexity of work was causing staff sickness and burnout.Its survey of just over 1,000 UK consultants found six in 10 thought their jobs were unsustainable.It comes amid mounting concern about the ability of AandE units to cope this winter.At the start of this year, the NHS in England missed its target of fewer than 5% of patients waiting more than four hours, as waiting times hit their highest rates for nine years.Ministers have since announced a £500m bailout fund for the next two winters to help those hospitals with the most acute problems.The college has always maintained that a shortage of doctors is a contributory factor to the problems.Previous reports have highlighted the fact that AandEs do not have enough consultants.The average is just over seven per unit when it should be 10 - and 16 for the largest hospitals - according to the college.But now the college is warning that the shortages are beginning to affect the consultants who are in place.In the survey, 94% complained they were working excessive hours - with more than half saying they were regularly doing more than a fifth extra on top of their contracted time.The report also uncovered a small, but growing problem with consultants emigrating.Last year 21 left the UK compared with three in 2008.College vice president Dr Taj Hassan said: "Senior medical decision-makers in emergency medicine provide one of the most vital strands in maintaining safety."A failure to address these issues will compromise this ability and also further worsen the present workforce crisis."Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said the situation was "unacceptable"."Patients have incredible respect for emergency medicine teams, but those teams need to be backed up with the funding they need to do their jobs without being stretched in this way."A Department of Health spokesman commented: "We know we need to do more to support emergency departments to do their important work through winter and beyond."That is why we are investing £500m and we tasked Health Education England with developing plans to encourage more medical students to become AandE doctors in the future."He also said a major review of the urgent and emergency care system - led by medical director Prof Sir Bruce Keogh - would be reporting shortly.</body>

      <title>Extra £570m NHS cash in Welsh budget</title>
      <description>The NHS in Wales will get £570m extra funding Finance Minister Jane Hutt announces as she outlines the draft budget.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-24446450</url>
      <date>1381257923</date>
      <body>The NHS in Wales will get £570m of extra funding over three years, Finance Minister Jane Hutt has announced.It includes £150m for this financial year she told AMs as she unveiled the Welsh government's draft budget.She said the extra money would help the NHS in Wales to avoid a scandal such as the one in Stafford Hospital, where hundreds of patients died as a result of neglect and abuse.However funding for local government will see a cut of 5.81% next year.Early calculations suggest that local government cuts are particularly tough.Local government spending will fall from £4.648bn this year to £4.466bn next year, a cut in cash terms of 3.91% or 5.81% in real terms.Their budgets will be around 9% lower in real terms between now and 2015-16.Meanwhile, Ms Hutt said the pressures faced by the NHS "will continue to grow".Welsh NHS spending will rise from £5.722bn to £5.927bn next year, an increase of 3.58% in cash terms or 1.68% in real terms.Earlier in the day, Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood and Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams agreed to help the minority Labour administration get its budget through the assembly chamber.But Conservative shadow finance minister Paul Davies criticised the budget deal."Clearly they are willing to prop up this failing Labour government," he said.Under the terms of the deal, ministers will devote £100m to Plaid and Lib Dem spending priorities in return for the two opposition parties abstaining in the crucial vote in December.The money included £50m to treat more patients in the community rather than hospital and the doubling of funding for the pupil deprivation grant, a scheme to help poorer school pupils.Whilst praising the extra spending Welsh ministers had agreed to as part of the budget negotiations, Ms Wood raised concerns about the impact of local government cuts."What effect will this have on their ability to provide essential services?" she asked the finance minister."What will this mean for council tax increases next year?"What advice do you intend to issue to local government about council tax, and what impact will this budget have on young people trying to stay in education and gain qualifications?"Ms Hutt said it was not possible to "shield" all services from UK government spending cuts."Rising demand levels, cost increases and pressures resulting directly from the UK government's welfare reforms are biting," she said.She stressed the priority was to protect health, schools and universal benefits, such as free prescriptions, school breakfasts and bus passes for older people."We have also been clear that our focus will continue to rest on creating growth and jobs for the Welsh economy."Our commitment to tackle poverty by raising educational attainment and supporting children, families and deprived communities, will also help to achieve a fairer, healthier Wales," Ms Hutt added.Lib Dem finance spokesman Peter Black AM urged Ms Hutt to ensure the money got to those "in most need" and was spent as effectively as possible.Commenting on another key element of the budget deal his party and Plaid Cymru had made with Welsh ministers, he said: "I'm very proud indeed that we now have £71.3m supporting the poorest pupils in our communities next year, a commitment to investment in education and training."According to the Welsh government, these are the main areas of investment:BBC Wales health correspondent Owain Clarke writes:The Welsh government hopes the extra funding for the NHS will be a shot in the arm for a service which has often this year looked as if it is struggling to cope.The health and finance ministers spent the summer looking at the problems the NHS faced and came up with a figure. The result - £570m - exactly the three-year package of extra investment announced today.But bear in mind some economists estimate that the NHS here needs more - well in excess of £200m extra a year just to stand still.Why? Most of the money is spent on staff - and most of them on contracts which give them incremental rises each year. So unless jobs are cut, or there's a pay freeze then the bill increases.Also spending on drugs and medicines increases year on year, as does the costs of replacing equipment.Don't forget either we're living longer, putting more strain on the service and the NHS is also a notoriously inefficient organisation.So a big chunk of the extra money could be swallowed up almost immediately. The Welsh government's budget deal also includes a £50m fund designed to keep people out of hospital who don't need to be there.A huge rise in the number of elderly people going to AandE put the NHS under a massive strain in the spring. There's also almost £10m for robotic cancer surgery.Up until now dozens of Welsh men have had to go to England for less invasive prostate cancer operations and pay up to £15,000 for the privilege.But one of the key questions will be what will the seven Welsh health boards do with the rest money coming their way? Will they invest in sorting out some of the longer term challenges they face or take their foot off the pedal?The British Medical Association (BMA) Wales welcomed investments into a new intermediate care fund and enhancements to health technology funding, which it said was "long overdue".Secretary Dr Richard Lewis said: "Doctors and healthcare staff need to know that our limited resources are being targeted at services that matter to patients and support their day to day work."The government need to be honest with the profession and the public about what can and cannot be delivered in these financially straightened times."There has to be a focus on clinical priorities and safe services. There is no room for unnecessary bureaucracy and empty targets."The Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents health boards, welcomed the investment but said: "Even with this additional funding, change must take place right across Wales to ensure efficient, safe and sustainable health care services are provided within the resources allocated by Welsh government."This will inevitably mean that difficult choices have to be made on what services are provided where and when."The Unison union said it applauded the Welsh government for its "commitment to a publicly owned and financed" NHS as well as the increase in funding.Wales secretary Margaret Thomas said: "Under the circumstances, this is a responsible budget proposal from the Welsh government."Councillor Aaron Shotton, the Welsh Local Government Association's finance spokesperson said by the end of 2015-16, local government will have "borne the brunt of austerity" in Wales."This will see councils potentially having to close libraries and sports centres, slash pothole and other day-to-day maintenance budgets, cut bus subsidies and switch off streetlights between midnight and dawn," he said."While local councils will do everything they can to protect frontline services like education and social care, they will simply not be able to protect everythingCommenting on the budget, the TUC in Wales said this was a "hugely challenging time for all who believe in social justice and quality public services".General secretary Martin Mansfield said the Welsh government had worked to mitigate the impact of UK cuts since 2010,He said: "The UK government has slashed our finances by £1.7bn a year in order to pursue their austerity ideology - on top of Wales already being under funded due to the Barnett formula."The Welsh government approach is prioritising the best use of the resources left available to them."It will be a very difficult process but we will try to support them in that effort."All public service employers must play their full part in holding together our Welsh public service ethos."He said there must be "no knee jerk moves" towards pay cuts, job cuts and privatisation".BBC Wales economics correspondent Sarah Dickens writes:With the economy of Wales held back by too many people in low paid or low skilled work and many others not well enough to work, this budget appears to be trying to tackle that to make Wales wealthier.While extra money for health will flow back into the wider economy in the short term, it is hoped that increasing the impact of Flying Start's parenting support and the extra money for teaching children who are eligible for school meals will together try to break the poverty cycle.In an attempt to get more young people working the Jobs Growth Wales programme is being extended and an extra £12.5m is being spent to create another 4,000 job opportunities for 16-24 year olds. At the same time £20m will support apprenticeships.The losers as expected are local authorities. The local government budget is being cut by 3.9% in cash terms. That's equivalent to cuts of 5.8% when inflation is taken into account.It also needs to be remembered that two thirds of local government spending is covered by education and social services, leaving just one third to absorb those cuts.That includes leisure services, libraries, road repairs and street lighting but also planning and economic regeneration that can have a direct impact on jobs and prosperity locally.We shall hear how that directly affects local councils next week.The Federation of Small Businesses's Welsh policy unit chair Janet Jones said:"On the face of it the budget announced today appears to be well grounded, with the Welsh Government embracing the use of innovative forms of finance to invest in much-needed infrastructure projects."BBC Wales education correspondent Arwyn Jones writes:The Pupil Deprivation Grant (PDG) was introduced last year.Schools are allocated funds of £450 per child on free school meals, aged five to 15, which goes directly into their budgets.Following today's deal, that should more than double to £918 in 2014/15.The Welsh government has always stressed that each school will be able to decide how it spends its allocation of money.But it does expect the money to help challenge the link between poverty and achievement in schools, with a particular focus on literacy and numeracy.However earlier this year there were reports that schools were absorbing the money into their budgets, using the money to buy tablet computers and to pay for teaching assistants.So now schools have to account for their spending by publishing an online breakdown, as part of a push for greater transparency.Last month a survey of schools by the Liberal Democrats suggested that only 23% of schools use the PDG funding strictly for pupils on free school meals.But that's the only real evaluation to date of the PDG.To be fair, it is still early days, and the Welsh government has commissioned a team from Cardiff University to monitor how effective the grant has been. They're due to start reporting their findings next year.So, yes, the money may have doubled. But we'll have to wait to see if it's money well spent.Following the announcement of the draft budget, the National Union of Teachers (NUT) said while education had not been shielded from the implication of cuts to Welsh government finances, they were pleased with the "significant investment" for the PDG.NUT secretary David Evans said: "We are still lagging behind other parts of the UK. However, I think it is fair to accept that in the face of swingeing cuts to the Welsh government's funding to have £35m earmarked for schools through the PDG is something to be positive about."</body>

      <title>New Indian outbreak of encephalitis</title>
      <description>Fifteen children have died over the last few days in a fresh outbreak of viral encephalitis in India's Uttar Pradesh state, taking this year's toll to 358.</description>

      <body>Fifteen children have died in the past few days in a fresh outbreak of viral encephalitis in India's Uttar Pradesh state, taking this year's toll to 358.The disease usually occurs during the monsoon season in Gorakhpur and adjoining areas and children are the worst affected.More than 200 patients are still being treated at government hospitals.At least 6,500 children have died of encephalitis in the region since the first case was detected in 1978.Gorakhpur and adjoining districts which border Nepal in the foothills of the Himalayas are low-lying and prone to floods, providing a breeding ground for mosquitoes which commonly transmit the virus.The Press Trust of India on Tuesday reported that 15 children had died of the disease in the past few days, taking this year's toll in the state to 358.Doctors say affected patients come from between 10 and 12 districts in the region, and are mostly the rural poor.Until 2005, doctors say that the the majority of deaths were caused by Japanese encephalitis, a mosquito-borne virus.But in the past seven years, children have been dying of other forms of viral encephalitis, the exact cause of which is unclear.The diseases cause headaches and vomiting and can lead to coma, brain dysfunction, seizure and inflammation of the heart and kidney.Doctors say children between the age of six months and 15 years are the worst affected.A fifth of the children who survive have to live with neurological weaknesses, doctors say.The government says it has tried to check the regular outbreak of encephalitis in the region.Last week, India launched a vaccine against Japanese encephalitis as part of a national programme to fight the virus."Beginning with the first report in 1955 in Tamil Nadu state, the Japanese encephalitis virus has now spread to more than 171 districts in 19 states," Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said at the launch of the vaccine.In 2005, a virulent outbreak of Japanese encephalitis in Gorakhpur killed 1,000 people, mostly children. This was the worst outbreak since 1978.</body>

      <title>NI has 'half' A&amp;E consultants needed</title>
      <description>A senior A&amp;E consultant says that hospitals in Northern Ireland are operating with roughly half the required number of emergency consultants.</description>

      <date>1381222113</date>
      <body>A senior AandE consultant has said that hospitals in Northern Ireland are operating with only half the required number of emergency consultants.Sean McGovern said there are currently 56 AandE consultants working across NI's nine emergency departments."That is probably, in rough terms, half the number that we require," he addedHe was speaking as a UK-wide survey of AandE consultants found six in 10 thought their jobs were unsustainable due to staff shortages and work-load pressure.The research was carried out by the College of Emergency Medicine, which surveyed just over 1,000 UK consultants.Their responses suggested that excessive pressure on AandE consultants has the potential to put patients at risk.Dr McGovern is the clinical director of emergency medicine at the Ulster Hospital and is also vice-chair of the College of Emergency Medicine in Northern Ireland.He told BBC Radio Ulster that AandE departments in Northern Ireland were currently safe but "struggling" to provide the level of service required.He said they were trying to provide emergency care 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with 56 AandE consultants.He added that "to put it in broad context", that figure was just over half the number of politicians currently employed at the Northern Ireland Assembly, which has 108 MLAs."Obviously, people are struggling at this moment in time to have a safe system of care. That is evidenced by the need for locums on a consistent basis."He said "the system at the moment is safe for people" but added that there is a need for "radical change"."Over the next 12 months or so there needs to be change. We're heading into a difficult winter situation and we need to look at changes in the whole system of emergency care."Dr McGovern said the UK-wide survey had pointed to consultants' fears of an increased demand on AandE services and fewer doctors opting to specialise in emergency medicine."This (survey) document that has come out is in relation to the reasons why people are not entering the specialty. The high demand, especially, it's a 24/7 demand specialty. And the document clearly points out there are inequities - most people will not work beyond 60 years of age, when now the pensionable age is 68."He added that in Northern Ireland there was "clear evidence of people emigrating, there's clear evidence of people taking a few years out in Australia"."There are now new trainees coming through who would be expected to take up posts shortly, but they themselves are thinking about emigrating to other areas," Dr McGovern said.From Northern Ireland's 56 consultants, 50 responded to the College of Emergency Medicine survey.Of that number, 78% said that their job was not sustainable in its current form, the highest percentage of all UK regions.</body>

      <body>More people will soon have access to new and expensive medicines, according to the Scottish government.Health Secretary Alex Neil has told the Scottish Medicines Consortium to be more flexible when evaluating drugs.Mr Neil said there should be a new approach for medicines to be used in end-of-life care and for treating very rare conditions.The changes are the first step in a wider process which will look at how medicines are evaluated.Mr Neil's announcement came on the day a new treatment for lung cancer was approved by the SMC but a breast cancer drug will not routinely be made available in the NHS in Scotland.The decision to accept the drug crizotinib, which could be an alternative to chemotherapy for some lung cancer patients, means Scotland is currently the only part of the UK to approve the drug for use on the NHS.But at the same time the SMC ruled that new breast cancer drug - Perjeta - will not be recommended for use.Drugs manufacturer Roche said patients with the HER2 positive breast cancer taking Perjeta lived on average just over six months longer without their disease getting worse than those treated with Herceptin or chemotherapy alone.The Scottish government, which has no direct involvement in SMC decisions, is keen to make the process more transparent.Announcing his plans to revamp the system, Mr Neil extended a special fund to pay for new medicines until 2016.He also created a new approval system for doctors who want to prescribe drugs which are not routinely available.Mr Neil said: "It is only right that Scottish patients have access to medicines that are clinically justified."We have listened carefully to patients, charities and consultants and put in place a comprehensive range of measures which will increase access to new medicines and make the system better and more open for patients."Professor Angela Timoney, chair of the Scottish Medicines Consortium, said: "We share the Scottish government's objective of increasing access to new medicines for patients in Scotland."</body>

      <description>'Ancient humans' used toothpicks nearly 1.8 million years ago, a study of their teeth reveals.</description>

      <date>1381226019</date>
      <body>"Ancient humans" used toothpicks nearly 1.8 million years ago, a study of their teeth has revealed.A team studied hominid jaws from the Dmanisi Republic of Georgia - the earliest evidence of primitive humans outside Africa.They also found evidence of gum disease caused by repeated use of what must have been a basic toothpick.Writing in PNAS, the team says its findings help to explain the diversity found in hominid teeth.The researchers used a new forensic approach to look at variations on the teeth of hominids thought by some to be early European ancestors.Teeth can shed light on what the individuals ate and how old they may have been, but until now it was not clear why there was so much diversity in the Georgian hominid mandibles, or jaws.Ani Margvelashvili, lead author of the study at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, said that scientists dealing with fossil hominid mandibles should pay close attention to tooth wear and the fossil individual's age."Progressive tooth wear triggers bone remodelling processes that substantially modify the shape of the jaw during an individual's lifetime. These effects are typically underestimated when attributing fossil hominid jaws to different species," she told BBC News."The individual who was using a toothpick was young, as his or her teeth were not worn down. We also discovered a damaged area between the tooth area and the gum. There was a small cylinder-shaped lesion - in this area, if you place a toothpick it goes through."The researchers analysed four mandibles from one of the biggest collections of well-preserved early human remnants known anywhere in the world.The Dmanisi site has been valued as an important place to look at how hominids migrated from Africa."It's not very often you have one site with four mandibles. It has allowed us to see special features that have not been seen before," explained David Lordkipanidze of the Georgian National Museum.This included horizontal scratches on a lesion, visible on the root surface of one of the teeth."Scientists often describe groups with new characters as different species. Here we show in one group you can see many characteristics. It shows once more how complicated the story of human evolution is," Prof Lordkipanidze, co-author of the work, told BBC News.It is still unclear what species the Dmanisi hominids were. Experts once believed it was Homo erectus who first ventured out of Africa.But the Dmanisi hominids were not typical of the tall-standing and big-brained H. erectus. Instead, the Dmanisi individuals were short, long-armed, small-brained and thin browed. The fossils are therefore now sometimes referred to as Homo georgicus.Louise Humphrey from the Natural History Museum, London, said there had been a longstanding interest in the causes and implications of the high degree of variation in their mandibles and crania."This paper demonstrates that remodelling of the mandible associated with heavy tooth wear and continuous tooth eruption could contribute to that variation."Peter Ungar from the University of Arkansas, US, said the study could provide a new way of looking at fossils."Tooth pick markings are not uncommon in fossil hominids from this time period, but this clinical, forensic approach is new and potentially useful."Analyses of tooth movements due to wear have been more-or-less limited to anatomically modern humans, and this paper introduces the approach to paleoanthropology," Prof Ungar added.</body>

      <title>Microscopic 'bacterial zoos' made</title>
      <description>A "bacterial zoo" with microscopic cages has been built out of jelly by US researchers.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24427957</url>
      <date>1381194157</date>
      <body>A "bacterial zoo" with microscopic cages built out of jelly has been constructed by US scientists.Their findings, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, could transform understanding of how bacteria behave in communities.The bugs have different properties, which can make infections hard to treat, when they form colonies.UK researchers said bacterial communities were poorly understood and the technology could lead to progress.Big groups of bacteria can acquire antibiotic resistance where lone bacteria would be vulnerable. The nature of a community can affect how serious an infection becomes in open wounds or in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis.Scientists have been growing bacteria in Petri dishes in the laboratory for more than a century.But they do not replicate all the conditions inside the body and they cannot be used to manually build colonies of bacteria, one bacterium at a time.A team of researchers at the University of Texas have used 3D printing to build colonies.They mixed bacteria with a special form of gelatin and let it set so the bacteria were suspended like cocktail fruit in jelly.They then fired a laser at the gelatin-bacteria mix.The structure of the gelatin was altered at the point the laser beam was focused. The targeted gelatin proteins hooked up to each other so that when the rest of the gelatin was washed away it left the "cage".It allowed the researchers to build cages around individual, or small groups of bacteria in whatever shape they chose. By building up a number of cages, they could eventually build a "zoo", with every bacterium exactly where the researchers wanted it.The walls of the cage were able to keep the bacteria in place, but allow nutrients and signals to pass between cages.Prof Jason Shear, from the University of Texas, said experiments had shown that one species of bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, could become more antibiotic resistant when growing with another Pseudomonas aeruginosa.He told the BBC that the new technology could start to tackle questions about bacterial communities: "If a cluster develops antibiotic resistance, how large does it have to be, how many cells, what density is needed, is a low oxygen environment key?"We're starting to see that it really does matter how cells arrange themselves, it affects how antibiotic resistant a colony is, so it may ultimately inform therapies."Prof Ross Fitzgerald, from the Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh, said: "I think it is safe to say we know very little about bacterial communities."There are millions of bacteria in the gut, but we don't know much about how they function or relate to each other and infectious diseases are often caused by more than one pathogen, co-infection is more common that we'd thought in the past."I think this technology does provide an opportunity to simulate better in the laboratory various bacterial communities that can be present in an infection."</body>

      <title>Does reality TV help the NHS?</title>
      <description>Fly-on-the wall TV programmes may not be showing us the real National Health Service, warns Dr Johnny Marshall, of the NHS Confederation.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-23687320</url>
      <date>1376622383</date>
      <body>Reality TV finds its way into all areas of our lives - including our hospitals. In this week's Scrubbing Up column, Dr Johnny Marshall, of the NHS Confederation, asks if the picture it reflects is distorting our idea of how the NHS works.There has been an increasing range of reality shows focusing on NHS services in recent years: One Born Every Minute, 24 Hours in AandE, Keeping Britain Alive, and Junior Doctors, to name just a few.These programmes provide amazing insights into the tireless work of NHS staff and the joys and heartaches of patients and their families.They show a health service that many of us as professionals are proud to work in and are determined to improve despite the increasing pressures on it, a service that is a source of great pride.But as more NHS reality shows appear on our screens, do they really give us a representative view of everything that the health service can and does do?In particular, is there too much fixation on the hospital model, the wonder services and miracle drugs breaking new barriers, and not enough on the care outside hospitals that provides just as essential a purpose?And does this bias the public's view of what we think the "right" kind of healthcare looks like, and inhibit our acceptance of change?The NHS is a complex system, and most of us would agree that many modern treatments are unrecognisable from the original service set up in 1948.Yet the very success of improving health outcomes for the postwar big killers is resulting in a new challenge - people living longer but developing more long-term diseases in older age.To meet these challenges we need to move the emphasis away from hospitals and towards community services.I fear that reality shows, as great as they are, may inadvertently reinforce the public view that hospitals, regardless of their standards, are best, without considering the alternatives.The reality is that hospitals are only one part of the modern NHS story.Many core health services may not have the TV wow factor of pioneering treatment carried out by our big teaching hospitals, or be as thrilling as the trauma care that saves lives in the most horrific of situations.But many community-based services are life-saving - such as falls services, which have been shown to reduce death rates by as much as by 50%.And although they are not glamorous they do save lives and, importantly, allow people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. After all, there is no place like home.Services such as these are a critical part of ensuring that people receive the right care.They relieve pressure on hospitals so those who do need treatment can be seen more quickly.And they reduce the likelihood of people having to stay in hospital because the support they need to be cared for at home or in the community is not there.We have seen how the pressures grow on our AandE departments when these other services are not available.Like any other industry, if the NHS is to retain its core purpose and principle - to meet the needs of everyone and remain free at the point of delivery - and in a safe affordable and sustainable way, it has to move with the times. And we need to let it do so.We have seen many improvements across a wide range of areas, with people spending less time in hospital, so it makes sense to have fewer hospital beds and more support in the community.Similarly, by concentrating the skill and expertise needed to deliver round-the-clock specialist care for patients, we are reducing the number of places it is allocated.By improving stroke services in London, care is now located at eight sites rather than 30 sites, with hundreds of lives - and money - saved each year.These changes may seem daunting, and I have no doubt the NHS needs to do more to engage the public in debate.Often we have not explained the benefits of change well enough.Instead, we have tended to engage with communities after we have come up with a preferred solution, and so have found ourselves in long, drawn-out battles over proposals deemed to be without proper foundation or evidence.So what, you might ask, does reality TV have to do with this?TV shows are there to entertain us, and we should not knock the opportunity to improve our knowledge and insight of various aspects of medicine.But TV also provides a useful mirror that reflects society - our prejudices, fears and hopes.And if our hope is to care for everyone in the right way and in the right place, TV needs to start reflecting that.The future I describe is already a reality in many parts of the NHS, but not evenly distributed.So how about a reality series looking at the amazing work that goes on in the community?After all, that is where life really happens. Is reality TV a help or hindrance to the NHS?</body>

      <title>App aims to improve death records</title>
      <description>How mobile phones are helping register deaths</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24164824</url>
      <date>1379723133</date>
      <body>Two thirds of deaths worldwide go completely unrecorded, making it impossible to know if public health money is being spent in the right places. But could a mobile phone app be the answer?Birth and death are perhaps the most significant moments of any human life - worth writing down for posterity.But in many countries around the world, the systems set up to collect vital data about citizens have such low coverage that many deaths slip through the net.Not knowing who has died, and what they have died of, makes it impossible to build an accurate picture of a nation's health.Now technology - in the form of a specialist mobile phone app - could make all the difference.Using a technique known as "verbal autopsy", field workers visit relatives to ask them about the circumstances of a family death.By collecting the information digitally from currently hard-to-reach places, it has the potential to revolutionise our understanding of global health.In Malawi, any death that occurs outside a medical facility is not recorded.Dr Carina King, a fellow at University College London, is overseeing the implementation of the mobile phone autopsies in the Malawian district of Mchinji."We found everyone surprisingly open, and I think they find the phone quite an interesting thing when we go for interviews," she told the BBC.Verbal autopsies have been in use for about 20 years but the information was traditionally recorded on a paper questionnaire.These often lengthy documents were supposed to be analysed by two doctors, who would use the answers to deduce the likely cause of death.However the sheer scale of the task was often too great, meaning that many of the questionnaires ending up languishing in dusty rooms, completely unread."The mobile phone has been very good and means we don't have lots of paper forms," says Dr King."We have very quick access to the data and we can analyse it quickly to get the causes of death."The phone software, known as MIVA, presents a series of questions that a trained field worker uses to find out information from the family.Each question has a range of possible answers and the software intelligently skips to the next relevant question depending on the response.Most important of all is that it is designed to quickly compute the most likely cause of death.The result is stored in the phone and can be sent to a central database either by text message or internet upload.Dr Jon Bird of City University, London, who was part of the team involved in creating the software, says mobile phones provide a particularly convenient way of collecting data."Mobile phones are probably one the most widespread technologies in the world. They're cheap, they're robust and everyone knows how to use one," he told the BBC."The everyday nature of mobile phones also makes them really valuable because the people that are being interviewed don't find them intrusive."In Malawi, mobile phone autopsies are currently being used to record the cause of death in children.The project is called MaiMwana, meaning mother and child in the local Chichewa language, and it focuses on children who died before their fifth birthday.The under-five mortality rate in Malawi is 71 per 1,000 live births according to 2012 figures from the World Bank - compared to just five per 1,000 live births in the UK.Lazaro Cypriano lives in the village of Mzangawa in Mchinji district, central Malawi with his wife Magdalena and their toddler.The couple lost their first two children.Their second child died about a year ago, after a series of hospital visits due to fever. It is this death that will be the subject of the verbal autopsy.Outside urban areas, one of the main problems for collecting data is finding out when a death has occurred.To get around this, field reporters from the local community take on the responsibility of alerting the MaiMwana team of people who have died in their area.This is how Lazaro's family was identified, and the visit now affords him his first opportunity to narrate what happened to his son and have that information recorded.The interviewer asks the couple standard questions and matches their answers to the choices provided in the application's template.It's a highly sensitive and skilled job - and one which field interviewer Nicholas Mbwana can see is made easier by using a mobile phone."We go to the households, ask about the causes of death - what really happened - and we also record the GPS in order to trace the household in future," he told the BBC.Dr King says the system is key to the success of the project."GPS gives us the location of every household in the district so we can actually plot out on a map where people are dying of what, which means that you could design more sophisticated programs for targeting specific interventions."Mobile phone autopsies are being used on a limited scale at present. But the long term aim is to roll out the technique much more widely."The beauty of the system is that it's standardised and can be translated into any language you want," says Dr Bird."It's important when you're collecting data on a large scale that everyone is answering the same question, so that you know that the results are directly comparable from town to town and country to country."The World Health Organization (WHO) is already supporting the initiative and is working with institutions from the UK to Sweden to develop the technology further.The data is currently being collected in a range of databases that can be accessed by researchers interested in public health.As the project grows, researchers from the University of Umea in Sweden will co-ordinate the growing number of translations and the distribution of the technology around the world.The government in Malawi is already keen to see the results of the project."It is important for us as a ministry to know what is killing Malawians out there so that we can plan ahead and put appropriate interventions in place to prevent that - and also to put out health messages," says Dr Charles Mwansambo, Malawi's Health Secretary.The Ministry of Health has so far only been using information collected from medical facilities, which the health secretary concedes is biased data."We need comprehensive data from the hospitals and the community to plan well. We find ourselves planning for the small community that comes to hospital, not realising there is a bigger community out there that we need to budget for," he adds.Dr Mwansambo also acknowledges that a cultural practice of burying health documents with the dead makes it difficult to collect important information about deaths."When somebody dies people want to forget everything about them - those memories that will remind them of their loved ones. So unfortunately they bury the health passport along with their clothes and other possessions and we lose vital information in the process," he explains.The health passports are documents issued to parents, which record the birth weight of the baby and its gain over time, as well as which immunizations were administered and when.An elder at Mzangawa village, Kangkwamba Piri, is already talking to members of his community to drop that cultural practice."We've been doing this for a long time but it is wrong. What needs to be done is not to bury the documents and that's what we're encouraging people to do," he says.For now, it is likely that millions of deaths will still go unnoticed by official figures. But verbal autopsies recorded on mobile phones are making small but significant inroads into solving the problem.And for and his wife Magdalena, the chance to give information about what killed their child to an official is important.Magdalena says: "What I have learnt from this interview will help me take care of my third baby so he can be healthy and live long."</body>

      <body>The average Briton gets six-and-a-half hours' sleep a night, according to the Sleep Council. Michael Mosley took part in an unusual experiment to see if this is enough.It has been known for some time that the amount of sleep people get has, on average, declined over the years.This has happened for a whole range of reasons, not least because we live in a culture where people are encouraged to think of sleep as a luxury - something you can easily cut back on. After all, that's what caffeine is for - to jolt you back into life. But while the average amount of sleep we are getting has fallen, rates of obesity and diabetes have soared. Could the two be connected?We wanted to see what the effect would be of increasing average sleep by just one hour. So we asked seven volunteers, who normally sleep anywhere between six and nine hours, to be studied at the University of Surrey's Sleep Research Centre.The volunteers were randomly allocated to two groups. One group was asked to sleep for six-and-a-half hours a night, the other got seven-and-a-half hours. After a week the researchers took blood tests and the volunteers were asked to switch sleep patterns. The group that had been sleeping six-and-a-half hours got an extra hour, the other group slept an hour less.While we were waiting to see what effect this would have, I went to the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford to learn more about what actually happens when we sleep.In the Sleep Centre, they fitted me up with a portable electro-encephalograph, a device that measures brain wave activity. Then, feeling slightly ridiculous, I went home and had my seven-and-a-half hours of sleep.The following day I went to discuss what had happened inside my head during the night with Dr Katharina Wulff.The first thing she pointed out was that I had very rapidly fallen into a state of deep sleep. Deep sleep sounds restful, but during it our brains are actually working hard. One of the main things the brain is doing is moving memories from short-term storage into long-term storage, allowing us more short-term memory space for the next day. If you don't get adequate deep sleep then these memories will be lost.You might think: "I'll cut back during the week and then make up for it at the weekend." Unfortunately it doesn't work like that, because memories need to be consolidated within 24 hours of being formed.Since deep sleep is so important for consolidating memories it is a good idea if you are revising or perhaps taking an exam to make sure that you're getting a reasonable night's sleep. In one study, people who failed to do so did 40% worse than their contemporaries.Deep sleep only lasts for a few hours. My electrode results showed that during the night my brain went through multiple phases of another kind of activity, called REM sleep."This is the phase when you are usually paralysed - so you can't move," Wulff explained. "In fact the only muscles which are not paralysed are the eye muscles, and that's why it's called rapid eye movement sleep."During REM sleep an extraordinary thing happens. One of the stress-related chemicals in the brain, noradrenalin, is switched off. It's the only time, day or night, this happens. It allows us to remain calm while our brains reprocess all the experiences of the day, helping us come to terms with particularly emotional events.We get more REM sleep in the last half of the night. Which means that if you are woken unexpectedly, your brain may not have dealt with all your emotions - which could leave you stressed and anxious. Drinking alcohol late at night is not a good idea as it reduces your REM sleep while it's being processed in your body.Back at the University of Surrey our sleep volunteers had finished their second week of the experiment. What we wanted to see was the effect switching from six-and-a-half hours to seven-and-a-half hours, or vice versa, would have on our volunteers.Computer tests revealed that most of them struggled with mental agility tasks when they had less sleep, but the most interesting results came from the blood tests that were run.Dr Simon Archer and his team at Surrey University were particularly interested in looking at the genes that were switched on or off in our volunteers by changes in the amount that we had made them sleep."We found that overall there were around 500 genes that were affected," Archer explained. "Some which were going up, and some which were going down."What they discovered is that when the volunteers cut back from seven-and-a-half to six-and-a-half hours' sleep a night, genes that are associated with processes like inflammation, immune response and response to stress became more active. The team also saw increases in the activity of genes associated with diabetes and risk of cancer. The reverse happened when the volunteers added an hour of sleep.So the clear message from this experiment was that if you are getting less than seven hours' sleep a night and can alter your sleep habits, even just a little bit, it could make you healthier. "Have a lie-in, it will do you good" - that's the kind of health message that doesn't come along very often.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on FacebookTrust Me I'm a Doctor is broadcast on 10 October on BBC Two at 20:00 BST, or catch up with iPlayer</body>

      <title>What's behind the idea of banning 10-packs of cigarettes?</title>
      <description>Why are packs of 10 cigarettes being banned?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24441618</url>
      <date>1381251231</date>
      <body>Euro MPs have voted to ban the sale of packs of 10 cigarettes as part of a general tightening of the law. Why?Public health campaigners are now focusing some of their effort on trying to reduce the number of young people taking up smoking.In the UK, cigarettes are commonly sold in shops in either packs of 10 or 20. But in much of the rest of the EU the smaller pack size is banned.Fourteen EU states already have 20 as the minimum, four stipulate a minimum of 19, and in the UK and Italy the minimum is 10. Now, if the draft directive passes its final stages 10-packs will be illegal across the EU.The health campaigners describe packets of 10 as "kiddy packs" because they argue they are more affordable out of pocket money. Official figures estimate that 4% of children in England between the ages of 11-15 years old are smoking at least once a week."The thing we know about the pricing of cigarettes is that if the price is kept high through taxation that that works as a measure to help smokers to quit and also as a deterrent to young people," says Amanda Sandford research manager at Action on Smoking and Health (ASH)."If the minimum size of pack people can buy is 20 they are going to have to fork out at least £6 and £8 for a premium brand."The Republic of Ireland changed the law to make the minimum pack size 20 in 2007. Research in the run-up to the ban had suggested three-quarters of young people who smoked bought 10-packs.The number of smokers in the 10-17-year-old age group fell from 21.2% in 1998 to 18.6% in 2002, 15.3% in 2006 and 12% in 2010.But the 10-pack ban was just one of a catalogue of anti-smoking measures including a ban on in-store display and advertising, restrictions on self-service vending machines. Enhanced warnings on packets and higher prices came later.Campaign group Forest, which describes itself as "the voice and friend of the smoker", says around two million people in the UK buy their cigarettes in packs of 10, because that's what they can afford, or they want to cut down. It argues that forcing people to buy bigger packets of 20 won't help reduce smoking.But campaigners argue that tobacco displays have used 10-packs prominently to make cigarettes seem cheaper, thereby drawing in younger smokers. A number of brands in the UK also sell 14-packs which again have been attacked by campaigners."Newsagents were stopped from selling single cigarettes many years ago by law because they are accessible to children," says Sandford. "A 10-pack is within the pocket money range."There is an argument that someone cutting down might be helped by the availability of smaller packs, but Sandford argues that smaller packs also provide an easier route for a lapsing person to return to smoking.Reporting by Branwen Jeffreys and Finlo Rohrer.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Is 'addiction' an excuse to overeat?</title>
      <description>Is it helpful to label 'food addiction' an illness?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24402163</url>
      <date>1381109365</date>
      <body>"Food addiction" is becoming a popular term to explain overeating. But in this Scrubbing Up, Professor John Blundell from the Institute of Psychological Sciences at the University of Leeds warns the term is being used far too freely.Some have likened food addiction to drug addiction, and then used this term to associate it with overeating, and as a clinical explanation for the obesity epidemic, implicating millions of people.The use of the term food addiction is a step towards medicalisation and implies that normal human social behaviour is pathological.Forms of eating therefore become an illness. This attitude is not helpful and has huge implications for the way in which people view their own behaviour and their lives.The concept of food addiction comes from a combination of experimental data, anecdotal observations, scientific claims, personal opinions, deductions and beliefs.It is an over-simplification of a very complex set of behaviours.The existing evidence fails to define the precise characteristics of the actual foods concerned or the eating environment that underlies the assumed addiction risk.This is in contrast to drug addiction, where the molecule is identified and its pharmacological effect on the brain is characterised.Animal studies have shown changes to specific brain regions in those given a sugary diet - and human brain scans show activation of reward systems in the same part of the brain when sweet tastes are consumed.Therefore, it is not surprising that reward centres are activated when sweet foods are consumed, as we know that the reward circuits in the brain have been established through evolution as signalling systems that control our appetite.Many stimuli influence these areas of the brain and, in addition, there is an intrinsic drive to consume carbohydrate-rich foods to satisfy a basic metabolic need of the brain.Sweetness is a major signal for such foods but the science has not yet assessed this fully and much more work is needed before we could say that food is addictive.Attributing food addiction as the single cause underlying the development of obesity, despite the existence of numerous other very plausible explanations, is unhelpful, particularly for those trying to live more healthy lives.I am concerned that many people may potentially latch on to the concept of food addiction as an excuse to explain their overeating - the premise that it's "not my fault" and therefore, "I can't help it".This removes the personal responsibility they should feel and could act on - and they infer that their eating is a form of disease.Food addiction may offer an appealing explanation for some people but the concept could seriously hinder an individual's capacity for personal control.Binge eating disorder does exist - but it is a rare clinical condition affecting fewer than 3% of obese people.Sufferers have a strong compulsion to eat, which persists alongside the sense of a loss of control.Addiction-like food behaviour may be a component of the severe and compulsive form of binge eating disorder.But this condition does not explain the huge rise in obesity we have seen across the population.Binge eating is not a key cause of obesity and, therefore, in the context of mass public health, is not a major concern.What we need is a calm and composed analysis of what the words food addiction really mean so that people can make informed deductions about the causes of their own behaviour.If you are concerned that you may have an eating disorder and would like to speak with someone about it, you could contact the charity beat on 08456341414.</body>

      <title>Face blindness: Seeing but not seeing</title>
      <description>What is it like to live with face blindness?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24385650</url>
      <date>1381047931</date>
      <body>Imagine that suddenly you cannot recognise your mother, your partner, your child. You can see them but your brain cannot process the information - you don't know whether they are smiling, or understand their emotions.That is what happened to David Bromley, after he suffered a brain injury that left him with face blindness.David has prosopagnosia. People with this condition can see the eyes, the nose, and the mouth, what is known as the context - but they cannot see them as a whole. They do not recognise gestures or emotions."I can even recognise my wife if I walk into the house and know that she is there," says David."But if I'm in the street and she passes by and I don't know that she is going to be there, I wouldn't recognise her."David, who lives in Essex, had unknowingly been living with eye damage since birth - the arteries and veins were mixed up. This eventually caused a partial loss of sight and damage in the brain which caused the prosopagnosia.Perhaps the most difficult aspect of this condition is that people do not notice right away that something is wrong with them.He remembers when he realised there was a problem."I went to a reunion where I saw friends that I hadn't seen for 30 years. We were pretty close but we went our separate ways."On the way home, he told his brother-in-law: "'Fran and Mickey haven't changed a bit, they are exactly the same!'. And then I said 'hold on, were they wearing tank tops?'"What David was seeing was his memory of their friends back then. "My brain was telling me that there they were and what they looked like, but that wasn't the reality".After that, he discovered he was face blind.There are two main forms of prosopagnosia; developmental - where people fail to develop face processing abilities which is thought to affect around 2% of the population, and acquired, which develops after some form of brain injury and is much rarer.Dr Ashok Jansari, a cognitive neuropsychology expert from the University of East London said: "Acquired prosopagnosia is extremely rare because the type of brain damage is very specific,."It can be caused by damage to the back of the brain on the right-hand side in an area known generally as the right occipito-temporal region."David said: "I don't know what's worse - not being able to ever recognise people or at 56 years old - as it happened to me - suddenly not being able to recognise anybody".He added that the worst part is the social embarrassment."We were on holiday in Cuba and I'd been snorkelling in the sea. I was talking with this guy from Denmark, when this woman swam up and said 'buenos dias' and I went 'hello, pleased to meet you', thinking it was his wife, but it was actually my wife and I hadn't recognised her."David can see people perfectly well - but 10 or 15 minutes later he cannot recognise them.He now tells clients: "If I ignore you, I'm not being rude, it is just that I can't recognise you."Sandra, from London, who only wants to give her first name, is also afraid of social embarrassment.She had encephalitis - inflammation of the brain - 14 years ago, which left her with face blindness.Even though her prosopagnosia is mild - she can recognise people she knew before her illness - she would rather not let people know because she does not want anyone to think she has some sort of incapacity."Life with prosopagnosia is very shameful," she says.She is teacher and at work almost nobody knows that she is face blind."If I see someone every day, I can recognise them. But if one of the children says hi to me on the street, I would know it is a student from the school, but I wouldn't know who."I don't say anything to the children, I just work every day to learn their faces."But she says: "Perhaps the reason why I don't mention it is because I don't want them to think that I cannot do my job, because that's not true. I don't want to feel ashamed or that people think that there is something wrong with me."Dr Jansari understands the feelings and fears of David and Sandra.He knows of cases in which people have lost their jobs because of the condition - including a teacher who had difficulty recognising pupils, causing problems when parents came to pick up their children at the end of the day,Even though prosopagnosia is not recognised as a disability, Dr Jansari thinks it should be treated as such in some cases.This condition has no cure. "In the case of acquired prosopagnosia, once a part of the brain is damaged it is not going to 'grow' back, so it is impossible to fix the problem," he said."With developmental prosopagnosia, we don't know what causes it, but hypothetically in the future if they find that there is a genetic cause, that could be corrected - but that would be a very long way off."Even though people develop strategies to cope - because people change their appearance, they are not foolproof.Dr Jansari says: "Once David thought that a photograph he saw was of George Michael but it was of me, from a time when I used to have a goatee beard and a gold earring!"</body>

      <title>Awake under the knife</title>
      <description>Can you be conscious but feel no pain under the knife?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24357476</url>
      <date>1380930754</date>
      <body>Having a general anaesthetic is a routine part of many operations. But what happens if you are still conscious after you close your eyes?You are in the operating theatre. Anaesthetic has been administered and the countdown to unconsciousness begins.For most people, the next thing they will remember is being roused from a deep sleep.But in a small minority of cases, complete unconsciousness never comes.Being awake during surgery and not being able to do anything about it is every patient's worst nightmare.But according to one of the country's leading anaesthetists, it may not be as simple as saying that someone is either asleep or awake.Prof Jaideep Pandit, consultant anaesthetist at the Oxford University Hospitals, believes there is an alternative "third state" of consciousness somewhere between sleeping and waking that patients under general anaesthetic can and do experience."I call it dysanaesthesia," he explains. "A type of awareness where the patient is aware of the surgery but is neither conscious nor unconscious."Despite being used around the world on a daily basis, no-one is exactly sure how a general anaesthetic acts upon the body.Anaesthesia is a complicated business requiring many years of training and a proper understanding of which drugs to give, and how much.However in general, a patient can be expected to receive an anaesthetic to make them unconscious and a painkiller to numb the pain.A specialist doctor will then monitor a whole host of measurements throughout the operation to make sure that the patient really is out for the count.Even so, in an estimated 1 in 15,000 surgeries patients experience what is known as accidental awareness where they remember aspects of their surgery after waking. Around a third of those will feel pain.The question whether someone is conscious or not is mind-bogglingly complex.But Professor Pandit is investigating something that goes one step further - a twilight state that lies between conscious and unconscious states - and one that his experiments show happens much more frequently than accidental awareness.He has been able to show this through the use of something known as the Isolated Forearm Technique.Before the advent of carefully calibrated monitoring equipment, anaesthetists were able to use this technique during surgery to check whether someone was fully unconscious.The method uses a tourniquet to prevent any muscle relaxants from paralysing the forearm. This means that if the patient becomes conscious during surgery, they can move their arm to alert the surgeon.Professor Pandit has used the technique to show some fascinating aspects to human awareness.In repeated tests, one third of patients who are seemingly unconscious are able to squeeze the experimenter's fingers on command using their non-paralysed forearm. But none of them will move spontaneously to show that they are awake or in pain during surgery."To all extents and purposes, these patients are unconscious," says Prof Pandit. "But they are clearly in a state where they can respond to some stimuli like verbal commands but not to others like the surgery, possibly because they are not distressed by it."According to Prof Pandit, this suggests there is a third level of consciousness.But analysing the concept remains extremely difficult."Mainly when patients come round they will have no recall of the event or if they do they do it's just vague memories. They're unable to remember anything with clarity," he told the BBC.One way doctors frequently explain general anaesthesia to patients is to compare it to being asleep. But that is technically inaccurate says Dr Emory Brown, a professor of anaesthesia at Harvard Medical School."What we need to do to safely and humanely operate on you - to perform a procedure which is indeed, very invasive and certainly traumatic - is to put you in a state which is a coma that we can readily reverse," he told the BBC.This coma-like condition potentially protects the patient from pain and memory of the surgery. But it also helps the surgeons to operate by keeping the patient still and maintaining bodily functions at a stable level.However, what's happening in the brain as it slips from conscious into unconsciousness is still uncertain.In 2011, a research team at Manchester University were able to watch for the first time the effects on a human brain as it lost consciousness under anaesthetic.Using a novel method of brain imaging, they were able to construct real-time 3D images of the brain - rather than the 2D slices of standard brain scans.It enabled them to see how electrical activity in the brain changed as the patients went under.Interestingly, activity in the brain appeared to hot up as the patient became unconscious. This suggests that rather than switching off, the brain works hard to dampen down or inhibit consciousness while they are under the influence of anaesthetic.But scientists are still a long way off from understanding the impact on the brain as unconsciousness occurs."We are still unable at this time to define what human consciousness is, so trying to find a box of tricks that's going to monitor its absence is difficult," says Dr Kevin Fong, a consultant in anaesthesia at University College London Hospitals."But awareness during anaesthesia is something we've learnt to guard against through layers and layers of monitoring. We check surrogates of awareness such as heart rate, blood pressure and rates of respiration, and also constantly monitor the exact concentration of drugs in the blood."Indeed having memory of your surgery is one of the most important complications that both anaesthetists and patients wish to avoid.Although a national survey this year found the risk of waking up under the knife was extremely low, the effects for patients who do experience it can be acutely traumatic.For Prof Pandit, the ultimate aim of understanding human unconsciousness is to prevent such episodes from occurring."The risk of experiencing pain or distress during accidental awareness is very low at around 1 in 45,000," he explains. "But when it does happen it can have a very bad effect on the individual.""So it's not just the numbers that are driving us to research dysanaesthesia, but also the impact."</body>

      <body>A two-year-old girl born with a condition which means her brain forgets to tell her to breathe is about to leave hospital for the first time.Maisie Harris from Gillingham, Kent has been at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London since being transferred from Medway Maritime at three months old.She has congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), also known as Ondine's Curse.A new, portable ventilator has enabled Maisie to go home.The machine knows when she is able to take her own breaths and when she is likely to have a CCHS episode and require support.It has batteries and a carry case, so Maisie, who is three on 23 October, will be able to go on outings with her family and go to school when she is older.Staff on Great Ormond Street's Miffy Ward held a party for her on Friday, before she leaves hospital on Monday."We cannot wait to bring Maisie home and enjoy being a normal family," said her mother Rachel Bridger, 23."It's felt as though we have been in hospital for a lifetime."Everyone here has become like a second family to us - they know Maisie inside out."She knows her own mind but she is a really happy little girl - she's hardly ever upset."I don't think it will take her long to get used to playing with her toys at home and sleeping in her own bed for the first time."Maisie, who featured in BBC2's Great Ormond Street series last year, also has malacia of the airways, so her airways are floppy like the top of a balloon and do not hold their shape properly.Consultant Colin Wallis said: "We have been working on ways to allow a greater number of long-term ventilated children to go home."The family home is the best place for a young child to grow and develop, and Maisie will now be able to go out and about with her family, make new friends and experience everything the outside world has to offer."Dr Wallis treated Ms Bridger when she was younger. She also has CCHS, although her condition is less complex.She and Maisie's father Andrew Harris, 26, have been trained on how to use her ventilator and will be supported by a team of local carers.</body>

      <title>Can a drug make you tell the truth?</title>
      <description>Did powerful drug make Michael Mosley tell the truth?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24371140</url>
      <date>1380759219</date>
      <body>In movies and TV dramas, sodium thiopental is shown as a sinister truth serum used to get information out of captured people. Michael Mosley tried it out.One of the great challenges of living in our society is knowing when people are telling the truth or not. We lie all the time and are remarkably bad at detecting when other people are deliberately deceiving us.There are lots of urban myths about lie detecting, such as the claim that liars tend to look away, twitch their feet or touch their noses when lying (the so-called Pinocchio effect).In study after study, it has been shown that professionals such as policemen are no more reliable at detecting liars than the rest of us. So it's not surprising that for many years scientists have been working to develop "truth drugs" - drugs that will make you open up and tell all you know to an interrogator.One of the oldest and best known of these truth drugs is sodium thiopental. Although it was first developed in the 1930s, it is still used today in a range of settings, including, in some countries, by the police and the military.I was intrigued but also extremely sceptical about the claims that sodium thiopental, originally developed as an anaesthetic, could make people speak the truth if they chose not to. So I decided, as part of a series I've been making on the extraordinary history of pharmaceuticals, to try it out.Sodium thiopental is part of a group of drugs called barbiturates, drugs widely used in the 1950s and 60s to help people sleep better. They are no longer used for that purpose because they are extremely addictive and potentially lethal - Marilyn Monroe famously died from a barbiturate overdose.I decided to take a low dose of sodium thiopental under proper medical supervision, with anaesthetist Dr Austin Leach monitoring my vital signs throughout. Barbiturates work by slowing down the rate at which messages travel through the brain and spinal column. The more barbiturates there are, the harder it is for chemical messages to cross the gaps between one neuron and the next.Your whole thinking process slows down until you fall asleep. With thiopental, that happens very quickly indeed.Although it was originally developed as an anaesthetic, it was soon noticed that when patients were in that twilight zone halfway between consciousness and unconsciousness, they became more chatty and disinhibited. After the drug had worn off, the patients forgot what they had been talking about.It was decided that sodium thiopental might form the basis for a truth drug, an interrogation tool. But does it really work?I decided that I would have a go at trying to maintain the fiction that rather than being Michael Mosley, science journalist, I would be Michael Mosley, famous heart surgeon. We started with a very low dose. Immediately I felt extremely light-headed, intoxicated. But would this make me more inclined to speak the truth?There is an expression, "in vino veritas" (in wine there is truth). Alcohol is an anaesthetic and it depresses some of our higher centres, areas like the cerebral cortex where a lot of thought processing occurs. It reduces inhibitions but also slows thought processes, making it difficult to think clearly. The Roman historian Tacitus claimed that Germanic tribes held their important councils while drunk, as they thought it made effective lying harder.One theory about sodium thiopental is that it works in much the same way. Because lying is generally more difficult and complicated than telling the truth, if you suppress higher cortical functions you are more likely to speak the truth, simply because it's easier.I'm not sure if I lied effectively while under the influence of low dose thiopental, but I found that I could still lie."I am a cardiac - ha ha ha! - cardiac surgeon, a world famous cardiac surgeon," I shouted out when Dr Leach asked me what I did for a living."Would you like to tell me what the last operation you carried out was?" he enquired, politely."It was a heart bypass," I improvised. "They survived, yeah, I was awesome."Not convincing, but I had just about managed to stick to my fictional story. But what would happen when the dose was upped?At this point I felt some trepidation. There was a risk that I might say something that I really didn't want the world to know, but, confident in my ability to keep on lying, I told Dr Leach to go ahead.I was given another slightly larger dose of sodium thiopental and this time I actually felt more sober, more in control. So what happened next was a complete surprise.Again Dr Leech asked me my name and my profession. This time there was no hesitation."I'm a television producer. Well, executive producer, well, presenter, some, mix of the three of them.""So you don't have any history of performing cardiac surgery?" he asked gently."None whatsoever. None whatsoever"I'm still confused about what happened because one effect of the drug is to distort short-term memory. But I think the reason that I spoke the truth on this occasion is because the thought of lying never occurred to me.So does it work? Well my conclusion after trying it out and speaking to experts is that it will certainly make you more inclined to talk, but that when you are under the influence you are also in an extremely suggestible state. The reason you become more suggestible is probably because the drug is interfering with your higher centres, like your cortex, where a lot of decision making goes on. There is a serious risk you will say what your interrogator wants to hear rather than the truth.The truth is we don't have a reliable truth drug yet. Or if there is one out there, nobody's telling.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <body>A Chinese court says it has agreed to consider an appeal by disgraced top politician Bo Xilai.The former Chongqing party leader was convicted of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power last month and jailed for life.At his trial, he denied all the charges in a fiery defence.Bo Xilai was removed from office last year amid a scandal which saw his wife convicted of the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood.It is almost certain that Bo's conviction will not be overturned as the courts are controlled by the ruling Communist Party, which long ago pronounced the politician guilty, the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing reports.Bo's many supporters maintain that he is the victim of a political purge, our correspondent adds.The announcement regarding the appeal came on the website of the high court in Shandong, the province where Bo's trial was held."Within the appeal period, Bo Xilai refused to accept the court's first instance judgement and submitted an appeal through the Shandong Jinan Intermediate People's Court to this court," it said."After the appeal period expired on 8 October, upon examination, this court decided to accept the appeal, in accordance with the law."No time period for the appeal was specified in the brief statement. Under Chinese law, the appeal should be heard within two months but could take longer in special cases.A source close to the Bo family told the New York Times newspaper that it was unlikely that the appeal would be heard in an open court.Analysts say that the Chinese government would want to avoid giving Bo another opportunity for public defiance.Bo Xilai's downfall came as China ushered in a new generation of leaders, amid a once-in-a-decade power transfer.The charismatic politician had been seen as a candidate for the very top, until his fall from grace. It was the biggest political shake-up to hit China's ruling elite in decades.Bo was removed from office last year amid a scandal which began when his deputy, Wang Lijun, sought refuge in the US consulate in Chengdu.The incident prompted an investigation into the death of British businessman Neil Heywood.Bo Xilai's wife, Gu Kailai, was eventually convicted of Mr Heywood's murder - a crime caused, the court said, by a financial dispute. Wang was also jailed for 15 years for helping Gu cover up the murder.During his trial, Bo was also accused of abusing his office by using his position to cover up for his wife's crime.</body>

      <title>Obama to nominate new Fed chief</title>
      <description>US President Barack Obama will nominate Federal Reserve vice-chair Janet Yellen to be the next head of the US central bank on Wednesday.</description>

      <body>US President Barack Obama will nominate Federal Reserve Vice-Chair Janet Yellen to be the next head of the US central bank on Wednesday, according to a White House official.If confirmed by the US Senate, Ms Yellen would replace Ben Bernanke, who has held the post for eight years.She has been his deputy for the last two years, and would become the first woman to head the Federal Reserve.Ms Yellen and Mr Bernanke are due to appear with the president on Wednesday.She has taught at Harvard University and the London School of Economics, as well as holding a series of senior administrative positions in the US.Ms Yellen, like Mr Bernanke, is seen as a "dove", meaning she prefers to prioritise boosting employment by keeping rates low rather than worrying about inflation.Her nomination has been widely expected after former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers withdrew his candidature.One senior US senator, Democrat Charles Schumer, said Ms Yellen had the backing of politicians and would win Senate confirmation "by a wide margin".The chairman of the US Senate Banking Committee, Tim Johnson, said she had "a depth of experience that is second to none"."I have no doubt she will be an excellent Federal Reserve chairman," he added.The BBC's chief business correspondent, Linda Yueh, says the transition from Mr Bernanke to Ms Yellen is likely to be "seamless" and will not have much impact, because the two already work so closely together."I don't think there's going to be a radical change," she said on Radio 4's Today programme, adding that the changeover was unlikely to alter the timing of the Fed's withdrawal of economic stimulus.Ms Yellen's most recent academic post was at the University of California, Berkeley. A former colleague of hers there, Laura Tyson, professor of business and economics, told the BBC her nomination was "terrific news"."We have an outstanding candidate who is a wonderful match of skills and experience and temperament and reputation around the world at a time when monetary policy is extremely important," she said."Continuity is important and Janet is an outstanding candidate."A former member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve, Prof Randy Kroszner, told the BBC that Ms Yellen was "battle tested" and would be driven by the data in deciding when to reduce support to the markets.On the US budget crisis, he added: "There isn't as much adult supervision in Washington as anyone in the world would like," but the process did help stop the US reaching Greek levels of indebtedness.</body>

      <title>Water leak douses Fukushima workers</title>
      <description>Six workers at Japan's crippled Fukushima nuclear plant are exposed to radioactive water after another leak, plant operator Tepco says.</description>

      <date>1381306897</date>
      <body>Six workers at Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant have been been doused in radioactive water, its operator says.The incident happened after a worker removed a pipe connected to a water treatment system at the plant, Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) said.A senior official from Japan's nuclear watchdog said he did not believe the workers received a "seriously troubling" dosage of radiation.Fukushima has been hit by a series of toxic water leaks in recent months.The plant was badly damaged by the earthquake and tsunami of March 2011. Cooling systems for reactors were knocked out, causing meltdowns at three of them.Water is being pumped in to cool the reactors, however this creates large amounts of contaminated water that must be stored securely.Some of the water has leaked from the tanks, pipes and damaged structures, leading to concerns contaminated water is mixing with groundwater that is flowing into the sea.The detached pipe was connected to a desalination system, Tepco said, which was being used to treat toxic water before storage in tanks.Tepco said it was measuring the radiation that the workers, who were wearing protective gear, were exposed to."It is serious in that it was another problem caused by carelessness, but I do not believe it is a seriously troubling dosage," Shunichi Tanaka, chairman of Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority, was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.Japanese officials say the water to which the workers were exposed was emitting beta decay radiation - and that is important, says Jonathan Amos, the BBC's science correspondent.Beta particles are very weakly penetrating, and the workers' protective overalls would have substantially limited their exposure. The reports suggest also that no water splashed in the faces of the clean-up staff, so there would have been little chance of contamination being ingested.But the incident is just the latest in a series of mishaps at the plant, and it will no doubt bolster the view of those who believe Tepco is bungling the recovery operation, our correspondent adds.The pipe had since been reconnected and the toxic water was contained, Tepco said.The incident is the latest involving worker error. On Monday, it was reported that a plant worker accidentally switched off power to pumps used for cooling the damaged reactors.Last week, workers overfilled a storage tank, and about 430 litres (100 gallons) of radioactive water may have leaked from the tank, with some flowing into the sea, Tepco said.</body>

      <title>Azerbaijan president seeks new term</title>
      <description>The people of oil-rich Azerbaijan are voting in an election in which the incumbent President, Ilham Aliyev is expected to win a third term.</description>

      <body>The people of oil-rich Azerbaijan are voting in an election in which the incumbent President, Ilham Aliyev, is expected to win a third term in office.The president has not even run an election campaign, so confident is he of victory, a BBC correspondent says.Opposition activists circulated photos and videos appearing to show individuals casting multiple ballots - though these could not be verified.Mr Aliyev inherited the presidency from his father, Heydar Aliyev.He has stifled dissent and pushed through a constitutional referendum scrapping presidential term limits.Human rights groups say in the run-up to the elections the government has launched an unprecedented crackdown on its critics.But political opposition in the country of nine million has also been blunted by prosperity, with oil wealth more than tripling gross domestic product.The main opposition candidate, representing a coalition of parties, is history professor Jamil Hasanli, 61.Other challengers include five MPs and two low-profile opposition figures. Critics say some are in collusion with the government and only in the race to dilute the opposition vote.The BBC's Rayhan Demytrie says that none is expected to present a serious challenge to the president who enjoys immense power after inheriting the presidency from his father in 2003 and who will be standing for a third term.Mr Aliyev abolished a two-term presidential limit in a controversial referendum in 2009.International monitors have said that the pre-election atmosphere has been characterised by a combination of apathy and fear.A recent Human Rights Watch report said that in the last year the government had intensified its crackdown on civil society and passed a number of laws to curtail any form of dissent, including a $10,000 (£6,000) fine for organising or attending an unsanctioned rally.Dozens of political activists have been arrested and jailed.Azerbaijan is an important supplier of oil and natural gas for European markets.In the decade since Mr Aliyev succeeded his father, Azerbaijan has been through a boom that has raised living standards.The president has courted Western states attracted by its strategic location and status as a producer and transporter of oil and gas.But dissent has grown over what critics describe as the country's endemic corruption and a large divide between rich and poor.One rights group has said that the number of political prisoners has doubled in advance of the elections.Oil multinationals BP, ExxonMobil and other Western companies have invested billions of dollars to tap into Azerbaijan's oil riches.An oil pipeline supported by the US and the European Union to pump Azerbaijani crude oil via Georgia to Turkey - bypassing Russia - went into operation in 2005.The pipeline is seen as an important part of the West's aim of reducing Europe's dependence on Russian energy resources.</body>

      <body>Samsung Electronics, the world's best-selling smartphone maker, has launched a handset with a curved display screen.Called the Galaxy Round, the smartphone will feature a 5.7in (14.5cm) display.The launch comes just days after rival LG said it would begin production of curved-screen phones next year.Digital display technology has been progressing towards curved screens. Both Samsung and LG already offer curved organic light-emitting diode (OLED) television sets.Samsung said the curved screen display would help consumers use some of the features on the phone, including those that enable users to check information such as date, time and missed calls when home screen is off, with more ease.At the same time, users can also change music tracks on their phone, even while its display is off.The Galaxy Round will initially be launched only in South Korea. The firm gave no indication of its plans for a global launch.The global smartphone market has been growing rapidly.According to research firm CCS Insight, worldwide smartphone sales will hit nearly one billion in 2013 - accounting for more than half the total of 1.7 billion mobile phones sold.As as result, smartphone manufacturers have been keen to offer new products to win consumers.With display technology moving towards flexible and bendy screens, it is one area that companies have been looking at.Some analysts said that while the initial offering of curved-screen phones may not see huge sales, the segment of flexible displays was one to keep an eye on."These phones may not be a game-changer today, but they are definitely an indication of things to come," Manoj Menon, managing director of consulting firm Frost and Sullivan, told the BBC."Flexible displays have a huge role to play as the market place for 'internet of things' grows."This refers to the idea that many things in homes or offices - not just typical computers - will soon be connected to the internet.The sector is tipped by many to be a major industry in the near future.Mr Menon said that as flexible screens became more advanced and cost-effective to make, it was likely to speed up growth in the sector.</body>

      <title>Obama: Republicans using 'extortion'</title>
      <description>US President Obama says he is willing to hold budget talks with Republicans, but not if they "demand a ransom in exchange for doing their jobs".</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24453693</url>
      <date>1381285503</date>
      <body>US President Barack Obama has said he is willing to hold budget talks with Republicans, but not until they agree to lift "threats" against the economy.Republicans "don't get to demand ransom in exchange for doing their jobs", Mr Obama said, by demanding concessions in policy before reopening government.The US government shut down last week when Congress failed to agree a budget.Republican leaders on Tuesday renewed their calls for Mr Obama to open negotiations over ending the impasses.Republican House Speaker John Boehner told reporters he was "disappointed that the president refuses to negotiate".He said the president's position not to talk with Republicans "until [they] surrender" was not sustainable, and any discussions regarding the debt ceiling must address how the nation is "living beyond its means".At the White House, Mr Obama said he had spoken to Mr Boehner and was "happy to talk with him and other Republicans about anything".But Mr Obama said any negotiations on the ongoing government shutdown or the debt limit "shouldn't require hanging the threats of a shutdown or economic chaos over the heads of the American people"."We can't make extortion routine as part of our democracy," Mr Obama said. "Democracy doesn't function this way. And this is not just for me. It's also for my successors in office, whatever party they're from."He also warned of the repercussions of defaulting on the government's debt should Congress fail to raise the borrowing limit, currently set to be reached on 17 October.Mr Obama said breaching the borrowing limit could disrupt capital markets, undermine international confidence in America, permanently increase the nation's borrowing costs, add to its deficits and debt, and pose the "significant risk of a very deep recession".The US government partially shut down operations on 1 October after Republicans who control the House of Representatives refused to approve a budget, saying they would only do so if Mr Obama's healthcare reform law were delayed or stripped of funding.Mr Obama and the Democrats have thus far refused, noting the law was passed in 2010, subsequently approved by the Supreme Court, and was a central issue in the 2012 election which Mr Obama won.At the same time, the Republicans have refused to approve an increase in the US debt limit unless it is accompanied by significant spending cuts and other policy concessions.Mr Obama maintains Mr Boehner could end the current government showdown by allowing the House to vote on a "clean" budget bill that does not alter the health law, because that could pass with votes from both Democrats and moderate Republicans.But doing so would risk damaging his standing with the most conservative elements of his caucus, analysts say.US and foreign officials and economists have warned of severe economic consequences if the US defaults on its debt because the government is unable to borrow money to fund its obligations."Failure to lift the debt ceiling would be a major event. Prolonged failure... would almost surely derail the US recovery," said International Monetary Fund economic counsellor Olivier Blanchard on Tuesday."But the effects of any failure to repay the debt would be felt right away... leading to potentially major disruptions in financial markets both in the United States and abroad."Philippine President Benigno Aquino warned that what happens in the US "affects us all"."The US economy is the number-one economy in the world," he said while attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) in Bali."The world economy obviously is not in a position to withstand too much shock at this time."At the White House, Mr Obama said that if the US eventually dealt with the impasse "the way we should", then "folks around the world will attribute this to the usual messy process of American democracy but it doesn't do lasting damage".He sought to reassure US bond holders and others that the country remained good for its debts, despite the shutdown."My message to the world is the United States always has paid its bills and it will do so again," Mr Obama said.The shutdown has already had a significant impact in the US.Hundreds of thousands of workers have been sent home without pay, national parks, museums, and tourists sites have been closed, research has halted, and more.Visitors to the iconic Grand Canyon in Arizona have got no further than locked gates around the site, which normally attracts 18,000 visitors a day as weather cools about summer highs.Workers in small towns that depend on Grand Canyon tourism for their livelihoods are having to resort to food banks.On Monday, US defence contractor Lockheed Martin said it would put 3,000 workers on unpaid leave, warning that number would rise if the government shutdown continued.That announcement followed United Technologies' decision to lay off 2,000 employees temporarily, saying manufacturing had halted because there were no government inspectors working to sign off products.</body>

      <title>Venezuela's Maduro seeks new powers</title>

      <body>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has asked parliament to give him special powers to fight corruption and what he called economic sabotage.The country is currently facing shortages of food and essential goods, power cuts and soaring inflation.The measure, used on four occasions by his predecessor Hugo Chavez, would allow Mr Maduro to govern by decree for a set period of time.The opposition fears he will use his powers to stifle any dissent.A vote to implement the so-called Enabling Law is due to be held in the National Assembly next week.In a three-hour speech to the assembly, Mr Maduro called it a "matter of life or death" for the country's socialist revolution."If corruption keeps expanding and perpetuating its destructive capitalist logic, there will be no socialism here," he said.Mr Maduro vowed to root out corruption in all aspects of Venezuelan life, stressing that even members of the governing Unified Socialist Party would not be exempt from scrutiny.But Henrique Capriles, the opposition presidential candidate who narrowly lost the election to Mr Maduro earlier this year, said the decree would not solve the country's problems."I don't think this law will bring any economic or social benefit to Venezuelans," he said. "They're going to use the law to persecute and distract the people from their real problems."Although Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves, its people are suffering from the highest inflation in Latin America, sluggish growth and shortages.A power cut last month left more than two-thirds of the country without electricity.Finance Minister Nelson Merentes has conceded that while the social-oriented policies of Mr Chavez have improved the living standards of many Venezuelans, they did not solve the "structural problems" of the economy.Hugo Chavez died of cancer in March after 14 years in power.His vice-president and handpicked successor, Mr Maduro, has pledged to continue his policies but does not command the same support enjoyed by Mr Chavez.</body>

      <body>A special war crimes tribunal in Bangladesh has handed a life sentence to a former opposition minister.Abdul Alim, 83, of the Bangladesh National Party was guilty of nine of 17 charges dating back to the country's 1971 war of independence from Pakistan.Six current and former leaders of the main Islamic party, Jamaat-e-Islami, have recently been convicted by the same tribunal.Dozens of people have died during violent protests against the verdicts.Last week the tribunal sentenced another senior BNP party member, Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, to death for crimes against humanity.Alim was spared the death penalty, despite the gravity of his crimes, because of his poor health, Attorney General Mahbubey Alam told reporters."He will remain in the prison until his death," he said.Alim was convicted of involvement in the deaths of 372 Hindus in one of the war's worst atrocities.Prosecutors said he killed up to 600 people in the north-western Joypurhat district where he headed a branch of a pro-Pakistani militia called Razakar Bahini.The war crimes tribunal was set up by the Awami League-led government in 2010 and opposition parties have accused it of pursuing a political vendetta against its opponents.Human rights groups and the BNP have both said that the tribunal fell short of international standards.Bangladesh government figures estimate more than three million people died in the war of independence. Other researchers put the figure at between 300,000 and 500,000.</body>

      <body>At least 60 Tibetans were injured after Chinese police fired into a crowd of protesters, rights group Free Tibet and US-based Radio Free Asia report.The shooting occurred on Sunday in Biru county, as villagers demanded police free a man who led separate protests in September, the reports said.There had been clashes in September after Tibetans refused to fly China's flag outside their homes, reports said.Tibet is governed as an autonomous region in China.However, rights groups have accused China of religious and political repression - something denied by the Chinese authorities.A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said that she was unaware of the reports, and declined to comment further, Reuters news agency said.A policeman at the public security bureau in Tibet's Biru county also told AFP news agency that there was "no protest, no one injured".Foreign media are only allowed to enter Tibet at the invitation of the Chinese government. These visits are rare and tightly controlled, making it almost impossible to independently verify reports.On 6 October, a crowd of protesters gathered outside the local government office appealing for the release of local Dorjee Dagtsel, Radio Free Asia, and UK-based Free Tibet, said.Security forces opened fire into the crowd, injuring at least 60 and leaving two in a critical condition, they said.Free Tibet added in the statement that the forces "deployed tear gas" and beat the protesters.However, the International Campaign for Tibet said it was not clear if the troops fired live rounds or tear gas.Free Tibet named the two critically injured Tibetans as Tagyal, who had a broken femur, and Tsewang, who was shot in the jaw. It said they had been taken to a hospital in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa.All the phone lines in the region have been disconnected, exile Tibetan web portal Phayul reported.The incident appears to be latest sign of the continuing unrest on China's Tibetan plateau, the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing reports.Since serious ethnic rioting broke out in 2008, more than 100 Tibetans have set themselves on fire in protest against what they say is Beijing's repressive rule, our correspondent adds.Beijing claims a centuries-old sovereignty over the Himalayan region, and says Tibet has developed considerably under its rule.Send your pictures and videos to yourpics@bbc.co.uk or text them to 61124 (UK) or +44 7624 800 100 (International).

      <body>One of Australia's most notorious criminals, Mark "Chopper" Read, who later became a novelist, has died of liver cancer, his manager says.Read spent 23 years in jail for kidnapping and malicious wounding but was never charged with murder, despite once claiming he had killed 19 people.He became a best-selling crime author and successful artist after his release.He was the inspiration for 2000 film Chopper, which starred Eric Bana.The 58-year-old died on Wednesday at Royal Melbourne Hospital, his manager said. He was diagnosed with cancer in 2012.Read grew up in Melbourne, and was a ward of the state by the time he was a teenager.He became known as a "standover man", who stole from drug dealers and abducted and tortured other criminals for money.Chopper Read was a criminal-cum-celebrity and a household name in Australia, the BBC's Jon Donnison in Sydney reports.The self confessed hitman from Melbourne's underworld spent almost half his life behind bars on a string of violent offences, our correspondent adds.He once claimed to have killed 19 people, although he said in an interview earlier this year that the real number was "probably about four or seven".Former prison chaplain Peter Norden told ABC radio that Read mostly "wasn't a successful crook. He got caught for most of the things he did."After his release from prison in the 1990s he wrote several best-selling crime books, and turned to painting, which he described as "a form of therapy" to relieve his anger.</body>

      <title>'No bailout' for the Earth's climate</title>
      <description>Governments forced to rescue the world's banking system are being warned by the OECD that there will be no bailout if there is a climate crisis.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24450438</url>
      <date>1381303090</date>
      <body>Governments forced to rescue the world's banking system are being warned there will be no bailout if there is a crisis in the Earth's climate system.That is the view of the head of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).Angel Gurria is expected to rebuke nations failing to curb CO2 emissions in a speech on Wednesday.He will say the analysis of the climate threat is far clearer than were the warning signs for the financial crisis.Mr Gurria is due to address the topic of climate change, investment and energy policies in a London lecture co-organised with the London School of Economics and the Climate Markets and Investors Association (CMIA)The talk coincides with a report in The Independent newspaper that claims UK Chancellor George Osborne is about to reject the recommendations of government advisers by slowing the drive to tackle global warming.In his speech, Mr Gurria will ask if leaders overseeing the financial system that led to the "train wreck" of the banking crisis would have been happy to take the risks if they had known the consequences.“Unlike the financial crisis, we do not have a 'climate bailout option' up our sleeves,” he will say.“And despite all the attention given to climate change deniers, our understanding of the scale of the risk is much better developed than our understanding of the financial risks, pre-crisis.”An OECD source said the secretary-general's remarks were directed both at countries which had dragged their feet on reducing emissions and those which had taken a leadership position but were now starting to wobble.Asked if the latter group included the UK, where the chancellor argued last week that Britain "should not be in front of the rest of the world” in tackling climate change, the source said the OECD was fully aware of the situation in Britain and all its member states.Mr Gurria will also warn that renewable technologies will be harmed by stop-start policies. Renewables firms in the UK have benefited from a stable policy framework in the medium term, but are uncertain about long-term investments as right-wing Conservatives attempt to abandon CO2 targets for 2030, arguing that they damage competitiveness.He also takes a swipe at fossil fuel subsidies, currently estimated at over $500bn a year globally. These typically provide cheap motoring for the rich, he says, and fail to help the poor.The world, he says, needs to become zero-carbon in the second half of the century, and needs to start on that pathway immediately if climate change is to be stabilised.Mr Gurria, like the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon last week, is trying to galvanise action for an ambitious agreement in the planned 2015 UN climate conference in Paris.Rich nation governments struggling against recession have been going slow on climate change policies, and developing nations have argued that they need space to expand emissions to grow their economies and draw people out of poverty.Mr Gurria will argue that creating an infrastructure that leaves people dependent on fossil fuels will prove more costly overall in terms of the economy and public welfare.Interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, he said: "Countries like Britain have been leading the charge (on climate change) and have to continue to do that. It's because of leadership of UK that EU has seen that this is the way to go - and the rest of the world too."He said energy policy has become extra challenging following technology improvements on exploiting fossil fuels. "We grew up with scarcity of oil and fuel, now we are entering a world of abundance so we're really going to have to think very hard on this."The OECD is to publish a paper on the most effective ways of managing carbon cuts in the economy.Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin</body>

      <body>A letter has emerged containing an eyewitness account of the capture of Australian outlaw Ned Kelly in the 1880 Glenrowan shoot-out.The letter was written by Donald Sutherland, who was working nearby, to his parents in Scotland.In it the bank clerk describes the armour Ned Kelly wore and his calm demeanour after being shot many times.The letter, handed down through several generations, is to go on display at the State Library of Victoria.Ned Kelly, who led a gang of outlaws in Victoria, was hanged at Old Melbourne Jail in 1880 for killing three policemen.He was seen by some as a cold-blooded killer and by others as a folk hero who fought the colonial authorities.It was in the Victoria town of Glenrowan that he was shot and captured by police, while other members of his gang, including his brother, were killed."On hearing of the affray, I at once proceeded to Glenrowan to have a look at the desperados who caused me so many dreams and sleepless nights," Mr Sutherland wrote in his letter."I saw the lot of them. Ned, the leader of the gang, being the only one taken alive. He was lying on a stretcher quite calm and collected notwithstanding the great pain he must have been suffering from his wounds."The outlaw, he said, was "encased in armour made from the moule boards [curved plates] of a lot of ploughs"."Now the farmers about here have been getting their moule boards taken off their ploughs at night for a long time but who ever dreamed it was the Kellys and that they would be used for such a purpose," he commented.Ned, he said, did not "look like a murderer and bushranger"."He is a very powerful man aged about 27, black hair and beard with a soft, mild-looking face and eyes, his mouth being the only wicked portion of the face," he said.Mr Sutherland said he enclosed in his letter hair from the tail of Ned Kelly's horse - a mare who "followed him all around the trees during the firing".In a statement, Victoria's state librarian Sue Roberts called the letter a "remarkable document"."This letter is a very personal account of events that have become part of Australia's folklore," she said.</body>

      <title>Too much sex kills male marsupials</title>
      <description>The males of some species of marsupials die from exhaustion after engaging in strenuous mating activities, say scientists.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24443104</url>
      <date>1381237115</date>
      <body>A new study suggests that some species of marsupials mate with such vigour and intensity that it quite literally kills them.The scientists say that males die in large numbers after mating with as many partners as possible in sex sessions lasting up to 14 hours at a time.A key factor in this costly coitus is the promiscuous behaviour of females who all breed at the same time of year.The study is published in the journal PNAS.Suicidal reproduction or semelparity is well known in many species of plants and fish but is rare in mammals.This new study looks at the mating behaviour of 52 different species of small, insect eating marsupials in Australia, South America and Papua New Guinea.They found that in some of these animals, such as the antechinus, the phascogale and the dasykaluta, male attempts to father offspring cost them their lives.This "dying-off" trait is more likely to be found in species living in regions where food was plentiful in one period of the year.This makes the females of the species more likely to shorten their mating seasons so they only give birth when there is plenty to eat.In these marsupials, the females have also synchronised their reproductive cycles.They are also highly promiscuous, as this promotes sperm competition among the males, explained Dr Diana Fisher from the University of Queensland, the lead author of the study."The females that mate with more males, get to weed out the poor quality males because of this sperm competition," she said."The ones that succeeded in fertilisation were the ones with better offspring survival."While this ensures sturdy descendents, the process is fatal for the fathers.The males attempt to mate with as many females as possible in long, laborious bouts, driven by high levels of hormones including testosterone.These chemicals in turn elevate their levels of stress hormones and their systems are unable to cope, says Dr Fisher."If we humans get huge stress, we have a feedback system and we bring it down."But the marsupials just keep ramping it up more and more and are driven to spend all their time mating competitively.She added: "And its the stress hormone that does that."Dr Fisher says that this is sexual selection driven by females. It is a different strategy to other mammals where the males sometimes fight for the right to mate or are selected by the females on the basis of looks or strength."In this case, it is having the one that's best at sperm competition," she said.The research team says that the strategy of losing half the species in the act of reproduction can work well as an evolutionary strategy if the population is dense."Every other animal has a cost of reproduction," said Dr Fisher."It's just they've got it all at once."Follow Matt on Twitter.</body>

      <title>US high court weighs election limits</title>
      <description>The US Supreme Court hears arguments in a case that could further expand the amount of wealthy donors' money in the US political system.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24449605</url>
      <date>1381252927</date>
      <body>The US Supreme Court has heard arguments in a case that could further expand the amount of wealthy donors' money in the US political system.A Republican donor is challenging a legal limit on total political contributions in an election cycle.Proponents of the law argue overturning it would unfairly increase wealthy individuals' influence in politics.The arguments come three years after the court loosened strictures on corporate spending in elections.Contribution limits were established by Congress in the 1970s in an attempt to restore the public's faith in government after President Richard Nixon's resignation in the Watergate scandal.At issue in the case argued on Tuesday, McCutcheon v Federal Election Commission, is the total amount of money a single individual can give to candidates across the country in a given two-year election cycle.The plaintiff is Republican Shaun McCutcheon, owner of the Coalmont Electrical Development Corporation in Alabama.In the 2011-12 election cycle he gave $1,776 (£1,100) each to 15 candidates for Congress.He wanted to give the same amount to 12 other candidates, but was blocked by the federal limit on overall individual contributions, which is tied to inflation and will be $123,200 for 2013-14."It's a very important case about your right to spend your money how you choose," Mr McCutcheon has said.He told the Associated Press he planned to spend several hundred thousand dollars in this election cycle between candidates and outside political groups.Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr, who argued in favour of the limit on behalf of the Obama administration, told the court on Tuesday that if the limit were overturned, donors "could potentially funnel massive amounts of money to a favoured candidate".A controversial high court ruling in 2010, known as Citizens United v Federal Election Commission, loosened restrictions on political spending by nominally independent groups known as political action committees.While those groups are barred from directly co-ordinating with candidates' campaigns, they may spend large amounts of money promoting a candidate or running negative adverts again the candidate's opponents. They are funded by business interests, wealthy individuals and, to a lesser extent, labour unions.The McCutcheon case does not directly challenge limits on the amount an individual can give to a single candidate.But groups that favour strict limits on the amount of money in politics say a broad ruling by the court overturning the limits would threaten the integrity of US elections."This is not about some abstract concept," said Fred Wertheimer, president of campaign finance reform group Democracy 21."It's about re-establishing a system where huge contributions can be given directly to benefit candidates and parties, and it will create opportunities for the corruption of governmental decisions."Mr Verrilli argued on Tuesday that without the aggregate limits, one donor giving the maximum allowed to every congressional candidate, political party and political action committee would exceed $3m in contributions in a single election cycle.Only a small portion of all current donors to political campaigns would be affected by a removal of the aggregate limit, should the Supreme Court rule in favour of Mr McCutcheon.According to the Center for Responsive Politics, 646 people in the 2012 election cycle hit the maximum overall donation limit.Those people gave more than $93m directly to candidates and committees.During arguments, the nine justices seemed closely divided.Chief Justice John Roberts, who was in the majority in the 2010 Citizens United case, appeared to be looking for middle ground that would allow individual donors to give to more candidates without opening the door to multi-million dollar direct contributions, analysts said.</body>

      <body>The man who died after setting himself on fire on the Washington National Mall on Friday has been identified as New Jersey resident John Constantino.Constantino, 64, poured petrol over himself in sight of the Capitol building and set himself ablaze.His family said his death was "not a political act or statement, but the result of his long battle with mental illness".Passing joggers attempted to save Constantino, who died in hospital.Police said Constantino was conscious and breathing at the scene after passers-by attempted to extinguished the flamesBut he died of his injuries later that evening, and officials had to use DNA and dental records to identify him because of the extent of his burns.The Constantino family said in the statement that it wanted to acknowledge the heroism of the emergency workers and bystanders who tried to save his life.The family said it was "shocked and deeply saddened", but did not address the nature of his mental illness and asked for privacy.Lt Pamela Smith of the US Park Police said she was not aware that Constantino had carried any signs with him or had articulated a cause.A witness, Katy Scheflen, told the Associated Press she did not hear the man say anything intelligible before he set himself on fire.The National Mall, a public park in the heart of Washington DC between the US Capitol and the Lincoln Memorial, is a popular tourist destination. It has been nominally closed during the partial US government shutdown.Constantino's death came a day after an unarmed woman was killed after a police chase through the city following her attempt to bypass a security gate at the White House.</body>

      <body>Protesters in Brazil have disrupted an official visit to a football stadium being built for next year's World Cup.A group of some 50 people stormed the Arena Pantanal, in the western city of Cuiaba, as it was being inspected by the Secretary General of Fifa, Jerome Valcke.They shouted slogans and held banners criticising the huge amounts spent in preparations for the World Cup.The incident raises new concerns about security during the event."Go home!" and "World Cup for whom?" read some of the banners carried by protesters - most of them striking teachers and postal workers.They have called for more public spending on health and education.The stadium is expected to cost about £140m ($230m; 500m reais).Many in Brazil have criticised the decision to build a stadium for more than 40,000 spectators in Mato Grosso state, which does not have a single team in the country's top football division.But the Brazilian government said that hosting four World Cup matches at the stadium will draw the world's attention to the natural beauty of the Pantanal Conservation Area, a home to vast tropical wetlands.Mr Valcke said the protesters had to take the long term benefits into account."People have freedom and that is part of democracy. But the workers who are here trying to finish the stadium should not be targeted," said Mr Valcke.He said he had a meeting with Governor Silval Barbosa to find out if the works were going to meet the deadline set by the Fifa, the world's football governing body.Officials say the Arena Pantanal is 85% ready, though none of the seats in the stadium have been installed.Fifa has demanded that all venues are ready by 20 December.The 2014 World Cup will kick off in Sao Paulo on 12 June. The final match will be played in Rio de Janeiro's Maracana stadium on 13 July.</body>

      <title>Argentine leader surgery 'went well'</title>
      <description>Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is in good spirits after surgery to treat bleeding on her brain, her spokesman says.</description>

      <date>1381251025</date>
      <body>Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has undergone surgery to treat bleeding on her brain, at a hospital in Buenos Aires.The operation, which has lasted about two hours, "went very well" said her spokesman, Alfredo Scoccimarro.Ms Fernandez, 60, is expected to remain in intensive care for the next 48 hours and stay in hospital until next week.She was ordered to rest for at least a month after doctors discovered the subdural haematoma."The president is in good spirits and is already in her room," said Mr Scoccimarro.The president's leave of absence means she will have to suspend campaigning for congressional elections.The break from the campaign trail is considered awkward for the president as some opinion polls have suggested the government could lose control of Congress in the poll on 27 October.While her party has done well in the primaries on a nationwide level it has failed to win a key seat in the province of Buenos Aires, where her rival and former cabinet chief Sergio Massa beat Ms Fernandez's candidate.Medical experts say recovering from this type of surgery is a long process, and her lay-off is now likely to be longer than a month.Vice-President Amado Boudou, who is facing a corruption investigation, will be in charge of the country during her leave.The president's spokesman, Alfredo Scoccimarro, issued a statement on Sunday saying her doctors had carried out a brain scan in August after a previously undisclosed trauma thought to have been caused by a fall.They found nothing untoward, but on Saturday, she went to hospital for checks for an irregular heartbeat and headaches, and a further scan revealed the subdural haematoma - bleeding between the brain and the skull.The hospital treating her said on Monday she had experienced a slight loss of muscular strength in her left arm, and recommended surgery to drain the haematoma.President Fernandez was first elected in 2007 and then returned to power by a comfortable majority in 2011.Her health has been followed closely since the sudden death of her husband, former President Nestor Kirchner, from a heart attack in 2010.She has been admitted to hospital on a number of occasions while serving as president. She has low blood pressure and had to have a thyroid gland removed in 2012.</body>

      <body>Italy's prime minister and the European Commission president have been heckled on a visit to the island of Lampedusa.Enrico Letta and Jose Manuel Barroso are on the island following one of Italy's worst migrant boat disasters. At least 274 people died when their boat capsized and sank last week.Residents shouted "disgrace" and "shame" as the men began their visit.Lampedusa is a key destination for boats carrying migrants who want to leave Africa and head to Europe.Many residents in Lampedusa have long complained that the authorities in Italy and the European Union have not been doing enough to deal with the thousands of migrants who come ashore each year.A boat carrying 500 migrants - most from Eritrea and Somalia - capsized last Thursday about 1km (half a mile) from Lampedusa.There were 155 survivors, and 274 bodies have been found. Divers are still searching for those who remain missing.A small group of activists and local residents gathered at the airport as Mr Letta and Mr Barroso arrived in Lampedusa.They shouted "shame", "disgrace" and "killers" as the men walked from their plane."They should be ashamed of themselves. They should solve this humanitarian problem," one protester was quoted by Agence France-Presse news agency as saying.Mr Barroso and Mr Letta are paying tribute to the victims of the shipwreck and meeting members of the emergency services, as well as refugees from Somalia, Eritrea and Syria.They are joined by the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Cecilia Malmstroem, who said on Tuesday she had called for the EU to launch Mediterranean-wide search and rescue patrols to intercept migrant boats.She said she planned to ask the EU's Frontex border agency to draw up a "concrete proposal" for an operation that would allow better tracking, identification and rescue of migrant boats.Frontex currently helps Italy to intercept migrant boats, but the two EU operations in the southern Mediterranean have limited resources - a total of four ships, two helicopters and two planes.</body>

      <title>Libyan PM calls for Western help</title>
      <description>Libya's prime minister says illegal weapons passing through Libya pose a threat to the entire region and calls for international help to combat it.</description>

      <date>1381272153</date>
      <body>Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan has called on Western powers to help stop the spread of militancy in his country.In an interview with BBC Newsnight he said Libya was being used as a base to export weapons throughout the region."The movement of these weapons endangers neighbouring countries too, so there must be international co-operation to stop it," Mr Zeidan said.On Monday Libya questioned the US ambassador over the capture of a suspected al-Qaeda leader in Tripoli.Anas al-Liby, wanted over the 1998 bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, was seized by US commandos in an early morning raid on Saturday.The US has defended the capture saying that Mr Liby - whose real name is Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai - was "a legal and an appropriate target".But Libya's national congress on Tuesday demanded his return, calling his capture a kidnapping that amounted to a "flagrant violation of the country's national sovereignty".President Barack Obama told reporters on Tuesday that the US had strong evidence that he had "planned and helped execute plots that killed hundreds of people - a whole lot of Americans"."He will be brought to justice," he said.Mr Liby is believed to have been one of the masterminds behind the 1998 US embassy attacks, which killed more than 220 people in Kenya and Tanzania.The 49-year-old has been indicted in a New York court in connection with the attacks and has been on the FBI's most wanted list for more than a decade with a $5m (£3.1m) bounty on his head.He was living openly in the Libyan capital Tripoli before his capture. BBC Newsnight reporter Tim Whewell says that this and the brazenness of the US operation are further signs of the current weakness of the Libyan state.Libyan Justice Minister Salah al-Marghani, who on Monday summoned US ambassador Deborah Jones over Mr Liby's capture, said the US-led operation had caught Libya's leaders off-guard."The news itself was definitely a surprise to me," he told reporters. "And having seen the prime minister on the same night, I haven't seen anyone more surprised than Ali Zeidan about what happened."On Sunday, the prime minister's office said he had asked the US for clarification on the raid and stressed Libya was "keen on prosecuting any Libyan citizen inside Libya".However, Mr Zeidan has said that ties between the Libya and the US will not be affected by the operation.There has been little visible co-operation between the US and Libya since the terror attack on the US consulate in Benghazi last year, in which the ambassador Chris Stephens was killed, our reporter says.Speaking to BBC Newsnight before the capture of Mr Liby, Mr Zeidan said that the huge proliferation of weapons in Libya poses a serious security threat."Weapons are being smuggled out of and into Libya by groups which are trying to murder and assassinate people, and spread terror in the country," he said."You see every day the militants fight each other, the issue is that the arms are available for the Libyan citizens, they are available for the young people, it is available at homes and in stores everywhere."Proliferation is not just a concern for Libya but for its neighbours too.Western intelligence agencies believe Libya now has the largest unsecured stockpile of weapons in the world, with millions of tons of arms unaccounted for since the 2011 revolution that toppled Muammar Gaddafi.They include 3,000-8,000 so-called Manpads - Man Portable Air Defence Systems - portable missile systems which are a threat to all types of aircraft, including civilian passenger planes.These surface-to-air missiles, which are easy to use and easy to hide, are the weapon of choice for groups like al-Qaeda, say security experts.</body>

      <description>At least nine people are killed and dozens injured in a fire at clothing factory in Gazipur, near Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, officials say.</description>

      <body>At least nine people have been killed in a fire at a clothing factory near the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka, emergency officials say.Local media said about 50 people had been hurt in the fire, which broke out late on Tuesday in Gazipur.It was feared the number of people killed could rise.Safety standards in Bangladesh's garment factories are notoriously poor. More than 1,100 people died in April when a factory outside Dhaka collapsed.Another 2,500 people were injured in the disaster in the Ashulia district on the outskirts of the capital, where most of the clothing industry is based.Last November, 112 workers were killed in a fire at another clothes factory in the area.The cause of the latest fire was not immediately clear, but reports said it broke out at a knitting section of Aswad Composite Mills.A local official at the scene said that fire fighters had been unable to recover any bodies.One man came to the site to find his uncle told the BBC that he had not been able to find him."I found out that the fire started from a [textile] machine," he said. "When the silencer of the machine exploded, the fire spread and the factory caught fire."Immediately after the fire many people ran out of the factory but a few could not get out."Reports quoted officials saying water shortages and a lack of nearby fire stations had allowed the blaze to escalate and continue for several hours.Factory Director Emdad Hossain told the Daily Star in Bangladesh that 170 workers were on duty on the two floors when the fire broke out."Almost all of them managed to come out of the building," he said.Mr Hossain suffered injuries while rushing out of the building.Although most members of a reported workforce of 3,000 had left the building for the day, those killed are thought to have been working overtime.District administrator Dilruba Khanom said that emergency services were waiting until sunrise to complete their search of the factory. They warned that the number of casualties could rise."They have managed to control the fire in most parts of the factory, but the warehouse is still burning," he said. "The bodies are charred beyond recognition."Police officer Ameer Hossain told the Daily Star that nine bodies had been recovered. Other accounts put the toll at 10.Clothing makes up around three-quarters of Bangladesh's total exports, and the factory collapse prompted protests and calls for improved safety measures.Dozens of international retailers agreed a plan last July to conduct inspections at factories from which their goods were sourced.Send your pictures and videos to yourpics@bbc.co.uk or text them to 61124 (UK) or +44 7624 800 100 (International).

      <body>Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, has agreed to dissolve its joint venture with one of India's leading business groups, Bharti Enterprises.Wal-Mart will acquire Bharti's stake in the venture, which operates wholesale cash and carry stores in India.The US firm said that it was still keen to grow its business in India.It said it would "continue to advocate for investment conditions" that allow foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail in the country."Through Walmart's investment in India, including our cash and carry business, supply chain infrastructure, direct farm programme and supplier development, we want to serve India and its people," Scott Price, chief executive of Wal-Mart Asia said in a statement.India opened up its multi-brand retailing sector to foreign investors last year. But so far no foreign firm has applied to enter the market.Many industry players and analysts have said that strict pre-conditions attached to investments have kept companies away.Prompted by these concerns, India eased key rules governing foreign direct investment (FDI) in the sector in August this year.The previous rules made it mandatory for foreign supermarkets to source 30% of their products from small Indian firms.The government has retained that requirement, but says foreign firms will be given five years in which to reach that target, giving them the option of importing goods from overseas initially.Foreign retailers will also be allowed to set up shop in cities with a population of less than one million, which they had been barred from earlier.</body>

      <body>Police in Mexico City have freed members of Spanish indie band Delorean, who were kidnapped on Sunday by a criminal gang.The four musicians were the victims of a type of crime increasingly popular in Mexico, known as "virtual kidnapping".They were phoned in their hotel by someone posing as a policeman and told to move to a different hotel, where the kidnappers were.The gang then demanded a ransom from relatives in Spain, police said.The kidnappers seemingly left the musicians unguarded, but they were so scared that they did not try to escape.The families eventually informed the police, who located the musicians 48 hours after they went missing. No arrests have been made.The gang had demanded a £235,000 ($380,000) payment in order to release the band.Delorean, an indie group formed more than 10 years ago in the Basque seaside town of Zarautz, was in Mexico to take part in an electronic music festival, Mutek.The musicians were unharmed and in good health. They are expected to give a media conference when they return to Spain.Earlier, the Mexican government published new figures showing that there were more than 105,000 kidnappings in the country in 2012.The figure have caused surprise in Mexico as they are much higher than previous estimates, says the BBC's Will Grant.Fewer than 2,000 of the kidnappings that took place last year were reported to police.</body>

      <description>The EU urges Mediterranean-wide search and rescue patrols to intercept migrant boats, as the alleged captain in the Lampedusa tragedy is held.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24440908</url>
      <date>1381253847</date>
      <body>The European Commission has called for the EU to launch Mediterranean-wide search and rescue patrols to intercept migrant boats.The move by Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem was prompted by the deaths of at least 274 migrants whose boat sank off Italy's Lampedusa island.She said this was a moment to show real European solidarity beyond words.The alleged skipper of the Lampedusa boat, a Tunisian man, is being held in Sicily, suspected of manslaughter.Ms Malmstroem told reporters after the meeting she had asked ministers from the 28 member states to allow a major operation by the EU's Frontex border agency "covering the whole Mediterranean, from Cyprus to Spain".First reactions from EU member states were encouraging, she said."We will ask Frontex to make a concrete proposal and come back to us," she said.Frontex is currently helping Italy to intercept migrant boats, but the two EU operations in the southern Mediterranean have limited resources - a total of four ships, two helicopters and two planes.The search and rescue patrols would "help better tracking, identification and rescue of boats, especially migrants' boats", the commissioner's spokesman Michele Cercone said."It could help prevent tragedies like the one in Lampedusa," he added.The search for bodies from the boat that sank on Thursday off Lampedusa, between Sicily and Africa, continued throughout Tuesday.Divers, who have already recovered dozens of bodies, brought up another 42, bringing the total number to 274. One of those brought to the surface was a child.Many of the 500 people who were on board are still missing. The victims were mostly from Eritrea and Somalia.The alleged captain of the ship, Khaled Bensalam, 35, is in custody in Agrigento, Sicily. Investigators suspect him of being responsible for the sinking and he could face multiple counts of manslaughter, though no charges have yet been laid, the BBC's Rome office was told.Until his arrest, he was with other survivors of the shipwreck at the reception centre in Lampedusa, Italian media report.It is thought that other than the skipper, there was only one crewman aboard, and that he did not survive.In Luxembourg, Ms Malmstroem asked EU member states to "give their political support and to make the necessary resources available".The EU's external border agency, set up in 2004, has seen its budget cut from 118m euros (£100m; $160m) in 2011 to 85m euros in 2013.Tens of thousands of migrants attempt the perilous crossing from North Africa to Sicily and other Italian islands each year.Accidents are common, but last week's shipwreck was among the deadliest on record.Co-operation had to be increased, the EU commissioner said, with migrants' countries of origin and the countries from which they travelled to Europe.A partnership with Morocco was already in place and the EU would hope to do the same with Tunisia and other North African states.Italian Interior Minister Angelino Alfano backed the European Commission plan, arguing that more had to be done to save lives. "We are in the middle of the Mediterranean: we have saved thousands and thousands of people - now we are asking the EU for a hand in strengthening border control," he said.However, there was some concern among diplomats that the new mission was doomed to failure. One told AFP that it would result in migrant boats taking to sea as soon as they saw the Frontex ships in order to be rescued.There were 155 survivors of the Lampedusa accident, which happened about 1km (half a mile) offshore.The wreck is lying about 47m (155ft) below the surface, which means the recovery divers can only stay on the bottom for a short time.Divers have begun removing bodies from the hull, where a navy officer said they found corpses "so entwined one with the other" they were difficult to pull out.Malta and Greece, as well as Italy, have long made appeals previously for more assistance from the EU for the states that bear the brunt of mass immigration.The UN refugee agency is also urging EU countries to share the immigration burden more equally.A spokesman told the BBC that the experience of a small Italian island handling large numbers of migrants clearly showed how southern Europe was having to deal with an unfair share of the problem.But northern EU nations, such as Sweden, Germany and Denmark, insist they take a large proportion of migrants. "Germany is the country that takes in the most refugees in Europe," Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said on Tuesday.A spokesman in Berlin told German media that 65,000 refugees had been taken in last year, compared with 15,000 in Italy.EU states have for years been unable to reach agreement on a common migration and asylum policy.Italian PM Enrico Letta is expected to travel to Lampedusa on Wednesday with Ms Malmstroem and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.Key migrant routes to southern Europe</body>

      <title>Weapons watchdog to boost Syria team</title>
      <description>The global chemical weapons watchdog says it will send a second team of inspectors to boost its programme to destroy Syria's stockpile.</description>

      <date>1381242612</date>
      <body>The world's chemical weapons watchdog has said it will send a second team of inspectors to boost its programme to destroy Syria's stockpile.The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it had made "a constructive beginning" to "a long and difficult process".However, it did not say how many extra inspectors would be deployed, or when.Under a UN resolution, Syria's chemical weapons mixing and filling equipment must be destroyed by 1 November.In a statement, OPCW chief Ahmet Uzumcu also said that the Syrian government had submitted additional information updating its initial disclosure, which would help the OPCW plan its future activities.Mr Uzumcu was delivering his first report to the 41-nation OPCW executive council.The BBC's Anna Holligan in the Hague says this report is significant because the content is based on evidence gathered by the OPCW experts on the ground in Damascus.They were part of an advance party, sent out to hold talks with the Syrian authorities and smooth the way for the destruction process to begin, our correspondent says.On Sunday, members of the joint OPCW and UN mission observed Syrian staff using cutting torches and angle grinders to destroy missile warheads, aerial bombs, and mixing equipment.This dismantling work is continuing at undisclosed locations this week, as the conflict in Syria continues.UN Secretary-General Ban ki-Moon has described it as "an operation the likes of which has never been tried before".US Secretary of State John Kerry has welcomed "a good beginning", and says the next step is to secure a date for the so-called Geneva-2 peace talks.However, human rights groups point out that chemical weapons are only responsible for about 2% of the estimated 100,000 deaths during the two-year conflict, in which armed opposition groups are seeking to topple President Bashar al-Assad.The groups warn that disposing of the chemical capabilities will not stop the war.Earlier on Tuesday, the UN estimated that more than eight million Syrians could have been forced from their homes by the country's civil war by the end of 2014.The number of refugees outside Syria is expected to hit 3.2m by the end of this year and 5.2m by the end of 2014.A further 2.25m are projected to be internally displaced next year, which would bring the number of those affected to more than a third of Syria's pre-war population.The estimates of the scale of the future human impact of the conflict were made at a meeting of UN agencies and NGOs late last month.However, a UN spokesman emphasised that the figures reflected the estimates made at the time, and that the final projections used to plan UN agencies' response in 2014 - due to be released this December - are likely to be even higher.</body>

      <title>UK reopens Iran diplomatic channels</title>
      <description>The UK will restore some diplomatic relations with Iran by appointing a charge d'affaires to work with the country, Foreign Secretary William Hague announces.</description>

      <body>The UK will restore some diplomatic relations with Iran by appointing a charge d'affaires to work with the country, William Hague has announced.But the foreign secretary warned the country's president to follow up his more "positive" words on its alleged nuclear weapons programme with "concrete actions".Mr Hague told MPs further progress would require "substantial change".Iran will appoint a charge d'affaires to work with London in return.Mr Hague said it was hoped this would help "on the way towards eventual re-opening of both our embassies".The UK shut its embassy in Tehran in November 2011 after it was attacked by protesters. It then ordered the closure of the Iranian embassy in London.Mr Hague said the recently elected government of President Hassan Rouhani had "presented themselves in a much more positive light than recent governments".But Iran was still in breach of six United Nations resolutions over its alleged development of nuclear weapons, he said, adding: "We must test the Iranian government's sincerity to the full."Mr Hague also said: "We are looking forward to serious proposals from Iran to follow up on their stated desire to make rapid progress on negotiations."It will be very important for Iran's relations with the international community for the marked change of presentation and statements to be accompanied by concrete actions and a viable approach to negotiations.He added: "In the absence of change to these policies, we will continue to maintain strong sanctions. A substantial change in British or western policies requires a substantive change in that programme."For Labour, shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander criticised the government for not moving more quickly to restore relations with Iran, saying it had "misjudged" the situation and risked being "left behind".He added: "On Iran, it is time for the government to catch up with our American allies."</body>

      <title>Failings found in border safeguards</title>
      <description>A report highlights a series of failings in the government's £500m "e-borders" programme to gather information on passenger movements in and out of the UK.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24453677</url>
      <date>1381300904</date>
      <body>A report has found failings in the government's £500m "e-borders" scheme to gather information on passenger movements in and out of the UK.The independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, John Vine, found that fewer than two-thirds of passenger movements were covered.And almost 650,000 records relating to smuggling had been deleted, he found.The Home Office said UK border technology was the most advanced in Europe but agreed there was more to do.The aim of the e-borders programme, devised by the Home Office in 2003, was to improve immigration controls by collecting advanced passenger information (API) on every scheduled inbound and outbound journey to and from the UK.That would enable staff to "export the border" - preventing passengers from travelling where this was considered a threat to the UK.A target was set to collect data on at least 95% of passenger movements by December 2010 but, at the time of the inspection last year, only 65% were being recorded.The report, parts of which are deleted from the public version, said: "We found that the e-borders programme had failed to deliver the planned increases in API and this had a detrimental impact on the delivery of all anticipated benefits."It blamed legal difficulties surrounding the collection of API on European flights and a failure to test the e-borders concept on train and sea routes.Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Vine said people with an alert against their name for "terrorist sympathy or activity" should be met at airport arrivals gates by border staff, but that was only being done at Heathrow among Britain's airports.He also said the e-Borders system was supposed to stop people flying to the UK if they had previously been excluded or deported from the country, but "not one person" had been stopped under that system.This method of stopping people flying when they tried to check in at foreign airports was supposed to be a "key benefit" of e-Borders, Mr Vine added.The Home Office said it now carried out advance checks on 78% of those flying to Britain and required API from everyone coming from outside the EU.Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: "We have the best coverage of any country in Europe but we are working to improve our coverage further."We will take the findings of the independent inspector into account as we continue to develop our API policies and coverage."Inspectors found that the data set was not extensive enough for the e-borders programme to meet another objective - to "count in and out" all foreign national passengers - and that this wouldn't be possible until 2018 at the earliest.The report, which contains 14 recommendations, also criticised the "poor quality" of data on watch lists used by the e-borders system to alert border staff of criminals, terrorists and other suspects.It said this created inefficiencies and a greater volume of work which officials were unable to manage."This, coupled with a policy of prioritising immigration work over customs work, resulted in the deletion... of over 649,000 records concerning potential drug and tobacco smuggling, over a 10-month period," the report said.It said the deletions had a "significant impact on the ability of staff at the border to seize prohibited and restricted goods and deal with those responsible."However, the Home Office played down the importance of the information that had been deleted, saying that anyone who had committed a serious offence would already be on a separate "warnings index" and intercepted on arrival.Officials said the details that had been removed were potential matches between two databases, less than 1% of which would have prompted an alert.Among a series of positive findings, inspectors said information gathered as a result of the e-borders scheme had resulted in the arrest of thousands of people for offences including murder and rape.Immigration caseworkers were able to conduct travel history searches using the data and identify people who had left the UK after being ordered to do so.Mr Vine said he was pleased that the e-borders "high-profile alerts" system was being used to intercept high-risk individuals at the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport - but pointed out that this was not happening at any other port or airport.He suggested that a fundamental re-think was needed for the programme, which, it is estimated, will cost £536m by 2015.Mr Vine said: "The Home Office should now define clearly what the aims of the e-borders programme are ahead of the new procurement exercise, and be transparent about what e-borders will deliver and by when."</body>

      <body>A pilot who fell ill at the controls of his plane forcing his passenger to land the light aircraft has died, police have said.The man collapsed in the cockpit of the plane after taking off, leaving the "inexperienced" passenger to make an emergency landing.The plane landed at Humberside Airport under the guidance of instructors called in by air traffic controllers.Police said they were unable to confirm the cause of death.A spokesman for Humberside Police said: "The pilot of the plane sadly died last night."We are not treating it as suspicious and we are in a position whereby formal identification will take place later today."He added that a file would be prepared for the coroner.Police, fire and ambulance crews were called to the North Lincolnshire airport after a distress call was made from the light aircraft.Two flying instructors were called in to advise the passenger how to bring the plane down.One of them, Roy Murray, said: "I think without any sort of talk-down he would have just gone into the ground and that would have been the end of it."The passenger and pilot were the only people on board the aircraft, which had taken off from Sandtoft Airfield 25 miles (40km) away.Eyewitnesses described seeing sparks as the plane landed at about 19:50 BST on Tuesday.Stuart Sykes said he saw the aircraft land: "It came down with a bump, a bump, a bump, hit the front end down, I heard some crashing and it's come to a halt."Two incoming flights were delayed while the aircraft was removed from the runway.</body>

      <title>Fuel supply warning for Alitalia</title>
      <description>Italian oil firm ENI says Alitalia needs to raise fresh finance or risks having its fuel supply cut.</description>

      <body>Alitalia risks having its fuel supplies cut off as the company struggles to avert a financial crisis.Italian oil company ENI said it could not keep supplying fuel if the airline failed to raise fresh finance.ENI's chief executive said his firm could not provide credit "to a company whose future seems no longer assured".After years of losses, Alitalia is trying to raise 100m euros ($136m; £84m) from its shareholders to keep the business running.Those shareholders are due to vote whether to extend fresh financing on 14 October.Alitalia was rescued from bankruptcy in 2009 by a consortium of investors.Under the deal Air France KLM took a 25% stake in the carrier.Analysts say Air France KLM wants to buy the rest of Alitalia.But the French carrier is unlikely to want Alitalia's debt burden and would probably want to make deep cost cuts."This is a tug of war over the price," said Andrea Giuricin, a transport analyst at Milan's Bicocca University."Air France KLM would like to buy Alitalia as cheaply as possible, preferably without having to take on its debt, while the Italian shareholders want to get something out of this as well."Reports say that Italy's civil aviation authority ENAC will meet company executives this week to assess whether Alitalia is a viable concern.On Tuesday the government held talks with the company to resolve the crisis and further talks are due this week.</body>

      <title>UK industry output in surprise fall</title>
      <description>UK industrial production fell unexpectedly in August, showing its biggest decline for nearly a year, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics.</description>

      <date>1381310710</date>
      <body>UK industrial production fell unexpectedly in August, showing its biggest decline for nearly a year, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Industrial output decreased by 1.1% month-on-month, surprising analysts, who had expected a 0.4% rise.The biggest factor in the decline was a big fall in manufacturing output, which was 1.2% down on July levels.It was the biggest overall drop in output since September 2012.At the same time, the ONS published figures showing that the UK trade deficit was largely unchanged in August.The gap between imports and exports for the month was estimated at £3.3bn, compared with £3.4bn in July.The decrease in UK manufacturing output was led by companies making pharmaceutical products, electronics, food and beverages.But other sectors also contributed to the surprise fall in overall output, with the oil and gas industry also underperforming.Private-sector surveys of production have been less downbeat. Last week, the Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for September indicated that UK manufacturing had grown for the sixth consecutive month.Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturers' organisation EEF, described the latest ONS figures as "a mixed bag of data which breaks the run of consistently upbeat indicators in recent months".She added: "Whilst August unwound some of the gains in June and July, the declines were particularly concentrated in a few sectors, namely food, pharmaceuticals and electronics."However, the trade news was a little more positive, with exports edging higher, thanks to gains in markets outside Europe."Despite this monthly setback on production, manufacturing should make a positive contribution to third-quarter GDP growth and other business surveys seem to align behind a continuation of this trend through the final months of the year."However, Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency brokers World First, said the figures were "a further sign that the UK's economic revival cannot be guaranteed"."While the IMF may have sung the UK's praises [on Tuesday], today's number shows that the broad-based recovery that so many have been hailing has significant tasks attached," he said."The divergence between the recent, multi-year highs on PMIs and the official data is worrying and a little difficult to explain. Could businesses be overly exuberant without cause?"</body>

      <title>Dyson balks at EU 'dust-free' tests</title>
      <description>Dyson is mounting a legal challenge against the EU's labelling policy for vacuum cleaners, saying it gives a misleading impression of the firm's products.</description>

      <body>British manufacturer Dyson is mounting a legal challenge against the EU's labelling policy for vacuum cleaners, saying it gives a misleading impression of the firm's products.Sir James Dyson, the firm's founder, said the EU's energy efficiency ratings were based on dust-free lab conditions, favouring "old-fashioned technology".Dyson said home performance was "very different to that in the laboratory".The firm has pioneered the bagless vacuum cleaner since 1991.From September 2014, all vacuum cleaners sold in the EU will be rated according to their performance and energy efficiency, on a scale from A to G.The EU says the measure is part of efforts to meet its goal of cutting carbon emissions and saving energy.It wants consumers to take the environment into consideration when they are buying household appliances.Dyson said it had launched a judicial review at the European General Court in Luxembourg, because it felt the rating system would mislead people looking to buy a new vacuum cleaner."The regulations stipulate that vacuums should be tested in laboratory conditions: empty and with no dust," said the firm."This does not simulate real-life conditions and is not representative of the view of testing and standards bodies across Europe."Dyson said its bagless design meant that its cleaners did not clog with dust and therefore wasted less energy.It also said the EU's tests did not take into account the cost, "on both the pocket and the planet", of replacement bags and filters for older types of vacuum cleaner."Dyson fully supports the ambition to make the environmental impact of a machine easier to understand," said a spokesman for the firm."However, we are challenging aspects of the label because it will mislead consumers - notably the fact that the machines are tested in lab conditions free of dust, and the fact that environmentally damaging and costly consumables are not considered."</body>

      <title>English people for England - Wilshere</title>

      <body>Only English people should play football for England, says midfielder Jack Wilshere.Manchester United's Adnan Januzaj could play for England if he passes Fifa's five-year residency requirement, as he is yet to commit to another country.Midfielder Januzaj, 18, is eligible for selection by Belgium, Serbia, Albania and Turkey.Asked about the issue, Wilshere said: "If you live in England for five years it doesn't make you English."The 21-year-old Arsenal player added: "If I went to Spain and lived there for five years, I'm not going to play for Spain."England boss Roy Hodgson has confirmed he has been monitoring Januzaj.Wilshere, who earlier this week insisted he is not a smoker despite being pictured with a cigarette outside a nightclub, added: "We have to remember what we are."We are English. We tackle hard, are tough on the pitch and are hard to beat."We have great characters. You think of Spain and you think technical but you think of England and you think they are brave and they tackle hard. We have to remember that."The only people who should play for England are English people."Liverpool's Raheem Sterling, born in Jamaica, and Wilfried Zaha of Manchester United, born in Ivory Coast, are part of the England Under-21 set-up along with West Brom's Saido Berahino, who left war-torn Burundi as a 10-year-old."It's a difficult one," said England Under-21 coach Gareth Southgate. "He [Januzaj] has not played for anyone else."We have lots of boys in our squad who were not born here, whose families have fled here."There are some wonderful stories and they are all incredibly proud to play for England."I'm torn with it. The world is changing. People move and work abroad. It is important to know why someone wants to play for you."Former Football Association chairman David Bernstein said England must "play within the rules and get the best team we can".He told BBC Radio 5 live: "There is much more fluidity in terms of population movement."I would say we must play within the rules but if players are eligible, I would be inclined to pick the best players we can get. Other countries do that."Cricketers Kevin Pietersen, Matt Prior and Jonathan Trott play for England despite being born in South Africa.Southgate added: "We seem to have embraced the cricket team that has won the Ashes, but it is a really interesting, philosophical debate."Januzaj, who joined United in 2011 from Belgian club Anderlecht for a reported fee of nearly £300,000, was born in Brussels.He has turned down the advances of Belgium, and has not won a cap at any level for any country.Januzaj qualifies for Albania through his Kosovan-Albanian parents, Turkey through his grandparents and Serbia as Kosovo's independence has not been recognised by the United Nations.Kosovo's national team are not members of Uefa or Fifa.Fifa, the sport's governing body, states a player is eligible if "he has lived continuously for at least five years after reaching the age of 18 on the territory of the relevant association".That would mean Januzaj would have to wait until 2018 to represent England, assuming he remains in the country until he turns 23.</body>

      <body>Sonny Bill Williams has been added to New Zealand's World Cup squad after belatedly making himself available.The 28-year-old dual-code star was not included in the 24-man party named on Monday because of "other commitments".However, coach Stephen Kearney confirmed second row Williams has now replaced 21-year-old Tohu Harris."I'm sorry for taking someone else's spot," Williams told BBC World. "Now that I'm there, don't expect anything other than a full-hearted performance."Williams started his career in league, but switched codes in 2008 and therefore missed out on a place in New Zealand's squad for that year's Rugby League World Cup, which his country went on to win.Despite helping the All Blacks win the 2011 Rugby Union World Cup, he said he could not turn down a chance to play in another major competition for his country."When I spoke to Stephen Kearney my body was sore and tired," said Williams, who helped the Sydney Roosters win the NRL Grand Final on Sunday, the day before the squad was announced."I've not had a rest since 2008 and thought I could go on a vacation with my family but I made a rash decision without thinking about it."Afterwards I thought what I would miss out on and remembered how bad I felt in 2008."I couldn't look at myself in the mirror so I had to make the phone call and say I was available."New Zealand are aiming to win the Rugby League World Cup for the second time and Williams has said sorry to Melbourne Storm's Harris, who will now miss out.Harris helped Storm beat Leeds Rhinos 18-14 to win the World Club Challenge in February and made his international debut two months later, in a 32-12 defeat against Australia.He has also rejected the chance to be a non-playing member of New Zealand's touring squad for the World Cup."I've offered my apologies to him and obviously he is hurting," added Williams, who has played seven rugby league internationals for New Zealand, but is yet to be on the winning team."It's just a really tough situation and all I can do now is play as hard as I can and help the boys retain the World Cup."The competition will be staged in England, Wales and France and Williams could play for New Zealand against the Cook Islands in a warm-up match at Doncaster's Keepmoat Stadium on Sunday, 20 October.New Zealand then face group games against Samoa on 27 October, France on 1 November and Papua New Guinea on 8 November.</body>

      <title>Fellowes defends Downton storyline</title>
      <description>Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes has defended a controversial storyline in the latest episode of the costume drama, which drew complaints from viewers.</description>

      <date>1381242722</date>
      <body>Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes has defended a controversial storyline in the latest episode of the costume drama, which drew dozens of complaints.ITV received 60 complaints after Anna May Bates (Joanne Froggatt) was attacked and raped by a guest's valet."The whole point of the way we do things on Downton is we don't do them gratuitously," Fellowes told the BBC."We are interested in exploring the resultant emotions and the effect these things have on people," he added.Fans took to Twitter on Sunday to express their "shock" and "distress" at the "sick" and "sensationalist" storyline.But Fellowes, who won an Oscar for the screenplay of Gosford Park in 2002, rejected the criticism, saying he was "sorry" if fans felt the show couldn't "go there".He pointed out the attack took place behind closed doors, saying: "If we'd wanted a sensational rape we could have stayed down in the kitchen with the camera during the whole thing and wrung it out."The point of our handling is not that we're interested in sensationalising but we're interested in exploring the mental damage and the emotional damage," he said.Froggatt also defended the scenes, telling BBC Breakfast she was "proud" that the show could tackle such a weighty subject."I think it's a really brave thing to do... I believe that Julian has written it in a way that is not gratuitous at all," she said."We all felt a big responsibility to get it right."Fellowes said the plot development did not signal a new direction for the drama, which is now in its fourth series."Downton deals in subjecting a couple of characters per series to a very difficult situation and you get the emotions that come out of these traumas."When you handle very difficult and sensitive story lines, the minus is that they do expect more work from the audience but the plus is they can take you to a helpful place in terms of self analysis," he said."The fact that [viewers] engage with it is sort of what you pray for as a programme maker, because with most series that's not happening."It's always a compliment that everyone gets so involved in the show," he added.An average of 9.2 million viewers watched Sunday night's episode, with a peak audience of 9.9 million.A warning alerting viewers to the upsetting scenes involving Mrs Bates and Lord Gillingham's valet Mr Green was broadcast before the episode aired.ITV said on Monday it had received 60 complaints, while broadcasting watchdog Ofcom also received a number of complaints - although it cannot yet release figures."All of this is about taking characters to the brink," explained Fellowes."We know Anna is a strong personality but it doesn't mean she will be able to be strong through this."The whole rest of the series, for her story and for Bates' story, is seeing how she negotiates her way through this. I don't think we ever have a sense that she leaves it behind," he said.Froggatt said later episodes would "explore the emotional journey of Anna and Bates after this event", adding that Fellowes had "done a beautiful job at hitting the right note with it".She said that the writer was "adamant" that they would not depict "that kind of violence against a woman" on screen, adding: "That's something he didn't want in a show of his, and that's an incredible thing in this industry in this day and age."She said the show still had "shock value" without "anything graphic" being shown.The actress explained that the series' historical advisor, Alastair Bruce, had told her that 100 years ago, when the story was set, women felt unable to tell the police about sexual assaults."There was still such a stigma attached to any kind of attack like this that you were very much in danger of losing all of that," she said."And if a woman lost her reputation that would bring shame upon the house, she could lose her job, she could lose her husband. And society still saw it as no smoke without fire, 'well he's only a man - he couldn't help himself.'"Nigel Harman, who played Anna's attacker, previously told ITV's This Morning he was "amazed" by the storyline, "because for a show like Downton it really leaped out as a bold and risky idea".The drama has not been afraid to shock viewers in the past, with the unexpected death of key character Matthew Crawley bringing last year's Christmas episode to a sombre conclusion.</body>

      <title>Robin Thicke ad ruled 'too sexual'</title>

      <body>An advert featuring singer Robin Thicke performing his number one hit Blurred Lines must not be shown before 19:30 as it is too sexual, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has said.The ruling was made after 97 complaints about the ad for Beats Pill speakers, which features scantily clad women.The ASA said while it accepted some viewers might find the ad distasteful, it would not cause widespread offence.However, it ruled the "overall tone" was sexual.The advert, which is based on the controversial music video for Thicke's song, shows three female models dancing and interacting with the product while dressed in hot pants and crop tops.It also features one woman kneeling on her hands and knees with a Beats Pill laid on her back.Those that complained said the commercial was sexist, objectified women and was degrading to women.Others said it was inappropriate at a time when children would be watching.In its response, Beats Electronics International said the advert was not intended to be offensive or encourage any inappropriate stereotypes, saying the women were confident, self-assured individuals who were "not subservient to the male character".It added the dominant images were of the product being used as dumbbells, a hotdog, binoculars and medicine, which were "strong, playful images that most viewers would not see as having any sexual connotation".In its ruling, the ASA acknowledged some viewers could find elements of the advert distasteful - "particularly the shots of the women's bodies with their heads obscured and the shot of the woman on all fours".It said as the shots were brief, it did not consider the ad - when taken as a whole - showed any sustained, overtly sexual or provocative behaviour.However, it concluded the overall tone was sexual and was not suitable for broadcast before 19:30.The unrated video for Thicke's Blurred Lines - in which the female models appeared topless - was branded misogynistic and banned from YouTube earlier this year.A second version of the video, featuring the women in the same outfits they wore in the Beats Pill advert, later replaced the original.</body>

      <title>Egypt border tensions pressure Hamas</title>
      <description>Egypt border crackdown increases strain on Gaza's Hamas rulers</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24455490</url>
      <date>1381307298</date>
      <body>The large white tents constructed in a row along the Gaza Strip's border with Egypt are ragged and abandoned; most of the thousands of smugglers who usually work in them are absent.Four Palestinians are using a horse and a winch to bring up buckets of dirt as they try to dig a new passage deep under the border with Egypt.Nearby, Abu Ahmed, and his workers are struggling to make repairs to their tunnel. Until recently they were part of a profitable trade, bringing in Egyptian construction materials.Now their business has literally collapsed."Ninety-five per cent of the tunnels are not functioning. It's almost total destruction," Abu Ahmed tells me. "The Egyptians demolished my tunnel and filled it with water."Recently Egypt's military has brought in bulldozers to clear a house and olive grove concealing tunnel entrances on its side of the border. Passages have been flooded or filled with sewage and blocked off.A network of hundreds of tunnels was constructed after the Islamist group Hamas overran Gaza in 2007, a year after winning parliamentary elections.Israel - which considers Hamas a terrorist organisation - and Egypt tightened a blockade on the Palestinian territory.Smuggling was a way of bypassing the restrictions. It was an important lifeline for the 1.7m Palestinians living in Gaza who relied on the imports of everyday goods and cheap Egyptian fuel.However, the underground passages have also been used to transfer weapons, and by armed militants to cross the border unseen. The Egyptian authorities see them as a serious threat to security.Attacks by Islamist militants in the Sinai region, which neighbours Gaza, have increased dramatically in the past three months, since the ousting of Egypt's Islamist President, Mohammed Morsi.The new Cairo government accuses Hamas, which has ideological links to Mr Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood movement, of supporting the extremists. It denies doing so.Yet local media reports suggest that the Egyptian army has even threatened a military intervention in the Gaza Strip if attacks on its troops in the Sinai Peninsula are not stopped.As tensions have risen, numbers of Palestinians being allowed to cross through the Rafah border crossing have been restricted. Thousands have got stuck trying to leave Gaza.Yousef Helou had to wait for two weeks to exit so he could take up his research scholarship at Oxford University. "You can see the misery on the faces of people here who are trying to leave. We are denied our own right to freedom of movement," he says."We are ordinary people, we live in Gaza, we are not responsible for the mistakes of Hamas or any other party, so why are we being punished collectively?"Last month, Israel further eased its import restrictions on Gaza, allowing construction materials to enter for the private sector.It said this was in response to a request from the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, a political rival of Hamas, whose Palestinian Authority governs parts of the West Bank.Mr Abbas recently returned to peace talks with Israel that the Gaza government rejects.His achievements only add to the sense that Hamas has found itself on the wrong side of recent events in the Middle East.Nathan Thrall, a senior analyst from International Crisis Group, says the Islamist organisation originally had high hopes of the Arab uprisings."Hamas saw that the entire region was moving in their favour. They saw Islamist movements and Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated movements rising and they saw that their position was going to be dramatically reversed," he says."They had been isolated not just by the West but by the Arab world and they felt that this was the dawn of a new era in which they would be legitimised and in which they potentially take over the entire Palestinian national movement. Now it looks quite the opposite."The deputy foreign minister in Gaza, Ghazi Hamed admits that Hamas is currently "suffering" but says it has overcome many challenges since its election win seven years ago."All the time we are passing different hard stages. We started with the political isolation, with economic boycotts, incursions, wars against Gaza, but we succeeded to pass this," he says."The situation now in Egypt is not easy for us. We feel now there are some people who tried to squeeze us in the corner. But I think sooner or later we will get out of this crisis."It is clear that funding is a major issue for Hamas which has to pay the salaries of 40,000 government workers. Previously it raised large sums from tunnel taxes.One strategy appears to be to try to mend ties with Iran, which was the main financial and military benefactor of the group. Relations were damaged and funding was cut back when Hamas backed Sunni Muslim rebels fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, a strategic ally of Tehran.In the meantime, the military wing of Hamas, its al-Qassam Brigades, has given its own response to the current pressures.There have been recent parades by masked militants carrying rocket-propelled grenades and guns that are clearly intended as a show of force; a dramatic reminder that for now Hamas retains a firm grip on Gaza.</body>

      <body>Corruption in education is a serious blight that undermines the quality and availability of schools and universities around the world, according to an international report.Anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International have published a global survey showing that about one in six students has had to pay a bribe for education services.In parts of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia this might be requiring parents to pay a fee for a school place that should be free.In Eastern Europe, it might be paying to gain an advantage in university admissions.The Berlin-based campaign group is best known for its annual "global corruption barometer", which measures levels of dishonest payments in more than 100 countries, based on more than 114,000 household interviews.This year's survey also asked questions about people's first-hand experiences and perceptions of dishonesty in education.In some countries these perceptions are distinctively negative. The report says that almost three-quarters of people in Cameroon and Russia see their education systems as "corrupt or highly corrupt".The findings show a huge range of malpractice.In Pakistan, there are warnings of thousands of "shadow schools" without any real students, but drawing public funding to pay for "ghost teachers"."Leakages" in the funding of schools in Kenya had the equivalent value of losing more than 11 million text books, says the report. A study of 180 schools in Tanzania showed that more than a third of intended funds had failed to reach the school.In Greece there are warnings about nepotism in jobs and promotions in higher education.In Vietnam there is a problem with bribery for places in the most sought-after schools.The report quotes figures from the United Nations showing 110 countries where fees are levied, despite in theory having free education enshrined in law. The report describes "myriad pretexts" to impose charges on parents.So why should education be so vulnerable to corruption?Parents want the best for their children, says the report, and they can be exploited by unscrupulous officials controlling access to places.It also involves a great deal of public money filtering down from central government to local school authorities. In Nigeria, the report says, $21m (£13m) intended for schools was lost in two years.But it's not only a problem for the developing world or those providing the basics of schooling.The massive expansion in demand for university education has created rich opportunities for illicit charges.Students need degree-level qualifications more than ever and are under great pressure to get university places and to leave with good grades, opening up fertile territory for corruption and cheating.Eastern European and former Soviet states are highlighted as having had particular difficulties.In Georgia, there have been reforms to stop corruption in university admissions. This hadn't simply been "cash-filled envelopes", but included a complex system of having to buy tutoring, Transparency International found.There could also be more practical types of illicit charges, with suggestions that in Romania access to university accommodation depended on bribery.The demand for qualifications has also generated its own industry in fake universities.In the United States, the report estimates, there are about a thousand "degree mills" in operation, selling bogus qualifications.This isn't only harmless self-delusion, says the report, as these bought qualifications are used to gain graduate jobs, including in one case working in a nuclear power plant.It also highlights the case of Colby Nolan, a student who ostensibly gained an MBA degree in 2004, until his owner revealed that the graduate was a six-year-old cat. He had gained the equivalent of an upper second class degree.The growth of higher education as a globalised, multi-billion dollar business has also spawned a parallel opportunity for fraud, says Philip Altbach, director of the Center for International Higher Education in the Lynch School of Education at Boston College.He has described the "spectre of corruption haunting" the move towards a more internationalised higher education system.And he has called for more co-ordinated international efforts to set standards and share information.The Transparency International study says that corruption has a corrosive effect on education, raising the cost and lowering the quality."Many people wouldn't realise the extent of corruption in education, right through from the financing of education through to academic corruption," says report editor, Gareth Sweeney."In some countries it's such a serious problem that it could undermine the credibility of their education systems."There is some good news as the report highlights efforts to tackle bribery.In Chile, anti-corruption lessons have been introduced to the school curriculum and in Bangladesh there is an "integrity pledge" taken by officials.The proliferation of mobile phones in Africa is being used to allow people to expose concerns about bribery in schools.Legal advice centres have also been developed in a number of countries to help community groups make legal challenges against school corruption.There are also international efforts to improve the monitoring and tracking of education funds.But corruption is still there leaching away education budgets. It's a particularly bleak problem when there are still tens of millions of children without any access to school."Corruption is an obstacle to a fundamental human right to education," says Mr Sweeney.While there are campaigners calling for education for all, such as Malala Yousafzai in Pakistan, this report also warns of the barriers being created for the poorest communities by demands for corrupt payments.Teachers take bribes to offset poor wages or irregular payments and that in turn raises questions about the lack of funding coming from higher up the chain.Mr Sweeney says that there should be a way of measuring good governance in any future global education targets."Even when formal school fees are abolished, many households are still being forced to pay informal fees. How is a family supposed to be able to afford these costs, when they cannot afford their daily meals?," says Pauline Rose, director of Unesco's Global Monitoring Report, which tracks progress towards primary education for all."Until these hidden costs are eradicated, we will not be able to call education free, and universal primary education will continue to remain a distant goal for the poorest."</body>

      <body>The Democratic Republic of Congo is potentially one of the richest countries on earth, but colonialism, slavery and corruption has turned it into one of the poorest, writes historian Dan Snow.The world's bloodiest conflict since World War II is still rumbling on today.It is a war in which more than five million people have died, millions more have been driven to the brink by starvation and disease and several million women and girls have been raped.The Great War of Africa, a conflagration that has sucked in soldiers and civilians from nine nations and countless armed rebel groups, has been fought almost entirely inside the borders of one unfortunate country - the Democratic Republic of Congo.It is a place seemingly blessed with every type of mineral, yet consistently rated lowest on the UN Human Development Index, where even the more fortunate live in grinding poverty.I went to the Congo this summer to find out what it was about the country's past that had delivered it into the hands of unimaginable violence and anarchy.The journey that I went on, through the Congo's abusive history, while travelling across its war-torn present, was the most disturbing experience of my career.I met rape victims, rebels, bloated politicians and haunted citizens of a country that has ceased to function - people who struggle to survive in a place cursed by a past that defies description, a history that will not release them from its death-like grip.The Congo's apocalyptic present is a direct product of decisions and actions taken over the past five centuries.In the late 15th Century an empire known as the Kingdom of Kongo dominated the western portion of the Congo, and bits of other modern states such as Angola.It was sophisticated, had its own aristocracy and an impressive civil service.When Portuguese traders arrived from Europe in the 1480s, they realised they had stumbled upon a land of vast natural wealth, rich in resources - particularly human flesh.The Congo was home to a seemingly inexhaustible supply of strong, disease-resistant slaves. The Portuguese quickly found this supply would be easier to tap if the interior of the continent was in a state of anarchy.They did their utmost to destroy any indigenous political force capable of curtailing their slaving or trading interests.Money and modern weapons were sent to rebels, Kongolese armies were defeated, kings were murdered, elites slaughtered and secession was encouraged.By the 1600s, the once-mighty kingdom had disintegrated into a leaderless, anarchy of mini-states locked in endemic civil war. Slaves, victims of this fighting, flowed to the coast and were carried to the Americas.About four million people were forcibly embarked at the mouth of the Congo River. English ships were at the heart of the trade. British cities and merchants grew rich on the back of Congolese resources they would never see.This first engagement with Europeans set the tone for the rest of the Congo's history.Development has been stifled, government has been weak and the rule of law non-existent. This was not through any innate fault of the Congolese, but because it has been in the interests of the powerful to destroy, suppress and prevent any strong, stable, legitimate government. That would interfere - as the Kongolese had threatened to interfere before - with the easy extraction of the nation's resources. The Congo has been utterly cursed by its natural wealth.The Congo is a massive country, the size of Western Europe.Limitless water, from the world's second-largest river, the Congo, a benign climate and rich soil make it fertile, beneath the soil abundant deposits of copper, gold, diamonds, cobalt, uranium, coltan and oil are just some of the minerals that should make it one of the world's richest countries.Instead it is the world's most hopeless.The interior of the Congo was opened up in the late 19th Century by the British-born explorer Henry Morton Stanley, his dreams of free trading associations with communities he met were shattered by the infamous King of the Belgians, Leopold, who hacked out a vast private empire.The world's largest supply of rubber was found at a time when bicycle and automobile tyres, and electrical insulation, had made it a vital commodity in the West.The late Victorian bicycle craze was enabled by Congolese rubber collected by slave labourers.To tap it, Congolese men were rounded up by a brutal Belgian-officered security force, their wives were interned to ensure compliance and were brutalised during their captivity. The men were then forced to go into the jungle and harvest the rubber.Disobedience or resistance was met by immediate punishment - flogging, severing of hands, and death. Millions perished.Tribal leaders capable of resisting were murdered, indigenous society decimated, proper education denied.A culture of rapacious, barbaric rule by a Belgian elite who had absolutely no interest in developing the country or population was created, and it has endured.In a move supposed to end the brutality, Belgium eventually annexed the Congo outright, but the problems in its former colony remained.Mining boomed, workers suffered in appalling conditions, producing the materials that fired industrial production in Europe and America.In World War I men on the Western Front and elsewhere did the dying, but it was Congo's minerals that did the killing.The brass casings of allied shells fired at Passchendaele and the Somme were 75% Congolese copper.In World War II, the uranium for the nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki came from a mine in south-east Congo.Western freedoms were defended with Congo's resources while black Congolese were denied the right to vote, or form unions and political associations. They were denied anything beyond the most basic of educations.They were kept at an infantile level of development that suited the rulers and mine owners but made sure that when independence came there was no home-grown elite who could run the country.Independence in 1960 was, therefore, predictably disastrous.Bits of the vast country immediately attempted to break away, the army mutinied against its Belgian officers and within weeks the Belgian elite who ran the state evacuated leaving nobody with the skills to run the government or economy.Of 5,000 government jobs pre-independence, just three were held by Congolese and there was not a single Congolese lawyer, doctor, economist or engineer.Chaos threatened to engulf the region. The Cold War superpowers moved to prevent the other gaining the upper hand.Sucked into these rivalries, the struggling Congolese leader, Patrice Lumumba, was horrifically beaten and executed by Western-backed rebels. A military strongman, Joseph-Desire Mobutu, who had a few years before been a sergeant in the colonial police force, took over.Mobutu became a tyrant. In 1972 he changed his name to Mobutu Sese Seko Nkuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga, meaning "the all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, goes from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake".The West tolerated him as long as the minerals flowed and the Congo was kept out of the Soviet orbit.He, his family and friends bled the country of billions of dollars, a $100m palace was built in the most remote jungle at Gbadolite, an ultra-long airstrip next to it was designed to take Concorde, which was duly chartered for shopping trips to Paris.Dissidents were tortured or bought off, ministers stole entire budgets, government atrophied. The West allowed his regime to borrow billions, which was then stolen and today's Congo is still expected to pay the bill.In 1997 an alliance of neighbouring African states, led by Rwanda - which was furious Mobutu's Congo was sheltering many of those responsible for the 1994 genocide - invaded, after deciding to get rid of Mobutu.A Congolese exile, Laurent Kabila, was dredged up in East Africa to act as a figurehead. Mobutu's cash-starved army imploded, its leaders, incompetent cronies of the president, abandoning their men in a mad dash to escape.Mobutu took off one last time from his jungle Versailles, his aircraft packed with valuables, his own unpaid soldiers firing at the plane as it lumbered into the air.Rwanda had effectively conquered its titanic neighbour with spectacular ease. Once installed however, Kabila, Rwanda's puppet, refused to do as he was told.Again Rwanda invaded, but this time they were just halted by her erstwhile African allies who now turned on each other and plunged Congo into a terrible war.Foreign armies clashed deep inside the Congo as the paper-thin state collapsed totally and anarchy spread.Hundreds of armed groups carried out atrocities, millions died.Ethnic and linguistic differences fanned the ferocity of the violence, while control of Congo's stunning natural wealth added a terrible urgency to the fighting.Forcibly conscripted child soldiers corralled armies of slaves to dig for minerals such as coltan, a key component in mobile phones, the latest obsession in the developed world, while annihilating enemy communities, raping women and driving survivors into the jungle to die of starvation and disease.A deeply flawed, partial peace was patched together a decade ago. In the far east of the Congo, there is once again a shooting war as a complex web of domestic and international rivalries see rebel groups clash with the army and the UN, while tiny community militias add to the general instability.The country has collapsed, roads no longer link the main cities, healthcare depends on aid and charity. The new regime is as grasping as its predecessors.I rode on one of the trainloads of copper that go straight from foreign-owned mines to the border, and on to the Far East, rumbling past shanty towns of displaced, poverty-stricken Congolese.The Portuguese, Belgians, Mobutu and the present government have all deliberately stifled the development of a strong state, army, judiciary and education system, because it interferes with their primary focus, making money from what lies under the Earth.The billions of pounds those minerals have generated have brought nothing but misery and death to the very people who live on top of them, while enriching a microscopic elite in the Congo and their foreign backers, and underpinning our technological revolution in the developed world.The Congo is a land far away, yet our histories are so closely linked. We have thrived from a lopsided relationship, yet we are utterly blind to it. The price of that myopia has been human suffering on an unimaginable scale.</body>

      <body>What makes an entrepreneur? The BBC's Cindy Sui hears from Yen Tseng, a Taiwanese Canadian who, with his elder brother, founded a travel business called iBeengo. It takes tourists off the beaten track and helps them experience Taiwan the local way.Yen Tseng got the idea to start a travel business about a year ago because he loved to travel. He was born in Taiwan and attended middle school there, but went to Canada for his early, secondary and university education. By the age of 25, he had travelled to 25 countries.But starting this business in Taiwan wasn't an easy decision for him and his brother Ronnie, 30. Both are highly educated and their family had expectations of them. "The biggest risk is still the fact that we didn't take the nine-to-five job and we didn't take a stable salary."Initially, Yen and his brother wanted to help people take the pain out of travelling - so with a loan of one million New Taiwan dollars ($34,000; £21,000) from their parents, they created iBeengo in September 2012. It allows travellers to pick and choose the itinerary they want and create custom-made tours.Most of their clients are Chinese independent student travellers curious about Taiwan who see visiting the island as a lifelong dream. Many are women because they like to get out there and explore, but also want the safety of being in a tour with a local guide, Yen says.What makes iBeengo's tours different from those of big travel agencies is that they allow travellers to sleep in if they want, skip parts of the tour and rejoin the group later, take their time at each location, and request locations off the itinerary."People don't actually like bus tours. Bus tours are like food on a flight, there's no choice. What we do is buffet style; you come here, pick out what you want, and go at the pace you like," said Yen.Some of the places iBeengo takes tourists to are popular scenic attractions, and they also offer free walking tours for interested tourists.Wearing their eye-catching bright green iBeengo t-shirts, Yen, his brother, and college-student volunteers point out locally known trivia, such as the stall that sells the best Taiwanese fried chicken patty at a night market, the locations where popular Taiwanese films were shot, or the childhood hangout of a Taiwanese pop singer.In its first year, iBeengo has taken 400 tourists around Taiwan. Yen says they try to keep their average tour size to fewer than 15 people and aim for an ideal ratio of one tour guide to five tourists, much less than the traditional ratio of one guide to 30 travellers.What makes starting up a business relatively low cost for Yen is that he and Ronnie hooked up with a start-up incubator which rents office space to young companies cheaply. They pay only NT$3,000 per person per month.Advertising in person also helps them cut costs. They fly to China to drop off brochures at universities and advertise on Chinese websites to reach out to their target customers - young Chinese people.IBeengo for the moment is mainly a travel exchange programme for students, but the brothers are hoping to raise the US$200,000 (£125,000) to register their company as a fully functioning tourism business for all.In the future the brothers plan to operate tours around Japan and further afield. But for now, they are enjoying helping tourists from mainland China - Taiwan's former rivals during the war decades ago - get to know the island and see not only its scenic beauty but unique character."Just the fact that our customers are going home and telling their friends about us and their friends are coming to us asking us to organise tours for them, that gives us a lot of satisfaction," Yen said.</body>

      <title>Close encounters of the Arab kind</title>
      <description>How centuries-old genre in the Middle East is seeing a revival</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24403002</url>

      <body>Have you ever heard of Alif the Unseen, computer hacker and recipient of an ancient scroll written by mythological spirits?Or Ajwan, a teenager on an intergalactic quest to save her son from the clutches of those who wish to convert him into a super-warrior?Probably you haven't. Possibly you should have. Introducing the rapidly evolving face of Arabic science fiction literature.It is a genre that at times challenges a political reality in countries where even peaceful protest can be a one-way ticket to a lengthy jail term, while at other times helps to explain the otherwise unimaginable splendour of an almighty God.Such is its lure that a recent conference held at the Science Museum's Dana Centre in London was packed with those keen to exchange views on the subject.Rarely has mainstream sci-fi attempted to grapple with the complexities of the Arab world.As Lebanese Canadian sci-fi writer explained, the mainstream sci-fi she grew up with was "very, very white... except for the aliens, of course."Though it might at times have featured characters from ethnic minorities, rarely did it seek to positively engage with other cultures beyond exoticisation or fear-mongering.In fact, "what you tend to get is Western science fiction that is very normative; gender looks remarkably the same and race looks remarkably pale", said Ms Mohtar.It might come as a surprise that one of the first sci-fi novels written was not, in fact, Shelly's Frankenstein or HG Wells' The Time Machine, but the work of 13th Century Baghdad-based writer and physician, Zakariya al-Qazwini.Awaj bin Anfaq is the story of a curious alien who arrives on planet Earth to observe human behaviour and finds himself perplexed by the oddities of this apparently sophisticated species.Neither is Mr Qazwini's work a regional anomaly.There are numerous examples of early Islamic sci-fi or fantasy fiction from the Arab world, not least of course, the fabulous Arabian Nights, replete with flying carpets, mystical jinn and even a little intergalactic travel.The reasons why this fledgling expedition into new literary territory never fully made lift-off remains, of course, unknown.But for Pakistani writer and academic Ziauddin Sardar, it has to do with a change of outlook across the region.As the "golden age" of the Islam drew to a close, so did the optimism and enthusiasm felt by many for the mysteries of the future, he claims.The Islamic world turned to reflect on its glorious past, and to a certain extent, to the West, whose speed of expansion may well have seemed to be the stuff of sci-fi.For Ms Mohtar, the cultural imperialism that resulted from this shift still afflicts her home country today."While I was living in Lebanon in the 1990s, I read very few fairy tales, or the kinds of stories that nourish a child's soul, in Arabic. I read them in French and in English.""I do feel there's been a sort of rupture that this legacy of colonialism has left."Yet despite the great expanse of time that separates the sci-fi of the 13th Century Islamic world from that of modern Arab writers like Amal, in Mr Sardar's opinion, there are certain elements they share."I think there are two things you need before you can have science fiction in a society; one is an appreciation of what science is all about, and the second is some awareness of the future," he said.The Arab world may not know what the future holds, but it is acutely aware of its existence, hurling the region forward at an unprecedented pace.The Arab Spring and its continuing aftershocks are a part of that change, but they represent a mere fragment of a much broader upheaval.As one guest at the conference said: "Having grown up in Egypt, to me we are living in a sci-fi. Thirty years ago we didn't even have electricity in most of Egypt."Is it just a translation of a Western genre - a hamburger spiced with cardamom and rosemary? Unsurprisingly, the panellists didn't think so.For them, Arabic sci-fi is an opportunity to respond to the damaging stereotyping of the "Arab Other" in mainstream sci-fi, as well as a space to explore the complex challenges facing Middle East today."The problems of contemporary Islamic society - the problem of gender, the problems with authoritarianism - all of these are explored very thoroughly in Arab sci-fi. But most importantly of all, it is Arabs reflecting on themselves," said Mr Sardar.Few would argue that Arab sci-fi literature still has a long way to go before it breaks into the mainstream.Often it must wrestle with low budget allowances, political restrictions and audiences increasingly accustomed to televised entertainment.Yet if the buzzing enthusiasm of the sold-out audience at the Dana Centre was anything to go by, Arab sci-fi's place in the future it seeks to understand seems assured.</body>

      <title>Why Iran takes issue with the Holocaust</title>
      <description>Why Iran's position on the Holocaust is still controversial</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24442723</url>
      <date>1381276636</date>
      <body>When Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was Iranian president, one issue which continually antagonised and offended abroad was his statements questioning the scale of the Holocaust, or whether it had even happened at all.The new administration under Hassan Rouhani has taken a softer line, but as BBC Persian's Bozorgmehr Sharafedin explains, Iran's position on the Holocaust continues to be controversial.One key question which President Rouhani kept being asked during his round of media appearances in New York last month was where he stood on the Holocaust.His responses were careful but did not satisfy everyone that Iran is no longer in the business of Holocaust denial or revisionism.President Rouhani said the Holocaust was a "reprehensible and condemnable crime".But as many people listening to his interviews on the fringe of the UN General Assembly pointed out, he did not say whether he concurred with the mainstream acceptance of the Holocaust meaning the killing by the Nazis of six million Jews.That, his critics say, shows that he has not closed the door entirely on those in the Islamic Republic who claim the number of victims of the Nazi extermination camps has been exaggerated.'What the Nazis did is condemned," said Mr Rouhani. "But the aspects that you talk about, clarification of these aspects is a duty of the historians and researchers. I am not a history scholar.'His Foreign Minister, Mohammed Javad Zarif, has been more outspoken.A US-educated diplomat who has served for years as Iran's representative at the United Nations, Mr Zarif clearly sees how much the issue has damaged Iran's international reputation."Iran never denied [the Holocaust]," he tweeted in an exchange with Christine Pelosi, the daughter of Nancy Pelosi, Minority Leader of the US House of Representatives."The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone."Mr Zarif was clearly referring to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who, during his presidency, frequently claimed the Holocaust was a myth. But does the departure of Mr Ahmadinejad mean the end of Holocaust denial in Iran?Ayatollah Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran who decides on the foreign policy, has repeatedly referred to the Holocaust as a distorted historical event and he is still in power.Iran and Israel had good relations under the Shah. The 1979 Islamic Revolution ushered in a new period of anti-Israel hostility, but this was not accompanied by any attempt to deny the Holocaust.In fact during the Iran-Iraq war (1980-88), Tehran found many Western films about World War II quite inspiring for the nation and national television was full of programmes sympathising with the victims of the war, including the Jews.The first Iranian official to cast doubt on the Holocaust was actually Ayatollah Khamenei.In January 2002, he referred to gas chambers in concentration camps as a story about which its truth was "not clear" and which was being used as "Zionist propaganda" to gain the sympathy of the world.Mr Ahmadinejad followed this line and in 2005, in his first year in office, called the Nazi extermination of the Jews "a myth"."The Holocaust used to be something you only read about in history books in Iran," says Mehdi Khalaji, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy."It was Ahmadinejad who brought this term into Tehran's political literature and made it one of the elements of his foreign policy. During his tenure Iran wanted to threaten Israel and it was the safest way."Meir Javedanfar, an Israeli expert on Iran and the Middle East who was born and raised in Tehran, believes Mr Ahmadinejad made Holocaust denial a key tenet of his foreign policy for two reasons."Firstly, he wanted to distinguish himself from his predecessor, Mohammad Khatami, who became a world figure by proposing the idea of dialogue between the civilisations and religions to the UN," he told the BBC."Secondly, he thought denying the Holocaust would be an existential blow to Israel. But he didn't realise denying the Holocaust would be perceived as anti-Semitic rather than anti-Israeli.'During Mr Ahmadinejad's tenure, there were efforts to try to show that Iran was not anti-Semitic.Probably the most high profile was a very expensive and well-produced Iranian television series, called Zero Degree Turn - which was in essence an Iranian version of Schindler's List.It was based on a real life story about an Iranian diplomat who saved Jews in 1940s Paris during the Nazi Occupation by giving out Iranian passports and allowing them refuge in the Iranian Embassy.But Mr Ahmadinejad continued his Holocaust denial rhetoric, despite the international backlash, as he thought he had found the Achilles heel of Israel.In December 2006 he ordered the foreign ministry to hold a two-day conference to review the Holocaust. Information obtained by the BBC shows many people at the ministry were frustrated by this order."Holocaust denial has been common in the Arab world for decades, but Ahmadinejad's ideology was mainly rooted in revisionist scholars in the West," says Mehdi Khalaji."That's why the anti-Holocaust conference in Tehran was mainly attended by Westerners and even some neo-Nazis and members of the Ku Klux Klan rather than Islamists.""Ahmadinejad thought he had managed to put unprecedented pressure on Israel," says Meir Javedanfar. "But he failed to notice he was only making the Israeli stance on Iran's nuclear programme stronger."President Rouhani and his team have made it clear that they want to put the rhetoric of the Ahmadinejad years behind them, as they attempt to find a solution to the standoff over Iran's nuclear programme.In an interview with ABC News at the end of September, Iran's foreign minister described the Holocaust as a "heinous crime" and said that the remarks by Ayatollah Khamenei about the Holocaust had been mistranslated and taken out of context."Ayatollah Khamenei has called the Holocaust a myth, but it's unlikely that he would deny the foreign minister's claim," says Mehdi Khalaji."Ahmadinejad is the scapegoat now. In the Islamic Republic's tradition, officials usually deny their previous statements, not explicitly, but by putting the blame either on translators or reporters. Mistranslation, in Iranian diplomacy, usually means giving up.'</body>

      <title>Azerbaijan's pre-determined president</title>
      <description>Little doubt in Azerbaijan about president's re-election</description>

      <body>Azerbaijan elects a president on Wednesday in what human rights organisations say is a stifling atmosphere of intimidation.Ilham Aliyev, who has run the oil-rich ex-Soviet republic since he succeeded his father 10 years ago, is standing for a third term.During his presidency, allegations of high-level corruption, the subversion of democracy and the stifling of dissent have been rife, with reports of politically motivated arrests shooting up drastically in the last two years.The pre-election period has, nonetheless, been a relatively calm one.But it is "post-election disorder" that worries the authorities, the Brussels-based International Crisis Group said in a recent report.Riots over corruption in regions like Ismayilli and Quba in January were seen as a sign of major public discontent with regional governors and, in effect, the ruling elite.In Ismayilli, the governor's son's car and hotel were set on fire after he reportedly insulted the residents.It was a small wave of unrest, but clearly worried the authorities and the repercussions continue. Ilgar Mammadov, a human rights defender and leader of the political movement ReAL who went to the region after the unrest erupted, was charged in February with causing mass unrest.While his trial is pending, he put forward his candidacy for the elections - which was rejected due to "invalid signatures". Mr Mammadov is one of 14 people described by Amnesty International as prisoners of conscience in Azerbaijan.Human rights organisations put the number of political prisoners between the tens and the hundreds.Seven of them are leading members of the youth movement Nida, who were detained in April while protesting against corruption and face charges of causing mass unrest and possessing illegal firearms.They are known for their frequent posts on Facebook and Twitter about alleged government corruption and human rights abuses.Azeri political analyst Rashad Shirinov told the BBC that Nida was "one of the most active and vivid youth forces" in the country and could have had an impact on the campaign had its leader not been arrested.Around the same time as the Nida arrests, Dashgin Melikov, an asthmatic young activist critical of the government, was also charged with illegal drugs possession and sentenced to two and a half years in prison.Until last week, he was a member of one of two major opposition parties, the Azerbaijani Popular Front.But then in an open letter he wrote from prison, Mr Melikov renounced his party and declared his support for Ilham Aliyev. His father told BBC Azeri that his son's illness was a factor in his decision - and that he had been promised freedom in return.The government insists that nobody is imprisoned for their political activities, and that their activism does not mean that they are not criminals.Yet according to Human Rights Watch, the Azerbaijani authorities use "spurious drug possession charges to lock up political activists critical of the government" ahead of the elections.The main competition to Ilham Aliyev comes from former MP Professor Jamil Hasanli, a candidate from the National Council opposition bloc. For the first time in more than two decades the in-fighting within the main opposition, already seen as weak, was put aside to choose a single candidate. According to Shirinov, this in itself is an achievement.He says that there are a number of fake candidates, installed by the ruling elite to confuse the citizenry, to counter the opposition's candidate. "This is very visible during the TV debates when all other candidates attack Jamil Hasanli," he says.A spokesman for the ruling New Azerbaijan Party, Aydin Mirzazadeh, dismisses these allegations, saying that every vote for another candidate is a vote against the government, and Azerbaijan's Central Election Committee (CEC) boasts of pluralism.But one of the main election observers, the OSCE, has been critical of the election environment from the start, saying there has been little substantive debate, unjustified restriction of freedom of speech and imbalanced media coverage.In addition to Ilgar Mammadov's disqualification, a second prominent candidate, popular cinematographer Rustam Ibrahimbayov, has been barred because of his dual Russian citizenship.Ilham Aliyev changed the constitution through a referendum in 2009 which got rid of the two-term limit for presidents, allowing him to stand for re-election this year.The opposition, however, argues that the candidacy is invalid because the constitution was changed after Mr Aliyev was sworn in as president in his second term.Prof Hasanli has formally complained to the CEC, with sources close to him saying the case will go "to the highest courts".Observers believe there is only one conceivable outcome from the election - another term for President Aliyev.Yet after the unprecedented outbursts of violence against corruption in Azerbaijan's regions, it is the period immediately after the election that will determine how popular Ilham Aliyev really is.</body>

      <title>Extension sought for badger cull</title>
      <description>The original targets for culling badgers are changed as new, more accurate information on population numbers becomes available.</description>

      <body>A pilot badger cull in west Somerset may be extended by up to three weeks as marksmen have failed to kill enough badgers to reach their target.Sources at Defra say that 850 badgers have been shot in the area over the six-week trial, just over 40% of an initial target of 2,081.But those sources insist the Somerset scheme has proven to be effective.They say new population data means there are far fewer badgers in the pilot area than originally thought.The controversial pilot culls set out to study if badgers could be killed safely, effectively and humanely.It is being carried out in an attempt to control TB in cattle, which can be spread by badgers, though opponents say it will have no impact.The plan was to kill 70% of the badgers in the areas of west Somerset and Gloucestershire by free shooting.Across both regions this meant around 5,000 badgers were to be killed in total.But Defra sources said these targets were based on population estimates from 2012 that have proved to be highly inaccurate."We have high confidence that between 2012 and 2013, there has been a decline in the badger population in both areas," said a source.As the cull started, hundreds of hair traps were set so that DNA could be extracted and analysed to give a more up-to-date assessment of badger numbers.In west Somerset, the population, which had been estimated at 2,400, has now been revised downwards to 1,450. In Gloucestershire, the numbers have been lowered from 3,400 to 2,350.There are a number of reasons behind the apparent decline according to Defra, including the impact of last winter's bad weather, disease and lack of food.As a result, the targets for culling have also been revised downwards to around 2,600 for both areas combined.To kill 70% of the badgers now estimated to live in west Somerset, the culling company needed to kill 1,015 badgers.After six weeks of shooting, they achieved 59%, and the company is now seeking an extension of its licence for another two to three weeks.Peter Kendall, president of the National Farmers' Union, said the number of badgers to be killed had been reduced because it was important not to "wipe out" entire populations.He told BBC Breakfast the marksmen needed "a few more weeks" to "meet the best criteria that the scientists have set"."Last year 38,000 cattle were killed and we've got to do something about the spread of this ghastly disease," he added.Asked why the desired number of badgers had not been killed, especially given the lower total population now estimated, Mr Kendall said these were pilot schemes and those involved are "learning as we go".He said there had been some "protester activity" and all shooting had been stopped whenever a person has been "spotted in a vicinity", though he said the protesters were not the reason the target number had not been reached.Defra sources believe that even on the lower figures, the exercise has been effective."This level of culling is a significant culling of the badger population and sufficient to achieve cattle disease benefits at the start of a four-year... period," the source said.There was a "possibility" that the company carrying out the Gloucestershire cull will also seek an extension.Reports in recent days suggested that the exercise in west Somerset was in trouble, with a Conservative MP admitting it had not worked as well as hoped.</body>

      <title>Higgs boson wins Nobel physics prize</title>
      <description>Peter Higgs and Francois Englert have won the Nobel prize in physics for their work on the theory of the Higgs boson, discovered at Cern in 2012.</description>

      <date>1381240861</date>
      <body>Two scientists have won the Nobel prize in physics for their work on the theory of the Higgs boson.Peter Higgs, from the UK, and Francois Englert from Belgium, share the prize.In the 1960s, they were among several physicists who proposed a mechanism to explain why the most basic building blocks of the Universe have mass.The mechanism predicts a particle - the Higgs boson - which was finally discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Cern, in Switzerland."This year's prize is about something small that makes all the difference," said Staffan Normark, permanent secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.Prof Higgs is renowned for shying away from the limelight, and he could not be located for interview in the immediate aftermath of the announcement."He's gone on holiday without a phone," his Edinburgh University physics colleague Alan Walker told the BBC, adding that Higgs had also been unwell."He is taking a break from all of this, taking some time to relax, because he knows when he comes back he'll have to face up to a media storm."But the university released a prepared statement from Higgs, 84, who is an emeritus professor of theoretical physics:"I am overwhelmed to receive this award and thank the Royal Swedish Academy," he said."I would also like to congratulate all those who have contributed to the discovery of this new particle and to thank my family, friends and colleagues for their support."I hope this recognition of fundamental science will help raise awareness of the value of blue-sky research."Francois Englert, 80, said he was "very happy" to win the award, speaking at the ceremony via phone link."At first I thought I didn't have [the prize] because I didn't see the announcement," he told the committee, after their news conference was delayed by more than an hour.Higgs was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, but it was in Edinburgh in 1964 that he had his big idea - an explanation of why the matter in the Universe has substance, or mass.His theory involved a missing particle in the Standard Model of physics, which has come to be known as the Higgs boson.Within weeks, Francois Englert had independently published his own, similar theory, alongside his now deceased colleague Robert Brout.Three other physicists - Gerald Guralnik, Tom Kibble and Carl Hagen - also made key contributions to the theory, and spoke at the announcement of the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012.Hagen has long argued for the name of the particle to be changed, protesting at the "rock star" status in which Higgs is held.And Higgs, too, has expressed his discomfort with the attention he has received, preferring to call the particle "the scalar boson".In a statement on Tuesday, Kibble, of Imperial College London, said he was "glad" the Nobel prize had gone to the work of Higgs and Englert."My two collaborators, Gerald Guralnik and Carl Hagen, and I contributed to that discovery, but our paper was unquestionably the last of the three to be published."It is therefore no surprise that the Swedish Academy felt unable to include us, constrained as they are by a self-imposed rule that the prize cannot be shared by more than three people."My sincere congratulations go to the two prize winners, Francois Englert and Peter Higgs."And the renowned physicist Prof Stephen Hawking added his praise: "In the early 60s, theorists were struggling to understand why particles have mass. Peter Higgs and Francois Englert proposed a mechanism called symmetry breaking. This mechanism also predicted a massive particle, the Higgs boson. The discovery last year at Cern of a particle with the correct properties confirms this prediction and is a triumph for theory."Proving the theory correct took almost half a century and involved creating the biggest and most sophisticated machine humankind has ever built.The LHC at Cern lies in a circular tunnel 27km (17 miles) round. It is so big it is partly in Switzerland, partly in France. It took 10 years and thousands of scientists and engineers to build it.Cern director general Rolf Heuer said he was "thrilled" that this year's prize had gone to particle physics."The discovery of the Higgs boson at Cern... marks the culmination of decades of intellectual effort by many people around the world," he commented.The Nobel prizes - which also cover chemistry, medicine, literature, peace and economics - are valued at 8m Swedish krona (£775,000; $1.2m). Laureates also receive a medal and a diploma.The official citation for Englert and Higgs read: "For the theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles, and which recently was confirmed through the discovery of the predicted fundamental particle, by the Atlas and CMS experiments at Cern's Large Hadron Collider".David Willetts, UK minister for universities and science, said the award was "an incredible endorsement of the quality of UK science".Prime Minister David Cameron said: "This brilliant achievement is richly deserved recognition of Peter Higgs' lifetime of dedicated research and his passion for science."It is also a credit to the world-leading British universities in which this research was carried out."It took nearly 50 years and thousands of great minds to discover the Higgs boson after Prof Higgs proposed it, and he and all those people should be extremely proud."</body>

      <title>European link to Jewish ancestry</title>
      <description>A new genetics study challenges some previous theories on the maternal ancestry of Ashkenazi Jews.</description>

      <date>1381310660</date>
      <body>A new genetics study has challenged previous theories about the maternal ancestry of Ashkenazi Jews.The study suggests that most female ancestors came from southern and western Europe, not the Middle East as some authors assume.The new work in Nature Communications indicates that Jewish groups could have absorbed European converts about 2,000 years ago.However, others working in the field are not convinced by the findings."The origins of the [Ashkenazi Jews] is one of the big questions that people have pursued again and again and never really come to a conclusive view on," said Martin Richards from the University of Huddersfield, UK, one of the authors on the new paper.The team studied mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the genetic information in the cell's "batteries", which is passed on only via women. It can be used to probe a population's maternal history.The researchers used mtDNA lineages from Europe, the Caucasus and the Middle East. Their conclusions were that Ashkenazi maternal lines were most closely related to those from southern and western Europe."This suggests that, even though Jewish men may indeed have migrated into Europe from [the Levant] around 2,000 years ago, they seem to have married European women," explained Prof Richards.He added that women could have been among early European converts to Judaism."The great majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not brought from the Levant, as commonly supposed, nor recruited in the Caucasus, as sometimes suggested, but assimilated within Europe."It's a very exciting time for the prehistory of Europe. There will be work coming out in the next few years that will really give us a good picture of what happened over the last 30,000-40,000 years."Ashkenazi Jews are thought to have migrated from the Levant to Italy in the first or second centuries, and then moved to western and then eastern Europe, where populations expanded in number during the 13th Century.This new study makes the suggestion that more than 80% of Ashkenazi Jews can trace their ultimate maternal ancestry to prehistoric Europe. But studies looking at the Y chromosome (which is passed down from father to son only) have shown that the male line of descent does trace back to the Middle East.Harry Ostrer at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University in New York, US, told BBC News the latest study was an "interesting paper".He added: "It's not terribly surprising that there are mitochondrial genomes that coalesce to a long time ago in Europe because that is representative of the first founding event of Ashkenazi Jewry in Europe."The genetic, historical and the archaeological records are pretty clear. What we see in the genomes of contemporary Ashkenazi Jews is that they are the descendants of people who have gone through a 'bottleneck' of moving from western to eastern Europe."As for the debate over geographic origins, Prof Ostrer said there was a belief that most of Jewish history happened in the Levant region but, in his view, "it didn't necessarily; it was happening all over the western world".However, Karl Skorecki, at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, said that in his view the new work contained serious flaws at the level of phylogenetic analysis - the study of where a lineage sits on a family tree."While Costa et al have re-opened the question of the maternal origins of Ashkenazi Jewry, the phylogenetic analysis in the manuscript does not 'settle' the question," he told BBC News.Doron Behar, a geneticist at Gene by Gene in Houston, US, was also unconvinced by the findings, but said he would prefer "to first address this issue in a scientific journal".Another point to note, according to David Goldstein at Duke University in North Carolina, US, was that mitochondrial DNA lineages rise and fall in a random way, he told .Therefore, he said the estimate of an 80% European origin for Ashkenazi maternal lineages was not statistically justified.</body>

      <body>The risks of stroke, heart and circulatory disease are higher in areas with a lot of aircraft noise, researchers say.Their study of 3.6 million residents near Heathrow Airport suggested the risks were 10-20% higher in areas with the highest levels of aircraft noise.The team's findings are published in the British Medical Journal.They agreed with other experts that noise was not necessarily to blame and more work was needed.Their work suggests a higher risk for both hospital admissions and deaths from stroke, heart and circulatory disease for the 2% of the study - about 70,000 people - who lived where the aircraft noise was loudest.The lead author, Dr Anna Hansell, from Imperial College London, said: "The exact role that noise exposure may play in ill health is not well established."However, it is plausible that it might be contributing - for example, by raising blood pressure or by disturbing people's sleep.""There's a 'startle reaction' to loud noise - if you're suddenly exposed to it, the heart rate and blood pressure increase."And aircraft noise can be annoying for some people, which can also affect their blood pressure, leading to illness."The relative importance of daytime and night-time noise from aircraft also needs to be investigated further."The study used data about noise levels in 2001 from the Civil Aviation Authority, covering 12 London boroughs and nine districts outside of London where aircraft noise exceeds 50 decibels - about the volume of a normal conversation in a quiet room.The authors say fewer people are now affected by the highest levels of noise (above 63 decibels) - despite more planes being in the skies - because of changes in aircraft design and flight plans.The researchers - from Imperial and also King's College London - adjusted their work in an effort to eliminate other factors that might have a relationship with stroke and heart disease, such as deprivation, South Asian ethnicity and smoking-related illness.They stressed that the higher risk of illness related to aircraft noise remained much less significant than the risks from lifestyle factors - including smoking, a lack of exercise or poor diet.In an accompanying editorial, Prof Stephen Stansfeld, from Queen Mary University of London, said: "These results imply that the siting of airports and consequent exposure to aircraft noise may have direct effects on the health of the surrounding population."Planners need to take this into account when expanding airports in heavily populated areas or planning new airports."The study covered 12 London boroughs in the centre and west of the capital - and nine council districts beyond London, including Windsor and Maidenhead, Slough and Wokingham.Heathrow Airport's director of sustainability, Matt Gorman, said: "We are already taking significant steps to tackle the issue of noise."We are charging airlines more for noisier aircraft, offering insulation and double glazing to local residents and are working with noise campaigners to give people predictable periods of respite from noise."Together these measures have meant that the number of people affected by noise has fallen by 90% since the 1970s, despite the number of flights almost doubling."A government spokesman said: "The number of people affected by high levels of noise around Heathrow has been falling for years due to improvements in aviation technology, better planning of flight paths and other factors. We would expect to see this trend continue."A separate study, also published on Wednesday in the BMJ, demonstrates a higher rate of admission to hospital with cardiovascular problems for people living near 89 airports in the US.Prof Kevin McConway, from the Open University, said: "Both of these studies are thorough and well-conducted. But, even taken together, they don't prove that aircraft noise actually causes heart disease and strokes."A major difficulty in interpreting what these studies tell us is that they are based on data for geographical areas, not for individual people."Over the coming months, Public Health England will recruit experts to further examine the public health issues around exposure to noise.</body>

      <title>'No bailout' for the Earth's climate</title>
      <description>Governments forced to rescue the world's banking system are being warned by the OECD that there will be no bailout if there is a climate crisis.</description>

      <body>Governments forced to rescue the world's banking system are being warned there will be no bailout if there is a crisis in the Earth's climate system.That is the view of the head of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).Angel Gurria is expected to rebuke nations failing to curb CO2 emissions in a speech on Wednesday.He will say the analysis of the climate threat is far clearer than were the warning signs for the financial crisis.Mr Gurria is due to address the topic of climate change, investment and energy policies in a London lecture co-organised with the London School of Economics and the Climate Markets and Investors Association (CMIA)The talk coincides with a report in The Independent newspaper that claims UK Chancellor George Osborne is about to reject the recommendations of government advisers by slowing the drive to tackle global warming.In his speech, Mr Gurria will ask if leaders overseeing the financial system that led to the "train wreck" of the banking crisis would have been happy to take the risks if they had known the consequences.“Unlike the financial crisis, we do not have a 'climate bailout option' up our sleeves,” he will say.“And despite all the attention given to climate change deniers, our understanding of the scale of the risk is much better developed than our understanding of the financial risks, pre-crisis.”An OECD source said the secretary-general's remarks were directed both at countries which had dragged their feet on reducing emissions and those which had taken a leadership position but were now starting to wobble.Asked if the latter group included the UK, where the chancellor argued last week that Britain "should not be in front of the rest of the world” in tackling climate change, the source said the OECD was fully aware of the situation in Britain and all its member states.Mr Gurria will also warn that renewable technologies will be harmed by stop-start policies. Renewables firms in the UK have benefited from a stable policy framework in the medium term, but are uncertain about long-term investments as right-wing Conservatives attempt to abandon CO2 targets for 2030, arguing that they damage competitiveness.He also takes a swipe at fossil fuel subsidies, currently estimated at over $500bn a year globally. These typically provide cheap motoring for the rich, he says, and fail to help the poor.The world, he says, needs to become zero-carbon in the second half of the century, and needs to start on that pathway immediately if climate change is to be stabilised.Mr Gurria, like the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon last week, is trying to galvanise action for an ambitious agreement in the planned 2015 UN climate conference in Paris.Rich nation governments struggling against recession have been going slow on climate change policies, and developing nations have argued that they need space to expand emissions to grow their economies and draw people out of poverty.Mr Gurria will argue that creating an infrastructure that leaves people dependent on fossil fuels will prove more costly overall in terms of the economy and public welfare.Interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, he said: "Countries like Britain have been leading the charge (on climate change) and have to continue to do that. It's because of leadership of UK that EU has seen that this is the way to go - and the rest of the world too."He said energy policy has become extra challenging following technology improvements on exploiting fossil fuels. "We grew up with scarcity of oil and fuel, now we are entering a world of abundance so we're really going to have to think very hard on this."The OECD is to publish a paper on the most effective ways of managing carbon cuts in the economy.Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin</body>

      <title>Toddler brain scan language insight</title>
      <description>The brain has a critical window for language development between the ages of two and four, brain scans suggest.</description>

      <body>The brain has a critical window for language development between the ages of two and four, brain scans suggest.Environmental influences have their biggest impact before the age of four, as the brain's wiring develops to process new words, say UK and US scientists.The research in The Journal of Neuroscience suggests disorders causing language delay should be tackled early.It also explains why young children are good at learning two languages.The scientists, based at King's College London, and Brown University, Rhode Island, studied 108 children with normal brain development between the ages of one and six.They used brain scans to look at myelin - the insulation that develops from birth within the circuitry of the brain.To their surprise, they found the distribution of myelin is fixed from the age of four, suggesting the brain is most plastic in very early life.Any environmental influences on brain development will be strongest in infanthood, they predict.This explains why immersing children in a bilingual environment before the age of four gives them the best chance of becoming fluent in both languages, the research suggests.It also suggests that there is a critical time during development when environmental influence on cognitive skills may be greatest.Dr Jonathan O'Muircheartaigh, from King's College London, led the study.He told the BBC: "Since our work seems to indicate that brain circuits associated with language are more flexible before the age of four, early intervention for children with delayed language attainment should be initiated before this critical age."This may be relevant to many developmental disorders, such as autism, since delayed language is a common early trait."Early childhood is a time when language skills develop very rapidly.Babies have a vocabulary of up to 50 words at 12 months but by the age of six this has expanded to about 5,000 words.Language skills are localised in the frontal areas of the left-hand side of the brain.The researchers therefore expected more myelin to develop in the left-hand side of the brain, as the children learned more language.In fact, they found it remained constant, but had a stronger influence on language ability before the age of four, suggesting there is a crucial window for interventions in developmental disorders."This work is important as it is the first to investigate the relationship between brain structure and language across early childhood and demonstrate how this relationship changes with age," said Dr Sean Deoni from Brown University, a co-researcher on the study."This is important since language is commonly altered or delayed in many developmental disorders, such as autism."Commenting on the study, Prof Dorothy Bishop of the department of Developmental Neuropsychology at the University of Oxford said the research added important new information about early development of connections in brain regions important for cognitive functions."There is suggestive evidence of links with language development but it is too early to be confident about functional implications of the findings," she said."Ideally we would need a longitudinal study following children over time to track how structural brain changes relate to language function."The study was funded by the National Institutes for Mental Health (US) and the Wellcome Trust (UK).</body>

      <title>Too much sex kills male marsupials</title>
      <description>Some species of marsupials are dying from sex after engaging in strenuous mating activities.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24443104</url>
      <date>1381237115</date>
      <body>A new study suggests that some species of marsupials mate with such vigour and intensity that it quite literally kills them.The scientists say that males die in large numbers after mating with as many partners as possible in sex sessions lasting up to 14 hours at a time.A key factor in this costly coitus is the promiscuous behaviour of females who all breed at the same time of year.The study is published in the journal PNAS.Suicidal reproduction or semelparity is well known in many species of plants and fish but is rare in mammals.This new study looks at the mating behaviour of 52 different species of small, insect eating marsupials in Australia, South America and Papua New Guinea.They found that in some of these animals, such as the antechinus, the phascogale and the dasykaluta, male attempts to father offspring cost them their lives.This "dying-off" trait is more likely to be found in species living in regions where food was plentiful in one period of the year.This makes the females of the species more likely to shorten their mating seasons so they only give birth when there is plenty to eat.In these marsupials, the females have also synchronised their reproductive cycles.They are also highly promiscuous, as this promotes sperm competition among the males, explained Dr Diana Fisher from the University of Queensland, the lead author of the study."The females that mate with more males, get to weed out the poor quality males because of this sperm competition," she said."The ones that succeeded in fertilisation were the ones with better offspring survival."While this ensures sturdy descendents, the process is fatal for the fathers.The males attempt to mate with as many females as possible in long, laborious bouts, driven by high levels of hormones including testosterone.These chemicals in turn elevate their levels of stress hormones and their systems are unable to cope, says Dr Fisher."If we humans get huge stress, we have a feedback system and we bring it down."But the marsupials just keep ramping it up more and more and are driven to spend all their time mating competitively.She added: "And its the stress hormone that does that."Dr Fisher says that this is sexual selection driven by females. It is a different strategy to other mammals where the males sometimes fight for the right to mate or are selected by the females on the basis of looks or strength."In this case, it is having the one that's best at sperm competition," she said.The research team says that the strategy of losing half the species in the act of reproduction can work well as an evolutionary strategy if the population is dense."Every other animal has a cost of reproduction," said Dr Fisher."It's just they've got it all at once."Follow Matt on Twitter.</body>

      <title>Planck telescope set for switch-off</title>
      <description>The European Space Agency is about to dispose of its Planck Surveyor, the telescope which mapped the "oldest light" in the Universe in unprecedented detail.</description>

      <date>1381226105</date>
      <body>The process of disposing of the Planck space telescope has begun.The satellite, which mapped the "oldest light" in the Universe in unprecedented detail, has completed its mission and will be turned off in two weeks' time.It is currently some 1.6 million km from Earth, where it is undergoing some final engineering tests.European Space Agency controllers will initiate a big burn on Planck's thrusters on Wednesday, pushing it away from the planet into a separate orbit.A second burn on 21 October will run the satellite's propellant supply to exhaustion."We drain everything so there's no possibility of having an exploding tank in the future," explained Steve Foley, Esa's spacecraft operations manager for Planck."We'll disconnect the batteries and switch off the transmitters, patching the software so they can never be re-activated. Final contact is scheduled for 23 October, and that will be it - Planck will just drift off," he told BBC News.The 600m-euro (£515m) telescope will end its days making a slow turn around the Sun. It will not come anywhere near the Earth again for another 13-14 years; and even then, the closest it will get will be about 10 million km.Planck has returned an extraordinary treasure trove of information, picking out thousands of objects in the sky not previously recognised. It has even mapped the sum of all the matter in space.But its main quest was to survey the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) - the "first light" to sweep out across space once a post-Big-Bang Universe had cooled sufficiently to permit the formation of hydrogen atoms.Before that time, scientists say, the cosmos would have been so hot that matter and radiation would have been "coupled" - the Universe would have been opaque.Today, the CMB pervades the entire sky, and scientists can measure tiny temperature variations in it to glean information about the shape, age and contents of the cosmos.Planck scanned the full microwave background five times before its High Frequency Instrument ran out of helium coolant in January 2012.The Low Frequency Instrument has continued operations, surveying the complete sky a further three times. This additional data will be used to help clean the telescope's final CMB map of any obscuring light sources, principally from our own galaxy.Scientists presented their first take on Planck's view of the cosmos in March, but promise an update in summer 2014.Of key interest will be whether the telescope has detected a particular type of polarisation in the ancient light known as the B-Mode.Theory holds that the Universe experienced a faster-than-light expansion in the first moments of its existence, and that this superluminal event is imprinted on the polarisation of the CMB.If Planck can resolve this very subtle "twist" in the directional quality of the light, it would open up a completely new way to probe the physics of the Big Bang.Commentators say such a discovery would likely also draw the attention of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which annually selects the Nobel Prizes.Prof Mark McCaughrean, Esa's senior scientific advisor, told BBC News: "Planck has done a fantastic job and has lasted considerably longer than expected. Any sadness about it being turned off is completely outweighed by the scientific results it has already delivered, namely the most precise assessment of the composition, structure, and early evolution of the Universe ever made."And the best may be yet to come; the amazing possibility of probing the Universe less than a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a second after it began."Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos</body>

      <title>Plastic pollution 'threatens lakes'</title>
      <description>Researchers say that the problem of plastic pollution is posing a growing threat to lakes as well as oceans.</description>

      <body>Pollution with plastic waste is not confined to the oceans but poses a growing threat to lakes as well.That is the view of researchers who found significant concentrations of the substance in Italy's Lake Garda.They say the levels are similar to those found in samples taken from marine beach sediments.They are concerned that these tiny plastic particles are accumulating in freshwater species and are "likely" to get into the food chain.The research is published in the journal, Current Biology.The problem of large amounts of plastic polluting the world's oceans has been well documented in recent years.As well as bigger pieces that can choke sea creatures when ingested, there is an equally serious issue with very small fragments called micro-plastics.But research on the problems caused by plastic in lakes has been lacking.This new study looked at Lake Garda, a large, sub-alpine body of water. The researchers found significant concentrations of plastic in sediment samples. On the north shore they found around 1,000 larger particles per square metre and 450 micro-plastic particles in the same area."We were surprised," lead author Prof Christian Laforsch from the University of Bayreuth told BBC News."We have similar amounts of plastic particles in the sediment of the lake's ecosystem as we find in marine ecosystems."Chemicals found in plastics can be poisonous, can damage endocrine systems or in some cases cause cancers.They can also transport dangerous organic pollutants into clean environments like lakes.Previous research on fish and other marine creatures has shown that these species tend to accumulate tiny plastic fragments into their tissue. Prof Laforsch worries that this is happening in Lake Garda and elsewhere."What we show is that filter feeders and sediment feeders and organisms that feed on the surface layer of the lake, all swallow these plastic particles mistaking them for food."There might be impacts when it affects the hormone system, they could become sterile for example. It could also be, that when fish are feeding on these organisms they accumulate these particles also in their tissue."The problem is being caused by human use of plastic materials say the researchers.Apart from water sports, and tourist and fishing boats, the main sources of waste entering Lake Garda were discarded plastic products and debris which may originate from landfill sites.The scientists are also concerned that the discovery of significant amounts of plastic in lake environments could have implications for human populations as the waters are often used for drinking and for agriculture.And they argue that, as in the seas, plastic pollution is likely to be widespread in freshwater bodies."There is nothing particular about Lake Garda," said Prof Laforsch."We are testing in Bavaria and it looks pretty much the same. It is, I think, a problem all over Europe and maybe all over the world."Follow Matt on Twitter.</body>

      <title>Fusion milestone passed at US lab</title>
      <description>Researchers at a US lab have passed a crucial milestone on the way to their ultimate goal of achieving self-sustaining nuclear fusion.</description>

      <date>1381181157</date>
      <body>Researchers at a US lab have passed a crucial milestone on the way to their ultimate goal of achieving self-sustaining nuclear fusion.Harnessing fusion - the process that powers the Sun - could provide an unlimited and cheap source of energy.But to be viable, fusion power plants would have to produce more energy than they consume, which has proven elusive.Now, a breakthrough by scientists at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) could boost hopes of scaling up fusion.NIF, based at Livermore in California, uses 192 beams from the world's most powerful laser to heat and compress a small pellet of hydrogen fuel to the point where nuclear fusion reactions take place.The BBC understands that during an experiment in late September, the amount of energy released through the fusion reaction exceeded the amount of energy being absorbed by the fuel - the first time this had been achieved at any fusion facility in the world.This is a step short of the lab's stated goal of "ignition", where nuclear fusion generates as much energy as the lasers supply. This is because known "inefficiencies" in different parts of the system mean not all the energy supplied through the laser is delivered to the fuel.But the latest achievement has been described as the single most meaningful step for fusion in recent years, and demonstrates NIF is well on its way towards the coveted target of ignition and self-sustaining fusion.For half a century, researchers have strived for controlled nuclear fusion and been disappointed. It was hoped that NIF would provide the breakthrough fusion research needed.In 2009, NIF officials announced an aim to demonstrate nuclear fusion producing net energy by 30 September 2012. But unexpected technical problems ensured the deadline came and went; the fusion output was less than had originally been predicted by mathematical models.Soon after, the $3.5bn facility shifted focus, cutting the amount of time spent on fusion versus nuclear weapons research - which was part of the lab's original mission.However, the latest experiments agree well with predictions of energy output, which will provide a welcome boost to ignition research at NIF, as well as encouragement to advocates of fusion energy in general.It is markedly different from current nuclear power, which operates through splitting atoms - fission - rather than squashing them together in fusion.NIF, based at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, is one of several projects around the world aimed at harnessing fusion. They include the multi-billion-euro ITER facility, currently under construction in Cadarache, France.However, ITER will take a different approach to the laser-driven fusion at NIF; the Cadarache facility will use magnetic fields to contain the hot fusion fuel - a concept known as magnetic confinement.Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter</body>

      <body>A six-week cull of badgers in west Somerset is believed to have ended.The controversial pilot, which has been heavily fought by campaigners, was overseen by Defra in an attempt to stop the spread of TB in cattle.A similar pilot in west Gloucestershire is thought to still be under way. Marksman in both counties are aiming to kill a total of 5,000 badgers.Defra has refused to comment on the success of the cull and neither it nor the NFU could confirm it has ended.Jay Tiernan, spokesman for Stop the Cull, said protesters had "totally destroyed" the pilot.Every night for six weeks, volunteers held patrols of both cull zones to monitor badger setts and worked to disrupt the marksman from shooting.Avon and Somerset Police said just three arrests had been made during the six-week period. In Gloucestershire, 18 people were arrested.Mr Tiernan said the methodology behind the cull "isn't sound".He added: "There's a group of badgers, you start shooting them and they disperse."Secondly the shooters can't get at the badgers to shoot them because we're there."The government licensed the shooting to test whether culling can be carried out in a safe, humane and effective way.It will analyse the results from both pilots to decide whether to extend the culling of badgers to other parts of the country.Supporters say it is the only way to eradicate the spread of TB to livestock.James Small, the Somerset chairman of the National Farmers' Union, said: "These are only two pilots and just represent a small step in trying to combat this disease, but I think there is a sense, at least, that a step has been taken."No details on the total number of badgers shot have yet been released despite requests from the BBC for details.</body>

      <title>Strategy focuses on UK trees' future</title>
      <description>An official strategy is due to be unveiled that aims to protect the UK's broadleaved woodlands.</description>

      <date>1381287732</date>
      <body>An official strategy is due to be unveiled later that aims to protect the UK's broadleaved tree species.The strategy has been developed by Forest Research, part of the Forestry Commission, and two charities, the Earth Trust and Future Trees Trust.It will be launched by environment minister Lord De Mauley at an event in Westminster.It encourages people to choose seeds and saplings carefully to ensure that the trees which they plant do well.Broadleaved trees are those which have wide leaves rather than the needle-like leaves of conifers. They include ash, beech, birch, elm, holly, hornbeam, lime, oak and poplar.The document's authors say broadleaved woodlands have declined over the past 200 years, resulting in 95% of hardwood timber now having to be imported.The 16-page vision, called A Future With Broadleaved Trees, says the trees have a "very special place in our national psyche" but are "much more than just beautiful things".Co-author Dr Steve Lee from Forest Research - the scientific arm of the Forestry Commission - explained: "If they are good quality and grow well, they will lock up carbon for a long period of time. Also, you can make good quality products from the timber, which will last for a very long time."The act of planting a tree, and the cost of that tree, is probably going to be the same regardless of where you get it from," he told BBC News."So you could plant a maladapted tree, wait a long time and it does not grow very well. Yet you could invest the same amount of money in another tree, which grows very well and remains more resilient to any changes that come along in terms of climate, pests and diseases."What we are really saying that the effort is the same, so look around before you plant and think hard about what it is and why it is you are planting those trees."The strategy, which looks ahead to 2025, is centred around three core objectives:Earth Trust chief executive Jayne Manley explained: "Our much loved broadleaved trees could provide significant benefits to people and the environment as well as the rural economy."We need to focus on these trees rather than take them for granted and part of this is identifying and planting 'improved' trees which are productive, healthy and adaptable."Dr Lee added: "What you are really after is something that will remain well adapted on that site and will remain resilient to any environmental impacts that may occur over the 80-year or so rotation period."The suggestion is that the local material, which you might have planted in the past without really thinking about it, might not be the most resilient in the future."</body>

      <body>"Ancient humans" used toothpicks nearly 1.8 million years ago, a study of their teeth has revealed.A team studied hominid jaws from the Dmanisi Republic of Georgia - the earliest evidence of primitive humans outside Africa.They also found evidence of gum disease caused by repeated use of what must have been a basic toothpick.Writing in PNAS, the team says its findings help to explain the diversity found in hominid teeth.The researchers used a new forensic approach to look at variations on the teeth of hominids thought by some to be early European ancestors.Teeth can shed light on what the individuals ate and how old they may have been, but until now it was not clear why there was so much diversity in the Georgian hominid mandibles, or jaws.Ani Margvelashvili, lead author of the study at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, said that scientists dealing with fossil hominid mandibles should pay close attention to tooth wear and the fossil individual's age."Progressive tooth wear triggers bone remodelling processes that substantially modify the shape of the jaw during an individual's lifetime. These effects are typically underestimated when attributing fossil hominid jaws to different species," she told BBC News."The individual who was using a toothpick was young, as his or her teeth were not worn down. We also discovered a damaged area between the tooth area and the gum. There was a small cylinder-shaped lesion - in this area, if you place a toothpick it goes through."The researchers analysed four mandibles from one of the biggest collections of well-preserved early human remnants known anywhere in the world.The Dmanisi site has been valued as an important place to look at how hominids migrated from Africa."It's not very often you have one site with four mandibles. It has allowed us to see special features that have not been seen before," explained David Lordkipanidze of the Georgian National Museum.This included horizontal scratches on a lesion, visible on the root surface of one of the teeth."Scientists often describe groups with new characters as different species. Here we show in one group you can see many characteristics. It shows once more how complicated the story of human evolution is," Prof Lordkipanidze, co-author of the work, told BBC News.It is still unclear what species the Dmanisi hominids were. Experts once believed it was Homo erectus who first ventured out of Africa.But the Dmanisi hominids were not typical of the tall-standing and big-brained H. erectus. Instead, the Dmanisi individuals were short, long-armed, small-brained and thin browed. The fossils are therefore now sometimes referred to as Homo georgicus.Louise Humphrey from the Natural History Museum, London, said there had been a longstanding interest in the causes and implications of the high degree of variation in their mandibles and crania."This paper demonstrates that remodelling of the mandible associated with heavy tooth wear and continuous tooth eruption could contribute to that variation."Peter Ungar from the University of Arkansas, US, said the study could provide a new way of looking at fossils."Tooth pick markings are not uncommon in fossil hominids from this time period, but this clinical, forensic approach is new and potentially useful."Analyses of tooth movements due to wear have been more-or-less limited to anatomically modern humans, and this paper introduces the approach to paleoanthropology," Prof Ungar added.</body>

      <body>Three scientists have won the Nobel Prize for medicine or physiology after discovering how cells precisely transport material.James Rothman and Randy Schekman, both from the US, and Thomas Sudhof, from Germany, shared the prize.They found the way "vesicles" act like a fleet of ships transporting their goods to the exact destination.It is crucial for the way the brain communicates, the release of hormones and parts of the immune system.The billions of cells which make up the body are not empty blobs, instead they are packed with precise machinery. In order for a cell to function properly it needs the right materials in the right place at the right time.Vesicles are tiny bubbles of fat which act as the cell's internal shipping service. They can send material such as enzymes, neurotransmitters and hormones, around the cell. Or they can fuse with the outer surface of the cell and release their contents into the wider body.The prize committee said the findings: "Had a major impact on our understanding of how cargo is delivered with timing and precision within and outside the cell."Without this wonderfully precise organisation, the cell would lapse into chaos."A defective vesicle transport system is implicated in diabetes and brain disorders.Prof James Rothman, from Yale University, found proteins embedded in the vesicles which act as the docking mechanism meaning the cargo is released in the correct location.Prof Randy Schekman, from the University of California at Berkeley, discovered the genes which regulated the transport system in yeast. He found that mutations in three genes resulted in a "situation resembling a poorly planned public transport system".After hearing of the award he said: "My first reaction was 'Oh, my God! That was also my second reaction."Prof Thomas Sudhof, originally from Germany but now at Stanford University in the US, made breakthroughs in how the transport system works in the brain so that neurotransmitters are released at the precise time.Dr Lisa Swanton, from the University of Manchester, said: "Vesicles are like a postman's bag, they have to get to a specific address."They have worked out the mechanism of sending to the right location, they have advanced the field enormously."They have revolutionised understanding of how cells are organised which is fundamental to huge number of diseases."</body>

      <title>'Digital baby' screen for sperm donors</title>
      <description>A service that digitally weaves together the DNA of prospective parents to check for potential disease in thousands of "virtual babies" is set to launch in the US by December.</description>

      <body>A service that digitally weaves together the DNA of prospective parents to check for potential disease in thousands of "virtual babies" is set to launch in the US by December.New York start-up Genepeeks will initially focus on donor sperm, simulating before pregnancy how the genetic sequence of a female client might combine with those of different males.Donors that more often produce "digital children" with a higher risk of inherited disorders will be filtered out, leaving those who are better genetic matches.Everything happens in a computer, but experts have raised ethical questions."We are just in the business right now of giving prospective mothers, who are using donor sperm to conceive, a filtered catalogue of donors based on their own underlying genetic profile," Genepeeks co-founder Anne Morriss told BBC News."We are filtering out the donor matches with an elevated risk of rare recessive paediatric conditions."Ms Morriss, an entrepreneur, gave a presentation on the company at the Consumer Genetics Conference in Boston last week.She was motivated in part by her own experience of starting a family. Her son was conceived with a sperm donor who happened to share with Morriss the gene for an inherited disorder called MCADD.MCADD (medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency) prevents those affected from converting fats to sugar. It can be fatal if it is not diagnosed early. Luckily, in Ms Morriss's case, the condition was picked up in newborn screening tests."My son has a pretty normal life," Ms Morriss said, "but about 30% of children with rare genetic diseases don't make it past the age of five."Genepeeks has formalised a partnership with a sperm bank - the Manhattan Cryobank - and has a patent pending on the DNA screening technology.The start-up benefits from the rapid pace of change in genetic technology.Indeed, six months ago, Genepeeks' founders decided it was able to use a superior system for DNA analysis (called "targeted exon sequencing") than the one originally envisaged - a result, says Anne Morriss, of falling costs and increased flexibility.For couples planning babies, other companies already screen one or both partners for genes that could cause disease if combined with a similar variant - so-called "carrier screening".One academic who studies the use of genetic technology commented: "This is like that, but ramped up 100,000 times."Ms Morriss's business partner, Prof Lee Silver, a geneticist and expert on bioethics at Princeton University, New Jersey, told BBC News: "We get the DNA sequence from two prospective parents. We simulate the process of reproduction, forming virtual sperm and virtual eggs. We put them together to form a hypothetical child genome."Then we can look at that hypothetical genome and - with all the tools of modern genetics - determine the risk that the genome will result in a child with disease. We're looking directly for disease and not carrier status. For each pair of people that we're going to analyse, we make 10,000 hypothetical children."The process will be run for the client and each potential donor one by one, scanning for some 600 known single-gene recessive conditions. In this way, the highest-risk pairings can be filtered out.Anne Morriss added: "At this stage our clients won't be receiving any genetic information back. We're very much focused on the practical utility of helping prospective parents who want to protect their future kids, giving them the option of additional analysis to what is currently being offered in the industry."But the company's founders have plans to expand the screening beyond single-gene recessive disorders to more complex conditions in which multiple genes play a part.Indeed, going to the trouble of simulating thousands of digital children deliberately lays the ground for this: "[It's] impossible to get towards an accurate risk calculation in any other way," said Anne Morriss.And in a video produced by the company, Prof Silver says: "My hope for the future is that any people who want to have a baby can use this technology to greatly reduce the risk of disease being expressed in their child."To some, such a prospect might appear like a step towards designer babies - until now the preserve of science fiction literature and films such as Gattaca, which envisaged a future of genetic "haves" and "have-nots".Bio-ethicists approached by the BBC said Genepeeks was a logical outcome of the increasing demand for more information when making reproductive decisions.However, some raised potential concerns about risk communication and the expansion of screening beyond rare single-gene disorders. But they suggested there were few, if any, regulatory barriers.One ethicist told BBC News: "The biggest question for me, just from the outset, is the understanding of uncertainty. Even people who have been doing genomics for years still have a hard time figuring out exactly what a risk for a particular genetic predisposition really means for a family."Gene-environment interactions can lead to people either having disease or not having disease."Dr Ewan Birney, associate director of the European Bioinformatics Institute in Hinxton, UK, echoed the point: "It's good that they're focusing on the carrier status of these rare Mendelian disorders where it's potentially more clear-cut. That said, these things are more complex than they first seem," he said."I'm sure the scientists appreciate that complexity. But when transmitting that complexity to everyday people, these things can sound more absolute than they really are."He added: "The thing I would want to stress here is just how complex this is. It's great that people are thinking of using this technology in lots of different ways, but our knowledge gap is very large."Risk communication to clients was, said Anne Morriss, "absolutely critical to anyone in this industry"."We have to be crystal clear about what we're testing for, what risks we're helping to reduce; that there's no guarantee you won't give birth to a sick child," she said.Prof Mildred Cho, associate director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics in California, raised questions over whether the sperm donor should also receive information about their genome gleaned from the screening process."Unlike hair colour, occupation or family history - those are things, presumably, the donor already knows - the thing that's different about this that I see is it could create information that the donor doesn't already have. It also has implications for the donor's other biological family members," Prof Cho told BBC News.This week it also emerged that California-based consumer genetics company 23andMe had submitted the patent on a DNA analysis tool for planning a child.Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter</body>

      <title>New shape-shifting metals discovered</title>
      <description>Scientists develop a new family of smart materials that could be used in applications ranging from space vehicles to electronics to jet engines.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24400101</url>
      <date>1380888037</date>
      <body>A new shape-changing metal crystal is reported in the journal Nature, by scientists at University of Minnesota.It is the prototype of a new family of smart materials that could be used in applications ranging from space vehicles to electronics to jet engines.Called a "martensite", the crystal has two different arrangements of atoms, switching seamlessly between them.It can change shape tens of thousands of times when heated and cooled without degrading, unlike existing technology.Currently, martensite metals are made of an alloyed mixture of nickel and titanium.They have the remarkable ability to "remember" their shape and even after being bent will return to their original form. For this, they are called "shape memory" metals.They have been used in spectacle frames and brassiere wires, but also in surgery as frameworks for shaping healing bones, and as "stents" for holding heart arteries open.Martensite metals change shape when heated or cooled through a certain temperature, when the atoms that make up their structure rearrange themselves in a sudden transformation.Some call this a "military transformation" because the rows of atoms that make up the metal crystal click into their new shape in an orderly manner.The transformation means that martensite can be used in smart mechanisms that respond to temperature change.Examples include automatic windows-openers in glasshouses, a means for automatically guiding solar panels to point at the Sun on the Hubble Space Telescope, and, very recently, a proposed use in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to morph the trailing edge of the engine cowling, making it quieter when it runs hot on take-off."The pitfall of current martensites is that after repeated shape changes, they build up stresses inside that degrade them and eventually break them apart. The new alloy, made of a mixture of zinc, gold and copper, changes back and forth almost indefinitely with little internal damage, opening up a new range of applications for these types of "active materials".The aim is now to apply the lessons learned from the new metal to make a family of ceramic solids that can also be shape-switched back and forth."The real advance is to make the transformations reversible that could be applied in many situations" explains Prof Richard James, one of the authors of the study."You could make devices that convert heat to electricity directly. They could use the waste heat from computers and cell phones to recharge the battery and make them more efficient."As the material cycles through its different atomic arrangements, crystals can be seen at its surface in ever-changing patterns, looking like microscopic rivers.The structures fit together without any stress layers between them, and this seems to be the key to their longevity and potential.The new materials could also be used in improved and efficient microelectromechanical systems - energy harvesting devices, in which small vibrations can be converted directly into power.These sorts of gizmos are already used in tyre pressure-monitoring systems in cars to power the electronics in the sensors.</body>

      <title>Top five physics discoveries chosen</title>
      <description>Quantum computers and science that could enable mobile phone shoe chargers are among the top physics spin-offs chosen by a leading magazine.</description>

      <body>Five physics discoveries with the potential to transform the world have been selected by a leading science magazine for its 25th birthday issue.Quantum computing and science that could enable shoes to charge a mobile phone are among the list compiled by Physics World.A potential new tumour treatment called hadron therapy and the "wonder-material" graphene also feature.The magazine also picked its top five breakthroughs of the last 25 years.In all, the publication compiled five lists of five to examine different aspects of physics.Graphene has been one of the most talked-about discoveries in the last decade.Its strength, flexibility and conductivity make it a potentially ideal material for bendable smartphones and superior prosthetic limbs.But graphene has another, less-heralded property which could help it transform the everyday lives of people around the world.Despite being just one atom thick, it is impervious to almost all liquids and gases.Generating holes in sheets of graphene could therefore create a selective membrane - "the ultimate water purifier" - which might someday create drinking water from the sea."Predicting the future is a mug's game. Of course, we expect to get a few of them wrong," Hamish Johnston, editor of physicsworld.com told BBC News."Grandiose, utopian predictions that never materialise always look faintly ridiculous in years to come - have you seen anyone recently flying to work on a nuclear-powered jet-pack?"Physics World is the monthly magazine of the Institute of Physics and was first published in October 1988.Selecting the five most important breakthroughs of its lifetime was "harder than choosing Nobel laureates", according to reporter Tushna Commissariat."There have been so many eye-popping findings that our final choice is, inevitably, open to debate," she wrote."Yet for us, these five discoveries stand out above all others as having done the most to transform our understanding of the world."They are, in chronological order:The magazine's 25th anniversary issue also highlights five images that have allowed us to "see" a physical phenomenon or effect.They range from the microscopic - electrons on a copper crystal - to the enormous - the Cat's Eye Nebula, as photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope.The list of five "biggest unanswered questions" features some eternal riddles - "is life on Earth unique?" Another is: "what exactly is time?"The final top five is a set of "fiendish physics-themed puzzles" devised by the British signals intelligence agency GCHQ.The first has already appeared online - a jumbled set of letters on a page which need to be deciphered before arriving at a physics-themed answer.A similar puzzle was recently used by GCHQ to attract potential employees.It will be followed by another four problems, one per week throughout October, which will become progressively more challenging."We think the puzzles are going to really stretch even the brightest minds," says Matin Durrani, editor of Physics World."You won't need any physics to solve them, but they are certainly going to make you think and they're a fun way to celebrate our 25th anniversary."I also hope our top fives in the birthday issue will remind everyone just how vital, enjoyable and interesting physics can be."</body>

      <description>US military-funded Boston Dynamics is developing astonishingly realistic animal and humanoid robots that can cross rough terrain, balance and gallop.</description>

      <body>Meet Atlas, a humanoid robot capable of crossing rough terrain and maintaining its balance on one leg even when hit from the side.And WildCat, the four-legged robot that can gallop untethered at up to 16mph (26km/h).These are the latest creations of Boston Dynamics, a US robotics company part-funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa).The robots are part of Darpa's Maximum Mobility and Manipulation programme.Darpa says such robots "hold great promise for amplifying human effectiveness in defence operations".Referring to Atlas's ability to remain balanced despite being hit by a lateral weight, Noel Sharkey, professor of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at the University of Sheffield, told the BBC: "This is an astonishing achievement... quite a remarkable feat."This version of Atlas is one of seven humanoid robots Boston Dynamics is developing in response to the Darpa Robotics Challenge.In December, competing robots will be set eight tasks to test their potential for use in emergency-response situations, including crossing uneven ground, using power tools and driving a rescue vehicle.Darpa wants to improve the manoeuvrability and controllability of such robots while reducing manufacturing costs.WildCat can bound, gallop and turn, mimicking the movements of quadruped animals. It is powered by an internal combustion engine."It is a shame that such technology is not being developed with other research funding," said Prof Sharkey, who is also chair of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control."We do not know what military purpose it will serve but certainly it is a step towards a high-speed ground robot that could be weaponised to hunt and kill."The video shows WildCat performing on a flat surface, but Prof Sharkey said: "It would be good to see how well it could perform in a muddy field."Last year, Boston Dynamics' Cheetah robot reached a sprint speed of 28.3mph tethered to a treadmill.Geoff Pegman, managing director of RURobots, told the BBC: "Robotics has been making important strides in recent years, and these are a couple of demonstrations of the technology moving forward."However, their application may be limited to areas such as defence and, maybe specialised construction or demolition tasks."In other applications there are more efficient ways of achieving the mobility more cost effectively."</body>

      <title>Body clock 'reset button' found</title>
      <description>The prospect of drugs to rapidly reset the body clock to avoid jet lag and the pains of shift work has moved a step close after research in Japan.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24387491</url>
      <date>1380823371</date>
      <body>Drugs that rapidly tweak the body clock in order to avoid jet lag and the pains of shift work have moved a step closer after research in Japan.The team at Kyoto University has found the clock's 'reset button' inside the brain.Their study, published in the journal Science, showed the button could be used to switch the clock to a new time zone in a single day.Experts said the team was "close to the money" in the hunt for a jet lag cure.There are clocks throughout the body and a "master clock" in the brain, keeping the body in sync with the world around it to make people sleepy at night.Anyone who has ever done shift work or a long-haul flight has experienced the disrupted sleep and hunger patterns of a body clock which is out of tune with the rising and setting of the sun.The clock uses light to help keep track of time, but it is naturally stubborn and adjusts slowly.The rough rule is that for every time zone crossed it takes a full day for the body to catch up. Fly from London to Beijing and it would take a week for the body clock to fully adapt.The team in Japan have come up with a way to get the master clock to be a bit more flexible.It is a group of 10,000 brain cells - about the same size as a grain of rice - which constantly talk to each other to keep a strict control over the time.The scientists found that interfering with the vasopressin receptors, essentially a brain cell's ears that allow it to keep in touch with its neighbours, let the clock shift rapidly.Genetically modified mice which had no vasopressin receptors were able to adjust to the clocks being put back eight hours within a single day, while normal mice took six days.When the clocks were put forward eight hours then it took normal mice eight days to adapt, but those without vasopressin receptors adjusted in two.Similar results were then achieved in normal mice using a drug.The study's authors concluded: "Studies have shown that chronic jet lag and rotating shift work can increase an individual's risk of developing hypertension, obesity, and other metabolic disorders."Our results identify vasopressin signalling as a possible therapeutic target for the management of circadian rhythm [body clock] misalignment."Dr Michael Hastings, a Medical Research Council body clock researcher, told the BBC's Science in Action programme: "It's a remarkable study, it really is very exciting for our field."There's been many false dawns when it comes to a cure for jet lag, but I think this time they're close to the money."However, he cautioned that vasopressin receptors were also heavily involved in kidney function so any drug developed would need to be designed carefully to target the body clock without disrupting the kidneys.Dr Hastings added that with an increasingly 24-7 society a drug which can adjust the body clock could, in theory, improve the health of shift workers."The issue here in terms of public health is rotational shift work, the epidemiological evidence that we have now shows that if a worker has spent a working life doing rotational shift work they're at higher risk of contracting certain forms of cancer, cardiovascular disease or metabolic syndrome like diabetes."</body>

      <title>Supervolcanoes ripped up early Mars</title>
      <description>Early Mars may have been wracked by giant explosive volcanoes that spewed billions upon billions of tonnes of rock and ash into the sky.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24348673</url>
      <date>1380733767</date>
      <body>Mars may have had giant explosive volcanoes in its ancient past that spewed billions upon billions of tonnes of rock and ash into the sky.Vast areas of collapsed ground in a region of the planet called Arabia Terra are their likely remains, believe Joe Michalski and Jacob Bleacher.The two scientists report their findings in this week's Nature journal.They say such supervolcanoes would have had a profound impact on the early evolution of Mars.Their gases would have influenced the make-up of the atmosphere and perturbed the climate. And the ashfall would have covered the landscape across great swathes of the planet. It is quite likely some of the deposits the rovers are now encountering on Mars have their origin in colossal blasts."Scientists know the planet must have been more active in its deep past, in its first billion years. But we've always struggled to find evidence for these early volcanoes. The supervolcanoes we report in Nature may solve this puzzle," said Dr Michalski, who is affiliated to the Natural History Museum in London, and the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona.Supervolcano is an informal term to describe an immense eruptive event that expels in excess of a 1,000 cu km of rock and ash.Earth has experienced this type of cataclysm numerous times, although not for many thousands of years. The US Yellowstone National Park, for example, sits on top of a past supervolcano.But these behemoths are not so straightforward to identify.Unlike, familiar volcanoes - such as Etna or St Helens on Earth, or indeed Olympus Mons on Mars - supervolcanoes do not build mountains out of layers of lava. Rather, their great scale means that, when they erupt, the whole landscape lets go with multiple vents and fissures. And after the eruption, the ground will fall back into the void left by all the ejected material, producing a large bowl or caldera.Michalski and Bleacher, from Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center, have identified a number of potential supervolcanoes in an area of Mars's northern hemisphere known as Arabia Terra. It is assumed to be one of the oldest terrains on the planet.The researchers say their calderas are unlikely to be old meteorite impacts sites because they are irregular in shape, and lack the raised rim and central peak often found at impact craters. Neither do they have an apron of ejected material, another classic impact trait."Our best example is Eden Patera," Dr Michalski told the BBC's Science In Action programme."Thousands of cubic kilometres of material would have been erupted, and that's a minimum. In terms of size, it would be very similar to Yellowstone - about 70km across. So, imagine driving for an hour; it would take you most of that time to get across this hole in the ground."The supervolcanoes' gases would certainly have influenced the composition of the early atmosphere and the evolution of the climate thereafter. But they may also have had an impact on Mars' potential for habitability, by pulling up substantial quantities of water and the essential elements needed for life from deep inside the planet.These are ideas that can be tested by Nasa's Curiosity rover, which is heading for a large mountain in the middle of Gale Crater on Mars' equator.No-one knows how this mountain formed, but some fraction of its layers may well be ashfall, possibly from the Arabia Terra supervolcanoes; and if not these particular volcanoes then perhaps other giants that have yet to be identified in satellite images."If future work shows that supervolcanoes were present more widely on ancient Mars, it would completely change estimates of how the atmosphere formed from volcanic gases, how sediments formed from volcanic ash and how habitable the surface might have been," emphasised Dr Michalski.Commenting on the research, Mars expert Dr Peter Grindrod, from Birkbeck, University of London, said: "Understanding ancient terrains on Earth is extremely difficult because of subsequent processes hiding or removing the evidence - attempting to understand the earliest periods of Mars' history is even more challenging, as in addition we are limited to data returned from spacecraft."However, this study is a fascinating example of just what can be achieved with data from recent missions. This study is important because, if correct, it not only tells us something about Mars' early geological history, but can also help explain the source of later sedimentary deposits, many of which are important in studies of habitability on Mars."And planetary geologist Dr Dave Rothery, from the Open University, proffered: "It is entirely plausible that the few, slightly anomalous, large craters that Michalski and Bleacher have highlighted are volcanic rather than impact craters. If so, then their size would suggest that they could well have erupted in the style of supervolcanoes on Earth."We know that such eruptions have had profound but short-lived effects on the Earth's climate."Were such an event to happen on Mars, it could either cool the globe (because of a global ash and aerosol cloud) or warm it (because of erupted greenhouse gases). The latter could lead to episodes of surface water flow, responsible for carving some of the medium-size valley systems on Mars."Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos</body>

      <title>EU hails global green tax on flights</title>
      <description>The EU and its critics both claim victory in the battle over green taxes on flights to and from Europe, after a deal was struck.</description>

      <body>The EU and its critics are both claiming victory in the battle over green taxes on flights to and from Europe, after a deal was struck.The world's governments agreed that all airlines should join a global scheme to cut carbon emissions. But details will not be negotiated until 2016.There is still pressure on the EU to delay imposing its Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) on aviation.The EU said its leadership had led to the deal, but greens disputed that.Environmentalists accused the EU of caving in to pressure.The new deal was reached on Friday after long negotiations in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).It ends for the first time the notion of exceptionalism that has been cultivated by the industry.The aviation sector will attempt to negotiate by 2016 a market-based mechanism (taxes, tradeable permits or carbon offsets) to tackle emissions from flying.Technical innovations will play a part too. The deal will be in place by 2020, when the new UN climate deal - not yet negotiated - is due to start.An EU spokesman told BBC News: “It’s a very positive outcome. After more than 15 years of talks we got a deal. The reality is, if it hadn’t been for EU pressure [through extending the ETS to aviation] this probably wouldn’t have happened.”Paul Steele, executive director of the industry-wide Air Transport Action Group, said it was "clearly an historic resolution"."It represents significant progress. We now have agreement on a global scheme and a timeline and the building blocks to deliver it.”But there was fierce resistance from some nations in the ICAO to curbing aviation emissions, especially from emerging economies with big territories like Brazil, China and India. And developing countries, particularly in Africa, have secured what appears to be a complete get-out clause.Bill Hemmings from the green group Transport and Environment said: “The EU ETS, the only international measure that actually reduces emissions from international aviation, has been hamstrung by ICAO delegates more interested in evading responsibility than protecting the environment. The text is full of holes… exactly what it was supposed to avoid.”Samantha Smith from the environmental group WWF said “the science is clearer than ever - 2020 is too late".Last month the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said there was convincing evidence that human activity was causing global warming."Right after the recent IPCC release, this was the first chance for governments in ICAO to take decisive action, and they failed,” Ms Smith said.It is not clear what happens now to the ETS aviation scheme. Plans to extend it to aircraft were previously put on hold, as the EU compromised to avoid a trade war.The ICAO meeting voted to prohibit any nation imposing its own scheme without a global agreement. But the EU is not convinced that this vote is binding and a spokesman told me there would be discussions in coming weeks over the way ahead.This agonised process for just one sector indicates just how hard it will be to get a global deal on greenhouse gas emissions that the UN expects in 2020.Follow Roger on Twitter</body>

      <title>Pollution 'hampers bees' foraging'</title>
      <description>Honeybees' ability to find flowers could be hampered by a chemical in diesel exhaust, say scientists.</description>

      <body>Honeybees' ability to find flowers could be hampered by a chemical in diesel exhaust, say scientists.Tests showed that exhaust degraded some floral scent chemicals the bees "home in on" when they are foraging.The study, published in Scientific Reports, also revealed that a specific group of chemicals found in diesel exhaust, known as NOx, diminished the insects' response to floral scents.They say the results are evidence that air quality should be improved."We got into this, because we were aware of the impacts of airborne pollutants on human health, so it didn't seem so wild that there may be impacts that extended beyond human health," said University of Southampton neuroscientist Dr Tracey Newman, who was involved in the work.To drill down to the chemical effects of pollution on the pollinators, the researchers made a mixture of the volatile, or smelly, chemicals that make up the scent of oilseed rape.They then used a diesel-powered generator to create a mixture of air and exhaust that closely matched levels of exhaust found on a busy road, and mixed this lab-made air pollution with the floral scent mix."We saw that there was loss of two of the components [of the floral odour mixture]," Dr Newman said.The two odour chemicals that were "lost" had chemically reacted with a component of the diesel exhaust, mono-nitrogen oxide, known as NOx.Having worked out how the pollution affected the chemistry of floral scents, the team set out to discover if the bees were affected by this change."Bees need to decipher the chemical messages they're getting [from flowers] to be able to home in on the flowers they know will give the best yield [of nectar]," said Dr Newman.The pollinators, she said, learned to recognise the scents of nectar-rich flowers and this enabled them to forage more efficiently.The team carried out a test that involved teaching bees to associate the smell of a particular chemical with being given a drop of sugary liquid.Bees respond to the taste of the sugar by sticking out their tongues - just as they do when drinking nectar from a flower. So after a few trials where the scent of the odour is followed closely by a sweet drop of liquid, the bees stick out their tongues as soon as they detect the scent."Having trained a bunch of bees, we then tested to see if they would respond in the same way to the mixture that was depleted by exposure to NOx [the reactive chemical in diesel exhaust]," said Dr Newman.When these odour chemicals were degraded by NOx, the bees were much less responsive to their smell and would not stick out their tongues.Biologist and lead researcher Dr Guy Poppy added that the airborne pollution appeared to be interfering with "the complex relationship" that had evolved between plants and animals."Flowers have evolved to produce chemical mixtures that attract pollinators," he told BBC News.Dr Newman added that the study highlighted the need to reduce pollution and improve air quality, in order to protect pollinating insects as well as improve human health.The value to food production of so-called "pollination services" is estimated to be hundreds of millions of pounds per year in the UK alone.Prof James Nieh, who studies honeybee health and behaviour at the University of California San Diego, said that the research posed a "largely unexplored question"."Most research on such contaminants has focused on pesticides," he told BBC News."But bees are subject to a much wider variety of pollutants and contaminants. The influence and potential synergy of these pollutants with pesticides should be studied."</body>

      <body>Japan's crippled Fukushima nuclear plant has a new leak of radioactive water after workers overfilled a storage tank, its operator says.The workers miscalculated the tank's capacity as it was tilted on unlevel ground, plant operator Tepco said.It said around 430 litres (100 gallons) of water may have leaked from the tank, and could have flowed into the sea.The plant has experienced several leaks since being crippled by an earthquake and tsunami in 2011.One of the largest leaks took place in August, when Tepco discovered a leak of at least 300 tonnes of highly radioactive water at a different part of the plant.The latest leak was discovered by workers late on Wednesday.Tepco official Masayuki Ono said: "We would like to apologise that we have to announce that we've had another leak in our tanks today.""This is partly because we've had to fill our tanks to the brim in order to deal with the difficult management of rain water overflow following [a typhoon]," he added.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said that Tepco had failed to deal with the leaks successfully."It's actually leaking so of course we can't say that [Tepco] have been properly dealing with the issue. It should not be leaking at all," he said.The 2011 disaster knocked out cooling systems to the nuclear plant's reactors, three of which melted down.Water is now being pumped in to cool the reactors, but storing the resultant large quantities of radioactive water has proved a challenge for Tepco.In September, the government said it would invest hundreds of millions of dollars into building a frozen wall around the plant to stop the leaks.</body>

      <title>Trees in ancient forest are felled</title>
      <description>The felling of diseased trees across an area the size of around 300 football pitches is taking place at Wales' largest ancient woodland.</description>

      <date>1380916448</date>
      <body>The felling of diseased trees across an area the size of around 300 football pitches is taking place at Wales' largest ancient woodland.Larch trees at Wentwood Forest, near Newport, have become infected with the fungal disease Phytophthora ramorum.The infection can kill trees and has spread across the UK after being found in south west England four years ago.The Woodland Trust, which owns most of the forest, said the felling of the trees was essential."This is the most serious and devastating action we've had to take on our estate," said the trust's head of woodland management, Andrew Sharkey."It again highlights both the need to tackle tree disease and the importance of restoring as much of our damaged ancient woodland to make it more resilient in decades to come."Felling the infected conifers across an area of 200 hectares (500 acres) will leave the Woodland Trust with a £35,000 bill for replanting in the forest.It also hits restoration work that has been taking place since the trust bought 352 hectares (869 acres) of Wentwood in 2006."Our aim was to prevent clear felling at Wentwood from happening. However, there is no alternative," explained Rory Francis, also from the trust."We are hoping that the action will slow down the spread of the infection or perhaps halt it."Wentwood Forest is the remains of the ancient tree cover that stretched from the River Wye to the River Usk.Conifers were first introduced to the wood in 1880, and much of the forest cleared to provide timber for trenches in World War I.When it was replanted in the 1950s and 1960s, the once abundant broadleaf trees were replaced with imported conifers, ultimately damaging the forest floor and its natural formation.The forest is spread out over 400 hectares (1,000 acres) and is home to 75 species of birds, including turtle doves, nightjars and spotted flycatchers, and is a habitat for dormice, otters, and pipistrelle bats.It is also a home to wild bluebells, wood sorrel and wild daffodils."Every time you have to clear-fell, the risk is that the shock of the sudden change in conditions stresses some of the native species and they could be lost," said Mr Francis."So in the short term, it will have a negative impact. We don't want to do it but it is a legal requirement."Natural Resources Wales (NRW), which manages most of the remaining forest, said it had already invested £500,000 across Wales to halt the spread of the infection, and was setting aside another £2m to tackle the problem.The disease has recently been discovered at Bwlch Nant-yr-Arian near Aberystwyth and at Cwmcarn Forest Drive in Caerphilly county borough.The infection has also spread to parts of north Wales, at Coed Maentwrog near Porthmadog, and at Coed Cymerau near Blaenau Ffestiniog.It has also affected larches across south west England, Northern Ireland and the west of Scotland."The felling in Wentwood Forest is very sad but this prompt action by the Woodland Trust is essential to try to slow the spread of this devastating disease," said John Browne, from NRW."Our ultimate aim is to make our forests more resilient to pests and diseases and we are heartened that the Woodland Trust is to seize this opportunity to undertake change of structure and species within Wentwood Forest by planting native broadleaves."The felled larch trees will be replaced with a mix of oak and cherry trees, and other broadleaf native trees."In some ways it will actually accelerate the work to plant native trees, but it is not in the circumstances we would have preferred," added the trust's Mr Francis.</body>

      <title>Omani owl could be new species</title>
      <description>A team working on a bird call recording project in Oman says it has discovered a new species of owl in the region.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/24374313</url>
      <date>1380868987</date>
      <body>Ornithologists working in Oman say an owl discovered in a remote, mountainous region could be a new species.Wildlife sound-recordist Magnus Robb told BBC News that he heard the bird's call whilst trying to record the call of another type of owl.After repeated trips to the remote site, he and a colleague - naturalist and photographer Arnoud van den Berg - captured photographs of the bird.They have published their observations in the journal Dutch Birding.Mr Robb's first recordings of the bird's unfamiliar hoot were a serendipitous discovery in March of this year."I was listening through my headphones, when I suddenly heard something completely different [to the owl species I was there to record]," he told BBC News."I know the other Arabian owl sounds quite well, and this was clearly something that didn't fit."The bird call expert said he had a "good inkling straight away that this could be something new"."I even phoned a colleague a few minutes later and said, 'I think I've just discovered a new species of owl."Mr Robb, who is involved in an international project called the Sound Approach, which aims to catalogue and understand bird sound, analysed the owls' call in detail.This revealed that the bird was most likely to belong to a genus, or group of species, known as Strix.Dr Wesley Hochachka from Cornell University's lab of ornithology commented that, in the last few decades, it had become "more accepted by ornithologists, particularly in tropical areas, that new species are being discovered based on distinctively different vocalisations".The team plans to gather DNA evidence from the owl's feathers in order to confirm their find genetically.But Prof Ian Newton, a bird expert from the UK's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said he found the evidence that the team had already provided convincing."Based on the recordings of songs and calls and on the good-quality photographs, I was also convinced that it should be placed within the genus Strix, which also contains the Tawny Owl of Britain and Europe," he told BBC News.Mr Robb said he hoped eventually to name the new species the Omani owl, in honour of the Omani people."One of the reasons we've gone through this process of describing and confirming this as a new species so quickly is to get conservation for this owl as soon as possible," he explained to BBC News."Conservation can only start when this species is accepted and given some official status."He hopes to return to Oman later this year in to learn more about the owl, its habitat and its behaviour.So far, he and and his colleagues have found only seven of the birds in a single wadi in the remote, mountainous area of Oman."This suggests that it's a very rare creature indeed," he told BBC News.</body>

      <title>Health of oceans 'declining fast'</title>
      <description>The health of the world’s oceans is deteriorating even faster than scientists previously thought, a report says.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24369244</url>
      <date>1380777580</date>
      <body>The health of the world’s oceans is deteriorating even faster than had previously been thought, a report says.A review from the International Programme on the State of the Ocean (IPSO), warns that the oceans are facing multiple threats.They are being heated by climate change, turned slowly less alkaline by absorbing CO2, and suffering from overfishing and pollution.The report warns that dead zones formed by fertiliser run-off are a problem.It says conditions are ripe for the sort of mass extinction event that has afflicted the oceans in the past.It says: “We have been taking the ocean for granted. It has been shielding us from the worst effects of accelerating climate change by absorbing excess CO2 from the atmosphere.“Whilst terrestrial temperature increases may be experiencing a pause, the ocean continues to warm regardless. For the most part, however, the public and policymakers are failing to recognise - or choosing to ignore - the severity of the situation.”It says the cocktail of threats facing the ocean is more powerful than the individual problems themselves.Coral reefs, for instance, are suffering from the higher temperatures and the effects of acidification whilst also being weakened by bad fishing practices, pollution, siltation and toxic algal blooms.IPSO, funded by charitable foundations, is publishing a set of five papers based on workshops in 2011 and 2012 in partnership with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN’s) World Commission on Protected Areas.The reports call for world governments to halt CO2 increase at 450ppm. Any higher, they say, will cause massive acidification later in the century as the CO2 is absorbed into the sea.It urges much more focused fisheries management, and a priority list for tackling the key groups of chemicals that cause most harm.It wants the governments to negotiate a new agreement for the sustainable fishing in the high oceans to be policed by a new global high seas enforcement agency.The IUCN’s Prof Dan Laffoley said: "What these latest reports make absolutely clear is that deferring action will increase costs in the future and lead to even greater, perhaps irreversible, losses."The UN climate report confirmed that the ocean is bearing the brunt of human-induced changes to our planet. These findings give us more cause for alarm – but also a roadmap for action. We must use it."The co-coordinator, Prof Alex Rogers from Oxford University has been asked to advise the UN's own oceans assessment but he told BBC News he had led the IPSO initiative because: "It’s important to have something which is completely independent in any way from state influence and to say things which experts in the field felt was really needed to be said."He said concern had grown over the past year thanks to papers signalling that past extinctions had involved warming seas, acidification and low oxygen levels. All are on the rise today.He agreed there was debate on whether fisheries are recovering by better management following examples in the US and Europe, but said it seemed clear that globally they were not.He also admitted a debate about whether overall climate change would increase the amount of fish produced in the sea. Melting sea ice would increase fisheries near the poles whilst stratification of warmer waters in the tropics would reduce mixing of nutrients and lead to lower production, he said.He said dead zones globally appeared to be increasing although this may reflect increased reporting."On ocean acidification, we are seeing effects that no-one predicted like the inability of fish to detect their environments properly. It’s clear that it will affect many species. We really do have to get a grip on what’s going on in the oceans," he said.Follow Roger on Twitter</body>

      <body>A rare egg of an endangered bird from India has been discovered at the University of Aberdeen, and it is hoped it could help save the species.The breeding habits of the Jerdon's Courser are mysterious.DNA analysis was used to identify the egg as belonging to the bird, after it was unearthed within an old collection at the institution's zoology museum.It is now hoped the discovery could help conservationists working to save the species in India.Dr Alan Knox, the university's emeritus head of museums who found the egg among a collection dating back to the 1900s, said: "I was looking through drawers of uncatalogued eggs when I spotted an egg labelled as belonging to this species."It was one of those eureka moments - finding something nobody else knows about, something so rare and exciting. I could hardly believe my eyes."My first question was how do you identify something that the books say has never been discovered?"He continued: "Very little is actually known about this extremely rare bird which inhabits an area only a few kilometres wide."It was seen only a few times in southern India before it was presumed extinct around 1900. It was rediscovered in 1986 but is listed as a critically endangered species."Without any others to compare it with, the process of correctly identifying the egg was a challenge."Dr Knox took the egg to the Natural History Museum in Tring, Hertfordshire, and the identification was confirmed after DNA was extracted from dried-up membrane scraped from the inside of the egg.He added: "We are hoping the discovery will help conservationists working to save the species in India."</body>

      <title>The Nasa probe keeping tabs on our turbulent Sun</title>
      <description>The news from Nasa's highly productive solar observatory</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24369363</url>
      <date>1381193972</date>
      <body>Brett Sapper has the unique responsibility of controlling Nasa's eye on the Sun.From a modest office in the agency's Goddard Space Center, in Greenbelt, Maryland, Sapper is in charge of the day-to-day operations of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), a satellite equipped with high-speed cameras capable of registering the Sun's activity nearly without interruptions.Launched in 2010 from Cape Canaveral, SDO has already been able to beam back 140 million images of the Sun, and some estimates predict that it will end up transmitting as much as 50 times more scientific information than any other mission in Nasa's history.Researchers hope this massive amount of data will help them forecast the effects of our turbulent star's behaviour on Earth. Intense solar activity can knock out power grids, GPS navigations and radio communications.From SDO's mission operation centre and surrounded by computers showing event logs and colourful displays of the satellite, Sapper says his work is fascinating because he is able to control "a robot in space" that he can't see and is located 36,500km (22,600 miles) above the Earth.But he immediately adds a caveat: "We are like fire fighters. We want to be bored, because if it's exciting it means there's a big problem."Up to now, according to this electrical engineer, there have not been any moments of fear, and he has been able to swiftly work with eight other scientists to control the mission's daily operations.They send commands and instructions to the satellite to tell it where to move, get all the "housekeeping information" back and also control two satellite dishes located at the White Sands Facility, in New Mexico, that are entirely dedicated to tracking the SDO while it collects scientific information."We do all that from here instead of having to call someone and have him do it for us", says Sapper. "That's something new here at Goddard and we are the only mission that does that: control the ground station from the mission operation centre".The satellite has got three instruments used by scientists to analyse not only the stellar surface, but also the star's interior. The possibility of looking inside the Sun is of vital importance to heliophysicists as they aim to decipher the very source of solar activity - the solar dynamo. This refers to the plasma currents that generate the Sun's unpredictable magnetic field.Scientists are now able to peer into the Sun by analysing the star's own acoustic waves, which are generated by its boiling turbulence. Using one of SDO's instruments, researchers are capable of turning those waves into clear pictures of the Sun's inner structures, just as geologists analyse the Earth's interior by studying earthquakes.Of course, Sapper and his colleagues at the mission operation centre cannot do all that work by themselves. In Goddard, his team only controls the technical aspects of the satellite and the antennas, whereas the science is done mainly by laboratories and universities across the country.One of Brett Sapper's colleagues at Goddard is helioseismologist William Dean Pesnell, whose job consists of interacting with the science groups. In other words, Pesnell is responsible for transforming Sapper's technical work into concrete results that may shed light on the solar dynamics that have an impact on the Earth's environment."We look at our satellite 24 hours a day and we get the data very quickly, so we can use it for immediate space weather purposes," says Dr Pesnell.This is important because the Sun's unpredictable behaviour could wreak havoc on the Earth: Nasa cites a 2008 report by the National Academy of Sciences, according to which a century-class solar storm could cause 20 times more economic damage than hurricane Katrina, considered the costliest US hurricane on record.It is therefore relevant for Dr Pesnell and his scientific team to try to understand what the Sun will do next."The goal of all our research is to predict what the magnetic field is going to do," he says."We aim to tell people: 'a flare is going to happen and if that is a concern to you, you should take steps to protect yourself'."But in order to accomplish their goal, both Sapper and Pesnell still have a lot of work ahead of them. SDO set out on a five-year mission, but mission scientists hope Nasa will extend the spacecraft's life by a few more years after 2015.After all, they know that a priceless treasure is at stake: the desire to understand the behaviour of our explosive star.</body>

      <title>Higgs: Five decades of noble endeavour</title>
      <description>Nobel recognises Higgs theory after near-50-year wait</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24445325</url>
      <date>1381271378</date>
      <body>Fifty years is a long time to wait for recognition of a brilliant idea. But this is the burden that Peter Higgs and Francois Englert have had to bear since they first proposed a mechanism to describe how matter in the Universe acquires mass.Englert and fellow Belgian Robert Brout were first to publish their ideas in August 1964. Higgs followed in October.The view - certainly, the one expressed by the Nobel committee on Tuesday - is that their papers were independent and indistinguishable, and that their work should therefore be jointly honoured.Of course, it is the standard practice not to award a Nobel posthumously, and so it is only Higgs and Englert who take the limelight, as their peer in this great endeavour, Robert Brout, died in 2011.Every advance owes something to previous generations - even Newton said he stood on the shoulders of giants; and sometimes it takes the insights of those who follow to truly see the implications.Prof Tom Kibble from Imperial College London probably falls into this latter category. His work with Americans Gerald Guralnik and Carl Hagen is regarded as being instrumental in the eventual application of the ideas expressed by Higgs, Englert and Brout."As you probably know, there were three groups working on this problem back then, but everyone's work in 1964 received essentially no attention at all, apart from the scepticism of various people," he recalls."The papers had hardly any citations for two or three years."If the Nobel committee's rules permitted more than three recipients per gong then the Imperial man could well have been standing in front of Tuesday's TV lights as well. As it is, he's applauding from the wings and proud to do so."I'm just really pleased they've recognised this work and this field," he told me.Particle physics is not the easiest subject to grasp for the lay audience, but a great many of us have come to absorb a vague concept of what the Higgs field and its associated boson entail - however fumbling.It is this notion that the Universe contains an all-pervasive field that elementary particles - the fundamental building blocks of matter - must traverse; and it is the drag these particles experience as they pass through the field that determines their mass. The boson is the thing that mediates the interactions.The maths may be beyond most of us, but everyone can appreciate that without an adequate description of mass - the very essence of stuff - then the cosmos can make no sense. There would be no form, no substance.The key reason it has taken nearly 50 years to prove the Higgs mechanism is that only now do we have an experimental set-up capable of nailing its existence.Others tried, but it took the scale and energy of the $10bn Large Hadron Collider to find the evidence.This colossal underground machine accelerates clutches of proton particles to fantastic speeds around a ring, colliding them in full view of sensitive detectors positioned at two widely separated locations.Only about one collision in every trillion produces a trace of the Higgs boson, and even then it is a process of deduction because all the scientists actually see are the products into which the particle decays.But the two independent detector sites confirmed each other's observations, and the boson was duly announced to great fanfare in July 2012."It is absolutely apt that it is recognised by a Nobel; it is one of the great discoveries of the 21 Century," says Prof Jim Virdee, another Imperial scientist and former spokesperson for one of those LHC detectors, the CMS experiment."One has to put it in some perspective. Our Standard Model [to describe how the basic building blocks of matter interact] wasn't built in a day. The first particle, the electron, was discovered by Thompson in 1897, and the Higgs is the last particle of the Standard Model - the 17th. So it was an enormous endeavour."Not that this is the end of the story. The LHC has barely got going and other discoveries are virtually guaranteed as it crashes together proton particles at ever greater energies."The LHC is a tremendous development," says Kibble. "We could never have pictured the experimental work that has burgeoned from those theoretical efforts in the 1960s."Which does raise the interesting question of why the LHC itself, its host institution Cern, and the thousands of scientists who work there, could not also be recognised in some form.The Nobel committee's rules for the physics prize do not seem to allow for this, but there is the precedent of another scientific body - the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - being given the Nobel peace prize in 2007.Some have speculated that Cern would also be a very worthy recipient of this gong."Cern has as one of its objectives to bring nations together through science," says Prof Virdee."It's certainly a remarkable human achievement to get so many people from so many different countries, cultures and creeds working together in the pursuit of fundamental knowledge. It's very uplifting."Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos</body>

      <title>Himalayas still uphill for climate report</title>
      <description>Data on Himalayan glaciers remains poor</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24396330</url>
      <date>1380882233</date>
      <body>Although the latest global update on climate change says the vast majority of glaciers worldwide have continued to shrink, scientists have admitted that the Himalayas remain an area where they still have very limited information.Glaciologists involved in the cryosphere chapter of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) first phase report, launched last week, said there was no good sample of Himalayan glaciers that could help them forecast their future behaviour."The Himalayas are one of the areas we really are data-poor," said Prof David Vaughan from Cambridge University, UK, and one of the two lead coordinating authors of the ice chapter in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)."We really need good samples of lots of glaciers and their measurements; we would like to have a larger number of benchmark glaciers," he told BBC News.The Himalayas received scant coverage in past IPCC reports.Until its Third Assessment Report in late 2001, the supreme authority on climate science called the Himalayan region a "white spot" because of the lack of information.Its Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 courted huge controversy when it mistakenly said that most of the Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035.After the IPCC put its hand up on this error, there was an expectation that AR5 would contain something more, particularly from the ground.But scientists involved in the latest IPCC report said there had been very little ground-truthing of the satellite imagery obtained for the Himalayas."Ground measurements are still very few, and, in addition, these few are usually limited to very small and not very representative glaciers," said Prof Georg Kaser, a University of Innsbruck, Austria, glaciologist and a lead author on AR5's cryosphere chapter."Field work on these glaciers is extremely difficult and also dangerous on an unacceptable scale. There is no way to overcome this, and this fact is also one of the reasons why we knew so little about these glaciers - giving thus also good reasons for [exaggerated] guesses."The Himalayas cover about one million square km, and there are more than 15,000 glaciers in the region according to several studies.The first-phase instalment of AR5 has significant detail on the Arctic, Greenland and the Antarctic.On the Greenland ice sheet, for instance, it said: "There is very high confidence that the Greenland ice sheet has lost ice during the last two decades."Combinations of satellite and airborne remote sensing together with field data indicate with high confidence that the ice loss has occurred in several sectors, and that large rates of mass loss have spread to wider regions than reported in AR4."But there is nothing like this on the Himalayas - the largest body of ice outside the northern and southern polar regions - and scientists say the main reason is the lack of studies on the ground.Even countries in the region have not been able to expand upon the few field studies they have initiated in limited pockets.India's Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology has been monitoring less than half-a-dozen glaciers within the Indian Himalayas."There are also strategic reasons behind the lack of ground work," says WIHG director Prof Anil Gupta, who was also a review editor on AR5's paleoclimate chapter."For instance, China and India share borders in the Himalayas and so because of the sensitivities on both the sides, it becomes difficult to reach these areas."WIHG has found that one of the reasons behind the recent catastrophic floods in Uttarakhand State of northern India was a breach of a glacial lake."The heavy precipitation led to the melting of the soft snow and even old ice in the Chorabari and companion glaciers that fed to the Chorabari Lake, which got breached due to excessive water intake from the glaciers," Prof Gupta explained."The mixing of glacial moraine, or debris, with glacial melt water mainly impacted the town of Shri Kedarnath and downstream towns of Gauriganga, Ramban, etc in the Kedarnath Valley."Prof Vaughan said that updates on the state of nearby glaciers were crucial for people living in such valleys in the Himalayas."If you live in a valley below one glacier, you really don't care what the global average [of glacial retreat] is; you just want to know what's happening to that particular glacier that's affecting your water security.According to the United Nations Environment Programme, there have been at least 35 events of glacial lake outbursts in Nepal, Pakistan, Bhutan and China during the last century.To minimise future risks, Prof Vaughan said scientists urgently needed more data on Himalayan glaciers."If they are going to start retreating then some of them will leave these kinds of glacial lakes that can then be quite dangerous if they burst out."We could actually predict which glaciers are likely to have that kind of behaviour in the future if only we can get on the ground and get some details."</body>

      <title>On Russia's controversial Arctic oil rig</title>
      <description>How safe is Russia's controversial oil platform?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24427153</url>
      <date>1381147258</date>
      <body>Remote and buffeted by icy waves, the Prirazlomnaya oil rig in the Arctic is the focus of a bitter dispute between Greenpeace and the Russian government - now an international court case.The journey to the rig starts in Arkhangelsk, one of Russia's historic northern ports. From there it is a two-and-a-half hour flight in an old Soviet propeller plane - an Antonov 26-100 - to the tiny settlement of Verandey, where the oil companies have built a small airstrip by the shore of the Arctic Ocean.From Verandey to the offshore oil platform is a half-hour helicopter ride, if the weather is good. But there was low cloud the first day we were there, so there were no helicopters and we spent the night in oil-workers' accommodation before trying again the next morning.When we made the flight the helicopter was an old Mi-8, but the safety equipment was good. We were all given survival suits for the journey, just as you would find in the North Sea.Soon we left the flat swampland behind and were out over the Pechora Sea.The Prirazlomnaya rig, when it comes into sight, is a sturdy structure set about 20m (66ft)-deep on the seabed. The visible part of the platform - the "topside" - sits on a massive concrete and steel structure. The weight of this box is what keeps it in position.Gazprom, the Russian state-owned company which operates the rig, says that this base is so heavy that it cannot be moved, even by thick ice. The company insists that drilling here is no different just because it is in the Arctic. It says there are many rigs - off Sakhalin Island in the far east for example - which have to cope with frozen seas.But environmental campaigners - and not only Greenpeace - insist that the Arctic is different. They say the nature here is unique. The polar bears, walruses, narwhals that live there have nowhere else to go. They warn that the Arctic Ocean only has two narrow entrances - one by Iceland and the other by Alaska. That means there is little mixing with other seas, so any oil spill would not disperse. Then there is the cold.Igor Chestin, chief executive of the environmental group WWF Russia, warns that because of the low temperatures an oil spill in the Arctic could be catastrophic."If you look at oil spills which happen in tropical waters, normally within a few years you don't find the oil anymore," he said, "because there are bacteria which actually absorb the oil and the oil disappears."But if you look at the northern environment, and for example the famous Exxon Valdez accident near Alaska, you still find the oil there. It's still poisoning the environment 24 years after the accident happened. It's still there. It didn't disappear - there are no micro-organisms which can absorb the oil."He says that an oil spill that might disperse in three years in warmer waters might take 100 years to disperse in the Arctic."Not a single oil company currently has the technology to deal with an oil spill under the ice. Some of them know how to collect oil from the surface of the water, or from the surface of the ice, which is like land. But under the ice? There are no technologies which can deal with that, and that means that the oil can spread over the place."In response Gazprom claim they have done everything they can to prevent a spill. The shallow waters mean the wellhead is actually inside the rig. They have a sophisticated cut-off system on the hoses which will offload the oil into tankers. It detects any movement by the tanker, if it is pulled away by ice for example. If there is too much movement it stops the flow of oil.Gazprom also insists that it could cope with a spill under the ice. It says two icebreakers are near the rig at all times, which could smash the pack ice and allow modern skimmers to clean up the oil.The workers on the Prirazlomnaya have been targeted by Greenpeace two years in a row. This year they were ready. The chief of the platform, Artur Akopov, showed us his defences - the fire hoses that his crew used to spray the activists who were trying to tie themselves onto the rig.It was used to deter the activists, and to make the side of the platform more slippery, and so more difficult to climb, he said.The campaigners had put his oil rig and the environment at risk, he claimed."By coming so close Greenpeace could have damaged the base of the platform. When they threw up their equipment they could easily have hit somebody. Or they might have ruptured one of the pressurised pipes and caused a diesel spill."That is something Greenpeace categorically deny. They used inflatable boats, and lightweight ropes.When the activists started climbing the platform, the Gazprom staff on the rig called their headquarters in Moscow. Artur Akopov said this was part of a pre-agreed response plan to any protest action. Within hours the FSB arrived. They are responsible for Russia's international security and borders, and are one of the successor agencies to the Soviet KGB.The FSB officers, who wore face masks, pulled the activists off the rig, pointed guns at them, and opened fire into the water, as can be seen on video released to the media by the FSB themselves.Given the changes in how Russia has dealt with activists in the last two years, perhaps Greenpeace should have expected a strong response.The Pussy Riot punk protest case last year put everyone on notice that long prison sentences are now a possibility.The 30 Greenpeace activists, six of them British, are now in jail in Murmansk on charges of "piracy as part of an organised group". The Netherlands - where the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise is registered - has challenged the arrests. It is using the Convention on the Law of the Sea to argue that the activists were illegally detained and should be released."Do you think they were pirates or protesters?" I asked Artur Akopov."That's for the court to decide" he said.</body>

      <title>Row over Spain's proposed solar tax</title>
      <description>Row in Spain over proposed toll on solar panel owners</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24272061</url>
      <date>1381100409</date>
      <body>"We will be the only country in the world charging for the use of the sun," says Jaume Serrasolses."Strange things are happening in Spain. This is one of them."Mr Serrasolses, the secretary of an association promoting the use of solar energy, SEBA, is referring to the government's proposal for a tax solely on those who generate their own electricity.They would pay a backup toll for the power from their solar panels, in addition to the access toll paid by everyone who consumes electricity from the conventional grid.Although the tolls vary, if you pay an access toll of 0.053 euros per kWh, you could face a backup toll of 0.068 euros per kWh.The new tax would extend the average time it would take for solar panels to pay for themselves from eight to 25 years, according to the solar lobby.The government says that with increasing "self-consumption", the income for conventional energy systems will decrease, but grid maintenance will cost the same."If I produce my own energy, but am connected to the grid, having the backup in case my production fails, I have to contribute to the cost of the entire system," says Energy Secretary Alberto Nadal.The government is hoping the energy reform will settle a debt of 26bn euros (£22bn; $35bn), which has built up over years as a result of regulating energy costs and prices.This is just the latest in a series of setbacks for the renewable energy sector.The government has gradually lowered a feed-in tariff - a scheme that paid people to produce their own "green electricity" - first reducing the period over which it was paid, then limiting it to already existing installations and finally an energy reform in July opened up the possibility of withdrawing it retroactively.At the same time it has not endorsed net metering, a policy allowing solar panel owners to send surplus energy to the grid and use it later. The idea was part of a previous proposal but was not included in the latest reform proposal.But while the government may have been heavily promoting solar energy six years ago, those who followed that lead may now pay dearly for their investment."The majority are people like your or my parents who at one time had savings and wanted to make an investment with a better return," says Piet Holtrop, a Dutch lawyer who is defending over 1,000 of them."Many of these people are going to lose their houses (that they used as collateral to buy solar panels). They are unable to pay back at the bank. They can't sell the installations, because the government has made them toxic assets," Mr Holtrop says.Though many people believe the government has succumbed to pressure from the big five energy companies, Mr Nadal insists that "solar energy is much more expensive than that mass-produced by large utilities".He adds that Spain is now paying for being at the forefront of solar energy development: "If we hadn't rushed into constructing large quantities of photovoltaic installations, we could have had them much better for [a] much lower price. It would have been much better introducing them step by step."The backup toll, still to be approved, has already paralysed the photovoltaic sector. "Nobody is going to make significant investment if it takes over 20 years to pay it off," says Jaume Serrasolses.However, the proposal has also prompted defiance.Ricard Jornet has fitted his beachside restaurant with 36 solar panels. Alongside other efficiency measures, they have cut his electricity bill by 40%.To avoid the backup toll, he plans to split the restaurant so that it uses two independent electricity systems, with only 30% connected to the grid. The rest will be self-sufficient, thanks to insulation and batteries storing the produced energy."I will save more money, because for the little part of the restaurant I will pay smaller access toll. I will also prove to the government this is not the way to do things."Civil disobedience is another option, despite hefty fines of up to 30m euros.Oriol, a chicken farmer, is willing to take the risk of undeclared self-consumption. "I believe they will warn me first. Then... we will have to invent another way to save the situation."The fines were originally designed for electricity companies and have to be approved by a cabinet council."The more people disobey, the more difficult it will be to fine them," says Jaume Serrasolses.Spain's energy regulator has sided with the opponents of the toll. It has found the proposal discriminatory, concluding that it makes self-consumption economically unviable and sacrifices middle and long-term economic efficiency for short-term economic sustainability. However, the regulator's word is non-binding.There are hopes that the European Commission will help, as its objective is to achieve 20% of energy production from renewable sources by 2020. The body is currently probing one of several complaints against Spain's energy policies.However, the Commission might have a dilemma."They are anxious to not jeopardise the plans for Spain's economic recovery," says Piet Holtrop."We are afraid the Commission is willing to sacrifice the EU legal framework for policy objectives."Other countries are carefully watching developments in Spain. The governments in Latvia, the Czech Republic, Italy and Greece seem to be pondering similar cutbacks."We want to make the Commission aware of the spillover effect," says Mr Holtrop.The backup toll may not end up being introduced, but the proposal has put many people off installing solar panels in the meantime, which means they are still getting their energy from the five big suppliers."I think they (the government) know this proposal does not make sense. They just want to gain time," says Ricard Jornet."[And] during all these months the energy oligopoly is making thousands of millions of euros."</body>

      <title>Hydrogen: The car fuel of the future?</title>
      <description>Could hydrogen power the cars of tomorrow?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24381812</url>
      <date>1380843391</date>
      <body>A small British firm is looking forward to a day in which we will take our cars to the garage and fill them with hydrogen.Acal Energy, based in Runcorn in Cheshire, says it has developed a chemistry that could make hydrogen fuel cells much cheaper and longer-lasting than current technologies.It wants to license its chemistry to the world's car-makers, opening the way for hydrogen vehicles to sell in large volumes in 10 or 20 years' time."We believe this is one of the breakthrough technologies," says Brendan Bilton, the company's chief commercial officer."We're pretty confident and excited... that this will start unlocking the barriers," he continues, "Allowing fuel cells to be in products for mass market applications."It is a bold dream but not a crazy one.The automotive industry is already far advanced with plans for a first generation of hydrogen cars.Hyundai, the South Korean manufacturer, has said it will soon start selling a hydrogen-powered version of its ix35 model.Meanwhile, the Japanese giant Toyota is expected to unveil its first nearly-production-ready foray into the territory at next month's Tokyo motor show.Other big names - including Daimler and Volkswagen - are thought to be on track to get hydrogen vehicles into showrooms by 2017.But few expect these first-generation hydrogen cars to sell in very large numbers.Acal Energy is pitching its technology as the enabler for a second generation of less costly, more durable vehicles which could - if all goes to plan - pose a serious challenge to the long domination of the internal combustion engine from about 2020 onwards.To begin with, consumers may take a bit of persuading.Hydrogen is widely seen as a dangerous fuel - an image underpinned by that grainy newsreel footage of the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg airship bursting into flames in the 1930s.But actually, experts do not seem daunted by this particular technical challenge.They point out that hydrogen is already used and managed on a routine basis in industrial processes.The main reason anyone bothers with it as a fuel for the future is because it is emission-free at the point of use.The hydrogen is combined with oxygen in a bit of kit called a fuel cell. This process generates electricity to power the engine in the vehicle.The waste products are heat and harmless water.Water is benign, unlike the global warming-inducing, carbon dioxide emissions that spew from even the most efficient petrol and diesel vehicles.The car industry has been developing fuel cells that use costly platinum as the catalyst for generating power from hydrogen for many years.Acal Energy claims the problem with this current technology is that it results in fuel cells that are either prohibitively expensive because of the high platinum content, or prone to degrade quickly.To get round these issues, the company has developed what Mr Bilton describes as a "liquid catalyst" composed of "a dissolved solution of metal salts".As well as being a lot cheaper than a platinum catalyst, the liquid doubles up as a coolant and a cleaning agent that extends the life of the fuel cell by taking away damaging by-products as it circulates through a "regenerator"."We have a solution that both increases durability and reduces cost," says Mr Bilton.The company has its offices in a science park that until a few years ago was the research and development centre for the British chemicals giant ICI, now shrunken in size and foreign-owned.Intriguingly, the ideas behind Acal Energy's patented "FlowCath" technology derive from techniques developed to clean clothes more efficiently.The founder of the company, Dr Andrew Creeth, now its chief technology officer, spent much of his career working as a scientist for the washing powder giant Unilever.Development of the product is taking place in an environment not unlike a gigantic school chemistry lab - full of bubbling chemicals, complicated equipment and clever looking people in white coats.The company has already raised £15m ($24m) to finance its work from a mixture of private investors and government sources.It is currently hoping to raise another £15m or so from a new funding round, with the outcome due to be announced soon.Eventually, Acal Energy aims to earn profits from the business model pioneered by the successful British micro-chip designer Arm Holdings.Arm's technology is embedded in most of the chips used in the world's smartphones and tablet computers.It receives a small royalty payment every time anyone upgrades their mobile device.Acal Energy dreams of equal success from licensing its technology to car manufacturers in decades to come.The big questions, though, are does the technology work and will it be the breakthrough that the company claims?Prof Nigel Brandon of Imperial College in London, a leading academic in hydrogen energy, is well qualified to comment."The core technology looks very exciting," he says."There are some components in their system they need to improve. I don't see any reason why they can't do that but they've still got to do it," Prof Brandon adds.It is guarded optimism that could equally be applied to the whole field of hydrogen fuel cell energy.The big advantages over battery-powered electric vehicles are hydrogen cars can be refuelled in a just a few minutes, they can run for 300 or 400 miles between refuelling and they have the environmental benefits of battery driven cars with the same range and convenience as those with petrol or diesel engines.But there are also significant snags.Among them is the need to create a hugely expensive new infrastructure of hydrogen filling stations to replace garages.Hydrogen enthusiasts often quote the example of the internet.Once the demand was proven, a global network of optical fibre cables to carry data traffic was rapidly built despite the cost.Major players in the car industry are betting - but not yet on a truly large scale - that hydrogen energy will follow the same pattern.</body>

      <body>Samsung Electronics, the world's best-selling smartphone maker, has launched a handset with a curved display screen.Called the Galaxy Round, the smartphone will feature a 5.7in (14.5cm) display.The launch comes just days after rival LG said it would begin production of curved-screen phones next year.Digital display technology has been progressing towards curved screens. Both Samsung and LG already offer curved organic light-emitting diode (OLED) television sets.Samsung said the curved screen display would help consumers use some of the features on the phone, including those that enable users to check information such as date, time and missed calls when home screen is off, with more ease.At the same time, users can also change music tracks on their phone, even while its display is off.The Galaxy Round will initially be launched only in South Korea. The firm gave no indication of its plans for a global launch.The global smartphone market has been growing rapidly.According to research firm CCS Insight, worldwide smartphone sales will hit nearly one billion in 2013 - accounting for more than half the total of 1.7 billion mobile phones sold.As as result, smartphone manufacturers have been keen to offer new products to win consumers.With display technology moving towards flexible and bendy screens, it is one area that companies have been looking at.Some analysts said that while the initial offering of curved-screen phones may not see huge sales, the segment of flexible displays was one to keep an eye on."These phones may not be a game-changer today, but they are definitely an indication of things to come," Manoj Menon, managing director of consulting firm Frost and Sullivan, told the BBC."Flexible displays have a huge role to play as the market place for 'internet of things' grows."This refers to the idea that many things in homes or offices - not just typical computers - will soon be connected to the internet.The sector is tipped by many to be a major industry in the near future.Mr Menon said that as flexible screens became more advanced and cost-effective to make, it was likely to speed up growth in the sector.</body>

      <title>BBC plans to help get UK coding</title>
      <description>The BBC will launch an initiative in 2015 to get coding more widespread in schools and homes.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24446046</url>
      <date>1381233705</date>
      <body>The BBC's director general, Tony Hall, has announced plans to "bring coding into every home, business and school in the UK".It comes 30 years on from a BBC push to make computing mainstream by putting BBC Micro computers in the majority of schools.In a speech to staff, Mr Hall said that the initiative would launch in 2015."We want to inspire a new generation to get creative with coding, programming and digital technology," he said.Government and technology experts are becoming increasingly worried that vital computing skills are no longer being taught in schools.Meanwhile interest in higher-education IT and computing courses is falling, giving rise to fears about a massive skills gap.This term a new computer science curriculum has been introduced to schools in England, and Education Minister Michael Gove has made it clear that he wants to see coding taught as a priority.Ralph Rivera, director of future media at the BBC, said: "The BBC has played a hugely important role in inspiring a generation of digital and technology leaders in the past, and now it's time to reignite that creativity.""We want to transform the nation's ability and attitude towards coding," he added.Details of the programme were limited, but the BBC said that it would partner with government, educators and technology companies."From working with children and young people, to stimulating a national conversation about digital creativity, the BBC will help audiences embrace technology and get creative," the corporation said in a blog post.A range of tools would be made available to give people "the skills to solve problems, tell stories and build new business in the digital world", it added.Experts appearing in a video to accompany the speech, agreed that action was needed.Martha Lane Fox, charged with getting more people online via her organisation Go on UK, said: "We are going to need a million more people who can work in the technology sector over the next 10 years. We don't have them. We've got to help to encourage people to go into that sector."Meanwhile, Eben Upton - founder of the Raspberry Pi budget computer project - said he looked forward to seeing how the scheme developed."A generation of UK developers got their start thanks to the original BBC Computer Literacy Project and the BBC Micro," he said."This initiative represents a welcome return to computing education from the organisation that was responsible for my interest in the subject."However, the comparison of the project to the BBC Micro raises potential controversy.The broadcaster's decision to partner with Acorn Computers three decades ago angered Sir Clive Sinclair as he prepared to launch a rival machine, the ZX Spectrum."They are marvellous at making programmes and so on, but by God they should not be making computers, any more than they should be making BBC cars or BBC toothpaste," he told Practical Computing magazine in 1982."They were able to get away with making computers because none of us had sufficient power or pull with the government to put over just what a damaging action that was. They had the unmitigated gall to think that they could set a standard - the BBC language. It is just sheer arrogance on their part."However, Apps for Good - an organisation which has helped students research, design and make software for three years - was not concerned by the new scheme."The BBC is entering a market where there's a number of players, but players who already work quite collaboratively," said Debbie Forster, the organisation's chief operating officer."Because there is such a big issue at stake and it is so important to so many different organisations what we are finding is that partnerships are formed more easily and more positively."Obviously the devil is in the detail in making it work - it always is - but it's a fascinating space and we look forward to hearing more and would be delighted for the BBC to join forces with everyone who is in here doing something."Learning Tree International - a firm which makes money from running programming training courses - was also unworried about the idea of the BBC becoming a competitor."From the point of view of getting people more inspired about IT and into that world, as such, it can only be a positive thing," said the firm's marketing director Christian Trounce.</body>

      <title>Disney tests 'tactile' touchscreen</title>
      <description>Disney researchers have found a way for people to feel the texture of the objects they see on a 2D touchscreen.</description>

      <body>Disney researchers have found a way for people to "feel" the texture of objects seen on a flat touchscreen.The technique involves sending tiny vibrations through the display that let people "feel" the shallow bumps, ridges and edges of an object.The vibrations fooled fingers into believing they were touching a textured surface, said the Disney researchers.The vibration-generating algorithm should be easy to add to existing touchscreen systems, they added.Developed by Dr Ali Israr and colleagues at Disney's research lab in Pittsburgh, the vibrational technique re-creates what happens when a finger tip passes over a real bump."Our brain perceives the 3D bump on a surface mostly from information that it receives via skin stretching," said Ivan Poupyrev, head of the interaction research group in Pittsburgh.To fool the brain into thinking it is touching a real feature, the vibrations imparted via the screen artificially stretch the skin on a fingertip so a bump is felt even though the touchscreen surface is smooth.The researchers have developed an underlying algorithm that can be used to generate textures found on a wide variety of objects.A video depicting the system in action shows people feeling apples, jellyfish, pineapples, a fossilised trilobite as well as the hills and valleys on a map.The more pronounced the feature, the greater the vibration is needed to mimic its feel.The vibration system should be more flexible than existing systems used to give tactile feedback on touchscreens, which typically used a library of canned effects, said Dr Israr."With our algorithm we do not have one or two effects, but a set of controls that make it possible to tune tactile effects to a specific visual artefact on the fly," he added.</body>

      <body>Four men have been arrested in the UK over their role in illegal online marketplace Silk Road.Three men in their early 20s were arrested in Manchester while a fourth man, in his 50s, was detained in Devon.The men were initially arrested on suspicion of drug offences. More arrests are expected in the coming weeks.Such sites would be a "key priority" for the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA), its director general said.The Silk Road, one of the world's largest websites selling illegal drugs, has now been closed down.Ross Ulbricht, the alleged operator of the site was arrested in San Francisco by the FBI at the beginning of October.Last week 40-year-old Steven Lloyd Sadler was arrested in Seattle. He is alleged to be one of the most prolific sellers on the Silk Road.The site operated on Tor, a so-called "dark web" service that anonymises users, making it much more difficult for authorities to track locations. Such areas of the internet are not covered by standard search engines.The site sold a range of items, but was most famous for offering a host of illegal drugs, paid for using virtual currency Bitcoin.Keith Bristow, the NCA's director general, warned that users who think they can hide their identity on the internet need to think again."These arrests send a clear message to criminals; the hidden internet isn't hidden and your anonymous activity isn't anonymous. We know where you are, what you are doing and we will catch you.""It is impossible for criminals to completely erase their digital footprint. No matter how technology-savvy the offender, they will always make mistakes."Exeter-based officers worked closely with American law enforcement officers to identify significant UK users of the Silk Road.It is hoped that the investigation will give them insights into how criminals use the dark net."These criminal areas of the internet aren't just selling drugs; it's where fraud takes place, where the trafficking of people and goods is discussed, where child abuse images are exchanged and firearms are traded," said Andy Archibald, head of the NCA's national cybercrime unit.The Silk Road may now be defunct but it seems that users are planning to resurrect the service.Technology news site TechCrunch reports that Silk Road version 2 could be "ready to launch".</body>

      <body>Nokia has sounded a further death knell for the operating systems Symbian and MeeGo, announcing no new content will be published on its app store from 1 January 2014.The company told developers they had just three months left to update content.The news has angered loyal fans still using the handsets.Nokia took the decision to make Windows Phone 7 its default operating system in 2011.The email outlining the timetable reads: "If you have Symbian and MeeGo content in the Nokia store, it will continue to be available for download to customers, and you will continue to receive download and revenue reports as well as payouts for downloaded content."However, starting January 1, 2014, you will no longer to be able to publish any new content or update existing content for Symbian and MeeGo."Microsoft bought Nokia's mobile phone business for 5.4bn euros ($7.2bn; £4.6bn) last month.The purchase is set to be completed in early 2014, when about 32,000 Nokia employees will transfer to Microsoft.While the news is unsurprising, some had thought the eco-system around the operating systems would continue for a few more years. Technology firm Accenture is contracted to provide support to Nokia for its remaining Symbian handset until 2016.Customers and developers took to Twitter and other online platforms to express their anger about the swiftness of the close-down.</body>

      <title>Blu-Ray albums target hi-fi fans</title>
      <description>Record companies are trying to tempt fans away from MP3s by releasing albums in a crystal-clear Blu-Ray format.</description>

      <date>1381241353</date>
      <body>Record companies are trying to tempt fans away from MP3s by releasing albums in a crystal-clear Blu-Ray format.Nirvana's Nevermind and Amy Winehouse's Back To Black will be among the first records to be released in the format, which comes to the UK this month.Listeners will need a Blu-Ray player and a stereo system to play the discs, which promise to deliver "the sound as it was intended by the artist".However, high-fidelity audio products have failed to catch on in the past.DVD-Audio and Super Audio CD (SACD), both of which launched in the early 2000s, delivered better quality sound than ordinary CDs but faltered in the marketplace.The new format, officially called Pure Audio, uses similar encoding techniques to those predecessors but, crucially, has the support of all the major record labels from the outset.Pioneered by Universal Music, it launched in France earlier this year, where the initial batch of 35 titles have already achieved sales of more than 500,000.One album, Mylene Farmer's Monkey Me, has sold 84,000 copies on Blu-Ray alone - which would be enough to ensure a top 10 placing in the UK charts.The BBC was given several tracks to audition, comparing them directly to the equivalent songs on CD and MP3 through a home stereo system.Stevie Wonder's I Wish opened up, with a rounder, fuller bass and the intricate hi-hat work sounding crisp and bright.Bob Marley's Is This Love sounded more spacious than the muddy MP3, with Marley's soulful vocals so clear he could almost have been in the room.The clarity wasn't always an advantage, however: Serge Gainsbourg's spittle-flecked come-ons in L'hotel Particulier sounded doubly creepy in full resolution.But despite the improvement in clarity, the question remains: Will fans accept the format?Although they are lower quality than a CD, the portability of MP3s and Apple's iTunes format proved more alluring to consumers than either SACD or DVD-Audio, which are no longer manufactured in any great number."It's all about timing," said Olivier Robert Murphy, global head of new business at Universal."When SACD launched it was supported by only part of the industry, and you had to buy a 1,000 euro (£842) player. Here, we have 33% of the population that already has a Blu-Ray player at home.""The magic of this format is that you buy a £60 player, you put the disc in, you play it through a basic stereo sound system - the sound is incredible."Warner Music and Sony have already released albums on Blu-Ray in France and Japan, while Universal plans to issue 200 albums in 14 countries "very quickly".At launch, the UK catalogue will contain albums such as The Velvet Underground and Nico's self-titled debut, Queen's A Night At The Opera and Marvin Gaye's What's Going On?Classical releases include the Berlin Philharmonic's interpretation of Mahler's Symphony No.5 and Rolando Vilazon's collection of Verdi's works for the tenor.Murphy acknowledged the selection relied heavily on heritage acts."It's not necessarily a strategy," he told the BBC, "but what we realised is that initially we're talking to specialists, we're talking to a niche"."I'm talking about the guy who spent 40 grand on his hi-fi system. Let's face it, this guy is probably 35-plus, and likes heritage artists."However, Murphy said the long-term goal was to release new albums in the format, too."For me, it could represent a very nice percentage of physical sales," he said."When I see that we're selling more vinyl now than in 2002, I know there is an appetite for this kind of music."But, in an admission of modern listening habits, albums purchased in the Blu-Ray format will come with a free copy of the lower-quality digital version."Blu-Ray is a copy-protected format," said Murphy. "If someone has spent £15 on a product, he should have the right to put it on their iPod and listen to it when he's doing his fitness programme."Eventually, the Pure Audio files could be distributed digitally themselves - but with a four-minute song needing 1GB of storage space, Murphy said it would be "three to four years" before that was a reality.</body>

      <title>Samsung devices face US import ban</title>
      <description>Some older Samsung gadgets look set to be banned from being imported to the US thanks to a patent row with Apple.</description>

      <date>1381249277</date>
      <body>Some older Samsung gadgets look set to be banned in the US following a patent row with Apple.In early August, Apple won a case at the US International Trade Commission (ITC) that found Samsung had infringed two patents covering mobile technology.That victory called for an import ban on some Samsung products but this was postponed pending an appeal.A US official overseeing the patent row has now rejected Samsung's appeal, meaning the ban will come into force."After carefully weighing policy considerations, including the impact on consumers and competition, advice from agencies and information from interested parties, I have decided to allow the commission's determination... to become final," said US trade representative Michael Froman.The patents in dispute cover detecting fingers on a touchscreen and the workings of the audio jack on smartphones and tablets. In August, Samsung was cleared of violating four other patented technologies.So far, it is not clear which products will be banned from sale. In its appeal, Samsung said it had, for newer products, developed its own technologies that did not draw on Apple's patented ideas. The ITC has already approved the workarounds for the disputed technologies.In August, US President Barack Obama overturned another ITC ruling that called for a ban on Apple products. He issued the first presidential veto for 26 years on an ITC matter when he decided to stop the ban on older iPhones and iPads.Apple and Samsung have regularly clashed in court over the past few years and have fought patent battles across 10 countries.</body>

      <title>Hi-tech $100 banknote goes into use</title>
      <description>The US Federal Reserve issues a new high-tech $100 banknote, comprising several new security features designed to beat the counterfeiters.</description>

      <date>1381195653</date>
      <body>The US Federal Reserve has issued a new hi-tech $100 banknote comprising several new security features.It includes a blue 3D security ribbon and a bell and inkwell logo that authorities say are particularly difficult to replicate.These combine with traditional security features, such as a portrait watermark and an embedded security thread that glows pink under ultraviolet light.The 2010 design was delayed because of "unexpected production challenges".The 3D security ribbon - which is woven into the note, not printed on it - features images of 100s that change into bells and move upwards or sideways depending on how you tilt the paper.Referring to the embedded security thread Chadwick Wasilenkoff, chief executive of security paper company Fortress Paper, told the BBC: "It's not a small incremental step up for security, it's a giant leap."Tilting also reveals a green bell within a copper-coloured inkwell to the right of the blue ribbon.In addition, the 100 number in the bottom right-hand corner shifts from copper to green.The redesigned banknote, which features a portrait of US founding father and scientist Benjamin Franklin, also includes raised "intaglio" printing that gives the notes a distinctive feel, and microprinted words that are difficult to read without magnification.Over a decade of research and development has gone into the new note, the Fed said, in a joint project with the US Secret Service and the Department of the Treasury.Advances in design software and high-resolution copying and printing have made it easier for counterfeiters to print fake money and harder for retailers to spot the forgeries.US authorities say that $100 bill is the most counterfeited of all US banknotes, but accurate figures for the total value of counterfeit cash in circulation are hard to come by.The US Secret Service estimates that counterfeit bills account for less than 0.01% of the $1.1 trillion (£683bn) of US money in circulation.It says about $80.7m of counterfeit currency changed hands domestically in 2012, and about $14.5m abroad.The authorities seized $9.7m in counterfeit cash before it could make it in to the US money supply, and seized $56.8m abroad in 2012.Bruce Schneier, security expert at BT, told the BBC: "Bills have to be easy to produce cheaply and in large quantities by the government, yet hard to reproduce in small quantities by counterfeiters."Making something that costs less than a dollar to produce and over $100 to reproduce is a very difficult problem."</body>

      <body>Electrical supply problems at a National Security Agency data centre have delayed its opening by a year, reports the Wall Street Journal.Power surges at the giant Utah centre had ruined equipment costing almost a million dollars, it said.The technical problems had also led to lengthy investigations that had meant its opening date had been pushed back.The Utah plant is one of three the NSA is building to boost its data gathering and surveillance capabilities.Over the past 13 months, 10 separate electrical surges have occurred at the data centre in Bluffdale, Utah, according to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), which is reported to have cost $1.4bn (£872m) to build.Each surge had burnt out and wrecked about $100,000 worth of computers and other equipment, it said.The Bluffdale facility is more than one million sq ft (93,000 sq m) in size and its power costs are expected to top $1m (£622,000) a month, according to the WSJ.The NSA had been supposed to start using the data storage and analysis centre in October 2012, it said, but this had been delayed by the damage caused by the power surges and a six-month investigation into their cause.The WSJ added it had seen technical documents indicating experts called in to find out the cause had rowed over whether the problem had been fixed.It said civil contractors were confident the problem had been solved but a special US Army engineer investigation team had said the cause was "not yet sufficiently understood" to be sure that it would not happen again.The amount of surveillance that the NSA carries out has come under scrutiny in recent months thanks to whistleblower Edward Snowden.He leaked documents allegedly detailing its activities including the Prism programme that garners data from web firms including Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Yahoo.In addition, the NSA has been found to be gathering data on phone calls made by US citizens.</body>

      <title>LG announces curved screen phones</title>
      <description>LG says it is about to start mass-producing flexible screens for smartphones ahead of the roll-out of new handsets in 2014.</description>

      <date>1381157495</date>
      <body>LG has announced it is to start mass-production of what it calls the "world's first flexible OLED [organic light-emitting diode] panel for smartphones".The South Korean firm said it hoped to start selling the first handsets to feature the tech next year.The news comes weeks after Samsung made a similar announcement.Samsung said it intended to launch its first product - a special edition of the Galaxy Note 3 - later this month.Both companies already use the technology to offer curved OLED television sets.Although the displays used in the TVs are in theory "flexible", they are mounted in fixed shells so they cannot be bent or otherwise re-shaped by the owner.A press release from LG's display division indicated its handset screen would curve from top-to-bottom rather than side-to-side, the design Samsung described in a recent patent.It said the advantage of using the tech was that the panel was "bendable and unbreakable"."The new display is vertically concave from top to bottom with a radius of 700mm [28in], opening up a world of design innovations in the smartphone market," LG added."What's more, it is also the world's lightest, weighing a mere 7.2g [0.25oz] even with a 6in screen, the largest among current smartphone OLED displays."One industry watcher was not convinced the product, as described, would have much appeal."I think LG is doing this to show it is innovative, to do something different and to stand out from the rest of the bar-style screen devices that we have at the moment," said David McQueen, a mobile device expert at tech consultants Informa."But I don't think consumers are going to be that interested by a slightly curved design."However, we do think there will be interest if flexible screens are used to offer different form factors."For example a device that you snap round your wrist or a traditional shaped smartphone whose screen wraps around the sides onto a bit of the back so that the edges become touchscreen rather than hard buttons."</body>

      <title>Euro MPs tighten anti-tobacco laws</title>
      <description>The European Parliament votes to tighten tobacco rules to curb smoking among young people, but avoids restricting e-cigarettes.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24439474</url>
      <date>1381239856</date>
      <body>Euro MPs have voted to tighten tobacco regulations aimed at putting young people off smoking, but some measures do not go as far as originally planned.They rejected a European Commission proposal to treat electronic cigarettes as medicinal products - a move that would have restricted sales.They backed a ban on cigarette flavourings - but with a five-year delay in the case of menthol.Slim cigarettes will not be banned. EU ministers must now consider the plans.Among other measures, MEPs voted on Tuesday to put health warnings on 65% of each cigarette pack, as opposed to the proposed 75%.Linda McAvan, the Labour MEP steering the legislation, said 65% was still "a long way towards plain packaging".The current requirement for health warnings is for 30% minimum coverage on one side and 40% on the other.Packs of 10 cigarettes, considered popular among younger smokers, will also be banned.Fourteen EU states already have 20 as the minimum, four stipulate a minimum of 19, and in the UK and Italy the minimum is 10.Smaller than normal packs of roll-your-own tobacco will still be allowed under the new rules.It was the European Parliament's first reading of a draft tobacco directive which could become law in 2014. It would then take two more years to become law in each of the 28 EU member states.There has been intense lobbying of MEPs by the tobacco industry and health campaigners.The Commission says almost 700,000 Europeans die from smoking-related illnesses each year - equal to the population of Frankfurt or Palermo. The costs for healthcare in the EU are estimated to be at least 25.3bn euros (£20.6bn; $33.4bn) annually.Conservative and Liberal MEPs welcomed the amendments made to the original proposal from Labour's Linda McAvan.Speaking to the BBC, Ms McAvan said she was disappointed that slim cigarettes were not banned.But cigarette packaging made to look like lipstick or perfume containers - attractive to girls - will disappear, she noted.There will now be further negotiations with the Council - the grouping of relevant EU ministers. MEPs may manage to avoid a second vote and fast-track the legislation so that it is adopted before the May 2014 European elections.The proposals also include a ban on words like "light", "mild" and "low tar", deemed to be misleading, and a ban on oral tobacco - called snus - although Sweden would retain its exemption.EU Health Commissioner Tonio Borg called the vote "positive". "I am confident that the revised Directive on Tobacco Products can still be adopted within the mandate of the current Parliament," he said.But Carl Schlyter MEP, health spokesman for the Greens, called it "a shameful day for the European Parliament, as a centre-right majority, led by the EPP group, has done the bidding of the tobacco industry and voted for weaker rules".Angela Harbutt of the pro-tobacco organisation Forest criticised the legislation, saying "prohibition doesn't work and products that are banned will almost certainly be available on the unregulated black market."Law-abiding consumers will be at a serious disadvantage and it won't help children because criminal gangs don't care who they sell to," she said.The UK has already said e-cigarettes will be licensed as medicine from 2016.Sales of the tobacco-free devices have boomed worldwide since bans on smoking in public places were introduced.But campaigners say their growing popularity is dangerous.They argue that e-cigarettes undermine years of anti-smoking efforts and could be especially damaging to children and non-smokers.The devices are designed to replicate smoking behaviour without the use of tobacco. They turn nicotine and other chemicals into a vapour that is inhaled.Manufacturers of e-cigarettes say the products have the potential to save millions of lives.Anti-smoking campaigners say young people especially are being tricked into taking up smoking.Prof Martin McKee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine says tobacco firms have simply extended their advertising techniques to e-cigarettes.Commissioner Borg, presenting the proposals, said tobacco products "should look and taste like tobacco products".In 2009‐10, sales of tobacco products generated nearly £9bn ($14.6bn; 11bn euros) in taxes for the UK government, about 2% of all receipts from taxation, a government report said.</body>

      <title>Army robot refuses to be pushed over</title>
      <description>US military-funded Boston Dynamics is developing astonishingly realistic animal and humanoid robots that can cross rough terrain, balance and gallop.</description>

      <body>Meet Atlas, a humanoid robot capable of crossing rough terrain and maintaining its balance on one leg even when hit from the side.And WildCat, the four-legged robot that can gallop untethered at up to 16mph (26km/h).These are the latest creations of Boston Dynamics, a US robotics company part-funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa).The robots are part of Darpa's Maximum Mobility and Manipulation programme.Darpa says such robots "hold great promise for amplifying human effectiveness in defence operations".Referring to Atlas's ability to remain balanced despite being hit by a lateral weight, Noel Sharkey, professor of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at the University of Sheffield, told the BBC: "This is an astonishing achievement... quite a remarkable feat."This version of Atlas is one of seven humanoid robots Boston Dynamics is developing in response to the Darpa Robotics Challenge.In December, competing robots will be set eight tasks to test their potential for use in emergency-response situations, including crossing uneven ground, using power tools and driving a rescue vehicle.Darpa wants to improve the manoeuvrability and controllability of such robots while reducing manufacturing costs.WildCat can bound, gallop and turn, mimicking the movements of quadruped animals. It is powered by an internal combustion engine."It is a shame that such technology is not being developed with other research funding," said Prof Sharkey, who is also chair of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control."We do not know what military purpose it will serve but certainly it is a step towards a high-speed ground robot that could be weaponised to hunt and kill."The video shows WildCat performing on a flat surface, but Prof Sharkey said: "It would be good to see how well it could perform in a muddy field."Last year, Boston Dynamics' Cheetah robot reached a sprint speed of 28.3mph tethered to a treadmill.Geoff Pegman, managing director of RURobots, told the BBC: "Robotics has been making important strides in recent years, and these are a couple of demonstrations of the technology moving forward."However, their application may be limited to areas such as defence and, maybe specialised construction or demolition tasks."In other applications there are more efficient ways of achieving the mobility more cost effectively."</body>

      <title>NSA targeted Tor via Firefox flaw</title>
      <description>The NSA allegedly used a security hole in older versions of the Firefox web browser in an attempt to undermine the Tor online anonymity service, reports say.</description>

      <body>The NSA attempted to monitor Tor users by using security holes in the Firefox web browser, according to reports.The US agency broke into computers to try to look at Tor anonymous communications, documents leaked by Edward Snowden have suggested.The National Security Agency (NSA) had difficulty in undermining the encrypted Tor service itself, they said.A security expert said the NSA appeared not to have yet managed to crack Tor.US signals intelligence agency the NSA, and its UK counterpart GCHQ, have been involved in long-term efforts to try to undermine the Tor online anonymity service, according to leaked documents published by the Guardian newspaper.The NSA and GCHQ have been implicated in spying on mass communications in a number of documents leaked by former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden.Tor (The Onion Router) tries to hide user identities, and the websites that people are looking at, by routing encrypted internet traffic through a number of volunteer computers.One of the ways the NSA tried to get around Tor encryption was to infect Tor users' computers instead, according to a Guardian report.The leaked document, called "Tor Stinks", said that the NSA had no success in revealing Tor communications between criminal suspects.Nevertheless, the agency had managed to "de-anonymise a very small fraction of Tor users".The document outlined different avenues the NSA had explored, including placing small pieces of data called cookies on users' machines.The agency also suggested slowing down communications over Tor using its own network of computers running Tor.The NSA has the ability to "stain" people's website traffic as it enters Tor, and to identify it as it leaves, according to leaked documents published by the Washington Post.The NSA allegedly infected computers in an attempt to look at web traffic at both ends of the encrypted Tor communication path, rather than decrypt the path itself.The agency used links with US telecoms companies to sift vast amounts of internet data and identify traffic from computers connecting to Tor, the report said.Once the users' machines were identified, the NSA allegedly used secret internet servers, codenamed FoxAcid, to infect the computers with malicious software.The NSA used software called EgotisticalGiraffe to attack vulnerable older versions of the Firefox web browser, the report said.Firefox is included in a bundle of software provided to get users up and running with Tor.The Tor service is intended for legitimate use by people in repressive regimes, but law enforcement agencies have been concerned that Tor can hide criminal and terrorist activity.The US government published a statement on Friday saying that its interest in Tor and other means of online communication "is based on the undeniable fact that these are the tools our adversaries use to communicate and co-ordinate attacks against the United States and our allies".Security expert Steven Murdoch said it was "strangely comforting" that the NSA had not managed to crack Tor."Tor seems not to be the weakest link," said Mr Murdoch, a Cambridge University researcher who contributes to the Tor Project."It looks like the weakest link is software on people's computers, in this case, older versions of Firefox," he said.</body>

      <title>BBC 'to launch personalised iPlayer'</title>
      <description>The BBC's director general Tony Hall is expected to announce the next generation iPlayer in a keynote speech on Tuesday.</description>

      <date>1381143897</date>
      <body>The BBC's director general Tony Hall is expected to announce the launch of the next generation BBC iPlayer in a keynote speech on Tuesday.It is understood he will explain his vision for an enhanced iPlayer, allowing users to personalise their viewing and listening choices.The iPlayer, launched in 2007, provides a catch-up service for BBC TV and radio programmes.The speech is Lord Hall's first since his joining speech in April.Entitled Where Next?, Lord Hall's speech will discuss the technological challenges facing the BBC, as more people turn to the internet via mobile phones and tablets to watch TV.As part of this focus, BBC Radio 1 has announced it is going to get its own channel on the iPlayer.The station said this will allow fans to watch exclusive performances and interviews not broadcast anywhere else.It is hoped that the channel will help Radio 1 reach more young people.Content will include music featured in Radio 1's Live Lounge and at the annual Big Weekend festival as well as interviews with celebrities and artists from around the world.But as the iPlayer becomes more bespoke for each user, media commentators have already begun to question the validity of the fixed licence fee paid by the public.Writing in the Guardian on Sunday, Steve Hewlett wrote: "One question that must surely arise in the unbundled 'My BBC' world is, once I've picked out the bits of the BBC I use and value, why should I pay for the rest?"And because the technology of on-demand delivery that underpins the whole project allows subscription in a way that broadcast TV and radio don't - at least not easily - 'My BBC' will inevitably in time reignite the question of subscription funding, for some BBC services at least."Lord Hall will also announce the launch of an app for mobile phones and tablets to allow listeners to hear their favourite radio programmes in one place.The app will showcase new pieces of content each day. Users will be able to choose what they want to hear and when they want to hear it.In time, users will be able to personalise their choices, with the app suggesting programmes they may like depending on their interests and the time they have available.It will feature programmes from stations including BBC Radio 4, Radio 3 and the World Service.Director of BBC Radio Helen Boaden said: "Listeners will get outstanding programmes from brilliant brains in a way which fits into their packed lives."A launch is planned in 2014, with content available both in the UK and internationally.In Tuesday's speech, Lord Hall will also flesh out the details of a 20% increase in funding for the BBC's arts coverage.The director general - who used to run the Royal Opera House - is keen to return the arts to the corporation's "heart".It will mean plays, art exhibitions and more live music from around the UK being broadcast on the BBC.Among Lord Hall's proposals are a new "BBC Arts at" brand, while two new television series will be fronted by historian Simon Schama and broadcaster Andrew Marr respectively.Lord Hall also wants to see the BBC collaborate more with arts institutions around the country.The director general is expected to unveil new partnerships with London's British Museum, the Tate and the Manchester International Festival.The plans mean that more opening nights, major exhibitions and arts events will be shown live on television.The announcements are part of the director general's new strategy for the BBC and come as the corporation is in the process of cutting 2,000 jobs by 2017 after the freezing of the licence fee.</body>

      <body>A new shape-changing metal crystal is reported in the journal Nature, by scientists at University of Minnesota.It is the prototype of a new family of smart materials that could be used in applications ranging from space vehicles to electronics to jet engines.Called a "martensite", the crystal has two different arrangements of atoms, switching seamlessly between them.It can change shape tens of thousands of times when heated and cooled without degrading, unlike existing technology.Currently, martensite metals are made of an alloyed mixture of nickel and titanium.They have the remarkable ability to "remember" their shape and even after being bent will return to their original form. For this, they are called "shape memory" metals.They have been used in spectacle frames and brassiere wires, but also in surgery as frameworks for shaping healing bones, and as "stents" for holding heart arteries open.Martensite metals change shape when heated or cooled through a certain temperature, when the atoms that make up their structure rearrange themselves in a sudden transformation.Some call this a "military transformation" because the rows of atoms that make up the metal crystal click into their new shape in an orderly manner.The transformation means that martensite can be used in smart mechanisms that respond to temperature change.Examples include automatic windows-openers in glasshouses, a means for automatically guiding solar panels to point at the Sun on the Hubble Space Telescope, and, very recently, a proposed use in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to morph the trailing edge of the engine cowling, making it quieter when it runs hot on take-off."The pitfall of current martensites is that after repeated shape changes, they build up stresses inside that degrade them and eventually break them apart. The new alloy, made of a mixture of zinc, gold and copper, changes back and forth almost indefinitely with little internal damage, opening up a new range of applications for these types of "active materials".The aim is now to apply the lessons learned from the new metal to make a family of ceramic solids that can also be shape-switched back and forth."The real advance is to make the transformations reversible that could be applied in many situations" explains Prof Richard James, one of the authors of the study."You could make devices that convert heat to electricity directly. They could use the waste heat from computers and cell phones to recharge the battery and make them more efficient."As the material cycles through its different atomic arrangements, crystals can be seen at its surface in ever-changing patterns, looking like microscopic rivers.The structures fit together without any stress layers between them, and this seems to be the key to their longevity and potential.The new materials could also be used in improved and efficient microelectromechanical systems - energy harvesting devices, in which small vibrations can be converted directly into power.These sorts of gizmos are already used in tyre pressure-monitoring systems in cars to power the electronics in the sensors.</body>

      <title>Preparing for the digital afterlife</title>
      <description>Society's struggle over who owns the dead's digital files</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24380211</url>

      <body>When 15-year-old Eric Rash committed suicide in 2011, his family and friends wanted to know why.In a bid to find answers, they went to Eric's Facebook account, and after failing to guess his password, appealed to the social media giant to grant them access.Facebook refused.Giving unauthorised access to someone other than the account holder, the company said, was against its privacy policy.The Rashes, who live in Virginia, tried to fight their case in court, but soon found there just wasn't any legislation that covered the management of "digital assets".The family's tragic battle is just one of many examples in which the internet has been shown to be woefully unprepared for dealing with death.In the two years since the Rashes' case, which led to the drafting of a federal law concerning the data of minors, few countries have issued clear guidance on the rights of families to access their deceased loved ones' data.And despite the fact that we put more of our lives in the cloud than ever before, few of us are preparing for our digital afterlife."We're accumulating far more digital records in our lives than we are physical ones," says Evan Carroll, who runs The Digital Beyond, a website which explores the subject of digital death."But we haven't yet entered the age where we are taking the question of what happens to those records seriously."Since Mr Carroll and his friend John Romano first raised the issue of the digital afterlife at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in 2009, some prominent companies have developed policies for dealing with deceased customers.Google has a step-by-step process allowing users to plan what they want done with their account, and will sometimes provide the contents of an email account which hasn't left specific instructions, after a "careful review".Facebook and Yahoo have taken a stricter stance, and won't hand over data without a court order, but the former allows relatives to choose whether they want to close an account or turn it into a memorial page.However many web companies are lagging behind.Cloud-based services which store our financial details, emails, music collections, social media interactions, photos and many other potentially precious items have different policies on data ownership, if indeed they have any.As a result, it is more difficult to bequeath your iTunes library to a loved one than it is to leave your CD collection to them in a shoebox.So why are we leaving our digital identities hostage to fortune?Part of the problem is that internet users have tended to be too young to be worrying about their mortality.But as the average browser gets older (the Office for National Statistics reckons almost 70% of all 65-74-year-olds in the UK are online), the idea of drafting a "digital will" is taking hold."We've seen several thousands sign up to our various membership packages," says Paul Golding, who co-launched Cirrus Legacy - a service which allows you to record login details for all your online accounts and leave instructions to a nominated guardian - just a year ago."People are beginning to realise what they could lose."Putting details of your online life in an actual will is not an option, as they are publicly accessible documents, but highlighting where they can be found is a safer bet. Although with passwords and usernames changing all the time, the challenge is to keep the information up to date.Digital estate planning, as the process of filing your details with a third party has become known, is an increasingly popular business, and many online services offer much more than simply making arrangements for accessing accounts.Some, such as My Wonderful Life, allow members to write messages to be sent to their dear ones from beyond the grave. Others, such as the ifidie Facebook app, give people the opportunity to share a posthumous joke, or record a confessional video to be released upon their demise.But it is the more conventional services offered by these companies which are proving vital to grieving families.Most of the time, families don't even know which online accounts their relative had signed up to, let alone the login details.And the cost of not knowing even a simple email password can be enormous, explains Evan Carroll."Email serves many purposes, only one of which is the digital equivalent of our mailboxes," he says. "It is the master key to many other accounts."But although leaving a list of your online accounts and passwords with a digital estate service might seem like a good solution, it is riddled with risks.Putting all your online security details in one place puts you at the mercy of a successful hacking attack. And, as Mr Golding admits, if he received "correct information" from a court of law, requiring him to hand over a list of passwords, he would "have to comply".Furthermore, using the login details left by a dead family member is potentially illegal. The terms and conditions of most established online services state that nobody other than the owner is allowed to use the account.Your loved ones may also not thank you for some posthumous revelations. Details of extra-marital affairs or a gambling addiction, which would otherwise have been taken to the grave, could be made available to mourners.But although much of the digital will-making process is still being ironed out, Mr Carroll urges people to do something, even if it is just writing a manual list and putting it in a safe place known only to a spouse."Many people say 'I don't have anything that I care about online'," he says."But you never know what will one day be of value to your family."</body>

      <description>Celebrating the Pi with fire, vegetables and pets</description>

      <body>There's no doubt that the Raspberry Pi bare-bones computer has captured the imagination of makers, hackers and artists around the world.The computers have been put to some novel uses, including a controller for a robot boat that is piloting itself across the Atlantic Ocean.As the millionth Raspberry Pi rolls off its UK production line, the BBC takes a look at a few of the more ambitious and creative projects that the bare-bones computer has made possible.Created by US teenager Chris Marion, Fire Hero mates the Raspberry Pi with canisters of propane and a microcontroller to add pyrotechnic effects that synchronise to music being played on an electric guitar.Hit the right notes and flames will shoot from a rig of six small propane "poofers", four medium-sized "poofers" and two huge cannons.The big ones produce flames that shoot more than 30m (100ft) into the air.Mr Marion said work on the original Fire Hero began in 2010, but the Pi helped him refine his control of the flames.The Pi sits at the centre of the system, reading data from the guitar and passing it to a separate device that opens and closes valves releasing the propane that is then ignited.Programming the Pi to act as the controller was not the hardest part of the project, he told the BBC."The real programming magic lies in the intelligent note and chord detection algorithms to transfer the data stream from the instruments to the Fire Hero device," he said.Fire Hero 3 has been shown off at a few music festivals in the US and its success has led Mr Marion to plan a bigger, flamier set up that, he estimates, will be six times the size of the latest version.It will still have a Pi at its core and is set to debut at a festival in 2014."My vision is to be able to bring a revolutionary new kind of special effects to live performances that enthrals the audience and provides additional sensory stimulation to further immerse them in the performance," he said.The Pi is not just helping people, man's best friends are benefiting too.In particular, a Hungarian vizsla dog called Judd has done very well thanks to a Pi-controlled treat dispenser.Created by Judd's owner, John Saunders, the little web-connected gadget dispenses doggy treats when an email is sent to a specific address.The dispenser drew on many of Mr Saunders's skills, but as he was weakest at coding, getting the Pi to co-ordinate all the moving parts had been tricky, he said."I'm not a programmer by trade, so that was much harder for me than the machining and design," he said.At the time the project was being developed, there was little information or code examples online to help get the gadget working. A web-based appeal helped him debug his code.The Pi was essential to the interactive part of the treat dispenser, he said. Rival controllers, such as the Arduino, were just as good at connecting to electronics but the Pi was much better when it came to working with the web."The machine received so many emails (including corresponding "thank you" emails) that Google shut down the account due to spam-suspicion - so that was frustrating," he added.Judd liked it too."The servo motor does a 'wiggle' upon receiving an email (which happens a few seconds before the treats fall out)," Mr Saunders told the BBC. "Judd learned to recognise this servo noise just about anywhere in the house and would run over to the machine."Most Pi projects just use one of the machines as a central controller. But one was nowhere near enough for Simon Cox, an engineering professor at the University of Southampton.Prof Cox created a supercomputer for less than £2,500 using 64 interconnected Raspberry Pi devices. The computing cluster runs off mains power and can address 1TB of memory."Building it was absolutely not about computer power," he said. Instead the system, dubbed Iridis Pi, was built to help people get to grips with the computational challenges of working with large numbers of tightly connected computers."It's about understanding all the pain of getting them to work together and the intricacies of building an algorithm to use them," he said.That was a skill all engineers needed in order to design and test their ideas, he said, but one that few had a chance to exercise before they reached university.The schematics and software for Iridis-Pi had been publicly released so anyone could replicate it and start developing that much-needed competence with computational science, said Prof Cox.Most Pi-based projects flaunt their wires and make a virtue of the tiny computer at their heart. Not so with Scott Garner's Beet Box project.In the creation of these interactive vegetables, Mr Garner, a designer and craftsman, was more interested in what he calls "invisible technology"."I like the idea of the next generation growing up in a world that isn't all screens and buttons - I think some nice wood and a few vegetables make for a good alternative," he said."Having done some experiments with both capacitive sensors and 'edible circuits', I decided it would be interesting to combine both concepts," he added."I spent a little time trying to think of the perfect vegetable-instrument combo and once I hit on beats from beets there was no looking back."The Pi won out over other ways to connect up and control sensors and speakers because of its processing power. Despite its flexibility this Pi project did present some unique problems."Dealing with produce as part of a circuit definitely comes with some challenges," said Mr Garner."The biggest difficultly is that as the beets dry out, their ability to conduct the touch signals is weakened."In practice, though, they suffered cosmetic damage from so many hands long before they failed as sensors, so having a few spares at the ready was necessary."The Raspberry Pi computers that Brendan O'Connor has used for his project are also hidden, albeit for very different reasons.Mr O'Connor has used the devices to help create some passive surveillance devices that can sit and sip the air for all the data leaking out from smartphones, tablets and laptops.Mr O'Connor's plan was to spread a series of the Pi-powered sensors, or Distributed Object Locators (Dols), around a city and use them to gradually build up information about the gadgets that pass by.Each one is about the size of a can of spam and is battery powered so it could sit unobtrusively in a locker, on top of a cupboard or in a bush in a park for weeks grabbing data.The Pi helped make it possible to get the boxes co-ordinating the information they find and sending it to their controller.The boxes - called CreepyDols - gather up the many status and query messages sent out by the gadgets that people carry around, said Mr O'Connor.Most of them had no idea their gadgets were broadcasting this information or that it could be used to pick them out of a crowd."Even a very savvy user has no way to stop it being shared," he said.Passive surveillance systems were also finding a role in environmental monitoring, said Mr O'Connor, where many different local conditions, such as humidity, temperature and rainfall, needed to be logged over a long period of time.</body>

      <title>The tech modernising Kenya's matatus</title>
      <description>How tech is modernising Nairobi's ramshackle buses</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24426676</url>
      <date>1381187146</date>
      <body>Matatus - the ramshackle public minibuses seating between 14 and 24 people that zip along the streets of Kenya's capital Nairobi - carry a third of the city's residents to and from work each day.The journey from the city centre to the working-class suburb of Rongai takes between 45 minutes and two hours, depending on traffic.Yet inside the "Ferguson" matatu - named for its colourful images of the former Manchester United manager - half a dozen passengers seem oblivious to the length of their commute.Instead, they sit glued to their smartphones, checking the latest news, YouTube videos and catching up on emails.Ferguson is one of more than 1,000 matatus in the city now equipped with free wi-fi for passengers to enjoy through a service called Vuma Online, launched this April by Safaricom, Kenya's biggest telecom company.The goal, according to Kevin Bett of Safaricom, is to "convert [passengers] to internet users".But for matatu drivers and conductors it's giving them an edge over intense competition for passengers."We get more passengers," says Victor Njuguna, a Vuma-equipped matatu conductor. "They actually wait for our bus - they want to enjoy free wi-fi."Nairobi is East Africa's economic, business and technology hub.It has grown from half a million residents in the 1970s to more than three million today. It has grown outward, not upward resulting in an unplanned semi-urban sprawl.It is perhaps no surprise then that the city ranks as the fourth most painful commute in the world, according to IBM's Commuter Pain Index.The government estimates that traffic jams cost the economy more than 50m Kenyan shillings (£365,000; $585,000) per day in lost productivity, fuel consumption and pollution.While the government has ambitious plans to build new roads and bypasses for the city, and even establish a mass rapid transit system and rapid light rail by 2030, progress, like the traffic itself, seems painfully slow.Though Nairobi's commute is dreadful to most, for some of Kenya's burgeoning "silicon savannah" techies, it's an opportunity."Commutes can be up to three hours long," says Jeremy Gordon, chief executive of FlashCast, a Kenyan tech start-up. "That's a captive audience whose time is pretty under-used."Launched in 2012, FlashCast has designed a location-based advertising system for buses and matatus, using a red LED marquee display connected to a GPS unit and 3G modem installed in the vehicles.Yet advertising alone can be boring."If we can't make it an entertaining, engaging experience, it's not worth it for them," explains Mr Gordon. "We also display news headlines, short quizzes, games, word scrambles and discussion topics."For example, in April they asked riders on selected buses to nominate the #BestDressed Passenger on the bus.The replies ended up being a huge hit, with responses such as "Red lipstick grey top blue jeans seated back seat next 2 the window on the left side. #pliz…""People have a desire to be stimulated when they're sitting in traffic," says Mr Gordon, "so it's a win win."It's also a win for the vehicle owners, since they earn a share of the advertising revenues.However, entertaining commuters - and occasionally helping them hit on each other - isn't the only service FlashCast offers.Since its GPS units track vehicles in real time, it is making that traffic information available through its Android mobile app so that customers can track the location and movement of certain buses, to help figure out which route to take to beat the traffic.Traffic delays are just one part of Nairobi's commuter woes. A greater problem lies in the structure of the public transportation system itself - a semi-formal and chaotic set-up of 20,000 privately owned matatus and buses.Although in theory there may be set prices, the market forces of supply and demand come into play. So if it rains, for example, prices go up.And since passengers pay cash fares directly to drivers or conductors, the matatu and bus owners have no way of knowing how much profit their vehicles are making.As a result, owners simply demand a flat daily fee from their staff, with the remaining profits split between the driver and conductor.While in Europe and other parts of the world prepaid cashless systems for public transportation are the norm, in Nairobi cash is still king.Yet that may be about to change. In May, Google launched a cashless, prepaid card system for the city's public transport, called BebaPay.Conductors are equipped with small, NFC (near-field communication) enabled smartphones. Passengers simply tap their BebaPay card to the phone.Money is then digitally transferred from the card to the phone, and passengers get a message on their phone confirming the transaction.The physical BebaPay cards can be purchased and topped up with credit at various locations across the city. The service doesn't require a bank account - just a Google account - and the cards and phones work without an internet connection."Cashless will lead to greater transparency, accountability, organisation… and ultimately better public transportation infrastructure," says Denis Gikunda from Google's Nairobi office.BebaPay is part of Google's broader strategy to "simplify payments", he says, and improve lives of people in emerging markets."Transport was a great place to begin, because it captures all the problems - a lot of transactions, frequently, all cash-based."Eventually, he says, BebaPay will not just be used for transportation, but for payment services across the city - from taxis, to public toilets and small retail kiosks.These high-tech solutions are certainly helping commuters in various ways, but few address one of passengers' main concerns - safety.The World Health Organization's Global Status Report on Road Safety estimates that there were nearly 8,500 deaths from traffic incidents in Kenya last year.One-third of all fatalities are passengers, many a result of "unsafe forms of public transportation". The finger is often pointed at reckless matatu drivers."What [passengers] want most is safety - to arrive at the destination in one piece," says Simon Kimuta of the Matatu Owners Association of Kenya.For that, he says, what Nairobi needs is better fleet management to monitor activity, and vehicles fitted with gadgets to monitor speeding, so owners can react.Yet more simple methods may also be effective.An initiative called the Zusha Project, funded by Georgetown University, recently randomly assigned stickers to the passenger cabs of 2,500 matatus around Kenya, with mottos such as "stand up and speak up" against bad driving.The idea was to get passengers to complain directly to the drivers about their reckless driving.After looking at aggregated insurance data, the project found matatus with stickers were in fact half as likely to get into accidents.As Billy Jack, associate professor of economics at Georgetown University who was part of the project, puts it: "Sometimes it's a low-tech solution that works the best."</body>

      <description>How to get broadband to rural Britain</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24366190</url>
      <date>1381100451</date>
      <body>Over the summer there was a lot of digging going on in the Lancashire countryside.Nothing unusual there you may think until you realise that these trenches are being built to house a fibre optic network with speeds to rival those that Google is installing in Kansas City.The community-led Broadband 4 Rural North (B4RN) scheme offers speeds of up to 1Gbps (gigabit per second) to communities along its route.And as it expands its network, more villages are asking if they can be connected too, proving that if you build it, they will come.The project has hit problems - some minor, like a delay over the summer caused by some nesting lapwings, but some bigger, for example when Network Rail refused permission for the ducts to run over a bridge, forcing it to reroute in a river.However its biggest problem is money. Despite raising £300,000 worth of local investment, the team behind the project estimate that the total cost will be £1.86m.It applied for a government grant but is still waiting to hear whether it will qualify while it is also finding it tricky to get a loan.It illustrates the difficulty of getting even a small-scale broadband network up and running and also begs the questions - why would farmers digging the trenches even want to take on such a project?The reality is that they and other local residents are fed up with slow or non-existent broadband.Commercial broadband providers like BT see no profit in rolling out complicated networks to a handful of houses in the middle of nowhere.And that is rather galling for the people living in such communities who need broadband just as much, in some cases more, than their urban counterparts.Broadband is now widely acknowledged as the fourth utility, and the government is all too aware that it needs to close the digital divide between town and country.But its solution - to offer £530m to councils to subsidise rural broadband roll-outs - has been widely criticised, most recently in a report from a group of MPs who make up the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).The process has been painfully slow. Initially the Department of Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) planned to complete the roll-outs by 2015.Now that has been put back to 2017, with the caveat that up to 10% of the country will still not be covered.When it became clear that former telecoms monopoly BT had won every single council contract, there were some angry reactions.The PAC report accused the DCMS of ripping off taxpayers by simply handing public money to BT.This week as BT puts the final dots on those contracts, the big question is where does it leave the community schemes like B4RN?While the current subsidy is now gone, the PAC report recommended the government make every effort to ensure that the next round of public funding - the £250m earmarked for the final 10% not covered in current plans - is spent more wisely."It can't simply be put into a pot marked BT. There has to be more competition. This is a good opportunity to make government funding go a lot further," said Malcolm Corbett, who heads up the independent networks co-operative association (Inca).He estimates that the local community broadband schemes supported by his organisation can offer a much faster service to remote communities and require far less state aid than that demanded by BT, largely because they rely on co-investments with the local people.It is a view that the government does not seem to share. A separate £20m provided by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to specifically fund innovative rural broadband schemes, including Lancashire's B4RN project, looks like it could be going the same way as the money provided by the DCMS."Our information indicates that almost all of the money will go to BT," said Mr Corbett."I'm on the point of giving up. Whatever we do and despite an extraordinarily critical government report, we still can't get these schemes out there. BT is just so powerful," he said.BT's managing director of Next Generation Access, Bill Murphy, is not surprised that community schemes are struggling to gain headway."Our payback on rural broadband is 15 years. This is not for the faint-hearted. If people want to go build, then go build but, as I tell them, broadband networks aren't just for Christmas,"And he is dubious that community schemes can roll out networks cheaper than BT."I spend a lot of time sitting in village halls hearing about how they want to build their own thing but none of them have ever built anything before. I admire their passion and commitment but I'm not going to be preached at by people who don't have the experience. Don't tell me that you can build a network cheaper than me," he said.One of the biggest criticisms in the PAC report was that BT and local authorities are failing to provide detailed information about how far their roll-outs would extend.Without such information it will be hard for rivals to offer projects to compete with BT.Gigaclear is one such rival. It is offering a 1Gbps fibre to the home service to homes in Oxfordshire and Rutland and hopes to extend its footprint to Hampshire and Kent.But lack of certainty about where BT may build networks is hampering its efforts."Under the current contracts drawn up with BT, councils can't say what areas will be upgraded until three months beforehand," said their marketing director Joe Frost."It means that whole areas will not be told anything for two years. That is a problem for them and for us," he said.The issue has led the Countryside Alliance to demand change."BT and the local authorities aren't being transparent about where the roll-out will cover. We need to see a map with postcode trackers showing what communities will be left out," said their head of policy Sarah Lee.For its part, BT said that it is up to local authorities to provide this information and that increasingly they are doing so.Anyone wanting to know whether their community will be covered by the current roll-out has simply to phone their council, added Mr Murphy.One of the most interesting things about the alternative community schemes is that they tend to favour faster fibre to the home technology (FTTH) over BT's preferred fibre to the street cabinet (FTTC), even though it is far more expensive to lay.Retired engineer Walter Wilcox has campaigned for years to get better broadband in the village of Ewhurst in Surrey and when it finally did come, he was unhappy with it."There are 76 houses that can't get the service, two properties where the fibre service is worse than the one they had before and we estimate 226 properties out of about 942 are unable to achieve the lower limit of 24 Mbps," he said.The upgrade was done by BT using FTTC.BT admits that the upgrade in Ewhurst took "longer than it should" and that 'there is still work to do"."There are about 5% of people in the village who can't get the service but we are working on solutions to fix this." said Mr Murphy.But what has happened in Ewhurst could be replicated around the country because, with a few exceptions, it is the technology that will form the backbone of BT's rollout.Many worry that FTTC is already an outdated technology, ill-suited to rural communities because the speed you get is in relation to how close you live to a street cabinet.In contrast the FTTH technology favoured by B4RN and other community schemes offers the same speed to everyone - and with a top speed of 1Gbps it is not going to be past its sell by date any time soon.As Chris Conder who sits on B4RN's management team puts it: "Fibre to the cabinet is like giving people a cold water tap whereas with fibre to the home they can have a hot power shower."B4RN already has plenty of satisfied customers on its network but whether it and others like it are really equipped for a nationwide fibre battle with BT remains distinctly uncertain.But there are plenty of people living in some of Britain's remotest places rooting for them.</body>

      <title>Can we trust the spying state?</title>
      <description>Assessing the impact of Edward Snowden</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24399213</url>
      <date>1380887494</date>
      <body>How worried should we be by the state's capability to spy on us?Top secret documents, leaked by former American intelligence analyst Edward Snowden, have revealed the huge capacity of Britain and America's intelligence agencies - GCHQ and the NSA - to capture communications.Snowden and his supporters have argued that the public should know more about what is happening, while governments have argued that exposure has endangered national security.Four months after the first revelations in the Guardian newspaper, a picture has emerged of Britain and America's intelligence-gathering capabilities.Taken together, the reports point to an ambition to be able to reach into the vast global tide of digital communications and be able to pick out any message and read it, as well as to conduct wide-ranging searches of billions of records to look for patterns and connections."Even if you're not doing anything wrong you're being watched and recorded," argued Edward Snowden. "You should decide if they should be doing this."Those who have worked inside the secret state say that the power is vital for national security and only used for national security."You have to have a powerful capability to find the small amount you're looking for - but that doesn't mean the state is reading everyone's emails," former GCHQ director Sir David Omand told the BBC."What the state needs and law enforcement needs is the possibility of accessing the communications of the terrorists, the criminals, the kidnappers, the proliferators, the paedophiles. But those communications are all mixed up with everyone else's communications - there are 204 million emails a minute buzzing around the globe."So you have to have a powerful capability to find the small amount that you are looking for. But it doesn't mean that the state is reading everyone's emails, nor would that conceivably be feasible."But can we trust the state with this power?Technology allows it to do things it could never have done before - collecting and sifting through billions of records using data mining to find a connection or reconstructing a person's social interactions from the trail they leave behind online.The lack of sufficient oversight worries those who have campaigned on civil liberties."Part of the problem here is an age problem," says David Davis, a former Conservative Shadow Home Secretary."My generation of politicians - up to ones 20 years younger than me - don't really understand the extent to which we are intruding into people's privacy."Mr Davis believes the current system of oversight and accountability is not strong enough, especially when access to metadata about communications and interactions only requires internal authorisation within an intelligence agency - and not the warrant that is required to intercept the actual content of communications."There is no need to trust the state unless it has got a good reason and they must justify that to someone else - a judge or a magistrate or someone who is outside their system and can check they are using it properly," he argues.The claim that encryption standards have been deliberately weakened or had so-called "backdoors" added to allow access by intelligence agencies caused particular anger among those who have spent their careers trying to improve internet security and ensure the privacy of communications."The NSA's actions have done more than undermine online security - they've threatened to break the internet," Ross Anderson, Professor in Security Engineering at Cambridge University says of its attempts to ensure access."In order to do this they have compromised in various ways the protocols on which the internet relies. When you introduce these vulnerabilities, they are not just for the spies to use. They are available for bad guys to use as well."The Snowden documents have surprised many, including Prof Anderson, in terms of the scale of what they reveal."To find that they had built this machine and got it working is an eye-opener," he told the BBC.Critics of the intelligence agencies believe the disclosures have been important in starting a public debate about whether we know enough about the state's capability and whether there are enough controls and oversight.But many of those inside the intelligence world point to the damage which they say the revelations have done. They fear that since Edward Snowden is in Russia, the Russian state will have found some way of accessing the information."Part of me says that not even the KGB in its heyday of Philby, Burgess and Maclean in the 1950s could have dreamt of acquiring 58,000 highly classified intelligence documents," Sir David Omand told the BBC.The concern is also that the more that is revealed in public, the more the targets of surveillance adapt their behaviour. Sir David believes Snowden's actions will do real damage to national security."My fear is that we are now going to witness a slow-motion car crash in which gradually sources dry up, targets such as terrorists and cybercriminals will work out what are the kind of capabilities we have, and they will adopt their methods and be harder to track down," says the former GCHQ director.In the last week, the BBC was given direct access to a small selection of original documents held outside the UK that form the basis of stories the Guardian newspaper has already published.The scale of the capability they reveal - and the secrets they contain - make clear there are serious issues involved in balancing the public interest and national security. That balance lies at the heart of this debate - between the public interest and the right to know about what the state can do and the need for the state to protect its secrets and its capabilities for the sake of national security.The question remains - who gets to decide?</body>

      <body>A pilot who fell ill at the controls of his plane forcing his passenger to land the light aircraft has died, police have said.The man collapsed in the cockpit of the plane after taking off, leaving the "inexperienced" passenger to make an emergency landing.The plane landed at Humberside Airport under the guidance of instructors called in by air traffic controllers.Police said they were unable to confirm the cause of death.A spokesman for Humberside Police said: "The pilot of the plane sadly died last night."We are not treating it as suspicious and we are in a position whereby formal identification will take place later today."He added that a file would be prepared for the coroner.Police, fire and ambulance crews were called to the North Lincolnshire airport after a distress call was made from the light aircraft.Two flying instructors were called in to advise the passenger how to bring the plane down.One of them, Roy Murray, said: "I think without any sort of talk-down he would have just gone into the ground and that would have been the end of it."The passenger and pilot were the only people on board the aircraft, which had taken off from Sandtoft Airfield 25 miles (40km) away.Eyewitnesses described seeing sparks as the plane landed at about 19:50 BST on Tuesday.Stuart Sykes said he saw the aircraft land: "It came down with a bump, a bump, a bump, hit the front end down, I heard some crashing and it's come to a halt."Two incoming flights were delayed while the aircraft was removed from the runway.</body>

      <title>Home Office 'Go home' adverts banned</title>
      <description>The Advertising Standards Authority bans a Home Office mobile advert telling illegal immigrants to "go home or face arrest".</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24452551</url>
      <date>1381308334</date>
      <body>The advertising watchdog has banned a Home Office advert telling illegal immigrants to go home, saying it was misleading.But the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) cleared the campaign of being offensive and irresponsible.The campaign saw two vans drive around London for a week in July, carrying the message "Go home or face arrest."The ASA said the posters on the vans referred to inaccurate arrest statistics.It received 224 complaints about the vans from individuals, campaign groups, legal academics and the Labour peer Lord Lipsey.During the campaign, the advertising vans drove around the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Barnet, Brent, Ealing and Hounslow, some of the most diverse areas of the capital where it is thought a lot of illegal immigrants live and work.The poster displayed a picture of handcuffs and read: "In the UK illegally?... GO HOME OR FACE ARREST."ASA chief executive Guy Parker told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the campaign was considered unlikely to cause "widespread offence".But he said the phrase "go home" was "reminiscent of the racist slogan" and "clearly carries baggage".He added: "It clearly upset some people and I think it might be wise, if the government uses the poster van again, to perhaps think about using a different phrase - like return home."The campaign split the coalition, with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg saying Liberal Democrat ministers had not known about them in advance.Business Secretary Vince Cable said the campaign was "stupid and offensive".The advert said there had been 106 arrests in the area in the past week and encouraged illegal immigrants to contact immigration officials for information on how they could be helped to leave the country.In its ruling, the ASA said the reference to the number of arrests was misleading because it did not relate to those detained in the specific areas where people would have seen the vans.It said the figure referred to arrests which occurred across a large part of north London more than two weeks before the campaign began."The ad must not appear again in its current form," said the ASA report."We told the Home Office to ensure that in future they held adequate substantiation for their advertising claims and that qualifications were presented clearly."But it dismissed complaints that the slogan "Go home" had been offensive or irresponsible. It said that, while the phrase had been used in the past to attack immigrants, the Home Office was now using it in a different context.The report said: "We concluded that the poster was unlikely to incite or exacerbate racial hatred and tensions in multi-cultural communities."It was not irresponsible and did not contain anything which was likely to condone or encourage violence or anti-social behaviour."Ministers have not clarified if or when the ad vans will be used again and they have not published any data on whether the campaign led to an increase in illegal immigrants turning themselves in.However, a Home Office spokesman said: "We are pleased the ASA has concluded that our pilot was neither offensive nor irresponsible."We have always been clear that this campaign was about encouraging illegal immigrants to leave the country voluntarily and was not targeted at particular racial or ethnic groups."In respect of the ASA's other findings, we can confirm that the poster will not be used again in its current format."</body>

      <title>Extension sought for badger cull</title>
      <description>The original targets for culling badgers are changed as new, more accurate information on population numbers becomes available.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24443110</url>
      <date>1381299980</date>
      <body>A pilot badger cull in west Somerset may be extended by up to three weeks as marksmen have failed to kill enough badgers to reach their target.Sources at Defra say that 850 badgers have been shot in the area over the six-week trial, just over 40% of an initial target of 2,081.But those sources insist the Somerset scheme has proven to be effective.They say new population data means there are far fewer badgers in the pilot area than originally thought.The controversial pilot culls set out to study if badgers could be killed safely, effectively and humanely.It is being carried out in an attempt to control TB in cattle, which can be spread by badgers, though opponents say it will have no impact.The plan was to kill 70% of the badgers in the areas of west Somerset and Gloucestershire by free shooting.Across both regions this meant around 5,000 badgers were to be killed in total.But Defra sources said these targets were based on population estimates from 2012 that have proved to be highly inaccurate."We have high confidence that between 2012 and 2013, there has been a decline in the badger population in both areas," said a source.As the cull started, hundreds of hair traps were set so that DNA could be extracted and analysed to give a more up-to-date assessment of badger numbers.In west Somerset, the population, which had been estimated at 2,400, has now been revised downwards to 1,450. In Gloucestershire, the numbers have been lowered from 3,400 to 2,350.There are a number of reasons behind the apparent decline according to Defra, including the impact of last winter's bad weather, disease and lack of food.As a result, the targets for culling have also been revised downwards to around 2,600 for both areas combined.To kill 70% of the badgers now estimated to live in west Somerset, the culling company needed to kill 1,015 badgers.After six weeks of shooting, they achieved 59%, and the company is now seeking an extension of its licence for another two to three weeks.Peter Kendall, president of the National Farmers' Union, said the number of badgers to be killed had been reduced because it was important not to "wipe out" entire populations.He told BBC Breakfast the marksmen needed "a few more weeks" to "meet the best criteria that the scientists have set"."Last year 38,000 cattle were killed and we've got to do something about the spread of this ghastly disease," he added.Asked why the desired number of badgers had not been killed, especially given the lower total population now estimated, Mr Kendall said these were pilot schemes and those involved are "learning as we go".He said there had been some "protester activity" and all shooting had been stopped whenever a person has been "spotted in a vicinity", though he said the protesters were not the reason the target number had not been reached.Defra sources believe that even on the lower figures, the exercise has been effective."This level of culling is a significant culling of the badger population and sufficient to achieve cattle disease benefits at the start of a four-year... period," the source said.There was a "possibility" that the company carrying out the Gloucestershire cull will also seek an extension.Reports in recent days suggested that the exercise in west Somerset was in trouble, with a Conservative MP admitting it had not worked as well as hoped.</body>

      <body>A man has been arrested after three light aircraft were vandalised at an airfield near Reading.Thames Valley Police said it appeared a vehicle was driven into the Cessna single engine planes in Englefield.The three planes have been written off as a result of the damage, estimated by the owners at up to £700,000.A Jeep Grand Cherokee was discovered set alight nearby, in Bath Road. A 29-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the incident.Buildings at the airfield were also damaged by the planes being pushed into them.Police said the planes were a 50 vintage type, a four-seater piston-powered plane and a six-seater light business plane.The damage was discovered by estate staff shortly after 07:00 BST. They had been told that animals had escaped onto the nearby A4, and found a gate had been forced open.David Wiggins, gamekeeper at the Englefield Estate, said: "We're pretty sure they were in after hares."We've got a lot of problems with hare coursing."Not just coursing, but just driving the animals over, running them over, flattening them."That's what it started as I guess and then it turned into this damage we've got here."Peter Ford, owner of the 50 vintage type said: "The guys obviously came with this four-wheel drive, pushed the aircraft into the back of the barn and then came again."He said his plane's wing had been "snapped off".</body>

      <title>Council's £1m Tour De France cost</title>
      <description>Hosting the Tour de France in Sheffield could cost the city council £900,000.</description>

      <body>Almost £1m is to be spent by Sheffield City Council to bring the 2014 Tour De France to the city.The cycle race, in its 101st year, could bring £15m into the South Yorkshire economy, the authority said.The second day of the tour will start at York Racecourse, go through the Pennines and climb the 1,720ft (524m) Holme Moss before ending in Sheffield.Some people have criticised the spending in the aftermath of the closure of the Don Valley Stadium.But councillor Isobel Bowler said the £900,000 expense was a "one-off investment in the city".The breakdown of the council's cost to host the event includes a £200,000 staging fee and £215,000 to be spent on marketing.Ms Bowler, the Labour council's cabinet member for sport and leisure, said the decision to bring the race to Sheffield would help "tourism, inward investment and profile".She said: "It is not about one day or even one weekend."The authority said it expected about 250,000 spectators to watch the race around the city, which will cover about 19 miles (30km) of road.It said the event would bring up to "£10m of direct economic benefit and £5m of place marketing value to the city".A report to approve the funding will be considered by the council's cabinet at a meeting next Wednesday.The expected costs have been criticised by some people.Rob Creasey, of the Save Don Valley Stadium Campaign, said: "On the council's model that's two years' running costs for the Don Valley Stadium."Our plan had been to unlock the gates and fill the stadium so the people of the city and region could celebrate the [Tour] event."On the BBC Look North (Yorkshire) Facebook page, Gemma Crossley said it was "disgusting when they have shut Stocksbridge leisure centre for the sake of £400K. My children can't have swimming lessons anymore because of a bike ride!!!"Marie Louise Hudson agreed, saying "they couldn't afford to keep Stocksbridge Leisure Centre open which is used by the whole community".Thom Wiseman said: "It shows a clear message that Sheffield City do not want people taking part in sport with the closures of Don Valley and Stocksbridge."But you can stand on a street and watch the bikes go past."But Peter Robertshaw disagreed, saying: "The world's biggest cycle race comes to Sheffield: let's show off our city...I applaud the council for having the guts to do this."The first stage of the race on 5 July 2014 departs from Leeds Town Hall before finishing in Harrogate.The precise route for the Sheffield stage has not yet been announced.</body>

      <body>NHS and care services patients need to become more demanding and fight for their rights, a new watchdog body says.Healthwatch England, which heads up a network of 152 local patient bodies, urged the public to become "savvy consumers" rather than "grateful patients".To help, the watchdog set out eight core rights for patients.It comes after polling indicated half of people who experienced poor care did not report it.The survey of more than 2,000 people found one in five had experienced poor care - but of those, 54% had not complained.Healthwatch England was created under the shake-up of the NHS earlier this year.It is envisaged that the organisation will act as a patients' champion, carrying out its own investigations and speaking out about issues of concern.This is its first report to Parliament, and it has used it to highlight the deference shown by patients.Healthwatch England chairwoman Anna Bradley said: "We all need to stop acting like grateful patients and care users and start to see ourselves as savvy consumers, insisting on our right to safe, dignified and high quality care."To help achieve that, the organisation has set out its list of rights:Ms Bradley added: "Consumer rights are second nature to us on the High Street, but by thinking this way we can ensure people have a voice at the heart of the health and social care system."Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb said he welcomed the initiative."Without real and meaningful input from patients, it is impossible for health and care services to improve and move forward in the future," he added.</body>

      <body>A doctor whose family was killed in a suspected arson attack a year ago has spoken of the "sweet memories" he has of his youngest child.Only Dr Abdul Shakoor survived the fire at the family home in Harlow last October and still suffered flashbacks.His wife Dr Sabah Usmani and his children, Hira, 12, Sohaib, 11, Muneeb, nine, Rayyan, six, and three-year-old Maheen, died as a result of the fire.Dr Shakoor appealed for answers to their deaths to bring closure.He told how his daughter Maheen would have turned five this month."I have really sweet memories of her," said Dr Shakoor. "She was a beloved daughter who brought a smile to everyone's face."So there are very good, sweet memories in our heart and they are everlasting there, but we are missing a lot."He said memories were also still fresh in his mind of the tragic night even after a year and he was still suffering flashbacks."It has been tough year but my beliefs and faith have given me great solace."Police, who are still investigating the fire, believe it started when burglars targeted the house.A car was found burnt out nearby and that may be linked.Dr Shakoor said: "All of the community would like to know answers why my innocent family was taken away in this way."As a great nation we want to make sure that the peace should prevail so the mums and the kids feel safe on the streets and in their homes."He said the support of the local community and the people at the hospital where he worked was really amazing and they had helped him stand firm."The lives of all my family, friends and the community had been changed by the tragedy and we are all waiting anxiously to see the killers brought to justice."I hope and believe that someone will come forward and help us all to come to a closure."We don't want this to happen again and another family to go through what I did," he told BBC Look East.Police are still investigating and want to trace a white man in his late teens to early 20s who was seen on a bicycle near the scene of the crime.They also want to find the family's black Toshiba Satellite laptop computer which was taken from the home.</body>

      <body>The rail industry's power to increase fares in England is to be curbed as part of a government drive to overhaul the rail fare system.Until now, some regulated fares could potentially have gone up by 9.1% next January.They will now be capped at 6.1%.But campaigners say it is not enough, and point out that commuters will still have to pay an above- inflation increase next year.Regulated fares are those which the government controls, and include season tickets, "anytime" single tickets around major cities, and off-peak inter-city return tickets.They will go up in 2014 by an average of 4.1%, a number calculated using an average of inflation - as measured by the retail prices index (RPI) for July - plus 1%.Train companies can add up to 5% on top of the average rise, although fares that go up by more than the average must be balanced by others that rise by less or fall.The government plans to limit that extra increase to 2% in the future. But the provision for the average regulated ticket price to go up by 1% more than inflation remains.The move is part of the government's Fares and Ticketing review being published by the Transport Secretary, Patrick McLoughlin.The review will also detail a pilot scheme that could see all long-distance rail tickets sold on a single-leg basis, not as returns.The government says this could allow passengers to more easily "mix and match" different ticket types when planning a return journey.Other plans to be revealed by the Transport Secretary include:Mary Creagh, the shadow transport secretary, said the new cap on fares would be "cold comfort for commuters"."It has taken 18 months, delivers fare increases of up to 6% and is too little too late," she said."This announcement doesn't go as far as Labour's plans which would prevent train companies from increasing fares beyond one per cent above inflation."</body>

      <body>The keys to the first £1 home sold in Liverpool have been handed over to its new owners.Liverpool Council offered the chance to buy 20 vacant houses for the small sum if the new owners pledged to refurbish them and stay for at least five years.The property, on Cairns Street, Granby, was handed over to Jayalal Madde by Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson.More than 1,000 people applied for the scheme and 10 applicants have so far been successful.Married father-of-two Mr Madde, 48, said he had raised money through a credit union to carry out refurbishments.The pilot scheme is part of plans to bring 179 empty homes back into use in the Granby, Picton and Arnside Road areas of the city.Applicants must live or work in Liverpool, be a first-time buyer and in employment. They had to agree to live in the property for a minimum of five years and not sub-let.The work required on each property is likely to cost more than £35,000.Mr Anderson said: "It mustn't be forgotten that bringing these homes up to a decent standard will be a real challenge."Those who are successful in obtaining a house will have to put in a lot of hard work, as well as their own finances."Mr Anderson said the pilot scheme formed part of his commitment to bring 1,000 empty properties back into use across the city.</body>

      <body>Exotic butterflies and moths from the continent are colonising in Britain.Increasing numbers are being drawn to southern England from north Africa and Europe after a spell of hot summer weather and a warm autumn, experts say.European long-tailed blue butterflies have been spotted in Wiltshire, Kent and Sussex.Rare moths including the Clifden nonpareil and rosy underwing have appeared in southern counties including Dorset and Hampshire.Dorset-based moth recorder Les Hill has spotted three Clifden nonpareil moths in the past two weeks in the same part of south Dorset.He described the insect, known for its bright flash of blue on its wings, as being on "every moth recorder's wish list"."As the name nonpareil states, it is peerless and has no equal," he said."To record one in a lifetime is the fulfilment of an ambition. To record them every year in my garden is just remarkable."Butterfly Conservation spokesman Richard Fox said the sightings were "very exciting news"."The hot summer enabled long-tailed blues and other migratory butterflies to spread northwards into Britain, capitalising on opportunities to breed here while the weather remains warm," he said.The charity said the large rosy underwing moth had only been seen on 10 occasions in Britain before this summer and recent sightings raised the "tantalising prospect that the moth is now locally resident".Experts have not seen such high numbers of this delicately-patterned moth entering the UK for half a century.Higher than average numbers of the exotic crimson speckled moth have also been recorded along the south coast.</body>

      <title>English people for England - Wilshere</title>
      <description>Midfielder Jack Wilshere says only "English people" should play for the national side as England monitor Adnan Januzaj.</description>

      <body>Only English people should play football for England, says midfielder Jack Wilshere.Manchester United's Adnan Januzaj could play for England if he passes Fifa's five-year residency requirement, as he is yet to commit to another country.Midfielder Januzaj, 18, is eligible for selection by Belgium, Serbia, Albania and Turkey.Asked about the issue, Wilshere said: "If you live in England for five years it doesn't make you English."The 21-year-old Arsenal player added: "If I went to Spain and lived there for five years, I'm not going to play for Spain."England boss Roy Hodgson has confirmed he has been monitoring Januzaj.Wilshere, who earlier this week insisted he is not a smoker despite being pictured with a cigarette outside a nightclub, added: "We have to remember what we are."We are English. We tackle hard, are tough on the pitch and are hard to beat."We have great characters. You think of Spain and you think technical but you think of England and you think they are brave and they tackle hard. We have to remember that."The only people who should play for England are English people."Liverpool's Raheem Sterling, born in Jamaica, and Wilfried Zaha of Manchester United, born in Ivory Coast, are part of the England Under-21 set-up along with West Brom's Saido Berahino, who left war-torn Burundi as a 10-year-old."It's a difficult one," said England Under-21 coach Gareth Southgate. "He [Januzaj] has not played for anyone else."We have lots of boys in our squad who were not born here, whose families have fled here."There are some wonderful stories and they are all incredibly proud to play for England."I'm torn with it. The world is changing. People move and work abroad. It is important to know why someone wants to play for you."Former Football Association chairman David Bernstein said England must "play within the rules and get the best team we can".He told BBC Radio 5 live: "There is much more fluidity in terms of population movement."I would say we must play within the rules but if players are eligible, I would be inclined to pick the best players we can get. Other countries do that."Cricketers Kevin Pietersen, Matt Prior and Jonathan Trott play for England despite being born in South Africa.Southgate added: "We seem to have embraced the cricket team that has won the Ashes, but it is a really interesting, philosophical debate."Januzaj, who joined United in 2011 from Belgian club Anderlecht for a reported fee of nearly £300,000, was born in Brussels.He has turned down the advances of Belgium, and has not won a cap at any level for any country.Januzaj qualifies for Albania through his Kosovan-Albanian parents, Turkey through his grandparents and Serbia as Kosovo's independence has not been recognised by the United Nations.Kosovo's national team are not members of Uefa or Fifa.Fifa, the sport's governing body, states a player is eligible if "he has lived continuously for at least five years after reaching the age of 18 on the territory of the relevant association".That would mean Januzaj would have to wait until 2018 to represent England, assuming he remains in the country until he turns 23.</body>

      <body>Gloucester full-back Olly Morgan has been forced to retire because of a serious knee injury.The 27-year-old, capped twice by England, has not played since damaging ligaments in January 2012."You always think in the back of your mind 'can I defy the odds?'. But I know I've made the right decision," he told BBC Gloucestershire."The training, playing and continuous process is hard for a fit player, so for me, it just wouldn't be possible."Morgan was making his 131st appearance for the Cherry and Whites, having signed a new contract two months earlier, when he suffered the injury in a 21-15 defeat by Worcester.He was initially ruled out for the remainder of the 2011-12 season, but an infection delayed his progress and he has remained in rehabilitation."The first time I thought it was more serious was when I had the infection, but that's the risk you take with the operations," he added."I was really pleased with how the rehab had gone. But like with many guys who retire with knee injuries they feel they get close, but with professional rugby as it is nowadays, it made me think it couldn't cope."The gutting thing is how hard I've worked. That's the hard part to take."Morgan signed his first professional contract with Gloucester in 2004 and three years later earned his two international caps against Scotland and Ireland in the Six Nations, only to suffer a shoulder injury during the latter appearance.</body>

      <title>League can help England - Lancaster</title>
      <description>Stuart Lancaster says England's union players can learn "a huge amount" from rugby league to close the gap on top teams.</description>

      <body>England head coach Stuart Lancaster says he will turn to rugby league to help his players reach the same level as New Zealand and South Africa.Lancaster went on a fact-finding mission to Australia and New Zealand in August to visit leading league clubs.In particular, he thinks a lot can be copied to boost England's try-scoring."We have a huge amount to learn from rugby league, particularly in terms of attacking and core skills," Lancaster told BBC Radio 5 live."Sometimes we can forget about the core skills bit. League is rugby in the simplest form in the sense that it's about great defence, great tackling technique, good handling, good passing, catching and great kicking."I think they concentrate on the basics better than us. You only have to look at some of the tries scored in the Grand Final last weekend."Lancaster spent time in Sydney with the Roosters and the Rabbitohs and also went to see Melbourne Storm before observing Australian Rules Football following England's tour to Argentina.The 43-year-old, who will be a keen observer of the forthcoming Rugby League World Cup, plans to take further inspiration from the other code."I have been hugely influenced by rugby league and I'm a massive league fan," said Lancaster, who observed Leeds Rhinos at close quarters while director of rugby at Leeds Carnegie."You look at the number of coaches that have come from rugby league into rugby union and influence the game, the list goes on."We have had the likes of Kevin Sinfield and Jamie Peacock come and speak to our players."Lancaster also wants to create a rugby union culture similar to that of world champions New Zealand and believes there is room for significant improvements in what it means to play for England."New Zealand have a strong emphasis on culture and identity," he added."The shirt means a huge amount to them. Playing for New Zealand is huge and the players are great role models for the country."We have a lot of work to do in that area. Real emotional glue brings a team together. And we have tried to look deeper into the history of our shirt."I wrote to five or six former players from the 1950s onwards to help us reconnect with what the shirt means, about what it means to play for England."England head coach Stuart Lancaster was speaking to Radio 5 live's Mark Pougatch which can be heard on the 5 live podcast.</body>

      <title>The band who opened a record shop</title>
      <description>The indie band who opened their own record shop</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24437766</url>
      <date>1381284402</date>
      <body>When indie band Frankie and the Heartstrings released their second album this summer, they were so alarmed by the lack of record shops in which to sell it that they decided to open their own."We were coming to the completion of our second record and the main story on the news one day was the fact HMV had gone bust," says singer Frankie Francis."At the time, a couple of local record shops had gone bust as well. We thought 'We've got this record coming out, but there might not actually be anywhere to sell it on the High Street.'"So we thought we'd take a stand and open our own record shop."With help from Sunderland City Council, the band took over the empty tourist office in their home town. "There's no call for it any more, for various reasons," Francis says solemnly.Pop Recs Ltd was only supposed to open for two weeks to mark their album's release in June. But the band say the reaction has been so good that they are keeping it open for as long as they can and have plans for in-store gigs through to next February.Four out of the five bandmates work there full time and, last month, the venture earned them the title of hardest working band in Britain from the Association of Independent Music.When I visit, the lead singer is manning the coffee machine, busily grinding beans and frothing milk as the shop fills up before an in-store gig by visiting Manchester band Dutch Uncles.Drummer Dave Harper and bassist Steve Dennis are behind the counter in a state of harangued dishevelment - passing coffee cups, jabbing the till, fetching supplies, pausing to chat to friends.Indie circuit stalwarts, Frankie and the Heartstrings made the top 40 with their debut album in 2011 and have a loyal live following, but are still waiting for that breakthrough to the big time."We're a band with not much money… and we've put what money we have into this project just to show bands can take a stand," Francis says."If we can do it on a street level, why can't people further up in the music business be as proactive as us?"We're engaging with loads of bands and labels to come and do things and because of that we're selling records in Sunderland for all these bands. That wouldn't have happened if this project didn't exist."But does it really matter whether we have real record shops selling real records any more? "I guess it matters more to us because we're in a band and we know how many records people sell," Francis replies."Even 10 years ago you would have sold double, three times, four times the amount of records that you sell now."I think it's very important to engage with people and make them realise the value of actually owning music, especially on vinyl because we're very romantic in that we take a lot of time over the artwork and the way it's laid out and the way the whole thing feels and looks."We just want to try and make that connect with people and explain to them why it's such a cherished item."A few months ago, Francis was simply a flamboyant indie rock front man. Now, he talks about business plans and the deals he has struck with various record labels."We're five kids from Sunderland who have been messing around in the back of a van for five years touring the world," he says."It's quite easy to slip back into the crazy gang mentality, but we've had to put our businessmen heads on."The group's second album missed the top 40 and they are now between record contracts. With minimal money to be made from album sales, mid-ranking indie bands must find other sources of income.Dutch Uncles are critical favourites but their three albums have not troubled the top 40. Singer Duncan Wallis says the idea of making money from selling records just does not occur to bands such as his."It's just not something you really consider," he says. "You only think about the money to be made out of touring, at this level anyway."Frankie and the Heartstrings say they have sacrificed summer festival fees in order to work in the shop, which earns them "enough to get by, and that's all we care about".The alternative would be much worse - getting proper jobs."The shop, if you maintain it correctly, could become an income for the band," Francis says. "If it wasn't for the shop we would all have to be in work now."Until now, the band have survived on the money they have made from their music. When a pizza company used one of their songs in a TV advert, the group lived for a year on the proceeds.Francis says: "I don't think there's any shame in that any more because you don't make any money from selling records, so you've got to make an income somehow."In the store, the band also sell their own coffee blend and brand of beer, and Francis admits they make more money from coffee than records most days. Like many other independent record stores, they know they cannot survive by selling music alone.Work by local artists and photographers adorns the walls and there are dedicated racks promoting records by local bands."We've had kids from the local area who've come into the shop, bought some records and the next week they've come in and said, 'We've just started a band, can we have a gig in here?'" Francis says.But the most prominent space is reserved for the new album by Frankie and the Heartstrings.The singer laughs: "If we're going to run a record shop, we're going to be number one in the charts every week in this store."</body>

      <title>Will EDL survive leader's exit?</title>
      <description>Leader's decision to quit marks watershed, writes Tom Symonds</description>

      <body>The English Defence League (EDL) began life as a street movement in opposition to Islamist extremists who protested against British troops in 2009 in Luton.It has stayed on the streets, its marches attended by men and women who say they are working class, and anti-Muslim.But the EDL has rarely been able to mobilise thousands for its marches. And often the hundreds who have turned out have been met by similar numbers of anti-racist campaigners.It has struggled ideologically too. There has been growing tension between supporters who appear to oppose all Muslims and the EDL's leaders who say they only oppose Muslim extremists.It has been suggested the leadership has "marketed" the EDL in this way, in contrast to the views of most of its members.Officially the EDL denies being racist, and rejects the suggestion it is of the far right.The group says it does not condemn all Muslims, and Tommy Robinson has said he does not "want to lead a war against all Muslims".However, in the past, he has talked about "Muslim communities feeling the full force of the EDL" - a comment he explained by suggesting this would be through democratic processes, not violence.For its part the British National Party appears to believe the EDL's leadership has not been radical enough.An article on its website states: "As genuine nationalists we have deep ideological differences with the EDL leaders who openly support the ethno-cultural genocide of the indigenous English through mass colonisation and multi-racialism."This tension is probably the best explanation as to why twelve senior members of the EDL have now left.Mr Robinson appears to have decided that a street movement that seems to confront all Muslims is not changing minds.But there is another explanation. EDL members say the personal pressure on Tommy Robinson in particular has been intense.In the wake of the stabbing of Lee Rigby in Woolwich, Mr Robinson tweeted that he'd received 200 death threats, including to cut off his head.He told BBC Radio 5Live that when supporters threatened to bomb mosques he would be blamed "when I pick my kids up from school". He insisted "that's not what I stand for".That pressure may simply have got to him.The anti-extremism group Quilliam appears to have played its part too.It has suggested that there is a negative symbiotic relationship between far-right extremism and Islamism, and this argument appears to have helped convince Tommy Robinson to make his announcement - through Quilliam itself.It is not yet clear in what ways the group has engaged with Mr Robinson and other EDL members.Their departure has weakened the movement, and its mobilisation of anti-Muslim working class sentiment.It remains to be seen if new leaders will emerge, or whether the EDL will melt away, leaving the British National Party alone on the right.</body>

      <title>'Do I still not like that': Graham Taylor's lowest point</title>
      <description>Graham Taylor 20 years on from notorious England defeat</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24354888</url>

      <body>"If you say 'Holland' to me, to this day I see David Platt running through on goal. I can't help it. When things don't go well as an England manager, it sticks with you for the rest of your life."Wednesday, 13 October, 1993 is a date lodged firmly in the mind of former England manager Graham Taylor.Three years into the job, three years after Bobby Robson, Paul Gascoigne and Gary Lineker had captured the nation's hearts by reaching the semi-finals of Italia 90, the unthinkable happened.A controversial defeat by the Netherlands in Rotterdam, with Ronald Koeman scoring the opener minutes after he should have been dismissed for a professional foul, effectively ended England's chances of qualifying for the 1994 World Cup in the United States.Taylor was left feeling "cheated".Thanks to a warts-and-all documentary broadcast on Channel 4 a year later, images of Taylor's touchline fury and exasperation remain etched in England fans' collective memory.After a poor Euro 92 which saw England eliminated in the group stages after scoring just once in three games, Taylor's maiden World Cup campaign got off to a bad start.Leads at home to Norway and then the Netherlands were painfully squandered, putting qualification in doubt."We played very well in both of those games and if we had won just one, which we deserved to, we would have been OK," Taylor remembers.But the away double-header in May and June of 1993 did not go well either.A draw in Poland and defeat away against leaders Norway in the space of four days left Taylor's side up against it. However, after an impressive 3-0 win over Poland at Wembley, England's fate was in their own hands going into the penultimate fixture in Rotterdam."We were a point above the Netherlands, with two games to go," says Taylor. "A draw would have been enough for us to qualify and we were as confident as we could expect to be."With captain Stuart Pearce injured and Lazio midfielder Paul Gascoigne suspended, Taylor made five changes to his side.Off the pitch, he was called on to help smuggle in the documentary crew after they were denied access by the Dutch FA. The crew donned England tracksuits and carried their film equipment into the stadium in team kitbags.Once the match kicked off, Leeds full-back Tony Dorigo - standing in for Pearce - smashed a long-range free-kick against the post, while Frank Rijkaard had an effort for the hosts disallowed in a goalless first half.So far, so good.The match, England's hopes and Taylor's career were all transformed by a two-minute spell around the hour mark. Andy Sinton - on at half-time in place of Carlton Palmer - hit a long ball over the top for David Platt to run on to.The England skipper was hauled to the ground by Koeman, but referee Karl-Josef Assenmacher decided to only show the Barcelona man a yellow card, rather than red.The documentary was to show Taylor imploring the German official to send Koeman off, memorably asking fourth official Markus Merk: "What sort of thing is happening here?"Even 20 years on, Taylor is incensed by the decision."I could not believe what I was seeing. It was a goalscoring opportunity and Koeman should have gone," he says. "Fifa had made a very strong point in the weeks before the game that the denial of a goalscoring opportunity was a straight red card."He should have been sent off, absolutely."After the game, Koeman admitted he had expected to be dismissed. Instead, Dorigo's free-kick was blocked by the advancing Dutch wall and two minutes later the home side were given a free-kick at the other end.To heighten England's sense of injustice, it was Koeman who stepped up to score. His first effort was charged down by Ince, but he made no mistake second time around, with ITV commentator Brian Moore's prophecy of "he's going to flick one, he's going to flick one" proving accurate as he curled the ball into the top corner."That was when I lost it," Taylor says. "I honestly felt that we were being cheated. The referee was favouring the home side, I really felt that, as the free-kick we had blocked was exactly the same."The only other occasion in my career I felt like that was when I was in charge of Lincoln and we had a terrible penalty awarded at Birmingham. But this was obviously worse."I lost the plot because I honestly and truthfully felt that England were being cheated in a vital game for the country."That was the worst I've ever been on a touchline. I'd never been like that before. But that is the one time I end up on film, so that's what people remember."Paul Merson hit the post again but a second goal for the Netherlands followed, with Dennis Bergkamp scoring."The referee's got me the sack," Taylor told the linesman in the closing minutes. "Thank him ever so much for that won't you?"Taylor concluded his reign with a futile 7-1 win in San Marino in November 1993, as the Netherlands secured qualification by beating Poland. Taylor resigned six days later."I try not to think about what would have happened next if Koeman had been sent off," Taylor says. "I'm sure we would have qualified for the World Cup and I probably keep my job. But that's life."Film-maker Ken McGill and his team had been recording Taylor and his team throughout the qualifiers. Taylor had agreed to take part in the programme as he hoped it would show the differences between club and international management.But as results turned for the worse, the focus shifted to Taylor himself - the man in the 'Impossible Job', the title of the film which more than six million people tuned in to watch."I didn't ever expect that we wouldn't qualify, I was arrogant enough to think that," admits Taylor."So I was keen to show the problems of being England manager. Then, as the results went on and we didn't qualify, I became more central to the documentary, quite rightly."You're the country's number one villain."Taylor thought about cancelling filming before the trip to Norway in June 1993, but knew that the written press - who were already hostile towards him - would seize on it as an admission England would not qualify."One positive which came out of it is that people saw I was passionate about the job," Taylor says. "But I can't watch it. I put a little bit of the documentary on my computer recently but I couldn't watch it."I said to myself 'don't watch it Graham, because for the next week you'll be down'."In the aftermath of his resignation - and being labelled a 'turnip' by the Sun newspaper in 1992 - Taylor considered leaving the country. Instead he stayed and rebuilt his club career, taking Watford back to the top flight.The documentary was a hit. But McGill, who has also made films with Gascoigne, Lennox Lewis and Ian Botham,  has mixed feelings 20 years on.Taylor may have been able to return to work, but his assistant Phil Neal was criticised for being 'a yes man' after the documentary was broadcast. At the time, he was England's most decorated player, yet his managerial career never recovered, with a brief spell in charge of Manchester City in 1996 his last job as a coach."At the time I felt terrible," McGill admits, "not only for Graham but I also feel responsible for Phil not being able to earn a living in football any more."If it wasn't for Graham's help, we would not have been able to film in Rotterdam. We would have missed all of that drama."I found it hard to take the consequences of the film. But there is nothing I would change. It is a piece of honest film-making."</body>

      <title>Can a fiver save the high street?</title>
      <description>Can just £5 a week help save your high street?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-24374320</url>
      <date>1381199149</date>
      <body>Online shopping and competition from out-of-town retail parks and supermarkets have long been cited as the reason so many British high streets are suffering. But can a project which challenges consumers to spend £5 locally finally turn the tide?A number of government schemes have been introduced to try and give shopping areas a boost, but what can towns do to help themselves?Burslem in Stoke-on-Trent is the latest to try out a scheme to get local people to spend £5 of their weekly shopping budget in their town centre instead of online or in chain stores.It currently has about 30 empty shops and has suffered since the closure of the Royal Doulton factory in 2005 and tourist attraction Ceramica shutting down in 2011.It is also two miles from Hanley which is seen as the retail centre for Stoke-on-Trent.Professor Jon Fairburn, from Staffordshire University's Business School, is helping to implement the social enterprise scheme called Totally Locally."The theory is if every adult living within one mile of Burslem town centre spends £5 with their local independent shops and businesses, it would be worth an extra £6m a year to the local economy," he said.But how realistic is that figure?Matthew Hopkinson, director of the Local Data Company which analyses retail trends, claims the scheme is "a gimmick".He said: "What you're trying to do is change consumer behaviour but even if they do it for one week they're probably not going to do it for 52 weeks a year."Businesses think if they can manipulate the consumer and their habits everything will be alright, but ultimately it can't be sustained."One town to already try the idea is the market town of Leek in the Staffordshire Moorlands.Three years ago, 11% of its shops - about 30 of them -were vacant and charity shops occupied a number of units. That vacancy rate is now down to 6% - about 11 shops.Marc Briand, who leads the scheme, said it was set up as a reaction to the building of a new supermarket in the town in 2011."Switching £5 of your shopping budget is as simple as buying a sandwich from the local cafe at lunch or buying your weekly fruit and veg," he said."Out of that people then start to think about getting their car serviced at the local garage or buying clothes from local boutiques."The initial idea of making sure people spend that fiver has started to tail away but we've built on that to market the town in the right way and people keep coming back."Pop into Alison Szafranski's Market Kitchen Cafe in Stanley Street and she will point you in the right direction to buy a birthday gift or bottle of wine for a dinner party - all on the town's high street."It's about promoting all the businesses here, competition is healthy, but we are all about pulling together to make our businesses successful and Leek successful," she said.Mr Briand said it was "difficult to gauge" how successful the £5 spend scheme had been."Traders are quite cagey about what their profits are but shopkeepers I know saw a definite upturn [in profits]," he said."Even taking it from a low vacancy rate...you can't say it hasn't had an effect."Traders in the smaller Staffordshire town of Eccleshall started the £5 spend scheme in January.Accountant Tim Hulse, who leads the project, said it was about uniting traders rather than revitalising the high street."Eccleshall has always been a reasonably prosperous area because we've got a lot of so-called destination shops; a baby boutique, a speciality wedding shop, jewellers, and those bring people in," he said."I think it's the case of bringing a group of people together to put the effort in to promote any sort of campaign. Some traders have reported a 10 to 20% rise in turnover since we began."At WM Perry's butchers shop in Stafford Street there is a list of nearby farms where the shop's meat comes from and a stack of bones piled on a table outside for dog owners to take for their pets.Owner Peter Bevan said: "I don't think you can dictate to someone how and where they spend their money but the important thing is we give them the service that keeps them coming back."I think that's what Eccleshall prides itself on, shopkeepers now know the customers' names and faces and know exactly what they want."But the scheme would not suit all town centres, according to Mr Hulse.He said: "We're a small enough town not to need a massive major brand name and I think with the unique businesses we have, proximity drives footfall."It will be interesting to see how Burslem does, being so close to Stoke-on-Trent city centre and what it has to offer retail-wise."Back in Burslem, some shops are getting a fresh coat of paint ahead of the launch of the £5 scheme on 12 October.Only time will tell if shoppers spending a weekly fiver will spark the town's revival.</body>

      <body>With hundreds of radio stations now broadcasting across the country, it is difficult to imagine how uncrowded the airwaves were 40 years ago. BBC Radio had a domestic monopoly - with no legal commercial competition on UK soil.That all changed on 8 October 1973 with the opening of the first Independent Local Radio station - LBC in London. Capital Radio, also in London, was next - and stations in Glasgow, Birmingham and Manchester soon followed. Within a decade, over 40 stations were on air.Here, as UK commercial radio celebrates a landmark birthday, spend a few minutes on a trip back in time to hear how it all started - and how the foundations of today's digital radio landscape were laid.All copyrights acknowledged.

      <title>Failings found in border safeguards</title>
      <description>A report highlights a series of failings in the government's £500m "e-borders" programme to gather information on passenger movements in and out of the UK.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24453677</url>
      <date>1381300904</date>
      <body>A report has found failings in the government's £500m "e-borders" scheme to gather information on passenger movements in and out of the UK.The independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, John Vine, found that fewer than two-thirds of passenger movements were covered.And almost 650,000 records relating to smuggling had been deleted, he found.The Home Office said UK border technology was the most advanced in Europe but agreed there was more to do.The aim of the e-borders programme, devised by the Home Office in 2003, was to improve immigration controls by collecting advanced passenger information (API) on every scheduled inbound and outbound journey to and from the UK.That would enable staff to "export the border" - preventing passengers from travelling where this was considered a threat to the UK.A target was set to collect data on at least 95% of passenger movements by December 2010 but, at the time of the inspection last year, only 65% were being recorded.The report, parts of which are deleted from the public version, said: "We found that the e-borders programme had failed to deliver the planned increases in API and this had a detrimental impact on the delivery of all anticipated benefits."It blamed legal difficulties surrounding the collection of API on European flights and a failure to test the e-borders concept on train and sea routes.Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Vine said people with an alert against their name for "terrorist sympathy or activity" should be met at airport arrivals gates by border staff, but that was only being done at Heathrow among Britain's airports.He also said the e-Borders system was supposed to stop people flying to the UK if they had previously been excluded or deported from the country, but "not one person" had been stopped under that system.This method of stopping people flying when they tried to check in at foreign airports was supposed to be a "key benefit" of e-Borders, Mr Vine added.The Home Office said it now carried out advance checks on 78% of those flying to Britain and required API from everyone coming from outside the EU.Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: "We have the best coverage of any country in Europe but we are working to improve our coverage further."We will take the findings of the independent inspector into account as we continue to develop our API policies and coverage."Inspectors found that the data set was not extensive enough for the e-borders programme to meet another objective - to "count in and out" all foreign national passengers - and that this wouldn't be possible until 2018 at the earliest.The report, which contains 14 recommendations, also criticised the "poor quality" of data on watch lists used by the e-borders system to alert border staff of criminals, terrorists and other suspects.It said this created inefficiencies and a greater volume of work which officials were unable to manage."This, coupled with a policy of prioritising immigration work over customs work, resulted in the deletion... of over 649,000 records concerning potential drug and tobacco smuggling, over a 10-month period," the report said.It said the deletions had a "significant impact on the ability of staff at the border to seize prohibited and restricted goods and deal with those responsible."However, the Home Office played down the importance of the information that had been deleted, saying that anyone who had committed a serious offence would already be on a separate "warnings index" and intercepted on arrival.Officials said the details that had been removed were potential matches between two databases, less than 1% of which would have prompted an alert.Among a series of positive findings, inspectors said information gathered as a result of the e-borders scheme had resulted in the arrest of thousands of people for offences including murder and rape.Immigration caseworkers were able to conduct travel history searches using the data and identify people who had left the UK after being ordered to do so.Mr Vine said he was pleased that the e-borders "high-profile alerts" system was being used to intercept high-risk individuals at the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport - but pointed out that this was not happening at any other port or airport.He suggested that a fundamental re-think was needed for the programme, which, it is estimated, will cost £536m by 2015.Mr Vine said: "The Home Office should now define clearly what the aims of the e-borders programme are ahead of the new procurement exercise, and be transparent about what e-borders will deliver and by when."</body>

      <body>A pilot who fell ill at the controls of his plane forcing his passenger to land the light aircraft has died, police have said.The man collapsed in the cockpit of the plane after taking off, leaving the "inexperienced" passenger to make an emergency landing.The plane landed at Humberside Airport under the guidance of instructors called in by air traffic controllers.Police said they were unable to confirm the cause of death.A spokesman for Humberside Police said: "The pilot of the plane sadly died last night."We are not treating it as suspicious and we are in a position whereby formal identification will take place later today."He added that a file would be prepared for the coroner.Police, fire and ambulance crews were called to the North Lincolnshire airport after a distress call was made from the light aircraft.Two flying instructors were called in to advise the passenger how to bring the plane down.One of them, Roy Murray, said: "I think without any sort of talk-down he would have just gone into the ground and that would have been the end of it."The passenger and pilot were the only people on board the aircraft, which had taken off from Sandtoft Airfield 25 miles (40km) away.Eyewitnesses described seeing sparks as the plane landed at about 19:50 BST on Tuesday.Stuart Sykes said he saw the aircraft land: "It came down with a bump, a bump, a bump, hit the front end down, I heard some crashing and it's come to a halt."Two incoming flights were delayed while the aircraft was removed from the runway.</body>

      <title>MI5 chief warns of threat to public</title>
      <description>Thousands of Islamist extremists in the UK see the British public as a legitimate target for attacks, the director general of MI5 warns.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24454596</url>
      <date>1381282153</date>
      <body>Thousands of Islamist extremists in the UK see the British public as a legitimate target for attacks, the director general of MI5 has warned.Andrew Parker was making his first public speech since taking over as head of the UK Security Service in April.Al-Qaeda and its affiliates in Pakistan and Yemen present "the most direct and immediate threats to the UK," he said.He also warned of the damage done to British security by the leaking of classified documents from GCHQ.Addressing the Royal United Services Institute in Whitehall, Mr Parker added the security services must have access to the many means of communication which terrorists now use.Threats to the UK are growing more diverse and diffuse, he said, but warned: "It remains the case that there are several thousand Islamist extremists here who see the British public as a legitimate target."He explained that "knowing of an individual does not equate to knowing everything about them"."Being on our radar does not necessarily mean being under our microscope," he said."The reality of intelligence work in practice is that we only focus the most intense intrusive attention on a small number of cases at any one time."The challenge therefore concerns making choices between multiple and competing demands to give us the best chance of being in the right place at the right time to prevent terrorism."Mr Parker added: "We are not perfect, and there are always things we can learn, do better and sharpen up on."With 30 years in MI5, Mr Parker was previously deputy director general and before that director of its counter-terrorism division at the time of the London bombings in 2005.In his speech, he named al-Qaeda and its affiliates in south Asia and the Arabian peninsula as presenting "the most direct and immediate threats to the UK".By that he meant primarily its elements in Pakistan and separately in Yemen, from where al-Qaeda has three times succeeded in smuggling explosives past security on to planes in the last four years.Referring to the ongoing conflict in Syria, he said a growing proportion of MI5's casework concerned individuals from the UK who had travelled to fight there.He said extremist Sunni groups in Syria were aspiring to attack Western countries.This has long been a concern of Western governments - that British-based jihadists will one day return from the killing fields of Syria and turn their new-found skills on the population back home.A number of people have been stopped at airports and some have been arrested on suspicion of terrorism."For the future, there is good reason to be concerned about Syria," he said.Mr Parker said 330 people had been convicted of terrorism-related offences in Britain between 11 September 2001 and 31 March 2013.He added that in the first few months of this year, there had been four major trials related to terrorist plots.Chillingly, he reminded the public that these included plans for a 7/7-style attack with rucksack bombs, and named two other plots.There were guilty pleas in each case, he said, with 24 terrorists convicted and sentenced to more than 260 years in jail.Mr Parker's speech also went on to reveal some of the fears and frustrations his service was experiencing over both the advances in technology and those who leak government secrets into the public domain.He warned that terrorists now had tens of thousands of means of communication "through e-mail, IP telephony, in-game communication, social networking, chat rooms, anonymising services and a myriad of mobile apps".Mr Parker said it was vital for MI5 - and by inference its partner GCHQ - to retain the capability to access such information if the Security Service was to protect the country.Intelligence officials in both the US and Britain have been absolutely dismayed at the wealth of secret data taken by the former CIA contractor Edward Snowden when he fled to Russia.Some 58,000 of the files are from GCHQ, whose intelligence, Mr Parker said, had played a vital role in stopping many UK terrorist plots over the past decade.Without mentioning Mr Snowden by name, he said ''it causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques".Doing this, he added, handed the advantage to the terrorists.In conclusion, Mr Parker said he did not believe the terrorist threat was any worse now than before. But it was "more diffuse, more complicated, more unpredictable".</body>

      <title>UK industry output in surprise fall</title>
      <description>UK industrial production fell unexpectedly in August, showing its biggest decline for nearly a year, according to the Office for National Statistics.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24455710</url>
      <date>1381310710</date>
      <body>UK industrial production fell unexpectedly in August, showing its biggest decline for nearly a year, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Industrial output decreased by 1.1% month-on-month, surprising analysts, who had expected a 0.4% rise.The biggest factor in the decline was a big fall in manufacturing output, which was 1.2% down on July levels.It was the biggest overall drop in output since September 2012.At the same time, the ONS published figures showing that the UK trade deficit was largely unchanged in August.The gap between imports and exports for the month was estimated at £3.3bn, compared with £3.4bn in July.The decrease in UK manufacturing output was led by companies making pharmaceutical products, electronics, food and beverages.But other sectors also contributed to the surprise fall in overall output, with the oil and gas industry also underperforming.Private-sector surveys of production have been less downbeat. Last week, the Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for September indicated that UK manufacturing had grown for the sixth consecutive month.Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturers' organisation EEF, described the latest ONS figures as "a mixed bag of data which breaks the run of consistently upbeat indicators in recent months".She added: "Whilst August unwound some of the gains in June and July, the declines were particularly concentrated in a few sectors, namely food, pharmaceuticals and electronics."However, the trade news was a little more positive, with exports edging higher, thanks to gains in markets outside Europe."Despite this monthly setback on production, manufacturing should make a positive contribution to third-quarter GDP growth and other business surveys seem to align behind a continuation of this trend through the final months of the year."However, Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency brokers World First, said the figures were "a further sign that the UK's economic revival cannot be guaranteed"."While the IMF may have sung the UK's praises [on Tuesday], today's number shows that the broad-based recovery that so many have been hailing has significant tasks attached," he said."The divergence between the recent, multi-year highs on PMIs and the official data is worrying and a little difficult to explain. Could businesses be overly exuberant without cause?"</body>

      <title>Power to raise rail fares curbed</title>

      <date>1381274115</date>
      <body>The rail industry's power to increase fares in England is to be curbed as part of a government drive to overhaul the rail fare system.Until now, some regulated fares could potentially have gone up by 9.1% next January.They will now be capped at 6.1%.But campaigners say it is not enough, and point out that commuters will still have to pay an above- inflation increase next year.Regulated fares are those which the government controls, and include season tickets, "anytime" single tickets around major cities, and off-peak inter-city return tickets.They will go up in 2014 by an average of 4.1%, a number calculated using an average of inflation - as measured by the retail prices index (RPI) for July - plus 1%.Train companies can add up to 5% on top of the average rise, although fares that go up by more than the average must be balanced by others that rise by less or fall.The government plans to limit that extra increase to 2% in the future. But the provision for the average regulated ticket price to go up by 1% more than inflation remains.The move is part of the government's Fares and Ticketing review being published by the Transport Secretary, Patrick McLoughlin.The review will also detail a pilot scheme that could see all long-distance rail tickets sold on a single-leg basis, not as returns.The government says this could allow passengers to more easily "mix and match" different ticket types when planning a return journey.Other plans to be revealed by the Transport Secretary include:Mary Creagh, the shadow transport secretary, said the new cap on fares would be "cold comfort for commuters"."It has taken 18 months, delivers fare increases of up to 6% and is too little too late," she said."This announcement doesn't go as far as Labour's plans which would prevent train companies from increasing fares beyond one per cent above inflation."</body>

      <title>Plane noise 'link' to heart disease</title>
      <description>The risks of stroke, heart and circulatory disease are higher in areas which have a lot of aircraft noise, researchers have found.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24432162</url>
      <date>1381277391</date>
      <body>The risks of stroke, heart and circulatory disease are higher in areas with a lot of aircraft noise, researchers say.Their study of 3.6 million residents near Heathrow Airport suggested the risks were 10-20% higher in areas with the highest levels of aircraft noise.The team's findings are published in the British Medical Journal.They agreed with other experts that noise was not necessarily to blame and more work was needed.Their work suggests a higher risk for both hospital admissions and deaths from stroke, heart and circulatory disease for the 2% of the study - about 70,000 people - who lived where the aircraft noise was loudest.The lead author, Dr Anna Hansell, from Imperial College London, said: "The exact role that noise exposure may play in ill health is not well established."However, it is plausible that it might be contributing - for example, by raising blood pressure or by disturbing people's sleep.""There's a 'startle reaction' to loud noise - if you're suddenly exposed to it, the heart rate and blood pressure increase."And aircraft noise can be annoying for some people, which can also affect their blood pressure, leading to illness."The relative importance of daytime and night-time noise from aircraft also needs to be investigated further."The study used data about noise levels in 2001 from the Civil Aviation Authority, covering 12 London boroughs and nine districts outside of London where aircraft noise exceeds 50 decibels - about the volume of a normal conversation in a quiet room.The authors say fewer people are now affected by the highest levels of noise (above 63 decibels) - despite more planes being in the skies - because of changes in aircraft design and flight plans.The researchers - from Imperial and also King's College London - adjusted their work in an effort to eliminate other factors that might have a relationship with stroke and heart disease, such as deprivation, South Asian ethnicity and smoking-related illness.They stressed that the higher risk of illness related to aircraft noise remained much less significant than the risks from lifestyle factors - including smoking, a lack of exercise or poor diet.In an accompanying editorial, Prof Stephen Stansfeld, from Queen Mary University of London, said: "These results imply that the siting of airports and consequent exposure to aircraft noise may have direct effects on the health of the surrounding population."Planners need to take this into account when expanding airports in heavily populated areas or planning new airports."The study covered 12 London boroughs in the centre and west of the capital - and nine council districts beyond London, including Windsor and Maidenhead, Slough and Wokingham.Heathrow Airport's director of sustainability, Matt Gorman, said: "We are already taking significant steps to tackle the issue of noise."We are charging airlines more for noisier aircraft, offering insulation and double glazing to local residents and are working with noise campaigners to give people predictable periods of respite from noise."Together these measures have meant that the number of people affected by noise has fallen by 90% since the 1970s, despite the number of flights almost doubling."A government spokesman said: "The number of people affected by high levels of noise around Heathrow has been falling for years due to improvements in aviation technology, better planning of flight paths and other factors. We would expect to see this trend continue."A separate study, also published on Wednesday in the BMJ, demonstrates a higher rate of admission to hospital with cardiovascular problems for people living near 89 airports in the US.Prof Kevin McConway, from the Open University, said: "Both of these studies are thorough and well-conducted. But, even taken together, they don't prove that aircraft noise actually causes heart disease and strokes."A major difficulty in interpreting what these studies tell us is that they are based on data for geographical areas, not for individual people."Over the coming months, Public Health England will recruit experts to further examine the public health issues around exposure to noise.</body>

      <body>The Queen is to begin the baton relay which will visit all 70 competing nations and territories ahead of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.The baton will contain the Queen's hand-written message to the Commonwealth.Unlike the Olympic Torch, there is just one baton and it will visit every country taking part in the Games, which begin on 23 July 2014.The 288-day relay starts from Buckingham Palace in London.It will travel to Scotland on Thursday before heading for its first international port-of-call in India on 11 October.The baton will visit the big Commonwealth countries such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, South Africa, Malaysia, Australia, Kenya, Ghana, Jamaica and Canada.And also smaller destinations, including Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, St Kitts and Nevis and the Falklands Islands.It will not now visit The Gambia, which last week withdrew from the Commonwealth, saying it will "never be a member of any neo-colonial institution".The relay arrives back in the UK in May next year, visiting Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Northern Ireland, Wales and England before a 40-day tour of Scotland in the run-up to the start of the Games.The final relay runner hands the baton, which contains the sealed, hand-written scroll, back to the Queen at the opening ceremony.About 200 invited guests will attend the event to mark the start of the relay, which will involve Commonwealth Games Federation president Prince Tunku Imran and Lord Smith of Kelvin, the chairman of Glasgow's games organising committee.Scottish Olympians Sir Chris Hoy and Allan Wells will take part in a ceremony which will see the Queen beginning the baton relay.Sprint legend Wells, winner of two Commonwealth golds and the 100m Olympic sprint title at the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games, will be the first athlete to receive the baton from the Queen and start it on its journey.He said: "As the final runner of the Queen's Baton Relay (QBR) at the last Commonwealth Games on Scottish soil in Edinburgh in 1986, the baton and what it symbolises is incredibly special for me."It is a real honour for me to now be named as the first baton-bearer for the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games."Sir Chris, a six-time Gold Olympian and double Commonwealth Gold medallist, will escort the baton as it makes the processional journey down the Mall, accompanied by pipers, to the ceremony itself.Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said: "The start of the Queen's Baton Relay, with two of Scotland's greatest-ever athletes, is another step towards what will be a momentous year for Scotland."2014 promises the greatest-ever Games and the relay will provide a fantastic celebration of sport and culture across the Commonwealth, with Glasgow and Scotland at its heart."The baton will spend an average of one to four days in each nation, with an extended duration of seven days in Wales, two weeks in England and 40 days in Scotland.The designers of the baton said the message from the Queen was "pivotal" and they were keen it should not be "hidden away".The baton has a lattice design, made from layers of titanium fused together by laser, which means the message is visible.The parchment, handmade in Glasgow using linen and plant fibre, is also "dramatically" illuminated by LED lights within a transparent cylinder to make the sealed scroll easier to see.The brief for designers stated that the baton should be easily handed from person to person, should weigh no more than 2kg and must be able to withstand all weathers for the 10-month relay.The baton's handle is made of elm wood sourced from the grounds of Garrison House on the Isle of Cumbrae and was constructed using a boatbuilding technique called bird-mouthing, which means it is light, strong and durable.The top of the baton contains a granite "gemstone" which will be detached by opening a puzzle mechanism and given as gift to each nation and territory.The gems are made of water-resistant granite unique to Scotland and were sourced from Ailsa Craig in the Firth of Clyde.Glasgow 2014 will be the 20th Commonwealth Games and will feature 17 sports in 11 days of competition, with 261 medal events.The Commonwealth of Nations has 54 members, but 70 teams participate in the Commonwealth Games because a number of British overseas territories, Crown dependencies and island states compete under their own flag.The UK nations - Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland - compete separately in the Commonwealth Games, as do the smaller home territories such as Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.The first Queen's Baton Relay was staged for the 1958 Commonwealth Games in Cardiff and has been the curtain raiser to the Games ever since.But until 1998, the relay would only travel through England and the host nation.By 2002, in Manchester, it was covering 100,000km and visiting 23 nations.Melbourne 2006 was the first baton relay to visit all the nations which sent teams to the Games.The baton's journey around the globe will be documented by adventurer and broadcaster Mark Beaumont for the BBC.</body>

      <title>Hugh Grant warns of press 'betrayal'</title>
      <description>Actor Hugh Grant says any "further compromise" by ministers over press regulation would be a "betrayal of promises" made to victims of press abuse.</description>

      <body>Actor Hugh Grant has said any "further compromise" by ministers over press regulation would be a "betrayal of the promises" made to media abuse victims.He said the government was "terrified of the press" and was doing all it could "to oblige the press barons".On Tuesday Culture Secretary Maria Miller said newspapers' proposals for regulation had been rejected.But she suggested the government was willing to consider some of the ideas put forward by publishers.Mr Grant, a member of the Hacked Off campaign, accused senior Tories of an "abuse of democracy" by trying to "sabotage" plans for a royal charter agreed by all parties in Parliament.The report of the Leveson Inquiry into press standards recommended a tougher form of self-regulation backed by legislation, and Mr Grant said any suggestion such a system would limit free speech was "propaganda on the part of the press".He said some of the main newspaper groups "refuse to accept any system which would make them accountable for any of their actions".Mr Grant said Lord Leveson had made "very mild" recommendations but the press was determined to "mark its own homework".He said victims of press abuse, such as the families of Madeleine McCann and Milly Dowler, had been told by David Cameron that new rules would protect people from the press."Any further compromise would be a betrayal of the promises made by the secretary of state and above all by the prime minister to them," Mr Grant added.Bob Satchwell, executive director of the Society of Editors, said Ms Miller was simply talking about "tidying up" press regulation plans.He said the minister agreed with Lord Leveson that a regulation system forced on the press without its consent would be "unworkable".On Tuesday Ms Miller announced that the Privy Council - an ancient body which advises the Queen, mostly made up of senior politicians - had rejected press proposals for a royal charter.She referred to principles in the Leveson report such as independence and access to arbitration and said an alternative plan would now be "improved", adding that ministers were said to be willing to consider some of the industry's ideas.Changes will now be made to the alternative plan backed by politicians and campaigners, and the Privy Council's decision is expected on 30 October.Roger Alton, executive editor of the Times, later said newspapers could take legal action in the European courts against new rules.He told the BBC's Newsnight programme the proposed system would be an "unjust law"."What we don't want to have is a statutory body because that is essentially the end of 300 years of a free press," he said.Mr Alton appeared on Newsnight in a personal capacity, not as a representative of his newspaper.Options for the self-regulation of the press were proposed in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry, set up in July 2011 after it emerged journalists working for the now-closed News of the World had hacked into the mobile phone of murdered Surrey schoolgirl Milly Dowler.Political involvement:"Recognition" panel:Appointments process:Corrections and apologies:Arbitration:</body>

      <title>Home Office 'Go home' adverts banned</title>
      <description>The Advertising Standards Authority bans a Home Office mobile advert telling illegal immigrants to "go home or face arrest".</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24452551</url>
      <date>1381308334</date>
      <body>The advertising watchdog has banned a Home Office advert telling illegal immigrants to go home, saying it was misleading.But the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) cleared the campaign of being offensive and irresponsible.The campaign saw two vans drive around London for a week in July, carrying the message "Go home or face arrest."The ASA said the posters on the vans referred to inaccurate arrest statistics.It received 224 complaints about the vans from individuals, campaign groups, legal academics and the Labour peer Lord Lipsey.During the campaign, the advertising vans drove around the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Barnet, Brent, Ealing and Hounslow, some of the most diverse areas of the capital where it is thought a lot of illegal immigrants live and work.The poster displayed a picture of handcuffs and read: "In the UK illegally?... GO HOME OR FACE ARREST."ASA chief executive Guy Parker told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the campaign was considered unlikely to cause "widespread offence".But he said the phrase "go home" was "reminiscent of the racist slogan" and "clearly carries baggage".He added: "It clearly upset some people and I think it might be wise, if the government uses the poster van again, to perhaps think about using a different phrase - like return home."The campaign split the coalition, with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg saying Liberal Democrat ministers had not known about them in advance.Business Secretary Vince Cable said the campaign was "stupid and offensive".The advert said there had been 106 arrests in the area in the past week and encouraged illegal immigrants to contact immigration officials for information on how they could be helped to leave the country.In its ruling, the ASA said the reference to the number of arrests was misleading because it did not relate to those detained in the specific areas where people would have seen the vans.It said the figure referred to arrests which occurred across a large part of north London more than two weeks before the campaign began."The ad must not appear again in its current form," said the ASA report."We told the Home Office to ensure that in future they held adequate substantiation for their advertising claims and that qualifications were presented clearly."But it dismissed complaints that the slogan "Go home" had been offensive or irresponsible. It said that, while the phrase had been used in the past to attack immigrants, the Home Office was now using it in a different context.The report said: "We concluded that the poster was unlikely to incite or exacerbate racial hatred and tensions in multi-cultural communities."It was not irresponsible and did not contain anything which was likely to condone or encourage violence or anti-social behaviour."Ministers have not clarified if or when the ad vans will be used again and they have not published any data on whether the campaign led to an increase in illegal immigrants turning themselves in.However, a Home Office spokesman said: "We are pleased the ASA has concluded that our pilot was neither offensive nor irresponsible."We have always been clear that this campaign was about encouraging illegal immigrants to leave the country voluntarily and was not targeted at particular racial or ethnic groups."In respect of the ASA's other findings, we can confirm that the poster will not be used again in its current format."</body>

      <title>Extension sought for badger cull</title>
      <description>The original targets for culling badgers are changed as new, more accurate information on population numbers becomes available.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24443110</url>
      <date>1381299980</date>
      <body>A pilot badger cull in west Somerset may be extended by up to three weeks as marksmen have failed to kill enough badgers to reach their target.Sources at Defra say that 850 badgers have been shot in the area over the six-week trial, just over 40% of an initial target of 2,081.But those sources insist the Somerset scheme has proven to be effective.They say new population data means there are far fewer badgers in the pilot area than originally thought.The controversial pilot culls set out to study if badgers could be killed safely, effectively and humanely.It is being carried out in an attempt to control TB in cattle, which can be spread by badgers, though opponents say it will have no impact.The plan was to kill 70% of the badgers in the areas of west Somerset and Gloucestershire by free shooting.Across both regions this meant around 5,000 badgers were to be killed in total.But Defra sources said these targets were based on population estimates from 2012 that have proved to be highly inaccurate."We have high confidence that between 2012 and 2013, there has been a decline in the badger population in both areas," said a source.As the cull started, hundreds of hair traps were set so that DNA could be extracted and analysed to give a more up-to-date assessment of badger numbers.In west Somerset, the population, which had been estimated at 2,400, has now been revised downwards to 1,450. In Gloucestershire, the numbers have been lowered from 3,400 to 2,350.There are a number of reasons behind the apparent decline according to Defra, including the impact of last winter's bad weather, disease and lack of food.As a result, the targets for culling have also been revised downwards to around 2,600 for both areas combined.To kill 70% of the badgers now estimated to live in west Somerset, the culling company needed to kill 1,015 badgers.After six weeks of shooting, they achieved 59%, and the company is now seeking an extension of its licence for another two to three weeks.Peter Kendall, president of the National Farmers' Union, said the number of badgers to be killed had been reduced because it was important not to "wipe out" entire populations.He told BBC Breakfast the marksmen needed "a few more weeks" to "meet the best criteria that the scientists have set"."Last year 38,000 cattle were killed and we've got to do something about the spread of this ghastly disease," he added.Asked why the desired number of badgers had not been killed, especially given the lower total population now estimated, Mr Kendall said these were pilot schemes and those involved are "learning as we go".He said there had been some "protester activity" and all shooting had been stopped whenever a person has been "spotted in a vicinity", though he said the protesters were not the reason the target number had not been reached.Defra sources believe that even on the lower figures, the exercise has been effective."This level of culling is a significant culling of the badger population and sufficient to achieve cattle disease benefits at the start of a four-year... period," the source said.There was a "possibility" that the company carrying out the Gloucestershire cull will also seek an extension.Reports in recent days suggested that the exercise in west Somerset was in trouble, with a Conservative MP admitting it had not worked as well as hoped.</body>

      <title>Putin demands Dutch arrest apology</title>
      <description>Russian President Vladimir Putin demands an apology after Dutch police arrest a diplomat, but the Netherlands awaits the result of an investigation.</description>

      <date>1381265925</date>
      <body>Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded an apology after police in the Netherlands briefly detained a Russian diplomat for alleged domestic abuse.Moscow said Dmitri Borodin had been badly beaten in front of his children and Mr Putin said those involved should be punished.The Dutch foreign minister said the matter was still being investigated.Ties between the countries have been strained by the detention of Greenpeace activists in Russia last month.The Netherlands launched legal action last week to free the activists, who were charged with piracy after a protest on an Arctic oil rig owned by state-controlled firm Gazprom.The 30 people, two of them Dutch citizens, were arrested aboard the Dutch-flagged Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise.Mr Borodin, a minister counsellor at the Russian embassy, told Russian media earlier that the men who arrested him had said they were responding to an alert raised by neighbours that children were being maltreated in the flat.Speaking during a visit to Indonesia, Mr Putin told reporters: "This is the most gross breach of the Vienna Convention [on Diplomatic Relations]."We are waiting for explanations and apologies and also for those guilty to be punished. We will react depending on how the Dutch side behaves."The foreign ministry in Moscow said the diplomat's flat in The Hague had been stormed by "armed people in camouflage uniform" and Mr Borodin had been beaten "in front of his children, on the absolutely made-up excuse that he allegedly mistreated them".Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov complained that the diplomat had been held for several hours after somebody had alleged he had been abusing his son, aged two, and his four-year-old daughter."That this happened in The Hague, the seat of the international court of justice, is absolutely absurd," he said.Dutch Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans insisted no conclusions would be drawn before he had heard the results of an investigation into Saturday night's events."We're going to find out calmly exactly what happened. If there is a reason, then we will apologise," he told Dutch broadcaster NOS."Every country has its own style, and the Dutch style is to remain calm and investigate the affair," he added.Mr Borodin expressed indignation at his alleged rough treatment by Dutch police on his private Twitter account, insisting he loved his children.Thanking sympathisers for their messages of support on Tuesday, he said in a tweet he would not be commenting further as it was no longer a private matter.The Russian foreign ministry's twitter account bitterly criticised the Dutch "silence", saying that Moscow awaited a "real apology and effective measures against this provocation's masterminds".The incident comes at an awkward time for the two countries, ahead of a 9 November royal visit to Russia by King Willem Alexander.The trip, expected to include a meeting with President Putin, brings an end to a year of cultural, economic and business events marking their bilateral relations.</body>

      <title>Samsung launches curved-screen phone</title>
      <description>Samsung Electronics, the world's best-selling smartphone maker, launches a handset with a curved display screen.</description>

      <body>Samsung Electronics, the world's best-selling smartphone maker, has launched a handset with a curved display screen.Called the Galaxy Round, the smartphone will feature a 5.7in (14.5cm) display.The launch comes just days after rival LG said it would begin production of curved-screen phones next year.Digital display technology has been progressing towards curved screens. Both Samsung and LG already offer curved organic light-emitting diode (OLED) television sets.Samsung said the curved screen display would help consumers use some of the features on the phone, including those that enable users to check information such as date, time and missed calls when home screen is off, with more ease.At the same time, users can also change music tracks on their phone, even while its display is off.The Galaxy Round will initially be launched only in South Korea. The firm gave no indication of its plans for a global launch.The global smartphone market has been growing rapidly.According to research firm CCS Insight, worldwide smartphone sales will hit nearly one billion in 2013 - accounting for more than half the total of 1.7 billion mobile phones sold.As as result, smartphone manufacturers have been keen to offer new products to win consumers.With display technology moving towards flexible and bendy screens, it is one area that companies have been looking at.Some analysts said that while the initial offering of curved-screen phones may not see huge sales, the segment of flexible displays was one to keep an eye on."These phones may not be a game-changer today, but they are definitely an indication of things to come," Manoj Menon, managing director of consulting firm Frost and Sullivan, told the BBC."Flexible displays have a huge role to play as the market place for 'internet of things' grows."This refers to the idea that many things in homes or offices - not just typical computers - will soon be connected to the internet.The sector is tipped by many to be a major industry in the near future.Mr Menon said that as flexible screens became more advanced and cost-effective to make, it was likely to speed up growth in the sector.</body>

      <title>Strategy focuses on UK trees' future</title>
      <description>An official strategy is due to be unveiled that aims to protect the UK's broadleaved woodlands.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24447040</url>
      <date>1381287732</date>
      <body>An official strategy is due to be unveiled later that aims to protect the UK's broadleaved tree species.The strategy has been developed by Forest Research, part of the Forestry Commission, and two charities, the Earth Trust and Future Trees Trust.It will be launched by environment minister Lord De Mauley at an event in Westminster.It encourages people to choose seeds and saplings carefully to ensure that the trees which they plant do well.Broadleaved trees are those which have wide leaves rather than the needle-like leaves of conifers. They include ash, beech, birch, elm, holly, hornbeam, lime, oak and poplar.The document's authors say broadleaved woodlands have declined over the past 200 years, resulting in 95% of hardwood timber now having to be imported.The 16-page vision, called A Future With Broadleaved Trees, says the trees have a "very special place in our national psyche" but are "much more than just beautiful things".Co-author Dr Steve Lee from Forest Research - the scientific arm of the Forestry Commission - explained: "If they are good quality and grow well, they will lock up carbon for a long period of time. Also, you can make good quality products from the timber, which will last for a very long time."The act of planting a tree, and the cost of that tree, is probably going to be the same regardless of where you get it from," he told BBC News."So you could plant a maladapted tree, wait a long time and it does not grow very well. Yet you could invest the same amount of money in another tree, which grows very well and remains more resilient to any changes that come along in terms of climate, pests and diseases."What we are really saying that the effort is the same, so look around before you plant and think hard about what it is and why it is you are planting those trees."The strategy, which looks ahead to 2025, is centred around three core objectives:Earth Trust chief executive Jayne Manley explained: "Our much loved broadleaved trees could provide significant benefits to people and the environment as well as the rural economy."We need to focus on these trees rather than take them for granted and part of this is identifying and planting 'improved' trees which are productive, healthy and adaptable."Dr Lee added: "What you are really after is something that will remain well adapted on that site and will remain resilient to any environmental impacts that may occur over the 80-year or so rotation period."The suggestion is that the local material, which you might have planted in the past without really thinking about it, might not be the most resilient in the future."</body>

      <title>English people for England - Wilshere</title>
      <description>Midfielder Jack Wilshere says only "English people" should play for the national side as England monitor Adnan Januzaj.</description>

      <body>Only English people should play football for England, says midfielder Jack Wilshere.Manchester United's Adnan Januzaj could play for England if he passes Fifa's five-year residency requirement, as he is yet to commit to another country.Midfielder Januzaj, 18, is eligible for selection by Belgium, Serbia, Albania and Turkey.Asked about the issue, Wilshere said: "If you live in England for five years it doesn't make you English."The 21-year-old Arsenal player added: "If I went to Spain and lived there for five years, I'm not going to play for Spain."England boss Roy Hodgson has confirmed he has been monitoring Januzaj.Wilshere, who earlier this week insisted he is not a smoker despite being pictured with a cigarette outside a nightclub, added: "We have to remember what we are."We are English. We tackle hard, are tough on the pitch and are hard to beat."We have great characters. You think of Spain and you think technical but you think of England and you think they are brave and they tackle hard. We have to remember that."The only people who should play for England are English people."Liverpool's Raheem Sterling, born in Jamaica, and Wilfried Zaha of Manchester United, born in Ivory Coast, are part of the England Under-21 set-up along with West Brom's Saido Berahino, who left war-torn Burundi as a 10-year-old."It's a difficult one," said England Under-21 coach Gareth Southgate. "He [Januzaj] has not played for anyone else."We have lots of boys in our squad who were not born here, whose families have fled here."There are some wonderful stories and they are all incredibly proud to play for England."I'm torn with it. The world is changing. People move and work abroad. It is important to know why someone wants to play for you."Former Football Association chairman David Bernstein said England must "play within the rules and get the best team we can".He told BBC Radio 5 live: "There is much more fluidity in terms of population movement."I would say we must play within the rules but if players are eligible, I would be inclined to pick the best players we can get. Other countries do that."Cricketers Kevin Pietersen, Matt Prior and Jonathan Trott play for England despite being born in South Africa.Southgate added: "We seem to have embraced the cricket team that has won the Ashes, but it is a really interesting, philosophical debate."Januzaj, who joined United in 2011 from Belgian club Anderlecht for a reported fee of nearly £300,000, was born in Brussels.He has turned down the advances of Belgium, and has not won a cap at any level for any country.Januzaj qualifies for Albania through his Kosovan-Albanian parents, Turkey through his grandparents and Serbia as Kosovo's independence has not been recognised by the United Nations.Kosovo's national team are not members of Uefa or Fifa.Fifa, the sport's governing body, states a player is eligible if "he has lived continuously for at least five years after reaching the age of 18 on the territory of the relevant association".That would mean Januzaj would have to wait until 2018 to represent England, assuming he remains in the country until he turns 23.</body>

      <body>Sonny Bill Williams has been added to New Zealand's World Cup squad after belatedly making himself available.The 28-year-old dual-code star was not included in the 24-man party named on Monday because of "other commitments".However, coach Stephen Kearney confirmed second row Williams has now replaced 21-year-old Tohu Harris."I'm sorry for taking someone else's spot," Williams told BBC World. "Now that I'm there, don't expect anything other than a full-hearted performance."Williams started his career in league, but switched codes in 2008 and therefore missed out on a place in New Zealand's squad for that year's Rugby League World Cup, which his country went on to win.Despite helping the All Blacks win the 2011 Rugby Union World Cup, he said he could not turn down a chance to play in another major competition for his country."When I spoke to Stephen Kearney my body was sore and tired," said Williams, who helped the Sydney Roosters win the NRL Grand Final on Sunday, the day before the squad was announced."I've not had a rest since 2008 and thought I could go on a vacation with my family but I made a rash decision without thinking about it."Afterwards I thought what I would miss out on and remembered how bad I felt in 2008."I couldn't look at myself in the mirror so I had to make the phone call and say I was available."New Zealand are aiming to win the Rugby League World Cup for the second time and Williams has said sorry to Melbourne Storm's Harris, who will now miss out.Harris helped Storm beat Leeds Rhinos 18-14 to win the World Club Challenge in February and made his international debut two months later, in a 32-12 defeat against Australia.He has also rejected the chance to be a non-playing member of New Zealand's touring squad for the World Cup."I've offered my apologies to him and obviously he is hurting," added Williams, who has played seven rugby league internationals for New Zealand, but is yet to be on the winning team."It's just a really tough situation and all I can do now is play as hard as I can and help the boys retain the World Cup."The competition will be staged in England, Wales and France and Williams could play for New Zealand against the Cook Islands in a warm-up match at Doncaster's Keepmoat Stadium on Sunday, 20 October.New Zealand then face group games against Samoa on 27 October, France on 1 November and Papua New Guinea on 8 November.</body>

      <title>What is Gus Poyet really like?</title>
      <description>A wonderful human being or egocentric and selfish? Former colleagues offer differing views on the new Sunderland boss</description>

      <body>New Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet is a "wonderful human being", says the man who gave the former Uruguay international his first coaching job.Mark Devlin has good reason to be thankful as he remembers how the former Chelsea and Tottenham midfielder helped after he nearly died in a plane crash.Devlin was chief executive at Swindon Town in 2006 when the club recruited Dennis Wise as manager, with former Stamford Bridge team-mate Poyet his assistant, following relegation from League One.But after the first game of the season at Hartlepool, Devlin and his 10-year-old son Stan were travelling in a light aircraft  that ran out of fuel and plunged on to Denham golf course in Buckinghamshire."Dennis and Gus came to see us in hospital the next day. I had fractured vertebrae in my spine and Stan had broken both his legs," said Devlin, now chief executive at Brentford."Gus promised to my nipper that every time Swindon won, he would come in and see Stan."You get used to people in football not keeping their word but Swindon won their first six games, and without fail he came and spent time with Stan."He would stay for a fairly lengthy period of time, talk to friends and relatives, some of whom would recognise him as Spurs or Chelsea fans, and he had time for them all."But not everyone has as much time for Poyet, who was dismissed by Brighton for gross misconduct and described as "selfish and egocentric" by former Spain international Vicente.The midfielder, released by Brighton after 18 starts in two injury-hit seasons, claimed the manager reversed a decision to let him return to Spain the previous summer when his young daughter struggled to settle in England."He is the worst person I've come across in football," the 32-year-old told the Argus newspaper in May."For example, he deceived me when he said I could go and then he didn't let me. I was four months out injured and he wasn't capable of coming up and asking how I was."Vicente claimed Poyet, 45, teased players over mistakes in training, and made fun of him when he missed a shot.That depiction does not tally with Irish midfielder Gary Dicker's recollection of the Uruguayan at Brighton, however."I'm sure you will find more players that will say good than bad. He can have a laugh and a joke but he's serious when he needs to be serious," Dicker, now at Rochdale, told BBC Radio 5 live."If you're in any job or any walk of life, I don't think everyone is going to get on with the boss."While views on Poyet's style and personality may differ, there is no doubt he faces a daunting task at Sunderland, bottom of the table after a turbulent period under previous boss Paolo Di Canio.Like the Italian when he was appointed, Poyet has no Premier League managerial experience, but he has enjoyed a varied coaching career so far.After less than six months at Swindon, he followed Wise to Leeds under former Chelsea chairman Ken Bates before Spurs hired him to work under Juande Ramos in October 2007.Although Poyet won the League Cup with Ramos at Tottenham early in 2008, they were fired in October after a poor start to the following season.He joined Brighton in 2009, led the the south-coast club to the League One title two years later and then last season's Championship play-off semi-final, where they were beaten by eventual winners Crystal Palace.Succeeding Di Canio, Poyet will attempt to bring stability as the sixth permanent Black Cats manager in five years - although he has attracted controversy before."Everybody knew what Di Canio was about and there were a few eyebrows raised when he got the job. I think Gus is a little bit calmer," former Brighton and Sunderland striker Johnny Byrne told BBC Sussex."But he wasn't short of controversy when he was at Brighton. When the Luis Suarez affair blew up at Manchester United  [Poyet's fellow Uruguayan was banned for racially abusing Patrice Evra] he wasn't slow to put his point of view."It ended pretty acrimoniously with him being suspended with his backroom staff, and then fired. You could argue Sunderland have taken a slight gamble."He is an interesting character and if he does well they will idolise him."What Sunderland fans will hope for, and may get, is an immediate boost to morale."When he walked in at Brighton the first day, I think everyone got a lift straight away. When I was there, he was top drawer," said Dicker."He likes to play attractive football but both his assistants thrive on clean sheets so they won't be leaking many goals."Devlin said the appointment of Wise and Poyet also brought immediate improvement at Swindon."They transformed the players. The fitness levels and passion they created made Swindon a really good side," he said."It was impressive that some of the players who looked so down after relegation were so different in pre-season."Dennis was a quite fearsome character but very passionate about football and Gus was a little bit more laid back, but between them they got the best out of the players."After the plane crash, the Swindon players, under Wise and Poyet's leadership, organised some gifts - including a Game Boy - for Devlin's son in hospital.Eight years on, Stan is studying for his A-levels and wants to be a paramedic."My son is 18 now and he's a QPR supporter but he won't have a word said against Gus Poyet. We'll always be grateful to him," said Devlin.</body>

      <title>Hoddle set to join FA commission</title>
      <description>Ex-England boss Glenn Hoddle is set to be named on Greg Dyke's commission into the national team's future prospects.</description>

      <date>1381268144</date>
      <body>Former England boss Glenn Hoddle is set to return to the Football Association 14 years after being sacked.Hoddle, 55, will take up a role on the commission announced by FA chairman Greg Dyke as part of a bid to transform the fortunes of the national team.The pair have met twice in recent months and it is understood Dyke consulted Hoddle before his speech on the state of the English game.Hoddle is expected to be named on Dyke's FA commission on Wednesday.The former Chelsea manager will be just one of a number of key figures on the commission, which is also expected to include former players, FA board members, representatives from Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) and the League Managers' Association (LMA).It is understood further details will emerge during Dyke's speech at the Leaders in Football Conference at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.In September, Dyke said England should aim to reach the semi-finals of Euro 2020 and win the World Cup in 2022.England have not gone beyond a World Cup quarter-final since they reached the last four in 1990 and have only won it once - in 1966. Their best performances at the European Championship were semi-final appearances in 1968 and 1996.The commission will ask why England are in this situation, what can be done to improve their prospects and how any changes can best be implemented.In a lengthy speech, Dyke laid out a vision to address what he called the "frightening trend" of the reduction in the number of English players in the Premier League.In recent weeks, Hoddle has praised Dyke's analysis. Speaking to his website, Zapsportz.com,  the former England and Tottenham midfielder said he shared his concern at the growing number of foreign players in the Premier League."We've got foreign owners, who bring in foreign managers, who bring in foreign players above English players and it's a downward spiral," he said."The England manager's job is a hard job as it is and it's going to get harder and harder unless we readdress it with a rule change."Hoddle was appointed England manager in 1996 and oversaw 27 games, leading the national side to the last 16 of the World Cup in 1998 before being dismissed a year later following controversial comments about disabled people.</body>

      <title>Obama to nominate new Fed chief</title>
      <description>US President Barack Obama will nominate Federal Reserve vice-chair Janet Yellen to be the next head of the US central bank on Wednesday.</description>

      <date>1381303563</date>
      <body>US President Barack Obama will nominate Federal Reserve Vice-Chair Janet Yellen to be the next head of the US central bank on Wednesday, according to a White House official.If confirmed by the US Senate, Ms Yellen would replace Ben Bernanke, who has held the post for eight years.She has been his deputy for the last two years, and would become the first woman to head the Federal Reserve.Ms Yellen and Mr Bernanke are due to appear with the president on Wednesday.She has taught at Harvard University and the London School of Economics, as well as holding a series of senior administrative positions in the US.Ms Yellen, like Mr Bernanke, is seen as a "dove", meaning she prefers to prioritise boosting employment by keeping rates low rather than worrying about inflation.Her nomination has been widely expected after former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers withdrew his candidature.One senior US senator, Democrat Charles Schumer, said Ms Yellen had the backing of politicians and would win Senate confirmation "by a wide margin".The chairman of the US Senate Banking Committee, Tim Johnson, said she had "a depth of experience that is second to none"."I have no doubt she will be an excellent Federal Reserve chairman," he added.The BBC's chief business correspondent, Linda Yueh, says the transition from Mr Bernanke to Ms Yellen is likely to be "seamless" and will not have much impact, because the two already work so closely together."I don't think there's going to be a radical change," she said on Radio 4's Today programme, adding that the changeover was unlikely to alter the timing of the Fed's withdrawal of economic stimulus.Ms Yellen's most recent academic post was at the University of California, Berkeley. A former colleague of hers there, Laura Tyson, professor of business and economics, told the BBC her nomination was "terrific news"."We have an outstanding candidate who is a wonderful match of skills and experience and temperament and reputation around the world at a time when monetary policy is extremely important," she said."Continuity is important and Janet is an outstanding candidate."A former member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve, Prof Randy Kroszner, told the BBC that Ms Yellen was "battle tested" and would be driven by the data in deciding when to reduce support to the markets.On the US budget crisis, he added: "There isn't as much adult supervision in Washington as anyone in the world would like," but the process did help stop the US reaching Greek levels of indebtedness.</body>

      <title>UK reopens Iran diplomatic channels</title>
      <description>The UK will restore some diplomatic relations with Iran by appointing a charge d'affaires to work with the country, Foreign Secretary William Hague announces.</description>

      <body>The UK will restore some diplomatic relations with Iran by appointing a charge d'affaires to work with the country, William Hague has announced.But the foreign secretary warned the country's president to follow up his more "positive" words on its alleged nuclear weapons programme with "concrete actions".Mr Hague told MPs further progress would require "substantial change".Iran will appoint a charge d'affaires to work with London in return.Mr Hague said it was hoped this would help "on the way towards eventual re-opening of both our embassies".The UK shut its embassy in Tehran in November 2011 after it was attacked by protesters. It then ordered the closure of the Iranian embassy in London.Mr Hague said the recently elected government of President Hassan Rouhani had "presented themselves in a much more positive light than recent governments".But Iran was still in breach of six United Nations resolutions over its alleged development of nuclear weapons, he said, adding: "We must test the Iranian government's sincerity to the full."Mr Hague also said: "We are looking forward to serious proposals from Iran to follow up on their stated desire to make rapid progress on negotiations."It will be very important for Iran's relations with the international community for the marked change of presentation and statements to be accompanied by concrete actions and a viable approach to negotiations.He added: "In the absence of change to these policies, we will continue to maintain strong sanctions. A substantial change in British or western policies requires a substantive change in that programme."For Labour, shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander criticised the government for not moving more quickly to restore relations with Iran, saying it had "misjudged" the situation and risked being "left behind".He added: "On Iran, it is time for the government to catch up with our American allies."</body>

      <body>NHS and care services patients need to become more demanding and fight for their rights, a new watchdog body says.Healthwatch England, which heads up a network of 152 local patient bodies, urged the public to become "savvy consumers" rather than "grateful patients".To help, the watchdog set out eight core rights for patients.It comes after polling indicated half of people who experienced poor care did not report it.The survey of more than 2,000 people found one in five had experienced poor care - but of those, 54% had not complained.Healthwatch England was created under the shake-up of the NHS earlier this year.It is envisaged that the organisation will act as a patients' champion, carrying out its own investigations and speaking out about issues of concern.This is its first report to Parliament, and it has used it to highlight the deference shown by patients.Healthwatch England chairwoman Anna Bradley said: "We all need to stop acting like grateful patients and care users and start to see ourselves as savvy consumers, insisting on our right to safe, dignified and high quality care."To help achieve that, the organisation has set out its list of rights:Ms Bradley added: "Consumer rights are second nature to us on the High Street, but by thinking this way we can ensure people have a voice at the heart of the health and social care system."Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb said he welcomed the initiative."Without real and meaningful input from patients, it is impossible for health and care services to improve and move forward in the future," he added.</body>

      <title>University regulation 'inadequate'</title>
      <description>A lack of regulation of England's universities means students are at risk of attending failing institutions, the Higher Education Commission says.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24447151</url>
      <date>1381281659</date>
      <body>A lack of regulation of England's universities means students are at risk of attending failing institutions, the Higher Education Commission (HEC) says.The HEC says current checks are not adequate for a sector that has a new funding system in the wake of higher tuition fees introduced last year.It says the situation could threaten the UK's higher education reputation.The government says a "robust but proportionate" regulatory system is needed.The HEC - an independent body made up of leaders from the education sector, business and the three main political parties - conducted its research over an eight-month period and concludes that current regulation is too "piecemeal".The commission says that the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce), which distributes the teaching grant to universities, was previously able to attach regulatory conditions to the grant.But now that the teaching grant has been reduced and is being replaced with increased student tuition fees since 2012, the ability to regulate universities through Hefce has been reduced in turn.Its report - Regulating Higher Education - says all degree providers in England should be "captured" by proper regulation.It says: "It [higher education] is a valuable part of our national infrastructure and we must therefore ensure that students investing thousands of pounds in their futures are receiving top quality provision, and that the institutions they are attending are financially viable."The HEC study expresses particular concern about newly established higher education providers, saying "more providers are entering the market... and online providers gaining traction"."Regulation as it sits is not adequately prepared for the diversity of these current and future developments."New market entrants are not facing the scrutiny they should, takeovers and complex corporate structures are being used to evade fundamental protections for students, and institutions are facing more pressure than ever to recruit students and crucially, therefore, bring in funding."The report continues: "In this new, reformed higher education landscape, the chances of an institution failing are increased. An institution failing would damage both students and the highly-valued brand of UK higher education."The HEC calls on the government for urgent legislation to tackle the problems.It suggests an overarching regulatory body - the Council for Higher Education (CHE) - should be created, incorporating the current body Hefce, the Office for Fair Access (Offa), the Student Loans Company and a new body called the Office for Competition and Institutional Diversity.The commission also calls for better information about the various degree providers now operating in the UK and says all of these should be subject to a new regulatory framework, with kitemarks for those meeting approved standards.It also proposes an insurance scheme, paid into by every institution, to safeguard students should an institution or course fail.Professor of government at Hull University and HEC inquiry co-chairman Lord Norton of Louth said: "Regulation is fundamental to the health and success of our HE sector and will make or break the effectiveness of the institutions that have made the UK a world leader in higher education."In the context of current reforms, the absence of legislation to provide a coherent regulatory architecture for the rapidly changing and increasingly dynamic sector is creating major headaches for its players."It is a situation crying out for urgent rectification by government, a refrain that was a constant throughout the course of the inquiry from those who gave evidence."Fellow co-chairman and former vice chancellor of Lincoln University Prof Roger King said: "Our proposals seek to build upon the existing regulatory strengths displayed by the sector and to ensure that more external and formalised external regulatory arrangements work with these."Above all, however, we need to urgently address the outstanding requirement for a more systematic and less piecemeal approach to the external regulation of the sector. This can only be achieved by early legislation by government."A spokeswoman for the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills said: "It is essential that there is a robust but proportionate regulatory system in place to protect students and the reputation of the wider sector."At the same time though a balance must be struck to protect institutional autonomy and academic freedom. These elements are key to the success of our university system."When the time comes for legislation we want to get it absolutely right."Prof Les Ebdon, director of Offa, said: "I believe that fair access is too important to be rolled up within the wider concerns of a multi-focused regulatory body."An independent director, with a sole focus on access, can challenge institutions to set themselves stretching widening participation targets and ensure that fair access remains high on the agenda, both for institutions and policy-makers."</body>

      <title>BBC plans to help get UK coding</title>
      <description>The BBC will launch an initiative in 2015 to get coding more widespread in schools and homes.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24446046</url>
      <date>1381233705</date>
      <body>The BBC's director general, Tony Hall, has announced plans to "bring coding into every home, business and school in the UK".It comes 30 years on from a BBC push to make computing mainstream by putting BBC Micro computers in the majority of schools.In a speech to staff, Mr Hall said that the initiative would launch in 2015."We want to inspire a new generation to get creative with coding, programming and digital technology," he said.Government and technology experts are becoming increasingly worried that vital computing skills are no longer being taught in schools.Meanwhile interest in higher-education IT and computing courses is falling, giving rise to fears about a massive skills gap.This term a new computer science curriculum has been introduced to schools in England, and Education Minister Michael Gove has made it clear that he wants to see coding taught as a priority.Ralph Rivera, director of future media at the BBC, said: "The BBC has played a hugely important role in inspiring a generation of digital and technology leaders in the past, and now it's time to reignite that creativity.""We want to transform the nation's ability and attitude towards coding," he added.Details of the programme were limited, but the BBC said that it would partner with government, educators and technology companies."From working with children and young people, to stimulating a national conversation about digital creativity, the BBC will help audiences embrace technology and get creative," the corporation said in a blog post.A range of tools would be made available to give people "the skills to solve problems, tell stories and build new business in the digital world", it added.Experts appearing in a video to accompany the speech, agreed that action was needed.Martha Lane Fox, charged with getting more people online via her organisation Go on UK, said: "We are going to need a million more people who can work in the technology sector over the next 10 years. We don't have them. We've got to help to encourage people to go into that sector."Meanwhile, Eben Upton - founder of the Raspberry Pi budget computer project - said he looked forward to seeing how the scheme developed."A generation of UK developers got their start thanks to the original BBC Computer Literacy Project and the BBC Micro," he said."This initiative represents a welcome return to computing education from the organisation that was responsible for my interest in the subject."However, the comparison of the project to the BBC Micro raises potential controversy.The broadcaster's decision to partner with Acorn Computers three decades ago angered Sir Clive Sinclair as he prepared to launch a rival machine, the ZX Spectrum."They are marvellous at making programmes and so on, but by God they should not be making computers, any more than they should be making BBC cars or BBC toothpaste," he told Practical Computing magazine in 1982."They were able to get away with making computers because none of us had sufficient power or pull with the government to put over just what a damaging action that was. They had the unmitigated gall to think that they could set a standard - the BBC language. It is just sheer arrogance on their part."However, Apps for Good - an organisation which has helped students research, design and make software for three years - was not concerned by the new scheme."The BBC is entering a market where there's a number of players, but players who already work quite collaboratively," said Debbie Forster, the organisation's chief operating officer."Because there is such a big issue at stake and it is so important to so many different organisations what we are finding is that partnerships are formed more easily and more positively."Obviously the devil is in the detail in making it work - it always is - but it's a fascinating space and we look forward to hearing more and would be delighted for the BBC to join forces with everyone who is in here doing something."Learning Tree International - a firm which makes money from running programming training courses - was also unworried about the idea of the BBC becoming a competitor."From the point of view of getting people more inspired about IT and into that world, as such, it can only be a positive thing," said the firm's marketing director Christian Trounce.</body>

      <title>Higgs boson wins Nobel physics prize</title>
      <description>Peter Higgs and Francois Englert have won the Nobel prize in physics for their work on the theory of the Higgs boson, discovered at Cern in 2012.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24436781</url>
      <date>1381240861</date>
      <body>Two scientists have won the Nobel prize in physics for their work on the theory of the Higgs boson.Peter Higgs, from the UK, and Francois Englert from Belgium, share the prize.In the 1960s, they were among several physicists who proposed a mechanism to explain why the most basic building blocks of the Universe have mass.The mechanism predicts a particle - the Higgs boson - which was finally discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Cern, in Switzerland."This year's prize is about something small that makes all the difference," said Staffan Normark, permanent secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.Prof Higgs is renowned for shying away from the limelight, and he could not be located for interview in the immediate aftermath of the announcement."He's gone on holiday without a phone," his Edinburgh University physics colleague Alan Walker told the BBC, adding that Higgs had also been unwell."He is taking a break from all of this, taking some time to relax, because he knows when he comes back he'll have to face up to a media storm."But the university released a prepared statement from Higgs, 84, who is an emeritus professor of theoretical physics:"I am overwhelmed to receive this award and thank the Royal Swedish Academy," he said."I would also like to congratulate all those who have contributed to the discovery of this new particle and to thank my family, friends and colleagues for their support."I hope this recognition of fundamental science will help raise awareness of the value of blue-sky research."Francois Englert, 80, said he was "very happy" to win the award, speaking at the ceremony via phone link."At first I thought I didn't have [the prize] because I didn't see the announcement," he told the committee, after their news conference was delayed by more than an hour.Higgs was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, but it was in Edinburgh in 1964 that he had his big idea - an explanation of why the matter in the Universe has substance, or mass.His theory involved a missing particle in the Standard Model of physics, which has come to be known as the Higgs boson.Within weeks, Francois Englert had independently published his own, similar theory, alongside his now deceased colleague Robert Brout.Three other physicists - Gerald Guralnik, Tom Kibble and Carl Hagen - also made key contributions to the theory, and spoke at the announcement of the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012.Hagen has long argued for the name of the particle to be changed, protesting at the "rock star" status in which Higgs is held.And Higgs, too, has expressed his discomfort with the attention he has received, preferring to call the particle "the scalar boson".In a statement on Tuesday, Kibble, of Imperial College London, said he was "glad" the Nobel prize had gone to the work of Higgs and Englert."My two collaborators, Gerald Guralnik and Carl Hagen, and I contributed to that discovery, but our paper was unquestionably the last of the three to be published."It is therefore no surprise that the Swedish Academy felt unable to include us, constrained as they are by a self-imposed rule that the prize cannot be shared by more than three people."My sincere congratulations go to the two prize winners, Francois Englert and Peter Higgs."And the renowned physicist Prof Stephen Hawking added his praise: "In the early 60s, theorists were struggling to understand why particles have mass. Peter Higgs and Francois Englert proposed a mechanism called symmetry breaking. This mechanism also predicted a massive particle, the Higgs boson. The discovery last year at Cern of a particle with the correct properties confirms this prediction and is a triumph for theory."Proving the theory correct took almost half a century and involved creating the biggest and most sophisticated machine humankind has ever built.The LHC at Cern lies in a circular tunnel 27km (17 miles) round. It is so big it is partly in Switzerland, partly in France. It took 10 years and thousands of scientists and engineers to build it.Cern director general Rolf Heuer said he was "thrilled" that this year's prize had gone to particle physics."The discovery of the Higgs boson at Cern... marks the culmination of decades of intellectual effort by many people around the world," he commented.The Nobel prizes - which also cover chemistry, medicine, literature, peace and economics - are valued at 8m Swedish krona (£775,000; $1.2m). Laureates also receive a medal and a diploma.The official citation for Englert and Higgs read: "For the theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles, and which recently was confirmed through the discovery of the predicted fundamental particle, by the Atlas and CMS experiments at Cern's Large Hadron Collider".David Willetts, UK minister for universities and science, said the award was "an incredible endorsement of the quality of UK science".Prime Minister David Cameron said: "This brilliant achievement is richly deserved recognition of Peter Higgs' lifetime of dedicated research and his passion for science."It is also a credit to the world-leading British universities in which this research was carried out."It took nearly 50 years and thousands of great minds to discover the Higgs boson after Prof Higgs proposed it, and he and all those people should be extremely proud."</body>

      <body>Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes has defended a controversial storyline in the latest episode of the costume drama, which drew dozens of complaints.ITV received 60 complaints after Anna May Bates (Joanne Froggatt) was attacked and raped by a guest's valet."The whole point of the way we do things on Downton is we don't do them gratuitously," Fellowes told the BBC."We are interested in exploring the resultant emotions and the effect these things have on people," he added.Fans took to Twitter on Sunday to express their "shock" and "distress" at the "sick" and "sensationalist" storyline.But Fellowes, who won an Oscar for the screenplay of Gosford Park in 2002, rejected the criticism, saying he was "sorry" if fans felt the show couldn't "go there".He pointed out the attack took place behind closed doors, saying: "If we'd wanted a sensational rape we could have stayed down in the kitchen with the camera during the whole thing and wrung it out."The point of our handling is not that we're interested in sensationalising but we're interested in exploring the mental damage and the emotional damage," he said.Froggatt also defended the scenes, telling BBC Breakfast she was "proud" that the show could tackle such a weighty subject."I think it's a really brave thing to do... I believe that Julian has written it in a way that is not gratuitous at all," she said."We all felt a big responsibility to get it right."Fellowes said the plot development did not signal a new direction for the drama, which is now in its fourth series."Downton deals in subjecting a couple of characters per series to a very difficult situation and you get the emotions that come out of these traumas."When you handle very difficult and sensitive story lines, the minus is that they do expect more work from the audience but the plus is they can take you to a helpful place in terms of self analysis," he said."The fact that [viewers] engage with it is sort of what you pray for as a programme maker, because with most series that's not happening."It's always a compliment that everyone gets so involved in the show," he added.An average of 9.2 million viewers watched Sunday night's episode, with a peak audience of 9.9 million.A warning alerting viewers to the upsetting scenes involving Mrs Bates and Lord Gillingham's valet Mr Green was broadcast before the episode aired.ITV said on Monday it had received 60 complaints, while broadcasting watchdog Ofcom also received a number of complaints - although it cannot yet release figures."All of this is about taking characters to the brink," explained Fellowes."We know Anna is a strong personality but it doesn't mean she will be able to be strong through this."The whole rest of the series, for her story and for Bates' story, is seeing how she negotiates her way through this. I don't think we ever have a sense that she leaves it behind," he said.Froggatt said later episodes would "explore the emotional journey of Anna and Bates after this event", adding that Fellowes had "done a beautiful job at hitting the right note with it".She said that the writer was "adamant" that they would not depict "that kind of violence against a woman" on screen, adding: "That's something he didn't want in a show of his, and that's an incredible thing in this industry in this day and age."She said the show still had "shock value" without "anything graphic" being shown.The actress explained that the series' historical advisor, Alastair Bruce, had told her that 100 years ago, when the story was set, women felt unable to tell the police about sexual assaults."There was still such a stigma attached to any kind of attack like this that you were very much in danger of losing all of that," she said."And if a woman lost her reputation that would bring shame upon the house, she could lose her job, she could lose her husband. And society still saw it as no smoke without fire, 'well he's only a man - he couldn't help himself.'"Nigel Harman, who played Anna's attacker, previously told ITV's This Morning he was "amazed" by the storyline, "because for a show like Downton it really leaped out as a bold and risky idea".The drama has not been afraid to shock viewers in the past, with the unexpected death of key character Matthew Crawley bringing last year's Christmas episode to a sombre conclusion.</body>

      <title>Is the British weather unique in the world?</title>
      <description>It's often said the British weather is unique, but is it really different from everywhere else?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24305230</url>
      <date>1381198849</date>
      <body>It's often said by laymen that the UK's weather is unique. But what makes it so different from anywhere else?Whatever you think of the British weather, if you don't like it one day there's always a good chance you might like it the next.Weather, in meteorological terms, refers to the daily elements like temperature, wind and rain. And in Britain they can all change hour by hour and day by day.It's this diversity and changeability that makes British weather so distinct, say meteorologists. While temperatures are fairly mild and there are four distinct seasons, you can also get warm weather in the middle of February and freezing rain in the middle of August - or both in one day."Other countries might have more dramatic weather," says Dr Liz Bentley, head of the Weather Club at the Royal Meteorological Society. "In India and Pakistan you get monsoon season, but you can usually predict the day it will start and the day it will finish."In the UK you sometimes have to look at the weather forecast several times in one morning just to plan a trip out that afternoon. Things can change that quickly."Many meteorologists call the British weather unique, although some say you could argue the weather in all countries is unique because no two are the same geographically and geologically. But they agree it is hard to find another country in the world with weather that compares to the UK.So what makes it so distinctly variable?"Britain's unique weather is all down to the fact it is an island and where it's positioned on the planet, between the Atlantic Ocean and a large land mass, continental Europe," says Helen Chivers from the Met Office. "There is a lot going on meteorologically where we are."Britain is under an area where five main air masses meet. An air mass is a large body of air that has similar temperature and moisture properties throughout.In the UK they are either polar or tropical, depending on where the air mass originated; they are also divided into maritime or continental, depending on whether the air has passed over land or sea.They come from all directions and can bring all types of weather.When they meet it creates a weather front. The air masses fight it out and the one that wins dictates the weather. The bigger the difference the worse the weather can be. There is a sixth air mass, the returning Polar Maritime, which is a variation of the Polar Maritime.One more important thing to throw into the mix is the jet stream. It is a high-altitude ribbon of fast-moving air that is associated with weather systems in the UK. The position of the jet stream can make a huge difference to the type of weather we experience.All in all, it's quite an extraordinary mix of atmospheric conditions battling it out."It's what makes the British weather so fascinating," says Bentley. "Experiencing such big changes so quickly is unique."Fascinating or frustrating, the layman might argue, but no other country in the world gets the same weather, say experts."Japan is probably the only other place that has similarities to the UK when it comes to weather," says Chivers."It is similar to us but in reverse. It is an island and has the Pacific Ocean to the east and Eurasian continent to the west. Britain's variations in weather really are that rare."These variations pose problems, from when to have a barbecue to effective planning for businesses. Companies spend millions trying not to be caught out by the British weather."From energy companies, supermarkets and insurance firms to banks, technology companies and local authorities, they all need to plan for the weather," says Richard Tipper, director of Ecometrica, which works with companies to get the climate and weather data they need to plan efficiently."It's the amazing changeability in British weather that is unique. It also means planning for it isn't always easy."Subtle changes in the weather are happening and will continue, says Bentley."We are starting to see more record-breaking weather, record droughts and record rainfall," she says.Last year is a good example. The dramatic switch from drought in early 2012 to the wettest April to June on record was of a magnitude never seen before, according to the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH).Hosepipe bans were brought in early in the year but by early autumn levels of groundwater were "well above" average.But the country's fascination with the weather probably won't change. Nor will some people's love for it."There is a real beauty about the weather in the UK," says Bentley."You might be guaranteed sun in other countries but constant sunshine can get dull. People move to other countries but often they end up missing the British weather and the seasons."There are also some real upsides. When we get unexpected sunshine in the UK everyone's day is better. It just feels like we are getting a special treat and we are so much happier."The Great British Year is on BBC One at 21:00 BST on Wednesday 9 October or catch up with iPlayer.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>What's behind the idea of banning 10-packs of cigarettes?</title>
      <description>Euro MPs have voted to ban the sale of packs of 10 cigarettes as part of a general tightening of the law. Why?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24441618</url>
      <date>1381251231</date>
      <body>Euro MPs have voted to ban the sale of packs of 10 cigarettes as part of a general tightening of the law. Why?Public health campaigners are now focusing some of their effort on trying to reduce the number of young people taking up smoking.In the UK, cigarettes are commonly sold in shops in either packs of 10 or 20. But in much of the rest of the EU the smaller pack size is banned.Fourteen EU states already have 20 as the minimum, four stipulate a minimum of 19, and in the UK and Italy the minimum is 10. Now, if the draft directive passes its final stages 10-packs will be illegal across the EU.The health campaigners describe packets of 10 as "kiddy packs" because they argue they are more affordable out of pocket money. Official figures estimate that 4% of children in England between the ages of 11-15 years old are smoking at least once a week."The thing we know about the pricing of cigarettes is that if the price is kept high through taxation that that works as a measure to help smokers to quit and also as a deterrent to young people," says Amanda Sandford research manager at Action on Smoking and Health (ASH)."If the minimum size of pack people can buy is 20 they are going to have to fork out at least £6 and £8 for a premium brand."The Republic of Ireland changed the law to make the minimum pack size 20 in 2007. Research in the run-up to the ban had suggested three-quarters of young people who smoked bought 10-packs.The number of smokers in the 10-17-year-old age group fell from 21.2% in 1998 to 18.6% in 2002, 15.3% in 2006 and 12% in 2010.But the 10-pack ban was just one of a catalogue of anti-smoking measures including a ban on in-store display and advertising, restrictions on self-service vending machines. Enhanced warnings on packets and higher prices came later.Campaign group Forest, which describes itself as "the voice and friend of the smoker", says around two million people in the UK buy their cigarettes in packs of 10, because that's what they can afford, or they want to cut down. It argues that forcing people to buy bigger packets of 20 won't help reduce smoking.But campaigners argue that tobacco displays have used 10-packs prominently to make cigarettes seem cheaper, thereby drawing in younger smokers. A number of brands in the UK also sell 14-packs which again have been attacked by campaigners."Newsagents were stopped from selling single cigarettes many years ago by law because they are accessible to children," says Sandford. "A 10-pack is within the pocket money range."There is an argument that someone cutting down might be helped by the availability of smaller packs, but Sandford argues that smaller packs also provide an easier route for a lapsing person to return to smoking.Reporting by Branwen Jeffreys and Finlo Rohrer.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Dying man told to take Gaviscon</title>
      <description>A man died after NHS 24 staff failed to spot he was suffering from blood poisoning - and told him to take heartburn remedy Gaviscon.</description>

      <body>A man died after NHS 24 staff failed to spot he was suffering from blood poisoning - and told him to take heartburn remedy Gaviscon.John Willock, 43, made a series of calls to the NHS telephone helpline after becoming ill after falling on ice on Christmas Eve 2009.A sheriff's report into his death found a "number of concerns and shortcomings" in the handling of Mr Willock's case.NHS 24 said it had made several improvements since the case.Mr Willock, a father of two from Erskine in Renfrewshire, had been delivering presents when he fell.He had hurt his knee, was "fluish", cold, shivery and feeling sick - but hid his vomiting and diarrhoea symptoms from his partner and family until Boxing Day because he did not want to spoil their Christmas.With doctors' surgeries closed over the festive period, he made a series of calls to NHS 24.In one recording played to the fatal accident inquiry into his death, training engineer Mr Willock pleaded: "Is there anything anyone could suggest or is there anything I can get for it? I cannot move. I am bed-ridden because of the diarrhoea."When Mr Willock rang for a second time the day before he died, call handler Ann McDermid failed to pass on to a nurse that he had called before.In his report, Sheriff Colin Pettigrew said the cause of Mr Willock's death had been septicaemia, although the source of the infection was uncertain.Sheriff Pettigrew said Ms McDermid had been guilty of "numerous failings."A recorded telephone conversation showed she said to the nurse: "The patient's got burnin' sensation" and "he's got a burning sensation in his chest for about 10 hours" and "an aw the other symptoms, OK?"Nurse Fiona McCulloch, who took over the call, ticked the wrong boxes on her computer diagnostic screen.If she had ticked the one marked "persistent abdominal upper abdominal discomfort" an emergency ambulance would have been sent for Mr Willock.She told him to take Gaviscon and cold milk, later admitting that this was inappropriate for someone suffering from sickness and diarrhoea.Another NHS 24 call handler, Carolyn Fergie, admitted at the inquiry she was "tired" when she took Mr Willock's third call to the helpline.She confessed to being "abrupt", rushing the call and failing to listen to what Mr Willock was telling her.She failed to record on the system that Mr Willock was a "return caller" and that his condition was "serious and urgent".As a result, nurse Pamela Scally treated it as a first call and advised Mr Willock to contact his GP practice within 36 hours.His condition deteriorated on 29 December - without ever having been admitted to hospital - and he died at home at tea-time that night after his partner Carolann Rogers dialled 999.Sheriff Pettigrew's report included the view of a leading infectious diseases expert, who said he believed Mr Willock had a survival chance of between 60% and 85% if he had been seen in hospital on 27 December, the day after he had admitted he was ill.He was visited at home on the day he died by his own GP, Dr Murray Macpherson, who decided the patient was not ill enough for hospital.However, Sheriff Pettigrew said he could find no "reasonable precautions" that may have prevented Mr Willock's death.He said: "There was insufficient evidence led before me to conclude that, even if a GP had visited Mr Willock (prior to the visit of Dr Macpherson) and given him an anti-emetic injection and arranged his admission to hospital, there was a 'real and lively possibility' that... would in any event have made a difference."I find that the correction of the numerous failings of the call handlers and nurse advisors... do not constitute 'reasonable precautions' whereby Mr Willock's death may have been avoided."A spokesman for Mr Willock's family said: "John was loved by his family and is greatly missed. Although the family is disappointed the sheriff did not make specific findings regarding the GPs, the sheriff's findings support the family view that there were significant failings on the part of the call handlers and nurse advisers involved in John's care."While there has been evidence of improvements since John's death, the family hope that NHS 24 further review their practices as suggested by the sheriff so that lessons are learned."NHS 24 medical director Prof George Crooks said: "NHS 24 would like to offer sincere condolences to the family of Mr Willock for their loss."Patient safety is always the guiding principle in the care and advice given by NHS 24 and we have made several improvements to our systems and processes since this case in 2009 in order to further safeguard patients and ensure they receive the most appropriate care."Following this case and the investigations which were carried out into NHS 24's role, all staff involved at that time have been subject to robust review of their practice and appropriate training and support was put in place."These learnings have also been shared across our frontline staff as part of ongoing continuous improvement of their practice."NHS 24 continues to work with our partners to ensure that people in Scotland have access to safe, effective, and appropriate services during the out of hours period."</body>

      <title>Prestwick Airport 'can make profits'</title>
      <description>Prestwick Airport, which is on the brink of being brought into public ownership, can be profitable if the right approach is taken, the deputy first minister says.</description>

      <body>Prestwick Airport can be profitable if the right approach is taken, the deputy first minister has said.The Scottish government announced at Holyrood on Tuesday it was negotiating to buy the airport.The Ayrshire facility, which was put up for sale last March by New Zealand-based owners Infratil, has been running annual losses of £2m.Nicola Sturgeon said she believed that "over time" Prestwick could go "back to profit".A six-weeks timetable of detailed negotiations has now begun with Infratil.Ms Sturgeon told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "We are embarking on commercial negotiations with the current owners of the airport so thing like purchase price for the airport will require to be resolved in terms of he negotiation."The minister defended the government's decision to step in to buy the airport, saying it was the "only realistic alternative to closure".She explained that, once the airport was in public ownership, there would be a detailed business case made which would include levels of investment and a timescale on turning around its fortunes.Ms Sturgeon added: "With the right financial investment, with the right commercial management, the right marketing over a period of time, Prestwick can be brought back into profit."The Scottish government's bid to buy Prestwick comes just months after struggling Cardiff Airport was sold to the Welsh government for £52m.Although publicly owned, Cardiff Airport is being by an "at arm's length" body rather than by the government, and "on a commercial basis".In a ministerial statement to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said the closure of Prestwick would be a "serious and unwelcome development" for the Ayrshire and the Scottish economies, with about 1,400 jobs linked directly or indirectly with the airport.Infratil has agreed to ensure the airport is kept fully open and operational while the negotiation process involving the government is ongoing.The only scheduled passenger airline at Prestwick, Ryanair, welcomed the likely government takeover.</body>

      <body>A £2m extension to the Museum of Free Derry is at risk because Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster has not signed off on a £1.2m tourist board grant, the Bloody Sunday Trust has warned.Plans for the museum in the Bogside could fall through, trust chair Conal McFeely said."It means the project is dead in the water if we cannot get them to release the letter of offer for £1.2m."The Department for Enterprise said the project was still being considered.The trust, which runs the museum, says it already has funding agreed in principle from the Department of Social Development and the Heritage Lottery fund - but it all hinges on Ms Foster agreeing to release the tourist board money.In a letter to Sinn Féin MLA Maeve McLaughlin dated 26 February this year, the chief executive of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board (NITB) said it was "only awaiting ministerial approval to proceed and issue a letter of offer for approximately £1.2m for phase two of the museum".However, Mr McFeely said that eight months later, they were still waiting. On 31 October, a £500,000 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund will expire.He said the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) money had been approved and that the Department of Social Development was offering £300,000 in funds. But everything rested on the NITB grant and minister's letter of approval."Now it is critical," he said."If we do not get the minister to sign off, the project is dead. The entire package is dependent on the main funder coming through. Over eight months we have attempted to do this properly without going public."We feel we are now in a critical phase and the project is not going to proceed due to the failure to get the letter from the NITB."The Bloody Sunday families are asking, 'is the minister opposed to this politically?'"The trust wants to meet Ms Foster to establish why the grant has not yet been approved.In a statement, a spokeswoman for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Industry said: "As the project promoters have already been advised, the project is currently being considered."All projects are assessed as part of the approvals process and it is not appropriate to indicate where in the approvals process any projects sits."The Heritage Lottery Fund has confirmed it had awarded a £500,000 grant that is due to expire on 31 October 2013. It said the HLF remained "hopeful" that a positive decision could be reached over funding in time to stop the grant being lost.</body>

      <title>£600m in major projects unveiled</title>

      <body>More than £600m is to be handed out towards major projects in a bid to stimulate the economy in Wales.It includes £62m for the South Wales Metro transport project and £140m for a help-to-buy housing scheme.Finance Minister Jane Hutt says it will create or sustain 11,000 jobs and tackle poverty.The announcement comes a day after she unveiled big cuts for councils and in other areas to pay for a £570m increase in the health budget.One senior council figure warned some local authorities could "go bust".Ms Hutt announced a series of capital spending commitments, including:Ms Hutt said: "The tough economic conditions continue but I am determined to use every pound available to invest in infrastructure and boost economic growth in the long-term."Councils were still reeling from Tuesday's funding announcement by Ms Hutt and the likely knock-on on services such as leisure centres and libraries.Local government spending will fall from £4.648bn this year to £4.466bn next year, a cut in cash terms of 3.91% or 5.81% in real terms.Their budgets will be around 9% lower in real terms between now and 2015-16.Councillor Russell Goodway, cabinet member for finance on Cardiff council - Wales' largest local authority - said: "I think there will be some local authorities in Wales that will go bust in the next two or three years. They will run out of money."From where I am sitting we are in a very dark place this morning and I don't think that some local authorities are going to survive."He told BBC Radio Wales that Cardiff has to save £20m this year which it was struggling to achieve let alone the £50m in cuts it needs to find in 2014-15."Even if we stopped spending every single penny that we spend on discretionary services that would not be enough to cut our spending. We have got to find different ways of doing things."Steve Thomas, chief executive of the Welsh Local Government Association said the cuts will affect services."It's a very tough budget and it's £175m coming out of council services," he told BBC Wales."We can't keep delivering the range of services that we're currently delivering so it will impact on things such as leisure services, libraries, refuse collections and the conditions of our roads."We run something like 735 services so there's going to be a massive impact for the Welsh public."He added: "We're not the number one priority and clearly what has happened is with the mixture of Westminster cuts and the prioritisation of health spending, local government has become in effect the poor relation in terms of this budget."Mr Thomas said one way of making up the shortfall would be to raise council tax - he did not expect any councils to freeze their rates next year."We've yet to see the local government settlement but once we see it, I think there will be more pressure on the council tax," he said."It is a source of income but I think we've got to consult the public and see what services they want to prioritise."We've got three years to make these cuts and it's going to be a very tough period for local authorities to do that."In announcing her draft budget, Ms Hutt said it was not possible to "shield" all services from UK government spending cuts.She stressed the priority was to protect health, schools and universal benefits such as free prescriptions, school breakfasts and bus passes for older people.</body>

      <body>Almost 50% more children are taking part in sport and physical activity regularly than two years ago, says a new study.Sport Wales' School Sport Survey also suggested boys were still more likely than girls to regularly join in sport.The body spoke to 110,000 pupils from nearly 1,000 schools across Wales.The number of children taking part in physical activity three times a week or more rose from 27% in 2011 to 40% in 2013.Sport Wales is responsible for increasing participation and improving performance in sport in Wales.Sport Wales chair Professor Laura McAllister said the figures showed sport and education were working together, and described the survey results as "encouraging".She added: "They also help us understand how to encourage tomorrow's generation to participate more in sport and physical activity."But there are still challenges ahead and we need to build upon the success that we are creating uniquely in Wales."We risk losing the enormous gains made if we do not listen to the voice of our children."At a time of public austerity it is not a question of more money. It is about investing in our children's future through the health, education and sports sectors working better together to give our children the best start in life."Earlier this year, a group led by Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson called for PE to be given the same status as maths and English.The Welsh government said it would consider the recommendation.Pembrokeshire badminton player Jordan Hart agreed that sport played a crucial part in her life.She competed in the School Games 2012, and now the 18-year-old is bidding to qualify for next year's Commonwealth Games."I don't know really what I would have done if I hadn't chosen to do sport," said Ms Hart, who is now studying a sports degree at Loughborough University."Personally, I think everybody should be involved in some sort of sport."It's a major factor in people's lives and it has definitely improved my life. I think it is definitely a positive."The results of the survey will give local authorities, education services and health boards detailed information to help boost the number of young people participating in sport and physical activity.Sarah Powell, chief executive of Sport Wales, said the survey showed its efforts had made a difference."The work in primary and secondary schools funded by Sport Wales over the last 10 years, with after-school clubs and the wider sports community, has opened up opportunities for every child to try out a wider variety of sports and physical activities."These have been delivered in an enjoyable and fun environment, building children's confidence and interest to do more."The School Sport Survey results build on other evidence suggesting an increase in participation since the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games - for instance sports club membership in Wales passed the 500,000 mark for the first time ever and there has been a big rise in disability sport opportunities."Although London 2012 was a point of inspiration, we need to sustain growth in sports participation through better understanding of young people and by delivering services they want."</body>

      <title>EU chief heckled on Lampedusa visit</title>
      <description>People on Lampedusa - scene of a tragic migrant shipwreck - heckle the European Commission president and Italian PM on a visit to the island.</description>

      <body>Italy's prime minister and the European Commission president have been heckled on a visit to the island of Lampedusa.Enrico Letta and Jose Manuel Barroso are on the island following one of Italy's worst migrant boat disasters. At least 274 people died when their boat capsized and sank last week.Residents shouted "disgrace" and "shame" as the men began their visit.Lampedusa is a key destination for boats carrying migrants who want to leave Africa and head to Europe.Many residents in Lampedusa have long complained that the authorities in Italy and the European Union have not been doing enough to deal with the thousands of migrants who come ashore each year.A boat carrying 500 migrants - most from Eritrea and Somalia - capsized last Thursday about 1km (half a mile) from Lampedusa.There were 155 survivors, and 274 bodies have been found. Divers are still searching for those who remain missing.A small group of activists and local residents gathered at the airport as Mr Letta and Mr Barroso arrived in Lampedusa.They shouted "shame", "disgrace" and "killers" as the men walked from their plane."They should be ashamed of themselves. They should solve this humanitarian problem," one protester was quoted by Agence France-Presse news agency as saying.Mr Barroso and Mr Letta are paying tribute to the victims of the shipwreck and meeting members of the emergency services, as well as refugees from Somalia, Eritrea and Syria.They are joined by the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Cecilia Malmstroem, who said on Tuesday she had called for the EU to launch Mediterranean-wide search and rescue patrols to intercept migrant boats.She said she planned to ask the EU's Frontex border agency to draw up a "concrete proposal" for an operation that would allow better tracking, identification and rescue of migrant boats.Frontex currently helps Italy to intercept migrant boats, but the two EU operations in the southern Mediterranean have limited resources - a total of four ships, two helicopters and two planes.</body>

      <title>Libyan PM calls for Western help</title>
      <description>Libya's prime minister says illegal weapons passing through Libya pose a threat to the entire region and calls for international help to combat it.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24451180</url>
      <date>1381272153</date>
      <body>Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan has called on Western powers to help stop the spread of militancy in his country.In an interview with BBC Newsnight he said Libya was being used as a base to export weapons throughout the region."The movement of these weapons endangers neighbouring countries too, so there must be international co-operation to stop it," Mr Zeidan said.On Monday Libya questioned the US ambassador over the capture of a suspected al-Qaeda leader in Tripoli.Anas al-Liby, wanted over the 1998 bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, was seized by US commandos in an early morning raid on Saturday.The US has defended the capture saying that Mr Liby - whose real name is Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai - was "a legal and an appropriate target".But Libya's national congress on Tuesday demanded his return, calling his capture a kidnapping that amounted to a "flagrant violation of the country's national sovereignty".President Barack Obama told reporters on Tuesday that the US had strong evidence that he had "planned and helped execute plots that killed hundreds of people - a whole lot of Americans"."He will be brought to justice," he said.Mr Liby is believed to have been one of the masterminds behind the 1998 US embassy attacks, which killed more than 220 people in Kenya and Tanzania.The 49-year-old has been indicted in a New York court in connection with the attacks and has been on the FBI's most wanted list for more than a decade with a $5m (£3.1m) bounty on his head.He was living openly in the Libyan capital Tripoli before his capture. BBC Newsnight reporter Tim Whewell says that this and the brazenness of the US operation are further signs of the current weakness of the Libyan state.Libyan Justice Minister Salah al-Marghani, who on Monday summoned US ambassador Deborah Jones over Mr Liby's capture, said the US-led operation had caught Libya's leaders off-guard."The news itself was definitely a surprise to me," he told reporters. "And having seen the prime minister on the same night, I haven't seen anyone more surprised than Ali Zeidan about what happened."On Sunday, the prime minister's office said he had asked the US for clarification on the raid and stressed Libya was "keen on prosecuting any Libyan citizen inside Libya".However, Mr Zeidan has said that ties between the Libya and the US will not be affected by the operation.There has been little visible co-operation between the US and Libya since the terror attack on the US consulate in Benghazi last year, in which the ambassador Chris Stephens was killed, our reporter says.Speaking to BBC Newsnight before the capture of Mr Liby, Mr Zeidan said that the huge proliferation of weapons in Libya poses a serious security threat."Weapons are being smuggled out of and into Libya by groups which are trying to murder and assassinate people, and spread terror in the country," he said."You see every day the militants fight each other, the issue is that the arms are available for the Libyan citizens, they are available for the young people, it is available at homes and in stores everywhere."Proliferation is not just a concern for Libya but for its neighbours too.Western intelligence agencies believe Libya now has the largest unsecured stockpile of weapons in the world, with millions of tons of arms unaccounted for since the 2011 revolution that toppled Muammar Gaddafi.They include 3,000-8,000 so-called Manpads - Man Portable Air Defence Systems - portable missile systems which are a threat to all types of aircraft, including civilian passenger planes.These surface-to-air missiles, which are easy to use and easy to hide, are the weapon of choice for groups like al-Qaeda, say security experts.</body>

      <title>China court to allow Bo Xilai appeal</title>
      <description>A Chinese court agrees to consider an appeal by disgraced politician Bo Xilai, jailed for life last month on charges of bribery and abuse of power.</description>

      <date>1381311099</date>
      <body>A Chinese court says it has agreed to consider an appeal by disgraced top politician Bo Xilai.The former Chongqing party leader was convicted of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power last month and jailed for life.At his trial, he denied all the charges in a fiery defence.Bo Xilai was removed from office last year amid a scandal which saw his wife convicted of the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood.It is almost certain that Bo's conviction will not be overturned as the courts are controlled by the ruling Communist Party, which long ago pronounced the politician guilty, the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing reports.Bo's many supporters maintain that he is the victim of a political purge, our correspondent adds.The announcement regarding the appeal came on the website of the high court in Shandong, the province where Bo's trial was held."Within the appeal period, Bo Xilai refused to accept the court's first instance judgement and submitted an appeal through the Shandong Jinan Intermediate People's Court to this court," it said."After the appeal period expired on 8 October, upon examination, this court decided to accept the appeal, in accordance with the law."No time period for the appeal was specified in the brief statement. Under Chinese law, the appeal should be heard within two months but could take longer in special cases.A source close to the Bo family told the New York Times newspaper that it was unlikely that the appeal would be heard in an open court.Analysts say that the Chinese government would want to avoid giving Bo another opportunity for public defiance.Bo Xilai's downfall came as China ushered in a new generation of leaders, amid a once-in-a-decade power transfer.The charismatic politician had been seen as a candidate for the very top, until his fall from grace. It was the biggest political shake-up to hit China's ruling elite in decades.Bo was removed from office last year amid a scandal which began when his deputy, Wang Lijun, sought refuge in the US consulate in Chengdu.The incident prompted an investigation into the death of British businessman Neil Heywood.Bo Xilai's wife, Gu Kailai, was eventually convicted of Mr Heywood's murder - a crime caused, the court said, by a financial dispute. Wang was also jailed for 15 years for helping Gu cover up the murder.During his trial, Bo was also accused of abusing his office by using his position to cover up for his wife's crime.</body>

      <title>Water leak douses Fukushima workers</title>
      <description>Six workers at Japan's crippled Fukushima nuclear plant are exposed to radioactive water after another leak, plant operator Tepco says.</description>

      <date>1381306897</date>
      <body>Six workers at Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant have been been doused in radioactive water, its operator says.The incident happened after a worker removed a pipe connected to a water treatment system at the plant, Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) said.A senior official from Japan's nuclear watchdog said he did not believe the workers received a "seriously troubling" dosage of radiation.Fukushima has been hit by a series of toxic water leaks in recent months.The plant was badly damaged by the earthquake and tsunami of March 2011. Cooling systems for reactors were knocked out, causing meltdowns at three of them.Water is being pumped in to cool the reactors, however this creates large amounts of contaminated water that must be stored securely.Some of the water has leaked from the tanks, pipes and damaged structures, leading to concerns contaminated water is mixing with groundwater that is flowing into the sea.The detached pipe was connected to a desalination system, Tepco said, which was being used to treat toxic water before storage in tanks.Tepco said it was measuring the radiation that the workers, who were wearing protective gear, were exposed to."It is serious in that it was another problem caused by carelessness, but I do not believe it is a seriously troubling dosage," Shunichi Tanaka, chairman of Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority, was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.Japanese officials say the water to which the workers were exposed was emitting beta decay radiation - and that is important, says Jonathan Amos, the BBC's science correspondent.Beta particles are very weakly penetrating, and the workers' protective overalls would have substantially limited their exposure. The reports suggest also that no water splashed in the faces of the clean-up staff, so there would have been little chance of contamination being ingested.But the incident is just the latest in a series of mishaps at the plant, and it will no doubt bolster the view of those who believe Tepco is bungling the recovery operation, our correspondent adds.The pipe had since been reconnected and the toxic water was contained, Tepco said.The incident is the latest involving worker error. On Monday, it was reported that a plant worker accidentally switched off power to pumps used for cooling the damaged reactors.Last week, workers overfilled a storage tank, and about 430 litres (100 gallons) of radioactive water may have leaked from the tank, with some flowing into the sea, Tepco said.</body>

      <title>Azerbaijan president seeks new term</title>
      <description>The people of oil-rich Azerbaijan are voting in an election in which the incumbent President, Ilham Aliyev is expected to win a third term.</description>

      <body>The people of oil-rich Azerbaijan are voting in an election in which the incumbent President, Ilham Aliyev, is expected to win a third term in office.The president has not even run an election campaign, so confident is he of victory, a BBC correspondent says.Opposition activists circulated photos and videos appearing to show individuals casting multiple ballots - though these could not be verified.Mr Aliyev inherited the presidency from his father, Heydar Aliyev.He has stifled dissent and pushed through a constitutional referendum scrapping presidential term limits.Human rights groups say in the run-up to the elections the government has launched an unprecedented crackdown on its critics.But political opposition in the country of nine million has also been blunted by prosperity, with oil wealth more than tripling gross domestic product.The main opposition candidate, representing a coalition of parties, is history professor Jamil Hasanli, 61.Other challengers include five MPs and two low-profile opposition figures. Critics say some are in collusion with the government and only in the race to dilute the opposition vote.The BBC's Rayhan Demytrie says that none is expected to present a serious challenge to the president who enjoys immense power after inheriting the presidency from his father in 2003 and who will be standing for a third term.Mr Aliyev abolished a two-term presidential limit in a controversial referendum in 2009.International monitors have said that the pre-election atmosphere has been characterised by a combination of apathy and fear.A recent Human Rights Watch report said that in the last year the government had intensified its crackdown on civil society and passed a number of laws to curtail any form of dissent, including a $10,000 (£6,000) fine for organising or attending an unsanctioned rally.Dozens of political activists have been arrested and jailed.Azerbaijan is an important supplier of oil and natural gas for European markets.In the decade since Mr Aliyev succeeded his father, Azerbaijan has been through a boom that has raised living standards.The president has courted Western states attracted by its strategic location and status as a producer and transporter of oil and gas.But dissent has grown over what critics describe as the country's endemic corruption and a large divide between rich and poor.One rights group has said that the number of political prisoners has doubled in advance of the elections.Oil multinationals BP, ExxonMobil and other Western companies have invested billions of dollars to tap into Azerbaijan's oil riches.An oil pipeline supported by the US and the European Union to pump Azerbaijani crude oil via Georgia to Turkey - bypassing Russia - went into operation in 2005.The pipeline is seen as an important part of the West's aim of reducing Europe's dependence on Russian energy resources.</body>

      <title>Venezuela's Maduro seeks new powers</title>

      <body>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has asked parliament to give him special powers to fight corruption and what he called economic sabotage.The country is currently facing shortages of food and essential goods, power cuts and soaring inflation.The measure, used on four occasions by his predecessor Hugo Chavez, would allow Mr Maduro to govern by decree for a set period of time.The opposition fears he will use his powers to stifle any dissent.A vote to implement the so-called Enabling Law is due to be held in the National Assembly next week.In a three-hour speech to the assembly, Mr Maduro called it a "matter of life or death" for the country's socialist revolution."If corruption keeps expanding and perpetuating its destructive capitalist logic, there will be no socialism here," he said.Mr Maduro vowed to root out corruption in all aspects of Venezuelan life, stressing that even members of the governing Unified Socialist Party would not be exempt from scrutiny.But Henrique Capriles, the opposition presidential candidate who narrowly lost the election to Mr Maduro earlier this year, said the decree would not solve the country's problems."I don't think this law will bring any economic or social benefit to Venezuelans," he said. "They're going to use the law to persecute and distract the people from their real problems."Although Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves, its people are suffering from the highest inflation in Latin America, sluggish growth and shortages.A power cut last month left more than two-thirds of the country without electricity.Finance Minister Nelson Merentes has conceded that while the social-oriented policies of Mr Chavez have improved the living standards of many Venezuelans, they did not solve the "structural problems" of the economy.Hugo Chavez died of cancer in March after 14 years in power.His vice-president and handpicked successor, Mr Maduro, has pledged to continue his policies but does not command the same support enjoyed by Mr Chavez.</body>

      <body>Protesters in Brazil have disrupted an official visit to a football stadium being built for next year's World Cup.A group of some 50 people stormed the Arena Pantanal, in the western city of Cuiaba, as it was being inspected by the Secretary General of Fifa, Jerome Valcke.They shouted slogans and held banners criticising the huge amounts spent in preparations for the World Cup.The incident raises new concerns about security during the event."Go home!" and "World Cup for whom?" read some of the banners carried by protesters - most of them striking teachers and postal workers.They have called for more public spending on health and education.The stadium is expected to cost about £140m ($230m; 500m reais).Many in Brazil have criticised the decision to build a stadium for more than 40,000 spectators in Mato Grosso state, which does not have a single team in the country's top football division.But the Brazilian government said that hosting four World Cup matches at the stadium will draw the world's attention to the natural beauty of the Pantanal Conservation Area, a home to vast tropical wetlands.Mr Valcke said the protesters had to take the long term benefits into account."People have freedom and that is part of democracy. But the workers who are here trying to finish the stadium should not be targeted," said Mr Valcke.He said he had a meeting with Governor Silval Barbosa to find out if the works were going to meet the deadline set by the Fifa, the world's football governing body.Officials say the Arena Pantanal is 85% ready, though none of the seats in the stadium have been installed.Fifa has demanded that all venues are ready by 20 December.The 2014 World Cup will kick off in Sao Paulo on 12 June. The final match will be played in Rio de Janeiro's Maracana stadium on 13 July.</body>

      <body>The world's chemical weapons watchdog has said it will send a second team of inspectors to boost its programme to destroy Syria's stockpile.The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it had made "a constructive beginning" to "a long and difficult process".However, it did not say how many extra inspectors would be deployed, or when.Under a UN resolution, Syria's chemical weapons mixing and filling equipment must be destroyed by 1 November.In a statement, OPCW chief Ahmet Uzumcu also said that the Syrian government had submitted additional information updating its initial disclosure, which would help the OPCW plan its future activities.Mr Uzumcu was delivering his first report to the 41-nation OPCW executive council.The BBC's Anna Holligan in the Hague says this report is significant because the content is based on evidence gathered by the OPCW experts on the ground in Damascus.They were part of an advance party, sent out to hold talks with the Syrian authorities and smooth the way for the destruction process to begin, our correspondent says.On Sunday, members of the joint OPCW and UN mission observed Syrian staff using cutting torches and angle grinders to destroy missile warheads, aerial bombs, and mixing equipment.This dismantling work is continuing at undisclosed locations this week, as the conflict in Syria continues.UN Secretary-General Ban ki-Moon has described it as "an operation the likes of which has never been tried before".US Secretary of State John Kerry has welcomed "a good beginning", and says the next step is to secure a date for the so-called Geneva-2 peace talks.However, human rights groups point out that chemical weapons are only responsible for about 2% of the estimated 100,000 deaths during the two-year conflict, in which armed opposition groups are seeking to topple President Bashar al-Assad.The groups warn that disposing of the chemical capabilities will not stop the war.Earlier on Tuesday, the UN estimated that more than eight million Syrians could have been forced from their homes by the country's civil war by the end of 2014.The number of refugees outside Syria is expected to hit 3.2m by the end of this year and 5.2m by the end of 2014.A further 2.25m are projected to be internally displaced next year, which would bring the number of those affected to more than a third of Syria's pre-war population.The estimates of the scale of the future human impact of the conflict were made at a meeting of UN agencies and NGOs late last month.However, a UN spokesman emphasised that the figures reflected the estimates made at the time, and that the final projections used to plan UN agencies' response in 2014 - due to be released this December - are likely to be even higher.</body>

      <title>Saudi jailed over daughter's death</title>
      <description>A Saudi preacher accused of torturing his five-year-old daughter and beating her to death has been sentenced to eight years in jail and 600 lashes.</description>

      <body>A Saudi preacher accused of torturing his five-year-old daughter and beating her to death has been sentenced to eight years in prison and 600 lashes.The case of Fayhan al-Ghamdi made headlines around the world earlier this year when it was suggested that a Saudi court might let him walk free.Activists began a campaign named after his daughter, "I am Lama", to press the authorities to prevent that happening.Al-Ghamdi is not recognised as a cleric by the Saudi religious establishment.The horrific details of the abuse that Lama al-Ghamdi suffered were revealed in medical records from the hospital where she was treated for 10 months before she died.Her ribs were broken, a fingernail was torn off and her skull crushed. She had been beaten with a cane and electric cables. She had also suffered burns.The abuse had happened while she was with her father, who was separated from her mother.It was reported that al-Ghamdi had suspected his daughter of losing her virginity and had beaten her and molested her in response.It was even suggested that he had raped her himself, although this was denied by Lama's mother.The outrage over the case intensified earlier this year when activists suggested that he might walk free, despite having confessed to having beaten Lama.The judge in the case suggested that one reading of Islamic law meant a father could not be held fully accountable for the death of his children.Activists warned that it looked like he might be released if the mother accepted blood money.The story grabbed headlines across the world.It shone a light on child abuse in Saudi Arabia where rights activists say strict codes of family privacy and a patriarchal tradition make it a serious problem.The Saudi authorities set up a child abuse helpline in response.Now, a verdict has been reached in the same court and with the same judge.One of the activists involved in the campaign, Aziz al-Yousef, told the BBC that she was disappointed that Fayhan al-Ghamdi did not receive a life sentence.But Lama's mother had in the end accepted the offer of blood money, despite having once said she would never take it.She said she needed it to help support her surviving children. That ruled out a life sentence.Another campaigner who fought for a longer sentence, Manal al-Sharif, told the BBC that she did not believe the penalty was enough.But she does feel that the I am Lama campaign - with the international pressure it brought to bear on the authorities - was instrumental in leading to the recent introduction of an unprecedented new Saudi law against domestic violence.However, she added that she still has deep reservations over how effectively this will be enforced in practice.</body>

      <title>Obama: Republicans using 'extortion'</title>
      <description>US President Obama says he is willing to hold budget talks with Republicans, but not if they "demand a ransom in exchange for doing their jobs".</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24453693</url>
      <date>1381285503</date>
      <body>US President Barack Obama has said he is willing to hold budget talks with Republicans, but not until they agree to lift "threats" against the economy.Republicans "don't get to demand ransom in exchange for doing their jobs", Mr Obama said, by demanding concessions in policy before reopening government.The US government shut down last week when Congress failed to agree a budget.Republican leaders on Tuesday renewed their calls for Mr Obama to open negotiations over ending the impasses.Republican House Speaker John Boehner told reporters he was "disappointed that the president refuses to negotiate".He said the president's position not to talk with Republicans "until [they] surrender" was not sustainable, and any discussions regarding the debt ceiling must address how the nation is "living beyond its means".At the White House, Mr Obama said he had spoken to Mr Boehner and was "happy to talk with him and other Republicans about anything".But Mr Obama said any negotiations on the ongoing government shutdown or the debt limit "shouldn't require hanging the threats of a shutdown or economic chaos over the heads of the American people"."We can't make extortion routine as part of our democracy," Mr Obama said. "Democracy doesn't function this way. And this is not just for me. It's also for my successors in office, whatever party they're from."He also warned of the repercussions of defaulting on the government's debt should Congress fail to raise the borrowing limit, currently set to be reached on 17 October.Mr Obama said breaching the borrowing limit could disrupt capital markets, undermine international confidence in America, permanently increase the nation's borrowing costs, add to its deficits and debt, and pose the "significant risk of a very deep recession".The US government partially shut down operations on 1 October after Republicans who control the House of Representatives refused to approve a budget, saying they would only do so if Mr Obama's healthcare reform law were delayed or stripped of funding.Mr Obama and the Democrats have thus far refused, noting the law was passed in 2010, subsequently approved by the Supreme Court, and was a central issue in the 2012 election which Mr Obama won.At the same time, the Republicans have refused to approve an increase in the US debt limit unless it is accompanied by significant spending cuts and other policy concessions.Mr Obama maintains Mr Boehner could end the current government showdown by allowing the House to vote on a "clean" budget bill that does not alter the health law, because that could pass with votes from both Democrats and moderate Republicans.But doing so would risk damaging his standing with the most conservative elements of his caucus, analysts say.US and foreign officials and economists have warned of severe economic consequences if the US defaults on its debt because the government is unable to borrow money to fund its obligations."Failure to lift the debt ceiling would be a major event. Prolonged failure... would almost surely derail the US recovery," said International Monetary Fund economic counsellor Olivier Blanchard on Tuesday."But the effects of any failure to repay the debt would be felt right away... leading to potentially major disruptions in financial markets both in the United States and abroad."Philippine President Benigno Aquino warned that what happens in the US "affects us all"."The US economy is the number-one economy in the world," he said while attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) in Bali."The world economy obviously is not in a position to withstand too much shock at this time."At the White House, Mr Obama said that if the US eventually dealt with the impasse "the way we should", then "folks around the world will attribute this to the usual messy process of American democracy but it doesn't do lasting damage".He sought to reassure US bond holders and others that the country remained good for its debts, despite the shutdown."My message to the world is the United States always has paid its bills and it will do so again," Mr Obama said.The shutdown has already had a significant impact in the US.Hundreds of thousands of workers have been sent home without pay, national parks, museums, and tourists sites have been closed, research has halted, and more.Visitors to the iconic Grand Canyon in Arizona have got no further than locked gates around the site, which normally attracts 18,000 visitors a day as weather cools about summer highs.Workers in small towns that depend on Grand Canyon tourism for their livelihoods are having to resort to food banks.On Monday, US defence contractor Lockheed Martin said it would put 3,000 workers on unpaid leave, warning that number would rise if the government shutdown continued.That announcement followed United Technologies' decision to lay off 2,000 employees temporarily, saying manufacturing had halted because there were no government inspectors working to sign off products.</body>

      <title>US high court weighs election limits</title>
      <description>The US Supreme Court hears arguments in a case that could further expand the amount of wealthy donors' money in the US political system.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24449605</url>
      <date>1381252927</date>
      <body>The US Supreme Court has heard arguments in a case that could further expand the amount of wealthy donors' money in the US political system.A Republican donor is challenging a legal limit on total political contributions in an election cycle.Proponents of the law argue overturning it would unfairly increase wealthy individuals' influence in politics.The arguments come three years after the court loosened strictures on corporate spending in elections.Contribution limits were established by Congress in the 1970s in an attempt to restore the public's faith in government after President Richard Nixon's resignation in the Watergate scandal.At issue in the case argued on Tuesday, McCutcheon v Federal Election Commission, is the total amount of money a single individual can give to candidates across the country in a given two-year election cycle.The plaintiff is Republican Shaun McCutcheon, owner of the Coalmont Electrical Development Corporation in Alabama.In the 2011-12 election cycle he gave $1,776 (£1,100) each to 15 candidates for Congress.He wanted to give the same amount to 12 other candidates, but was blocked by the federal limit on overall individual contributions, which is tied to inflation and will be $123,200 for 2013-14."It's a very important case about your right to spend your money how you choose," Mr McCutcheon has said.He told the Associated Press he planned to spend several hundred thousand dollars in this election cycle between candidates and outside political groups.Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr, who argued in favour of the limit on behalf of the Obama administration, told the court on Tuesday that if the limit were overturned, donors "could potentially funnel massive amounts of money to a favoured candidate".A controversial high court ruling in 2010, known as Citizens United v Federal Election Commission, loosened restrictions on political spending by nominally independent groups known as political action committees.While those groups are barred from directly co-ordinating with candidates' campaigns, they may spend large amounts of money promoting a candidate or running negative adverts again the candidate's opponents. They are funded by business interests, wealthy individuals and, to a lesser extent, labour unions.The McCutcheon case does not directly challenge limits on the amount an individual can give to a single candidate.But groups that favour strict limits on the amount of money in politics say a broad ruling by the court overturning the limits would threaten the integrity of US elections."This is not about some abstract concept," said Fred Wertheimer, president of campaign finance reform group Democracy 21."It's about re-establishing a system where huge contributions can be given directly to benefit candidates and parties, and it will create opportunities for the corruption of governmental decisions."Mr Verrilli argued on Tuesday that without the aggregate limits, one donor giving the maximum allowed to every congressional candidate, political party and political action committee would exceed $3m in contributions in a single election cycle.Only a small portion of all current donors to political campaigns would be affected by a removal of the aggregate limit, should the Supreme Court rule in favour of Mr McCutcheon.According to the Center for Responsive Politics, 646 people in the 2012 election cycle hit the maximum overall donation limit.Those people gave more than $93m directly to candidates and committees.During arguments, the nine justices seemed closely divided.Chief Justice John Roberts, who was in the majority in the 2010 Citizens United case, appeared to be looking for middle ground that would allow individual donors to give to more candidates without opening the door to multi-million dollar direct contributions, analysts said.</body>

      <body>The Democratic Republic of Congo is potentially one of the richest countries on earth, but colonialism, slavery and corruption has turned it into one of the poorest, writes historian Dan Snow.The world's bloodiest conflict since World War II is still rumbling on today.It is a war in which more than five million people have died, millions more have been driven to the brink by starvation and disease and several million women and girls have been raped.The Great War of Africa, a conflagration that has sucked in soldiers and civilians from nine nations and countless armed rebel groups, has been fought almost entirely inside the borders of one unfortunate country - the Democratic Republic of Congo.It is a place seemingly blessed with every type of mineral, yet consistently rated lowest on the UN Human Development Index, where even the more fortunate live in grinding poverty.I went to the Congo this summer to find out what it was about the country's past that had delivered it into the hands of unimaginable violence and anarchy.The journey that I went on, through the Congo's abusive history, while travelling across its war-torn present, was the most disturbing experience of my career.I met rape victims, rebels, bloated politicians and haunted citizens of a country that has ceased to function - people who struggle to survive in a place cursed by a past that defies description, a history that will not release them from its death-like grip.The Congo's apocalyptic present is a direct product of decisions and actions taken over the past five centuries.In the late 15th Century an empire known as the Kingdom of Kongo dominated the western portion of the Congo, and bits of other modern states such as Angola.It was sophisticated, had its own aristocracy and an impressive civil service.When Portuguese traders arrived from Europe in the 1480s, they realised they had stumbled upon a land of vast natural wealth, rich in resources - particularly human flesh.The Congo was home to a seemingly inexhaustible supply of strong, disease-resistant slaves. The Portuguese quickly found this supply would be easier to tap if the interior of the continent was in a state of anarchy.They did their utmost to destroy any indigenous political force capable of curtailing their slaving or trading interests.Money and modern weapons were sent to rebels, Kongolese armies were defeated, kings were murdered, elites slaughtered and secession was encouraged.By the 1600s, the once-mighty kingdom had disintegrated into a leaderless, anarchy of mini-states locked in endemic civil war. Slaves, victims of this fighting, flowed to the coast and were carried to the Americas.About four million people were forcibly embarked at the mouth of the Congo River. English ships were at the heart of the trade. British cities and merchants grew rich on the back of Congolese resources they would never see.This first engagement with Europeans set the tone for the rest of the Congo's history.Development has been stifled, government has been weak and the rule of law non-existent. This was not through any innate fault of the Congolese, but because it has been in the interests of the powerful to destroy, suppress and prevent any strong, stable, legitimate government. That would interfere - as the Kongolese had threatened to interfere before - with the easy extraction of the nation's resources. The Congo has been utterly cursed by its natural wealth.The Congo is a massive country, the size of Western Europe.Limitless water, from the world's second-largest river, the Congo, a benign climate and rich soil make it fertile, beneath the soil abundant deposits of copper, gold, diamonds, cobalt, uranium, coltan and oil are just some of the minerals that should make it one of the world's richest countries.Instead it is the world's most hopeless.The interior of the Congo was opened up in the late 19th Century by the British-born explorer Henry Morton Stanley, his dreams of free trading associations with communities he met were shattered by the infamous King of the Belgians, Leopold, who hacked out a vast private empire.The world's largest supply of rubber was found at a time when bicycle and automobile tyres, and electrical insulation, had made it a vital commodity in the West.The late Victorian bicycle craze was enabled by Congolese rubber collected by slave labourers.To tap it, Congolese men were rounded up by a brutal Belgian-officered security force, their wives were interned to ensure compliance and were brutalised during their captivity. The men were then forced to go into the jungle and harvest the rubber.Disobedience or resistance was met by immediate punishment - flogging, severing of hands, and death. Millions perished.Tribal leaders capable of resisting were murdered, indigenous society decimated, proper education denied.A culture of rapacious, barbaric rule by a Belgian elite who had absolutely no interest in developing the country or population was created, and it has endured.In a move supposed to end the brutality, Belgium eventually annexed the Congo outright, but the problems in its former colony remained.Mining boomed, workers suffered in appalling conditions, producing the materials that fired industrial production in Europe and America.In World War I men on the Western Front and elsewhere did the dying, but it was Congo's minerals that did the killing.The brass casings of allied shells fired at Passchendaele and the Somme were 75% Congolese copper.In World War II, the uranium for the nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki came from a mine in south-east Congo.Western freedoms were defended with Congo's resources while black Congolese were denied the right to vote, or form unions and political associations. They were denied anything beyond the most basic of educations.They were kept at an infantile level of development that suited the rulers and mine owners but made sure that when independence came there was no home-grown elite who could run the country.Independence in 1960 was, therefore, predictably disastrous.Bits of the vast country immediately attempted to break away, the army mutinied against its Belgian officers and within weeks the Belgian elite who ran the state evacuated leaving nobody with the skills to run the government or economy.Of 5,000 government jobs pre-independence, just three were held by Congolese and there was not a single Congolese lawyer, doctor, economist or engineer.Chaos threatened to engulf the region. The Cold War superpowers moved to prevent the other gaining the upper hand.Sucked into these rivalries, the struggling Congolese leader, Patrice Lumumba, was horrifically beaten and executed by Western-backed rebels. A military strongman, Joseph-Desire Mobutu, who had a few years before been a sergeant in the colonial police force, took over.Mobutu became a tyrant. In 1972 he changed his name to Mobutu Sese Seko Nkuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga, meaning "the all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, goes from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake".The West tolerated him as long as the minerals flowed and the Congo was kept out of the Soviet orbit.He, his family and friends bled the country of billions of dollars, a $100m palace was built in the most remote jungle at Gbadolite, an ultra-long airstrip next to it was designed to take Concorde, which was duly chartered for shopping trips to Paris.Dissidents were tortured or bought off, ministers stole entire budgets, government atrophied. The West allowed his regime to borrow billions, which was then stolen and today's Congo is still expected to pay the bill.In 1997 an alliance of neighbouring African states, led by Rwanda - which was furious Mobutu's Congo was sheltering many of those responsible for the 1994 genocide - invaded, after deciding to get rid of Mobutu.A Congolese exile, Laurent Kabila, was dredged up in East Africa to act as a figurehead. Mobutu's cash-starved army imploded, its leaders, incompetent cronies of the president, abandoning their men in a mad dash to escape.Mobutu took off one last time from his jungle Versailles, his aircraft packed with valuables, his own unpaid soldiers firing at the plane as it lumbered into the air.Rwanda had effectively conquered its titanic neighbour with spectacular ease. Once installed however, Kabila, Rwanda's puppet, refused to do as he was told.Again Rwanda invaded, but this time they were just halted by her erstwhile African allies who now turned on each other and plunged Congo into a terrible war.Foreign armies clashed deep inside the Congo as the paper-thin state collapsed totally and anarchy spread.Hundreds of armed groups carried out atrocities, millions died.Ethnic and linguistic differences fanned the ferocity of the violence, while control of Congo's stunning natural wealth added a terrible urgency to the fighting.Forcibly conscripted child soldiers corralled armies of slaves to dig for minerals such as coltan, a key component in mobile phones, the latest obsession in the developed world, while annihilating enemy communities, raping women and driving survivors into the jungle to die of starvation and disease.A deeply flawed, partial peace was patched together a decade ago. In the far east of the Congo, there is once again a shooting war as a complex web of domestic and international rivalries see rebel groups clash with the army and the UN, while tiny community militias add to the general instability.The country has collapsed, roads no longer link the main cities, healthcare depends on aid and charity. The new regime is as grasping as its predecessors.I rode on one of the trainloads of copper that go straight from foreign-owned mines to the border, and on to the Far East, rumbling past shanty towns of displaced, poverty-stricken Congolese.The Portuguese, Belgians, Mobutu and the present government have all deliberately stifled the development of a strong state, army, judiciary and education system, because it interferes with their primary focus, making money from what lies under the Earth.The billions of pounds those minerals have generated have brought nothing but misery and death to the very people who live on top of them, while enriching a microscopic elite in the Congo and their foreign backers, and underpinning our technological revolution in the developed world.The Congo is a land far away, yet our histories are so closely linked. We have thrived from a lopsided relationship, yet we are utterly blind to it. The price of that myopia has been human suffering on an unimaginable scale.</body>

      <description>How much can a bit of extra sleep change you?</description>

      <date>1381307042</date>
      <body>The average Briton gets six-and-a-half hours' sleep a night, according to the Sleep Council. Michael Mosley took part in an unusual experiment to see if this is enough.It has been known for some time that the amount of sleep people get has, on average, declined over the years.This has happened for a whole range of reasons, not least because we live in a culture where people are encouraged to think of sleep as a luxury - something you can easily cut back on. After all, that's what caffeine is for - to jolt you back into life. But while the average amount of sleep we are getting has fallen, rates of obesity and diabetes have soared. Could the two be connected?We wanted to see what the effect would be of increasing average sleep by just one hour. So we asked seven volunteers, who normally sleep anywhere between six and nine hours, to be studied at the University of Surrey's Sleep Research Centre.The volunteers were randomly allocated to two groups. One group was asked to sleep for six-and-a-half hours a night, the other got seven-and-a-half hours. After a week the researchers took blood tests and the volunteers were asked to switch sleep patterns. The group that had been sleeping six-and-a-half hours got an extra hour, the other group slept an hour less.While we were waiting to see what effect this would have, I went to the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford to learn more about what actually happens when we sleep.In the Sleep Centre, they fitted me up with a portable electro-encephalograph, a device that measures brain wave activity. Then, feeling slightly ridiculous, I went home and had my seven-and-a-half hours of sleep.The following day I went to discuss what had happened inside my head during the night with Dr Katharina Wulff.The first thing she pointed out was that I had very rapidly fallen into a state of deep sleep. Deep sleep sounds restful, but during it our brains are actually working hard. One of the main things the brain is doing is moving memories from short-term storage into long-term storage, allowing us more short-term memory space for the next day. If you don't get adequate deep sleep then these memories will be lost.You might think: "I'll cut back during the week and then make up for it at the weekend." Unfortunately it doesn't work like that, because memories need to be consolidated within 24 hours of being formed.Since deep sleep is so important for consolidating memories it is a good idea if you are revising or perhaps taking an exam to make sure that you're getting a reasonable night's sleep. In one study, people who failed to do so did 40% worse than their contemporaries.Deep sleep only lasts for a few hours. My electrode results showed that during the night my brain went through multiple phases of another kind of activity, called REM sleep."This is the phase when you are usually paralysed - so you can't move," Wulff explained. "In fact the only muscles which are not paralysed are the eye muscles, and that's why it's called rapid eye movement sleep."During REM sleep an extraordinary thing happens. One of the stress-related chemicals in the brain, noradrenalin, is switched off. It's the only time, day or night, this happens. It allows us to remain calm while our brains reprocess all the experiences of the day, helping us come to terms with particularly emotional events.We get more REM sleep in the last half of the night. Which means that if you are woken unexpectedly, your brain may not have dealt with all your emotions - which could leave you stressed and anxious. Drinking alcohol late at night is not a good idea as it reduces your REM sleep while it's being processed in your body.Back at the University of Surrey our sleep volunteers had finished their second week of the experiment. What we wanted to see was the effect switching from six-and-a-half hours to seven-and-a-half hours, or vice versa, would have on our volunteers.Computer tests revealed that most of them struggled with mental agility tasks when they had less sleep, but the most interesting results came from the blood tests that were run.Dr Simon Archer and his team at Surrey University were particularly interested in looking at the genes that were switched on or off in our volunteers by changes in the amount that we had made them sleep."We found that overall there were around 500 genes that were affected," Archer explained. "Some which were going up, and some which were going down."What they discovered is that when the volunteers cut back from seven-and-a-half to six-and-a-half hours' sleep a night, genes that are associated with processes like inflammation, immune response and response to stress became more active. The team also saw increases in the activity of genes associated with diabetes and risk of cancer. The reverse happened when the volunteers added an hour of sleep.So the clear message from this experiment was that if you are getting less than seven hours' sleep a night and can alter your sleep habits, even just a little bit, it could make you healthier. "Have a lie-in, it will do you good" - that's the kind of health message that doesn't come along very often.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on FacebookTrust Me I'm a Doctor is broadcast on 10 October on BBC Two at 20:00 BST, or catch up with iPlayer</body>

      <title>The band who opened a record shop</title>
      <description>Is this Britain's hardest working band?</description>

      <body>When indie band Frankie and the Heartstrings released their second album this summer, they were so alarmed by the lack of record shops in which to sell it that they decided to open their own."We were coming to the completion of our second record and the main story on the news one day was the fact HMV had gone bust," says singer Frankie Francis."At the time, a couple of local record shops had gone bust as well. We thought 'We've got this record coming out, but there might not actually be anywhere to sell it on the High Street.'"So we thought we'd take a stand and open our own record shop."With help from Sunderland City Council, the band took over the empty tourist office in their home town. "There's no call for it any more, for various reasons," Francis says solemnly.Pop Recs Ltd was only supposed to open for two weeks to mark their album's release in June. But the band say the reaction has been so good that they are keeping it open for as long as they can and have plans for in-store gigs through to next February.Four out of the five bandmates work there full time and, last month, the venture earned them the title of hardest working band in Britain from the Association of Independent Music.When I visit, the lead singer is manning the coffee machine, busily grinding beans and frothing milk as the shop fills up before an in-store gig by visiting Manchester band Dutch Uncles.Drummer Dave Harper and bassist Steve Dennis are behind the counter in a state of harangued dishevelment - passing coffee cups, jabbing the till, fetching supplies, pausing to chat to friends.Indie circuit stalwarts, Frankie and the Heartstrings made the top 40 with their debut album in 2011 and have a loyal live following, but are still waiting for that breakthrough to the big time."We're a band with not much money… and we've put what money we have into this project just to show bands can take a stand," Francis says."If we can do it on a street level, why can't people further up in the music business be as proactive as us?"We're engaging with loads of bands and labels to come and do things and because of that we're selling records in Sunderland for all these bands. That wouldn't have happened if this project didn't exist."But does it really matter whether we have real record shops selling real records any more? "I guess it matters more to us because we're in a band and we know how many records people sell," Francis replies."Even 10 years ago you would have sold double, three times, four times the amount of records that you sell now."I think it's very important to engage with people and make them realise the value of actually owning music, especially on vinyl because we're very romantic in that we take a lot of time over the artwork and the way it's laid out and the way the whole thing feels and looks."We just want to try and make that connect with people and explain to them why it's such a cherished item."A few months ago, Francis was simply a flamboyant indie rock front man. Now, he talks about business plans and the deals he has struck with various record labels."We're five kids from Sunderland who have been messing around in the back of a van for five years touring the world," he says."It's quite easy to slip back into the crazy gang mentality, but we've had to put our businessmen heads on."The group's second album missed the top 40 and they are now between record contracts. With minimal money to be made from album sales, mid-ranking indie bands must find other sources of income.Dutch Uncles are critical favourites but their three albums have not troubled the top 40. Singer Duncan Wallis says the idea of making money from selling records just does not occur to bands such as his."It's just not something you really consider," he says. "You only think about the money to be made out of touring, at this level anyway."Frankie and the Heartstrings say they have sacrificed summer festival fees in order to work in the shop, which earns them "enough to get by, and that's all we care about".The alternative would be much worse - getting proper jobs."The shop, if you maintain it correctly, could become an income for the band," Francis says. "If it wasn't for the shop we would all have to be in work now."Until now, the band have survived on the money they have made from their music. When a pizza company used one of their songs in a TV advert, the group lived for a year on the proceeds.Francis says: "I don't think there's any shame in that any more because you don't make any money from selling records, so you've got to make an income somehow."In the store, the band also sell their own coffee blend and brand of beer, and Francis admits they make more money from coffee than records most days. Like many other independent record stores, they know they cannot survive by selling music alone.Work by local artists and photographers adorns the walls and there are dedicated racks promoting records by local bands."We've had kids from the local area who've come into the shop, bought some records and the next week they've come in and said, 'We've just started a band, can we have a gig in here?'" Francis says.But the most prominent space is reserved for the new album by Frankie and the Heartstrings.The singer laughs: "If we're going to run a record shop, we're going to be number one in the charts every week in this store."</body>

      <title>Have drug scandals actually made sport more interesting?</title>
      <description>Have drug scandals actually made sport more interesting?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24329252</url>
      <date>1381280236</date>
      <body>Usually drugs in sport are the subject of universal condemnation, but have they actually made things more interesting, asks Paul Dimeo.I was 17 when Ben Johnson became a household name. Not for winning the 100m gold in the 1988 Olympics, but for losing that medal two days later after a positive test for the steroid stanozolol.Twenty-five years after Johnson's ignominy, he is now promoting an anti-drugs message, while I teach and study sports policy, and in particular drugs in sport. I've watched the Johnson race hundreds of time, telling my students to watch Carl Lewis's face drop in amazement at Johnson's speed.It is now one of the most famous events in sports history - famous for Johnson's positive and for the fact that many of the other runners were implicated in doping at some stage of their career.I've also become fascinated by professional cycling, a sport of which I knew nothing about until 10 years ago when the story of the Lance Armstrong miracle was increasingly circulating - the great hero who recovered from cancer to dominate the sport.As a lecturer in sports I often come across people who are wholly devoted to the ethical purpose of sport, to the idea that sport can help improve lives. I also meet people whose approach to sport is about performance - sports scientists, coaching experts and others who are helping to develop training techniques, nutritional strategies or technologies that can support what my Danish friend and colleague Verner Moller calls the will to win.Over the 25 years since Johnson's eye-popping, steroid-fuelled brilliance was savagely cut short and his life ruined, I have increasingly found myself fascinated by the moral ambiguities produced by the tensions between these competing paradigms. And I have come to see the ongoing war between the dopers and the anti-doping policing agencies as a manifestation of these historical dilemmas.After a doping scandal, we are encouraged to take the side of traditional ethics and support anti-doping. However, if we can empathise with athletes' will to win and desire for competitive advantage, which as spectators we celebrate and admire, we might be less harsh in our judgement.Ben Johnson and Lance Armstrong both thought others were doping - and they were right. They both felt they could not trust the anti-doping system to protect the idea of fairness - and they were right about that, too. Their doping was driven by the belief that they were only doing what they had to do to win. Yet they have both been punished very severely while others have got away with it. I can't help but have some sympathy.And when you start looking at the question from that angle, another thought presents itself. What if doping has done something good for sport? What if, in fact, doping has helped make sport what it is today?The best example is the Olympics, which was in crisis for most of the post-war period. Essentially it is a series of minority interest sports brought together with reference to the historical idealism of international peace and co-operation. In theory it was entirely amateur and the big professional sports like football, cycling, tennis, golf and American football were not represented. In the words of Jim Mills Sr, it was little more than PE for grown-ups.Few countries wanted to host the event , there was little sponsorship money and, beset by boycotts, the movement nearly collapsed. However, what made the Olympics interesting through the 1960s, 70s and 80s - breathed life into the whole affair - was the Cold War rivalry between the Soviet Union, East Germany and the US and their respective allies.This rivalry created meaning and a culture of excellence. Records were regularly broken in almost all disciplines. Great performances were admired while ongoing rivalries - individual and national - made for great stories. But we know now that many of the Olympic medal winners from those countries in these decades were on steroids. The growing popularity and media coverage of the Olympics was based upon excellence fuelled by steroids.The writer Umberto Eco once argued that sport isn't really about the actual event - that's over quickly, few people participate and only a relatively small number will be there to see it in real life. Instead, Eco wrote, sport is about reporting an event, then discussing the reporting of the event, then discussing the discussion. And drugs have certainly enhanced the discussion as much as they have enhanced the athletes. The discussion around sport - from newspaper headlines to in-depth biographies - has benefited greatly from drugs. The public love stories where drugs make sports stars seem like human beings - tragically flawed.But it goes beyond that. Anti-doping is a moral and controlling force which aims to protect the purity of sport, but like all moral forces runs up against human nature - in this case athletes' will to win, and their occasional lapses in concentration.Anti-doping would not exist without doping as its nemesis - the two are locked together, they need each other. It is a war in which each side defines the parameters of the other. And this has created a real sense of fascination among sports fans, and even those not normally interested in sport.Personally, I have made a career from discussing doping - writing and teaching about Cold War rivalries, doping at the Olympics and the wider history of drugs in sport. People talk to me almost every day about it. One of my students asks for my thoughts on the latest scandals and new policies. My weekend cycling buddies ask me what they are allowed to take to enhance their chances of success. Even a friend who is a former church minister once asked me why people are so angry with Lance Armstrong. After all, she said, in the bigger scheme of things he hasn't done much wrong.Most of all though I get to indulge my curiosity about sport, which is also about life, to explore that liminal space between what is judged to be right and what is wrong. My critical anti-authoritarian streak relishes instances where supposedly bad turn out to be good, and the supposedly good turn out to be bad.When I look back at Ben Johnson and at others - Marion Jones, Michael Rasmussen, David Millar, Marita Koch and so many more - I see people driven by a desire to win, for themselves and their families, and I can't bring myself to see anything wrong in that.This is an edited version of Paul Dimeo's Four Thought, which will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 20:45 BST on 9 October 2013.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <body>Corruption in education is a serious blight that undermines the quality and availability of schools and universities around the world, according to an international report.Anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International have published a global survey showing that about one in six students has had to pay a bribe for education services.In parts of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia this might be requiring parents to pay a fee for a school place that should be free.In Eastern Europe, it might be paying to gain an advantage in university admissions.The Berlin-based campaign group is best known for its annual "global corruption barometer", which measures levels of dishonest payments in more than 100 countries, based on more than 114,000 household interviews.This year's survey also asked questions about people's first-hand experiences and perceptions of dishonesty in education.In some countries these perceptions are distinctively negative. The report says that almost three-quarters of people in Cameroon and Russia see their education systems as "corrupt or highly corrupt".The findings show a huge range of malpractice.In Pakistan, there are warnings of thousands of "shadow schools" without any real students, but drawing public funding to pay for "ghost teachers"."Leakages" in the funding of schools in Kenya had the equivalent value of losing more than 11 million text books, says the report. A study of 180 schools in Tanzania showed that more than a third of intended funds had failed to reach the school.In Greece there are warnings about nepotism in jobs and promotions in higher education.In Vietnam there is a problem with bribery for places in the most sought-after schools.The report quotes figures from the United Nations showing 110 countries where fees are levied, despite in theory having free education enshrined in law. The report describes "myriad pretexts" to impose charges on parents.So why should education be so vulnerable to corruption?Parents want the best for their children, says the report, and they can be exploited by unscrupulous officials controlling access to places.It also involves a great deal of public money filtering down from central government to local school authorities. In Nigeria, the report says, $21m (£13m) intended for schools was lost in two years.But it's not only a problem for the developing world or those providing the basics of schooling.The massive expansion in demand for university education has created rich opportunities for illicit charges.Students need degree-level qualifications more than ever and are under great pressure to get university places and to leave with good grades, opening up fertile territory for corruption and cheating.Eastern European and former Soviet states are highlighted as having had particular difficulties.In Georgia, there have been reforms to stop corruption in university admissions. This hadn't simply been "cash-filled envelopes", but included a complex system of having to buy tutoring, Transparency International found.There could also be more practical types of illicit charges, with suggestions that in Romania access to university accommodation depended on bribery.The demand for qualifications has also generated its own industry in fake universities.In the United States, the report estimates, there are about a thousand "degree mills" in operation, selling bogus qualifications.This isn't only harmless self-delusion, says the report, as these bought qualifications are used to gain graduate jobs, including in one case working in a nuclear power plant.It also highlights the case of Colby Nolan, a student who ostensibly gained an MBA degree in 2004, until his owner revealed that the graduate was a six-year-old cat. He had gained the equivalent of an upper second class degree.The growth of higher education as a globalised, multi-billion dollar business has also spawned a parallel opportunity for fraud, says Philip Altbach, director of the Center for International Higher Education in the Lynch School of Education at Boston College.He has described the "spectre of corruption haunting" the move towards a more internationalised higher education system.And he has called for more co-ordinated international efforts to set standards and share information.The Transparency International study says that corruption has a corrosive effect on education, raising the cost and lowering the quality."Many people wouldn't realise the extent of corruption in education, right through from the financing of education through to academic corruption," says report editor, Gareth Sweeney."In some countries it's such a serious problem that it could undermine the credibility of their education systems."There is some good news as the report highlights efforts to tackle bribery.In Chile, anti-corruption lessons have been introduced to the school curriculum and in Bangladesh there is an "integrity pledge" taken by officials.The proliferation of mobile phones in Africa is being used to allow people to expose concerns about bribery in schools.Legal advice centres have also been developed in a number of countries to help community groups make legal challenges against school corruption.There are also international efforts to improve the monitoring and tracking of education funds.But corruption is still there leaching away education budgets. It's a particularly bleak problem when there are still tens of millions of children without any access to school."Corruption is an obstacle to a fundamental human right to education," says Mr Sweeney.While there are campaigners calling for education for all, such as Malala Yousafzai in Pakistan, this report also warns of the barriers being created for the poorest communities by demands for corrupt payments.Teachers take bribes to offset poor wages or irregular payments and that in turn raises questions about the lack of funding coming from higher up the chain.Mr Sweeney says that there should be a way of measuring good governance in any future global education targets."Even when formal school fees are abolished, many households are still being forced to pay informal fees. How is a family supposed to be able to afford these costs, when they cannot afford their daily meals?," says Pauline Rose, director of Unesco's Global Monitoring Report, which tracks progress towards primary education for all."Until these hidden costs are eradicated, we will not be able to call education free, and universal primary education will continue to remain a distant goal for the poorest."</body>

      <title>Preparing for the digital afterlife</title>
      <description>Society's struggle over who owns the dead's digital files</description>

      <body>When 15-year-old Eric Rash committed suicide in 2011, his family and friends wanted to know why.In a bid to find answers, they went to Eric's Facebook account, and after failing to guess his password, appealed to the social media giant to grant them access.Facebook refused.Giving unauthorised access to someone other than the account holder, the company said, was against its privacy policy.The Rashes, who live in Virginia, tried to fight their case in court, but soon found there just wasn't any legislation that covered the management of "digital assets".The family's tragic battle is just one of many examples in which the internet has been shown to be woefully unprepared for dealing with death.In the two years since the Rashes' case, which led to the drafting of a federal law concerning the data of minors, few countries have issued clear guidance on the rights of families to access their deceased loved ones' data.And despite the fact that we put more of our lives in the cloud than ever before, few of us are preparing for our digital afterlife."We're accumulating far more digital records in our lives than we are physical ones," says Evan Carroll, who runs The Digital Beyond, a website which explores the subject of digital death."But we haven't yet entered the age where we are taking the question of what happens to those records seriously."Since Mr Carroll and his friend John Romano first raised the issue of the digital afterlife at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in 2009, some prominent companies have developed policies for dealing with deceased customers.Google has a step-by-step process allowing users to plan what they want done with their account, and will sometimes provide the contents of an email account which hasn't left specific instructions, after a "careful review".Facebook and Yahoo have taken a stricter stance, and won't hand over data without a court order, but the former allows relatives to choose whether they want to close an account or turn it into a memorial page.However many web companies are lagging behind.Cloud-based services which store our financial details, emails, music collections, social media interactions, photos and many other potentially precious items have different policies on data ownership, if indeed they have any.As a result, it is more difficult to bequeath your iTunes library to a loved one than it is to leave your CD collection to them in a shoebox.So why are we leaving our digital identities hostage to fortune?Part of the problem is that internet users have tended to be too young to be worrying about their mortality.But as the average browser gets older (the Office for National Statistics reckons almost 70% of all 65-74-year-olds in the UK are online), the idea of drafting a "digital will" is taking hold."We've seen several thousands sign up to our various membership packages," says Paul Golding, who co-launched Cirrus Legacy - a service which allows you to record login details for all your online accounts and leave instructions to a nominated guardian - just a year ago."People are beginning to realise what they could lose."Putting details of your online life in an actual will is not an option, as they are publicly accessible documents, but highlighting where they can be found is a safer bet. Although with passwords and usernames changing all the time, the challenge is to keep the information up to date.Digital estate planning, as the process of filing your details with a third party has become known, is an increasingly popular business, and many online services offer much more than simply making arrangements for accessing accounts.Some, such as My Wonderful Life, allow members to write messages to be sent to their dear ones from beyond the grave. Others, such as the ifidie Facebook app, give people the opportunity to share a posthumous joke, or record a confessional video to be released upon their demise.But it is the more conventional services offered by these companies which are proving vital to grieving families.Most of the time, families don't even know which online accounts their relative had signed up to, let alone the login details.And the cost of not knowing even a simple email password can be enormous, explains Evan Carroll."Email serves many purposes, only one of which is the digital equivalent of our mailboxes," he says. "It is the master key to many other accounts."But although leaving a list of your online accounts and passwords with a digital estate service might seem like a good solution, it is riddled with risks.Putting all your online security details in one place puts you at the mercy of a successful hacking attack. And, as Mr Golding admits, if he received "correct information" from a court of law, requiring him to hand over a list of passwords, he would "have to comply".Furthermore, using the login details left by a dead family member is potentially illegal. The terms and conditions of most established online services state that nobody other than the owner is allowed to use the account.Your loved ones may also not thank you for some posthumous revelations. Details of extra-marital affairs or a gambling addiction, which would otherwise have been taken to the grave, could be made available to mourners.But although much of the digital will-making process is still being ironed out, Mr Carroll urges people to do something, even if it is just writing a manual list and putting it in a safe place known only to a spouse."Many people say 'I don't have anything that I care about online'," he says."But you never know what will one day be of value to your family."</body>

      <body>The Independent reports that the vice-chancellor of Oxford University believes leading colleges should be allowed to raise their tuition fees to £16,000 a year to "meet the true costs" of educating their students.Professor Andrew Hamilton says Oxford's "world class education system" is being jeopardised by an annual shortfall of £70m.The paper's editorial argues that the funding gap did not start when fee changes came in two years ago and it says it is too soon to judge whether the current arrangements are working.According to the Times, students facing the prospect of higher fees are likely to turn to a new lender to help them fund their education - the "bank of gran and grandad".It says a report by an equity release group has found that an estimated 364,000 grandparents have contributed towards university fees and living costs.It predicts that by 2023, 1.7 million people will have dipped into their savings to help their grandchildren avoid graduating with heavy debts.Both the Express and the Mirror lead with the news that the mother of Madeleine McCann has applied to appear in court in Portugal in her libel action against a former Portuguese detective.Kate McCann is said to be desperate to defend herself against claims that she and husband Gerry covered up the death of their daughter in an accident.The Daily Express says she is expected to use new evidence uncovered by Scotland Yard which will be revealed in a Crimewatch special on Monday.The Daily Mirror says she hopes that "giving an emotional account" will help to win the case.A group of charities has written a letter to the Daily Telegraph urging members of the House of Lords to support changes in the law that would ensure people in foster care receive support beyond the age of 18.The chief executives of the NSPCC, Barnardo's and the Children's Society, among others, say care leavers are "more likely to be unemployed, single parents, mental health service users, homeless or in prison".The charities say allowing people to remain with their foster carers until they are 21 "makes financial and moral sense".Many of the papers reserve space for Professor Peter Higgs, the physicist awarded the Nobel Prize for proposing the existence of a particle that helps explain how matter formed after the big bang."It's the boson what won it" is the headline in the Sun.There is also much head-scratching over the whereabouts of the scientist, who is described by the Guardian as being "as elusive as the Higgs boson".The paper explains how Prof Higgs has "disappeared off on holiday without a mobile phone" to escape the media attention.The Daily Mail says the man who "solved one of the greatest mysteries in the universe" is at the centre of one himself after vanishing into a black hole where even the Nobel Prize officials could not find him.The Times says there are rumours that Professor Higgs may have retreated to the Cairngorms, the spot where he came up with his theory 50 years ago.</body>

      <title>Why Iran takes issue with the Holocaust</title>
      <description>Why Iran's position on the Holocaust is still controversial</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24442723</url>
      <date>1381276636</date>
      <body>When Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was Iranian president, one issue which continually antagonised and offended abroad was his statements questioning the scale of the Holocaust, or whether it had even happened at all.The new administration under Hassan Rouhani has taken a softer line, but as BBC Persian's Bozorgmehr Sharafedin explains, Iran's position on the Holocaust continues to be controversial.One key question which President Rouhani kept being asked during his round of media appearances in New York last month was where he stood on the Holocaust.His responses were careful but did not satisfy everyone that Iran is no longer in the business of Holocaust denial or revisionism.President Rouhani said the Holocaust was a "reprehensible and condemnable crime".But as many people listening to his interviews on the fringe of the UN General Assembly pointed out, he did not say whether he concurred with the mainstream acceptance of the Holocaust meaning the killing by the Nazis of six million Jews.That, his critics say, shows that he has not closed the door entirely on those in the Islamic Republic who claim the number of victims of the Nazi extermination camps has been exaggerated.'What the Nazis did is condemned," said Mr Rouhani. "But the aspects that you talk about, clarification of these aspects is a duty of the historians and researchers. I am not a history scholar.'His Foreign Minister, Mohammed Javad Zarif, has been more outspoken.A US-educated diplomat who has served for years as Iran's representative at the United Nations, Mr Zarif clearly sees how much the issue has damaged Iran's international reputation."Iran never denied [the Holocaust]," he tweeted in an exchange with Christine Pelosi, the daughter of Nancy Pelosi, Minority Leader of the US House of Representatives."The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone."Mr Zarif was clearly referring to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who, during his presidency, frequently claimed the Holocaust was a myth. But does the departure of Mr Ahmadinejad mean the end of Holocaust denial in Iran?Ayatollah Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran who decides on the foreign policy, has repeatedly referred to the Holocaust as a distorted historical event and he is still in power.Iran and Israel had good relations under the Shah. The 1979 Islamic Revolution ushered in a new period of anti-Israel hostility, but this was not accompanied by any attempt to deny the Holocaust.In fact during the Iran-Iraq war (1980-88), Tehran found many Western films about World War II quite inspiring for the nation and national television was full of programmes sympathising with the victims of the war, including the Jews.The first Iranian official to cast doubt on the Holocaust was actually Ayatollah Khamenei.In January 2002, he referred to gas chambers in concentration camps as a story about which its truth was "not clear" and which was being used as "Zionist propaganda" to gain the sympathy of the world.Mr Ahmadinejad followed this line and in 2005, in his first year in office, called the Nazi extermination of the Jews "a myth"."The Holocaust used to be something you only read about in history books in Iran," says Mehdi Khalaji, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy."It was Ahmadinejad who brought this term into Tehran's political literature and made it one of the elements of his foreign policy. During his tenure Iran wanted to threaten Israel and it was the safest way."Meir Javedanfar, an Israeli expert on Iran and the Middle East who was born and raised in Tehran, believes Mr Ahmadinejad made Holocaust denial a key tenet of his foreign policy for two reasons."Firstly, he wanted to distinguish himself from his predecessor, Mohammad Khatami, who became a world figure by proposing the idea of dialogue between the civilisations and religions to the UN," he told the BBC."Secondly, he thought denying the Holocaust would be an existential blow to Israel. But he didn't realise denying the Holocaust would be perceived as anti-Semitic rather than anti-Israeli.'During Mr Ahmadinejad's tenure, there were efforts to try to show that Iran was not anti-Semitic.Probably the most high profile was a very expensive and well-produced Iranian television series, called Zero Degree Turn - which was in essence an Iranian version of Schindler's List.It was based on a real life story about an Iranian diplomat who saved Jews in 1940s Paris during the Nazi Occupation by giving out Iranian passports and allowing them refuge in the Iranian Embassy.But Mr Ahmadinejad continued his Holocaust denial rhetoric, despite the international backlash, as he thought he had found the Achilles heel of Israel.In December 2006 he ordered the foreign ministry to hold a two-day conference to review the Holocaust. Information obtained by the BBC shows many people at the ministry were frustrated by this order."Holocaust denial has been common in the Arab world for decades, but Ahmadinejad's ideology was mainly rooted in revisionist scholars in the West," says Mehdi Khalaji."That's why the anti-Holocaust conference in Tehran was mainly attended by Westerners and even some neo-Nazis and members of the Ku Klux Klan rather than Islamists.""Ahmadinejad thought he had managed to put unprecedented pressure on Israel," says Meir Javedanfar. "But he failed to notice he was only making the Israeli stance on Iran's nuclear programme stronger."President Rouhani and his team have made it clear that they want to put the rhetoric of the Ahmadinejad years behind them, as they attempt to find a solution to the standoff over Iran's nuclear programme.In an interview with ABC News at the end of September, Iran's foreign minister described the Holocaust as a "heinous crime" and said that the remarks by Ayatollah Khamenei about the Holocaust had been mistranslated and taken out of context."Ayatollah Khamenei has called the Holocaust a myth, but it's unlikely that he would deny the foreign minister's claim," says Mehdi Khalaji."Ahmadinejad is the scapegoat now. In the Islamic Republic's tradition, officials usually deny their previous statements, not explicitly, but by putting the blame either on translators or reporters. Mistranslation, in Iranian diplomacy, usually means giving up.'</body>

      <body>The English Defence League (EDL) began life as a street movement in opposition to Islamist extremists who protested against British troops in 2009 in Luton.It has stayed on the streets, its marches attended by men and women who say they are working class, and anti-Muslim.But the EDL has rarely been able to mobilise thousands for its marches. And often the hundreds who have turned out have been met by similar numbers of anti-racist campaigners.It has struggled ideologically too. There has been growing tension between supporters who appear to oppose all Muslims and the EDL's leaders who say they only oppose Muslim extremists.It has been suggested the leadership has "marketed" the EDL in this way, in contrast to the views of most of its members.Officially the EDL denies being racist, and rejects the suggestion it is of the far right.The group says it does not condemn all Muslims, and Tommy Robinson has said he does not "want to lead a war against all Muslims".However, in the past, he has talked about "Muslim communities feeling the full force of the EDL" - a comment he explained by suggesting this would be through democratic processes, not violence.For its part the British National Party appears to believe the EDL's leadership has not been radical enough.An article on its website states: "As genuine nationalists we have deep ideological differences with the EDL leaders who openly support the ethno-cultural genocide of the indigenous English through mass colonisation and multi-racialism."This tension is probably the best explanation as to why twelve senior members of the EDL have now left.Mr Robinson appears to have decided that a street movement that seems to confront all Muslims is not changing minds.But there is another explanation. EDL members say the personal pressure on Tommy Robinson in particular has been intense.In the wake of the stabbing of Lee Rigby in Woolwich, Mr Robinson tweeted that he'd received 200 death threats, including to cut off his head.He told BBC Radio 5Live that when supporters threatened to bomb mosques he would be blamed "when I pick my kids up from school". He insisted "that's not what I stand for".That pressure may simply have got to him.The anti-extremism group Quilliam appears to have played its part too.It has suggested that there is a negative symbiotic relationship between far-right extremism and Islamism, and this argument appears to have helped convince Tommy Robinson to make his announcement - through Quilliam itself.It is not yet clear in what ways the group has engaged with Mr Robinson and other EDL members.Their departure has weakened the movement, and its mobilisation of anti-Muslim working class sentiment.It remains to be seen if new leaders will emerge, or whether the EDL will melt away, leaving the British National Party alone on the right.</body>

      <title>Failings found in border safeguards</title>
      <description>A report highlights a series of failings in the government's £500m "e-borders" programme to gather information on passenger movements in and out of the UK.</description>

      <date>1381300904</date>
      <body>A report has found failings in the government's £500m "e-borders" scheme to gather information on passenger movements in and out of the UK.The independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, John Vine, found that fewer than two-thirds of passenger movements were covered.And almost 650,000 records relating to smuggling had been deleted, he found.The Home Office said UK border technology was the most advanced in Europe but agreed there was more to do.The aim of the e-borders programme, devised by the Home Office in 2003, was to improve immigration controls by collecting advanced passenger information (API) on every scheduled inbound and outbound journey to and from the UK.That would enable staff to "export the border" - preventing passengers from travelling where this was considered a threat to the UK.A target was set to collect data on at least 95% of passenger movements by December 2010 but, at the time of the inspection last year, only 65% were being recorded.The report, parts of which are deleted from the public version, said: "We found that the e-borders programme had failed to deliver the planned increases in API and this had a detrimental impact on the delivery of all anticipated benefits."It blamed legal difficulties surrounding the collection of API on European flights and a failure to test the e-borders concept on train and sea routes.Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Vine said people with an alert against their name for "terrorist sympathy or activity" should be met at airport arrivals gates by border staff, but that was only being done at Heathrow among Britain's airports.He also said the e-Borders system was supposed to stop people flying to the UK if they had previously been excluded or deported from the country, but "not one person" had been stopped under that system.This method of stopping people flying when they tried to check in at foreign airports was supposed to be a "key benefit" of e-Borders, Mr Vine added.The Home Office said it now carried out advance checks on 78% of those flying to Britain and required API from everyone coming from outside the EU.Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: "We have the best coverage of any country in Europe but we are working to improve our coverage further."We will take the findings of the independent inspector into account as we continue to develop our API policies and coverage."Inspectors found that the data set was not extensive enough for the e-borders programme to meet another objective - to "count in and out" all foreign national passengers - and that this wouldn't be possible until 2018 at the earliest.The report, which contains 14 recommendations, also criticised the "poor quality" of data on watch lists used by the e-borders system to alert border staff of criminals, terrorists and other suspects.It said this created inefficiencies and a greater volume of work which officials were unable to manage."This, coupled with a policy of prioritising immigration work over customs work, resulted in the deletion... of over 649,000 records concerning potential drug and tobacco smuggling, over a 10-month period," the report said.It said the deletions had a "significant impact on the ability of staff at the border to seize prohibited and restricted goods and deal with those responsible."However, the Home Office played down the importance of the information that had been deleted, saying that anyone who had committed a serious offence would already be on a separate "warnings index" and intercepted on arrival.Officials said the details that had been removed were potential matches between two databases, less than 1% of which would have prompted an alert.Among a series of positive findings, inspectors said information gathered as a result of the e-borders scheme had resulted in the arrest of thousands of people for offences including murder and rape.Immigration caseworkers were able to conduct travel history searches using the data and identify people who had left the UK after being ordered to do so.Mr Vine said he was pleased that the e-borders "high-profile alerts" system was being used to intercept high-risk individuals at the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport - but pointed out that this was not happening at any other port or airport.He suggested that a fundamental re-think was needed for the programme, which, it is estimated, will cost £536m by 2015.Mr Vine said: "The Home Office should now define clearly what the aims of the e-borders programme are ahead of the new procurement exercise, and be transparent about what e-borders will deliver and by when."</body>

      <body>A pilot who fell ill at the controls of his plane forcing his passenger to land the light aircraft has died, police have said.The man collapsed in the cockpit of the plane after taking off, leaving the "inexperienced" passenger to make an emergency landing.The plane landed at Humberside Airport under the guidance of instructors called in by air traffic controllers.Police said they were unable to confirm the cause of death.A spokesman for Humberside Police said: "The pilot of the plane sadly died last night."We are not treating it as suspicious and we are in a position whereby formal identification will take place later today."He added that a file would be prepared for the coroner.Police, fire and ambulance crews were called to the North Lincolnshire airport after a distress call was made from the light aircraft.Two flying instructors were called in to advise the passenger how to bring the plane down.One of them, Roy Murray, said: "I think without any sort of talk-down he would have just gone into the ground and that would have been the end of it."The passenger and pilot were the only people on board the aircraft, which had taken off from Sandtoft Airfield 25 miles (40km) away.Eyewitnesses described seeing sparks as the plane landed at about 19:50 BST on Tuesday.Stuart Sykes said he saw the aircraft land: "It came down with a bump, a bump, a bump, hit the front end down, I heard some crashing and it's come to a halt."Two incoming flights were delayed while the aircraft was removed from the runway.</body>

      <title>Queen launches Games baton relay</title>
      <description>The Queen is to begin the baton relay which will visit all 70 competing nations and territories ahead of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.</description>

      <date>1381273822</date>
      <body>The Queen is to begin the baton relay which will visit all 70 competing nations and territories ahead of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.The baton will contain the Queen's hand-written message to the Commonwealth.Unlike the Olympic Torch, there is just one baton and it will visit every country taking part in the Games, which begin on 23 July 2014.The 288-day relay starts from Buckingham Palace in London.It will travel to Scotland on Thursday before heading for its first international port-of-call in India on 11 October.The baton will visit the big Commonwealth countries such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, South Africa, Malaysia, Australia, Kenya, Ghana, Jamaica and Canada.And also smaller destinations, including Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, St Kitts and Nevis and the Falklands Islands.It will not now visit The Gambia, which last week withdrew from the Commonwealth, saying it will "never be a member of any neo-colonial institution".The relay arrives back in the UK in May next year, visiting Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Northern Ireland, Wales and England before a 40-day tour of Scotland in the run-up to the start of the Games.The final relay runner hands the baton, which contains the sealed, hand-written scroll, back to the Queen at the opening ceremony.About 200 invited guests will attend the event to mark the start of the relay, which will involve Commonwealth Games Federation president Prince Tunku Imran and Lord Smith of Kelvin, the chairman of Glasgow's games organising committee.Scottish Olympians Sir Chris Hoy and Allan Wells will take part in a ceremony which will see the Queen beginning the baton relay.Sprint legend Wells, winner of two Commonwealth golds and the 100m Olympic sprint title at the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games, will be the first athlete to receive the baton from the Queen and start it on its journey.He said: "As the final runner of the Queen's Baton Relay (QBR) at the last Commonwealth Games on Scottish soil in Edinburgh in 1986, the baton and what it symbolises is incredibly special for me."It is a real honour for me to now be named as the first baton-bearer for the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games."Sir Chris, a six-time Gold Olympian and double Commonwealth Gold medallist, will escort the baton as it makes the processional journey down the Mall, accompanied by pipers, to the ceremony itself.Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said: "The start of the Queen's Baton Relay, with two of Scotland's greatest-ever athletes, is another step towards what will be a momentous year for Scotland."2014 promises the greatest-ever Games and the relay will provide a fantastic celebration of sport and culture across the Commonwealth, with Glasgow and Scotland at its heart."The baton will spend an average of one to four days in each nation, with an extended duration of seven days in Wales, two weeks in England and 40 days in Scotland.The designers of the baton said the message from the Queen was "pivotal" and they were keen it should not be "hidden away".The baton has a lattice design, made from layers of titanium fused together by laser, which means the message is visible.The parchment, handmade in Glasgow using linen and plant fibre, is also "dramatically" illuminated by LED lights within a transparent cylinder to make the sealed scroll easier to see.The brief for designers stated that the baton should be easily handed from person to person, should weigh no more than 2kg and must be able to withstand all weathers for the 10-month relay.The baton's handle is made of elm wood sourced from the grounds of Garrison House on the Isle of Cumbrae and was constructed using a boatbuilding technique called bird-mouthing, which means it is light, strong and durable.The top of the baton contains a granite "gemstone" which will be detached by opening a puzzle mechanism and given as gift to each nation and territory.The gems are made of water-resistant granite unique to Scotland and were sourced from Ailsa Craig in the Firth of Clyde.Glasgow 2014 will be the 20th Commonwealth Games and will feature 17 sports in 11 days of competition, with 261 medal events.The Commonwealth of Nations has 54 members, but 70 teams participate in the Commonwealth Games because a number of British overseas territories, Crown dependencies and island states compete under their own flag.The UK nations - Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland - compete separately in the Commonwealth Games, as do the smaller home territories such as Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.The first Queen's Baton Relay was staged for the 1958 Commonwealth Games in Cardiff and has been the curtain raiser to the Games ever since.But until 1998, the relay would only travel through England and the host nation.By 2002, in Manchester, it was covering 100,000km and visiting 23 nations.Melbourne 2006 was the first baton relay to visit all the nations which sent teams to the Games.The baton's journey around the globe will be documented by adventurer and broadcaster Mark Beaumont for the BBC.</body>

      <title>MI5 chief warns of threat to public</title>
      <description>Thousands of Islamist extremists in the UK see the British public as a legitimate target for attacks, the director general of MI5 warns.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24454596</url>
      <date>1381282153</date>
      <body>Thousands of Islamist extremists in the UK see the British public as a legitimate target for attacks, the director general of MI5 has warned.Andrew Parker was making his first public speech since taking over as head of the UK Security Service in April.Al-Qaeda and its affiliates in Pakistan and Yemen present "the most direct and immediate threats to the UK," he said.He also warned of the damage done to British security by the leaking of classified documents from GCHQ.Addressing the Royal United Services Institute in Whitehall, Mr Parker added the security services must have access to the many means of communication which terrorists now use.Threats to the UK are growing more diverse and diffuse, he said, but warned: "It remains the case that there are several thousand Islamist extremists here who see the British public as a legitimate target."He explained that "knowing of an individual does not equate to knowing everything about them"."Being on our radar does not necessarily mean being under our microscope," he said."The reality of intelligence work in practice is that we only focus the most intense intrusive attention on a small number of cases at any one time."The challenge therefore concerns making choices between multiple and competing demands to give us the best chance of being in the right place at the right time to prevent terrorism."Mr Parker added: "We are not perfect, and there are always things we can learn, do better and sharpen up on."With 30 years in MI5, Mr Parker was previously deputy director general and before that director of its counter-terrorism division at the time of the London bombings in 2005.In his speech, he named al-Qaeda and its affiliates in south Asia and the Arabian peninsula as presenting "the most direct and immediate threats to the UK".By that he meant primarily its elements in Pakistan and separately in Yemen, from where al-Qaeda has three times succeeded in smuggling explosives past security on to planes in the last four years.Referring to the ongoing conflict in Syria, he said a growing proportion of MI5's casework concerned individuals from the UK who had travelled to fight there.He said extremist Sunni groups in Syria were aspiring to attack Western countries.This has long been a concern of Western governments - that British-based jihadists will one day return from the killing fields of Syria and turn their new-found skills on the population back home.A number of people have been stopped at airports and some have been arrested on suspicion of terrorism."For the future, there is good reason to be concerned about Syria," he said.Mr Parker said 330 people had been convicted of terrorism-related offences in Britain between 11 September 2001 and 31 March 2013.He added that in the first few months of this year, there had been four major trials related to terrorist plots.Chillingly, he reminded the public that these included plans for a 7/7-style attack with rucksack bombs, and named two other plots.There were guilty pleas in each case, he said, with 24 terrorists convicted and sentenced to more than 260 years in jail.Mr Parker's speech also went on to reveal some of the fears and frustrations his service was experiencing over both the advances in technology and those who leak government secrets into the public domain.He warned that terrorists now had tens of thousands of means of communication "through e-mail, IP telephony, in-game communication, social networking, chat rooms, anonymising services and a myriad of mobile apps".Mr Parker said it was vital for MI5 - and by inference its partner GCHQ - to retain the capability to access such information if the Security Service was to protect the country.Intelligence officials in both the US and Britain have been absolutely dismayed at the wealth of secret data taken by the former CIA contractor Edward Snowden when he fled to Russia.Some 58,000 of the files are from GCHQ, whose intelligence, Mr Parker said, had played a vital role in stopping many UK terrorist plots over the past decade.Without mentioning Mr Snowden by name, he said ''it causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques".Doing this, he added, handed the advantage to the terrorists.In conclusion, Mr Parker said he did not believe the terrorist threat was any worse now than before. But it was "more diffuse, more complicated, more unpredictable".</body>

      <title>Hugh Grant warns of press 'betrayal'</title>
      <description>Actor Hugh Grant says any "further compromise" by ministers over press regulation would be a "betrayal of promises" made to victims of press abuse.</description>

      <date>1381310755</date>
      <body>Actor Hugh Grant has said any "further compromise" by ministers over press regulation would be a "betrayal of the promises" made to media abuse victims.He said the government was "terrified of the press" and was doing all it could "to oblige the press barons".On Tuesday Culture Secretary Maria Miller said newspapers' proposals for regulation had been rejected.But she suggested the government was willing to consider some of the ideas put forward by publishers.Mr Grant, a member of the Hacked Off campaign, accused senior Tories of an "abuse of democracy" by trying to "sabotage" plans for a royal charter agreed by all parties in Parliament.The report of the Leveson Inquiry into press standards recommended a tougher form of self-regulation backed by legislation, and Mr Grant said any suggestion such a system would limit free speech was "propaganda on the part of the press".He said some of the main newspaper groups "refuse to accept any system which would make them accountable for any of their actions".Mr Grant said Lord Leveson had made "very mild" recommendations but the press was determined to "mark its own homework".He said victims of press abuse, such as the families of Madeleine McCann and Milly Dowler, had been told by David Cameron that new rules would protect people from the press."Any further compromise would be a betrayal of the promises made by the secretary of state and above all by the prime minister to them," Mr Grant added.Bob Satchwell, executive director of the Society of Editors, said Ms Miller was simply talking about "tidying up" press regulation plans.He said the minister agreed with Lord Leveson that a regulation system forced on the press without its consent would be "unworkable".On Tuesday Ms Miller announced that the Privy Council - an ancient body which advises the Queen, mostly made up of senior politicians - had rejected press proposals for a royal charter.She referred to principles in the Leveson report such as independence and access to arbitration and said an alternative plan would now be "improved", adding that ministers were said to be willing to consider some of the industry's ideas.Changes will now be made to the alternative plan backed by politicians and campaigners, and the Privy Council's decision is expected on 30 October.Roger Alton, executive editor of the Times, later said newspapers could take legal action in the European courts against new rules.He told the BBC's Newsnight programme the proposed system would be an "unjust law"."What we don't want to have is a statutory body because that is essentially the end of 300 years of a free press," he said.Mr Alton appeared on Newsnight in a personal capacity, not as a representative of his newspaper.Options for the self-regulation of the press were proposed in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry, set up in July 2011 after it emerged journalists working for the now-closed News of the World had hacked into the mobile phone of murdered Surrey schoolgirl Milly Dowler.Political involvement:"Recognition" panel:Appointments process:Corrections and apologies:Arbitration:</body>

      <title>Home Office 'Go home' adverts banned</title>
      <description>The Advertising Standards Authority bans a Home Office mobile advert telling illegal immigrants to "go home or face arrest".</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24452551</url>
      <date>1381308334</date>
      <body>The advertising watchdog has banned a Home Office advert telling illegal immigrants to go home, saying it was misleading.But the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) cleared the campaign of being offensive and irresponsible.The campaign saw two vans drive around London for a week in July, carrying the message "Go home or face arrest."The ASA said the posters on the vans referred to inaccurate arrest statistics.It received 224 complaints about the vans from individuals, campaign groups, legal academics and the Labour peer Lord Lipsey.During the campaign, the advertising vans drove around the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Barnet, Brent, Ealing and Hounslow, some of the most diverse areas of the capital where it is thought a lot of illegal immigrants live and work.The poster displayed a picture of handcuffs and read: "In the UK illegally?... GO HOME OR FACE ARREST."ASA chief executive Guy Parker told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the campaign was considered unlikely to cause "widespread offence".But he said the phrase "go home" was "reminiscent of the racist slogan" and "clearly carries baggage".He added: "It clearly upset some people and I think it might be wise, if the government uses the poster van again, to perhaps think about using a different phrase - like return home."The campaign split the coalition, with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg saying Liberal Democrat ministers had not known about them in advance.Business Secretary Vince Cable said the campaign was "stupid and offensive".The advert said there had been 106 arrests in the area in the past week and encouraged illegal immigrants to contact immigration officials for information on how they could be helped to leave the country.In its ruling, the ASA said the reference to the number of arrests was misleading because it did not relate to those detained in the specific areas where people would have seen the vans.It said the figure referred to arrests which occurred across a large part of north London more than two weeks before the campaign began."The ad must not appear again in its current form," said the ASA report."We told the Home Office to ensure that in future they held adequate substantiation for their advertising claims and that qualifications were presented clearly."But it dismissed complaints that the slogan "Go home" had been offensive or irresponsible. It said that, while the phrase had been used in the past to attack immigrants, the Home Office was now using it in a different context.The report said: "We concluded that the poster was unlikely to incite or exacerbate racial hatred and tensions in multi-cultural communities."It was not irresponsible and did not contain anything which was likely to condone or encourage violence or anti-social behaviour."Ministers have not clarified if or when the ad vans will be used again and they have not published any data on whether the campaign led to an increase in illegal immigrants turning themselves in.However, a Home Office spokesman said: "We are pleased the ASA has concluded that our pilot was neither offensive nor irresponsible."We have always been clear that this campaign was about encouraging illegal immigrants to leave the country voluntarily and was not targeted at particular racial or ethnic groups."In respect of the ASA's other findings, we can confirm that the poster will not be used again in its current format."</body>

      <title>Power to raise rail fares curbed</title>

      <date>1381274115</date>
      <body>The rail industry's power to increase fares in England is to be curbed as part of a government drive to overhaul the rail fare system.Until now, some regulated fares could potentially have gone up by 9.1% next January.They will now be capped at 6.1%.But campaigners say it is not enough, and point out that commuters will still have to pay an above- inflation increase next year.Regulated fares are those which the government controls, and include season tickets, "anytime" single tickets around major cities, and off-peak inter-city return tickets.They will go up in 2014 by an average of 4.1%, a number calculated using an average of inflation - as measured by the retail prices index (RPI) for July - plus 1%.Train companies can add up to 5% on top of the average rise, although fares that go up by more than the average must be balanced by others that rise by less or fall.The government plans to limit that extra increase to 2% in the future. But the provision for the average regulated ticket price to go up by 1% more than inflation remains.The move is part of the government's Fares and Ticketing review being published by the Transport Secretary, Patrick McLoughlin.The review will also detail a pilot scheme that could see all long-distance rail tickets sold on a single-leg basis, not as returns.The government says this could allow passengers to more easily "mix and match" different ticket types when planning a return journey.Other plans to be revealed by the Transport Secretary include:Mary Creagh, the shadow transport secretary, said the new cap on fares would be "cold comfort for commuters"."It has taken 18 months, delivers fare increases of up to 6% and is too little too late," she said."This announcement doesn't go as far as Labour's plans which would prevent train companies from increasing fares beyond one per cent above inflation."</body>

      <title>£600m in major projects unveiled</title>
      <description>More than £600m is to be handed out towards major projects in a bid to stimulate the economy in Wales, as local councils reel from cutbacks in funding from the Welsh government.</description>

      <body>More than £600m is to be handed out towards major projects in a bid to stimulate the economy in Wales.It includes £62m for the South Wales Metro transport project and £140m for a help-to-buy housing scheme.Finance Minister Jane Hutt says it will create or sustain 11,000 jobs and tackle poverty.The announcement comes a day after she unveiled big cuts for councils and in other areas to pay for a £570m increase in the health budget.One senior council figure warned some local authorities could "go bust".Ms Hutt announced a series of capital spending commitments, including:Ms Hutt said: "The tough economic conditions continue but I am determined to use every pound available to invest in infrastructure and boost economic growth in the long-term."Councils were still reeling from Tuesday's funding announcement by Ms Hutt and the likely knock-on on services such as leisure centres and libraries.Local government spending will fall from £4.648bn this year to £4.466bn next year, a cut in cash terms of 3.91% or 5.81% in real terms.Their budgets will be around 9% lower in real terms between now and 2015-16.Councillor Russell Goodway, cabinet member for finance on Cardiff council - Wales' largest local authority - said: "I think there will be some local authorities in Wales that will go bust in the next two or three years. They will run out of money."From where I am sitting we are in a very dark place this morning and I don't think that some local authorities are going to survive."He told BBC Radio Wales that Cardiff has to save £20m this year which it was struggling to achieve let alone the £50m in cuts it needs to find in 2014-15."Even if we stopped spending every single penny that we spend on discretionary services that would not be enough to cut our spending. We have got to find different ways of doing things."Steve Thomas, chief executive of the Welsh Local Government Association said the cuts will affect services."It's a very tough budget and it's £175m coming out of council services," he told BBC Wales."We can't keep delivering the range of services that we're currently delivering so it will impact on things such as leisure services, libraries, refuse collections and the conditions of our roads."We run something like 735 services so there's going to be a massive impact for the Welsh public."He added: "We're not the number one priority and clearly what has happened is with the mixture of Westminster cuts and the prioritisation of health spending, local government has become in effect the poor relation in terms of this budget."Mr Thomas said one way of making up the shortfall would be to raise council tax - he did not expect any councils to freeze their rates next year."We've yet to see the local government settlement but once we see it, I think there will be more pressure on the council tax," he said."It is a source of income but I think we've got to consult the public and see what services they want to prioritise."We've got three years to make these cuts and it's going to be a very tough period for local authorities to do that."In announcing her draft budget, Ms Hutt said it was not possible to "shield" all services from UK government spending cuts.She stressed the priority was to protect health, schools and universal benefits such as free prescriptions, school breakfasts and bus passes for older people.</body>

      <title>Plane noise 'link' to heart disease</title>
      <description>The risks of stroke, heart and circulatory disease are higher in areas which have a lot of aircraft noise, researchers have found.</description>

      <body>The risks of stroke, heart and circulatory disease are higher in areas with a lot of aircraft noise, researchers say.Their study of 3.6 million residents near Heathrow Airport suggested the risks were 10-20% higher in areas with the highest levels of aircraft noise.The team's findings are published in the British Medical Journal.They agreed with other experts that noise was not necessarily to blame and more work was needed.Their work suggests a higher risk for both hospital admissions and deaths from stroke, heart and circulatory disease for the 2% of the study - about 70,000 people - who lived where the aircraft noise was loudest.The lead author, Dr Anna Hansell, from Imperial College London, said: "The exact role that noise exposure may play in ill health is not well established."However, it is plausible that it might be contributing - for example, by raising blood pressure or by disturbing people's sleep.""There's a 'startle reaction' to loud noise - if you're suddenly exposed to it, the heart rate and blood pressure increase."And aircraft noise can be annoying for some people, which can also affect their blood pressure, leading to illness."The relative importance of daytime and night-time noise from aircraft also needs to be investigated further."The study used data about noise levels in 2001 from the Civil Aviation Authority, covering 12 London boroughs and nine districts outside of London where aircraft noise exceeds 50 decibels - about the volume of a normal conversation in a quiet room.The authors say fewer people are now affected by the highest levels of noise (above 63 decibels) - despite more planes being in the skies - because of changes in aircraft design and flight plans.The researchers - from Imperial and also King's College London - adjusted their work in an effort to eliminate other factors that might have a relationship with stroke and heart disease, such as deprivation, South Asian ethnicity and smoking-related illness.They stressed that the higher risk of illness related to aircraft noise remained much less significant than the risks from lifestyle factors - including smoking, a lack of exercise or poor diet.In an accompanying editorial, Prof Stephen Stansfeld, from Queen Mary University of London, said: "These results imply that the siting of airports and consequent exposure to aircraft noise may have direct effects on the health of the surrounding population."Planners need to take this into account when expanding airports in heavily populated areas or planning new airports."The study covered 12 London boroughs in the centre and west of the capital - and nine council districts beyond London, including Windsor and Maidenhead, Slough and Wokingham.Heathrow Airport's director of sustainability, Matt Gorman, said: "We are already taking significant steps to tackle the issue of noise."We are charging airlines more for noisier aircraft, offering insulation and double glazing to local residents and are working with noise campaigners to give people predictable periods of respite from noise."Together these measures have meant that the number of people affected by noise has fallen by 90% since the 1970s, despite the number of flights almost doubling."A government spokesman said: "The number of people affected by high levels of noise around Heathrow has been falling for years due to improvements in aviation technology, better planning of flight paths and other factors. We would expect to see this trend continue."A separate study, also published on Wednesday in the BMJ, demonstrates a higher rate of admission to hospital with cardiovascular problems for people living near 89 airports in the US.Prof Kevin McConway, from the Open University, said: "Both of these studies are thorough and well-conducted. But, even taken together, they don't prove that aircraft noise actually causes heart disease and strokes."A major difficulty in interpreting what these studies tell us is that they are based on data for geographical areas, not for individual people."Over the coming months, Public Health England will recruit experts to further examine the public health issues around exposure to noise.</body>

      <title>Extension sought for badger cull</title>
      <description>The original targets for culling badgers are changed as new, more accurate information on population numbers becomes available.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24443110</url>
      <date>1381299980</date>
      <body>A pilot badger cull in west Somerset may be extended by up to three weeks as marksmen have failed to kill enough badgers to reach their target.Sources at Defra say that 850 badgers have been shot in the area over the six-week trial, just over 40% of an initial target of 2,081.But those sources insist the Somerset scheme has proven to be effective.They say new population data means there are far fewer badgers in the pilot area than originally thought.The controversial pilot culls set out to study if badgers could be killed safely, effectively and humanely.It is being carried out in an attempt to control TB in cattle, which can be spread by badgers, though opponents say it will have no impact.The plan was to kill 70% of the badgers in the areas of west Somerset and Gloucestershire by free shooting.Across both regions this meant around 5,000 badgers were to be killed in total.But Defra sources said these targets were based on population estimates from 2012 that have proved to be highly inaccurate."We have high confidence that between 2012 and 2013, there has been a decline in the badger population in both areas," said a source.As the cull started, hundreds of hair traps were set so that DNA could be extracted and analysed to give a more up-to-date assessment of badger numbers.In west Somerset, the population, which had been estimated at 2,400, has now been revised downwards to 1,450. In Gloucestershire, the numbers have been lowered from 3,400 to 2,350.There are a number of reasons behind the apparent decline according to Defra, including the impact of last winter's bad weather, disease and lack of food.As a result, the targets for culling have also been revised downwards to around 2,600 for both areas combined.To kill 70% of the badgers now estimated to live in west Somerset, the culling company needed to kill 1,015 badgers.After six weeks of shooting, they achieved 59%, and the company is now seeking an extension of its licence for another two to three weeks.Peter Kendall, president of the National Farmers' Union, said the number of badgers to be killed had been reduced because it was important not to "wipe out" entire populations.He told BBC Breakfast the marksmen needed "a few more weeks" to "meet the best criteria that the scientists have set"."Last year 38,000 cattle were killed and we've got to do something about the spread of this ghastly disease," he added.Asked why the desired number of badgers had not been killed, especially given the lower total population now estimated, Mr Kendall said these were pilot schemes and those involved are "learning as we go".He said there had been some "protester activity" and all shooting had been stopped whenever a person has been "spotted in a vicinity", though he said the protesters were not the reason the target number had not been reached.Defra sources believe that even on the lower figures, the exercise has been effective."This level of culling is a significant culling of the badger population and sufficient to achieve cattle disease benefits at the start of a four-year... period," the source said.There was a "possibility" that the company carrying out the Gloucestershire cull will also seek an extension.Reports in recent days suggested that the exercise in west Somerset was in trouble, with a Conservative MP admitting it had not worked as well as hoped.</body>

      <title>UK industry output in surprise fall</title>
      <description>UK industrial production fell unexpectedly in August, showing its biggest decline for nearly a year, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics.</description>

      <body>UK industrial production fell unexpectedly in August, showing its biggest decline for nearly a year, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Industrial output decreased by 1.1% month-on-month, surprising analysts, who had expected a 0.4% rise.The biggest factor in the decline was a big fall in manufacturing output, which was 1.2% down on July levels.It was the biggest overall drop in output since September 2012.At the same time, the ONS published figures showing that the UK trade deficit was largely unchanged in August.The gap between imports and exports for the month was estimated at £3.3bn, compared with £3.4bn in July.The decrease in UK manufacturing output was led by companies making pharmaceutical products, electronics, food and beverages.But other sectors also contributed to the surprise fall in overall output, with the oil and gas industry also underperforming.Private-sector surveys of production have been less downbeat. Last week, the Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for September indicated that UK manufacturing had grown for the sixth consecutive month.Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturers' organisation EEF, described the latest ONS figures as "a mixed bag of data which breaks the run of consistently upbeat indicators in recent months".She added: "Whilst August unwound some of the gains in June and July, the declines were particularly concentrated in a few sectors, namely food, pharmaceuticals and electronics."However, the trade news was a little more positive, with exports edging higher, thanks to gains in markets outside Europe."Despite this monthly setback on production, manufacturing should make a positive contribution to third-quarter GDP growth and other business surveys seem to align behind a continuation of this trend through the final months of the year."However, Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency brokers World First, said the figures were "a further sign that the UK's economic revival cannot be guaranteed"."While the IMF may have sung the UK's praises [on Tuesday], today's number shows that the broad-based recovery that so many have been hailing has significant tasks attached," he said."The divergence between the recent, multi-year highs on PMIs and the official data is worrying and a little difficult to explain. Could businesses be overly exuberant without cause?"</body>

      <body>NHS and care services patients need to become more demanding and fight for their rights, a new watchdog body says.Healthwatch England, which heads up a network of 152 local patient bodies, urged the public to become "savvy consumers" rather than "grateful patients".To help, the watchdog set out eight core rights for patients.It comes after polling indicated half of people who experienced poor care did not report it.The survey of more than 2,000 people found one in five had experienced poor care - but of those, 54% had not complained.Healthwatch England was created under the shake-up of the NHS earlier this year.It is envisaged that the organisation will act as a patients' champion, carrying out its own investigations and speaking out about issues of concern.This is its first report to Parliament, and it has used it to highlight the deference shown by patients.Healthwatch England chairwoman Anna Bradley said: "We all need to stop acting like grateful patients and care users and start to see ourselves as savvy consumers, insisting on our right to safe, dignified and high quality care."To help achieve that, the organisation has set out its list of rights:Ms Bradley added: "Consumer rights are second nature to us on the High Street, but by thinking this way we can ensure people have a voice at the heart of the health and social care system."Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb said he welcomed the initiative."Without real and meaningful input from patients, it is impossible for health and care services to improve and move forward in the future," he added.</body>

      <title>University regulation 'inadequate'</title>
      <description>A lack of regulation of England's universities means students are at risk of attending failing institutions, the Higher Education Commission says.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24447151</url>
      <date>1381281659</date>
      <body>A lack of regulation of England's universities means students are at risk of attending failing institutions, the Higher Education Commission (HEC) says.The HEC says current checks are not adequate for a sector that has a new funding system in the wake of higher tuition fees introduced last year.It says the situation could threaten the UK's higher education reputation.The government says a "robust but proportionate" regulatory system is needed.The HEC - an independent body made up of leaders from the education sector, business and the three main political parties - conducted its research over an eight-month period and concludes that current regulation is too "piecemeal".The commission says that the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce), which distributes the teaching grant to universities, was previously able to attach regulatory conditions to the grant.But now that the teaching grant has been reduced and is being replaced with increased student tuition fees since 2012, the ability to regulate universities through Hefce has been reduced in turn.Its report - Regulating Higher Education - says all degree providers in England should be "captured" by proper regulation.It says: "It [higher education] is a valuable part of our national infrastructure and we must therefore ensure that students investing thousands of pounds in their futures are receiving top quality provision, and that the institutions they are attending are financially viable."The HEC study expresses particular concern about newly established higher education providers, saying "more providers are entering the market... and online providers gaining traction"."Regulation as it sits is not adequately prepared for the diversity of these current and future developments."New market entrants are not facing the scrutiny they should, takeovers and complex corporate structures are being used to evade fundamental protections for students, and institutions are facing more pressure than ever to recruit students and crucially, therefore, bring in funding."The report continues: "In this new, reformed higher education landscape, the chances of an institution failing are increased. An institution failing would damage both students and the highly-valued brand of UK higher education."The HEC calls on the government for urgent legislation to tackle the problems.It suggests an overarching regulatory body - the Council for Higher Education (CHE) - should be created, incorporating the current body Hefce, the Office for Fair Access (Offa), the Student Loans Company and a new body called the Office for Competition and Institutional Diversity.The commission also calls for better information about the various degree providers now operating in the UK and says all of these should be subject to a new regulatory framework, with kitemarks for those meeting approved standards.It also proposes an insurance scheme, paid into by every institution, to safeguard students should an institution or course fail.Professor of government at Hull University and HEC inquiry co-chairman Lord Norton of Louth said: "Regulation is fundamental to the health and success of our HE sector and will make or break the effectiveness of the institutions that have made the UK a world leader in higher education."In the context of current reforms, the absence of legislation to provide a coherent regulatory architecture for the rapidly changing and increasingly dynamic sector is creating major headaches for its players."It is a situation crying out for urgent rectification by government, a refrain that was a constant throughout the course of the inquiry from those who gave evidence."Fellow co-chairman and former vice chancellor of Lincoln University Prof Roger King said: "Our proposals seek to build upon the existing regulatory strengths displayed by the sector and to ensure that more external and formalised external regulatory arrangements work with these."Above all, however, we need to urgently address the outstanding requirement for a more systematic and less piecemeal approach to the external regulation of the sector. This can only be achieved by early legislation by government."A spokeswoman for the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills said: "It is essential that there is a robust but proportionate regulatory system in place to protect students and the reputation of the wider sector."At the same time though a balance must be struck to protect institutional autonomy and academic freedom. These elements are key to the success of our university system."When the time comes for legislation we want to get it absolutely right."Prof Les Ebdon, director of Offa, said: "I believe that fair access is too important to be rolled up within the wider concerns of a multi-focused regulatory body."An independent director, with a sole focus on access, can challenge institutions to set themselves stretching widening participation targets and ensure that fair access remains high on the agenda, both for institutions and policy-makers."</body>

      <title>Dying man told to take Gaviscon</title>

      <body>A man died after NHS 24 staff failed to spot he was suffering from blood poisoning - and told him to take heartburn remedy Gaviscon.John Willock, 43, made a series of calls to the NHS telephone helpline after becoming ill after falling on ice on Christmas Eve 2009.A sheriff's report into his death found a "number of concerns and shortcomings" in the handling of Mr Willock's case.NHS 24 said it had made several improvements since the case.Mr Willock, a father of two from Erskine in Renfrewshire, had been delivering presents when he fell.He had hurt his knee, was "fluish", cold, shivery and feeling sick - but hid his vomiting and diarrhoea symptoms from his partner and family until Boxing Day because he did not want to spoil their Christmas.With doctors' surgeries closed over the festive period, he made a series of calls to NHS 24.In one recording played to the fatal accident inquiry into his death, training engineer Mr Willock pleaded: "Is there anything anyone could suggest or is there anything I can get for it? I cannot move. I am bed-ridden because of the diarrhoea."When Mr Willock rang for a second time the day before he died, call handler Ann McDermid failed to pass on to a nurse that he had called before.In his report, Sheriff Colin Pettigrew said the cause of Mr Willock's death had been septicaemia, although the source of the infection was uncertain.Sheriff Pettigrew said Ms McDermid had been guilty of "numerous failings."A recorded telephone conversation showed she said to the nurse: "The patient's got burnin' sensation" and "he's got a burning sensation in his chest for about 10 hours" and "an aw the other symptoms, OK?"Nurse Fiona McCulloch, who took over the call, ticked the wrong boxes on her computer diagnostic screen.If she had ticked the one marked "persistent abdominal upper abdominal discomfort" an emergency ambulance would have been sent for Mr Willock.She told him to take Gaviscon and cold milk, later admitting that this was inappropriate for someone suffering from sickness and diarrhoea.Another NHS 24 call handler, Carolyn Fergie, admitted at the inquiry she was "tired" when she took Mr Willock's third call to the helpline.She confessed to being "abrupt", rushing the call and failing to listen to what Mr Willock was telling her.She failed to record on the system that Mr Willock was a "return caller" and that his condition was "serious and urgent".As a result, nurse Pamela Scally treated it as a first call and advised Mr Willock to contact his GP practice within 36 hours.His condition deteriorated on 29 December - without ever having been admitted to hospital - and he died at home at tea-time that night after his partner Carolann Rogers dialled 999.Sheriff Pettigrew's report included the view of a leading infectious diseases expert, who said he believed Mr Willock had a survival chance of between 60% and 85% if he had been seen in hospital on 27 December, the day after he had admitted he was ill.He was visited at home on the day he died by his own GP, Dr Murray Macpherson, who decided the patient was not ill enough for hospital.However, Sheriff Pettigrew said he could find no "reasonable precautions" that may have prevented Mr Willock's death.He said: "There was insufficient evidence led before me to conclude that, even if a GP had visited Mr Willock (prior to the visit of Dr Macpherson) and given him an anti-emetic injection and arranged his admission to hospital, there was a 'real and lively possibility' that... would in any event have made a difference."I find that the correction of the numerous failings of the call handlers and nurse advisors... do not constitute 'reasonable precautions' whereby Mr Willock's death may have been avoided."A spokesman for Mr Willock's family said: "John was loved by his family and is greatly missed. Although the family is disappointed the sheriff did not make specific findings regarding the GPs, the sheriff's findings support the family view that there were significant failings on the part of the call handlers and nurse advisers involved in John's care."While there has been evidence of improvements since John's death, the family hope that NHS 24 further review their practices as suggested by the sheriff so that lessons are learned."NHS 24 medical director Prof George Crooks said: "NHS 24 would like to offer sincere condolences to the family of Mr Willock for their loss."Patient safety is always the guiding principle in the care and advice given by NHS 24 and we have made several improvements to our systems and processes since this case in 2009 in order to further safeguard patients and ensure they receive the most appropriate care."Following this case and the investigations which were carried out into NHS 24's role, all staff involved at that time have been subject to robust review of their practice and appropriate training and support was put in place."These learnings have also been shared across our frontline staff as part of ongoing continuous improvement of their practice."NHS 24 continues to work with our partners to ensure that people in Scotland have access to safe, effective, and appropriate services during the out of hours period."</body>

      <body>An advert featuring singer Robin Thicke performing his number one hit Blurred Lines must not be shown before 19:30 as it is too sexual, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has said.The ruling was made after 97 complaints about the ad for Beats Pill speakers, which features scantily clad women.The ASA said while it accepted some viewers might find the ad distasteful, it would not cause widespread offence.However, it ruled the "overall tone" was sexual.The advert, which is based on the controversial music video for Thicke's song, shows three female models dancing and interacting with the product while dressed in hot pants and crop tops.It also features one woman kneeling on her hands and knees with a Beats Pill laid on her back.Those that complained said the commercial was sexist, objectified women and was degrading to women.Others said it was inappropriate at a time when children would be watching.In its response, Beats Electronics International said the advert was not intended to be offensive or encourage any inappropriate stereotypes, saying the women were confident, self-assured individuals who were "not subservient to the male character".It added the dominant images were of the product being used as dumbbells, a hotdog, binoculars and medicine, which were "strong, playful images that most viewers would not see as having any sexual connotation".In its ruling, the ASA acknowledged some viewers could find elements of the advert distasteful - "particularly the shots of the women's bodies with their heads obscured and the shot of the woman on all fours".It said as the shots were brief, it did not consider the ad - when taken as a whole - showed any sustained, overtly sexual or provocative behaviour.However, it concluded the overall tone was sexual and was not suitable for broadcast before 19:30.The unrated video for Thicke's Blurred Lines - in which the female models appeared topless - was branded misogynistic and banned from YouTube earlier this year.A second version of the video, featuring the women in the same outfits they wore in the Beats Pill advert, later replaced the original.</body>

      <body>Exotic butterflies and moths from the continent are colonising in Britain.Increasing numbers are being drawn to southern England from north Africa and Europe after a spell of hot summer weather and a warm autumn, experts say.European long-tailed blue butterflies have been spotted in Wiltshire, Kent and Sussex.Rare moths including the Clifden nonpareil and rosy underwing have appeared in southern counties including Dorset and Hampshire.Dorset-based moth recorder Les Hill has spotted three Clifden nonpareil moths in the past two weeks in the same part of south Dorset.He described the insect, known for its bright flash of blue on its wings, as being on "every moth recorder's wish list"."As the name nonpareil states, it is peerless and has no equal," he said."To record one in a lifetime is the fulfilment of an ambition. To record them every year in my garden is just remarkable."Butterfly Conservation spokesman Richard Fox said the sightings were "very exciting news"."The hot summer enabled long-tailed blues and other migratory butterflies to spread northwards into Britain, capitalising on opportunities to breed here while the weather remains warm," he said.The charity said the large rosy underwing moth had only been seen on 10 occasions in Britain before this summer and recent sightings raised the "tantalising prospect that the moth is now locally resident".Experts have not seen such high numbers of this delicately-patterned moth entering the UK for half a century.Higher than average numbers of the exotic crimson speckled moth have also been recorded along the south coast.</body>

      <title>Toddler brain scan language insight</title>
      <description>The brain has a critical window for language development between the ages of two and four, brain scans suggest.</description>

      <body>The brain has a critical window for language development between the ages of two and four, brain scans suggest.Environmental influences have their biggest impact before the age of four, as the brain's wiring develops to process new words, say UK and US scientists.The research in The Journal of Neuroscience suggests disorders causing language delay should be tackled early.It also explains why young children are good at learning two languages.The scientists, based at King's College London, and Brown University, Rhode Island, studied 108 children with normal brain development between the ages of one and six.They used brain scans to look at myelin - the insulation that develops from birth within the circuitry of the brain.To their surprise, they found the distribution of myelin is fixed from the age of four, suggesting the brain is most plastic in very early life.Any environmental influences on brain development will be strongest in infanthood, they predict.This explains why immersing children in a bilingual environment before the age of four gives them the best chance of becoming fluent in both languages, the research suggests.It also suggests that there is a critical time during development when environmental influence on cognitive skills may be greatest.Dr Jonathan O'Muircheartaigh, from King's College London, led the study.He told the BBC: "Since our work seems to indicate that brain circuits associated with language are more flexible before the age of four, early intervention for children with delayed language attainment should be initiated before this critical age."This may be relevant to many developmental disorders, such as autism, since delayed language is a common early trait."Early childhood is a time when language skills develop very rapidly.Babies have a vocabulary of up to 50 words at 12 months but by the age of six this has expanded to about 5,000 words.Language skills are localised in the frontal areas of the left-hand side of the brain.The researchers therefore expected more myelin to develop in the left-hand side of the brain, as the children learned more language.In fact, they found it remained constant, but had a stronger influence on language ability before the age of four, suggesting there is a crucial window for interventions in developmental disorders."This work is important as it is the first to investigate the relationship between brain structure and language across early childhood and demonstrate how this relationship changes with age," said Dr Sean Deoni from Brown University, a co-researcher on the study."This is important since language is commonly altered or delayed in many developmental disorders, such as autism."Commenting on the study, Prof Dorothy Bishop of the department of Developmental Neuropsychology at the University of Oxford said the research added important new information about early development of connections in brain regions important for cognitive functions."There is suggestive evidence of links with language development but it is too early to be confident about functional implications of the findings," she said."Ideally we would need a longitudinal study following children over time to track how structural brain changes relate to language function."The study was funded by the National Institutes for Mental Health (US) and the Wellcome Trust (UK).</body>

      <body>Northern Ireland's former first and deputy first ministers have criticised the current Stormont Executive.David Trimble and Seamus Mallon were speaking after they were conferred with honorary doctorates by Dublin City University.Mr Trimble said the current administration was not delivering very much apart from its existence.Mr Mallon said the DUP and Sinn Féin were lacking in political leadership.The two men travelled to Dublin to receive their doctorates in recognition of their "courage, dedication and a lifetime of commitment to the service of others".The pair were awarded the honour at the Helix on the 15th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.Mr Mallon told the Irish Times on Tuesday that Northern Ireland "could become apolitical because that leadership is not there"."Every single important issue that has cropped up, they have walked away from it," he said."The most recent one was the Maze, then there is the whole question of education."Northern Ireland's former first minister David Trimble told the paper that the differences faced by today's Executive were "of a different order" to what they were 15 years ago, but would have to be resolved at a local level.In his acceptance speech, he said the present administration was "not delivering very much apart from its existence, which is important".</body>

      <body>A £2m extension to the Museum of Free Derry is at risk because Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster has not signed off on a £1.2m tourist board grant, the Bloody Sunday Trust has warned.Plans for the museum in the Bogside could fall through, trust chair Conal McFeely said."It means the project is dead in the water if we cannot get them to release the letter of offer for £1.2m."The Department for Enterprise said the project was still being considered.The trust, which runs the museum, says it already has funding agreed in principle from the Department of Social Development and the Heritage Lottery fund - but it all hinges on Ms Foster agreeing to release the tourist board money.In a letter to Sinn Féin MLA Maeve McLaughlin dated 26 February this year, the chief executive of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board (NITB) said it was "only awaiting ministerial approval to proceed and issue a letter of offer for approximately £1.2m for phase two of the museum".However, Mr McFeely said that eight months later, they were still waiting. On 31 October, a £500,000 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund will expire.He said the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) money had been approved and that the Department of Social Development was offering £300,000 in funds. But everything rested on the NITB grant and minister's letter of approval."Now it is critical," he said."If we do not get the minister to sign off, the project is dead. The entire package is dependent on the main funder coming through. Over eight months we have attempted to do this properly without going public."We feel we are now in a critical phase and the project is not going to proceed due to the failure to get the letter from the NITB."The Bloody Sunday families are asking, 'is the minister opposed to this politically?'"The trust wants to meet Ms Foster to establish why the grant has not yet been approved.In a statement, a spokeswoman for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Industry said: "As the project promoters have already been advised, the project is currently being considered."All projects are assessed as part of the approvals process and it is not appropriate to indicate where in the approvals process any projects sits."The Heritage Lottery Fund has confirmed it had awarded a £500,000 grant that is due to expire on 31 October 2013. It said the HLF remained "hopeful" that a positive decision could be reached over funding in time to stop the grant being lost.</body>

      <title>50% rise in children playing sport</title>
      <description>Almost 50% more children are taking part in sport and physical activity regularly than two years ago, says a survey by Sport Wales.</description>

      <date>1381311068</date>
      <body>Almost 50% more children are taking part in sport and physical activity regularly than two years ago, says a new study.Sport Wales' School Sport Survey also suggested boys were still more likely than girls to regularly join in sport.The body spoke to 110,000 pupils from nearly 1,000 schools across Wales.The number of children taking part in physical activity three times a week or more rose from 27% in 2011 to 40% in 2013.Sport Wales is responsible for increasing participation and improving performance in sport in Wales.Sport Wales chair Professor Laura McAllister said the figures showed sport and education were working together, and described the survey results as "encouraging".She added: "They also help us understand how to encourage tomorrow's generation to participate more in sport and physical activity."But there are still challenges ahead and we need to build upon the success that we are creating uniquely in Wales."We risk losing the enormous gains made if we do not listen to the voice of our children."At a time of public austerity it is not a question of more money. It is about investing in our children's future through the health, education and sports sectors working better together to give our children the best start in life."Earlier this year, a group led by Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson called for PE to be given the same status as maths and English.The Welsh government said it would consider the recommendation.Pembrokeshire badminton player Jordan Hart agreed that sport played a crucial part in her life.She competed in the School Games 2012, and now the 18-year-old is bidding to qualify for next year's Commonwealth Games."I don't know really what I would have done if I hadn't chosen to do sport," said Ms Hart, who is now studying a sports degree at Loughborough University."Personally, I think everybody should be involved in some sort of sport."It's a major factor in people's lives and it has definitely improved my life. I think it is definitely a positive."The results of the survey will give local authorities, education services and health boards detailed information to help boost the number of young people participating in sport and physical activity.Sarah Powell, chief executive of Sport Wales, said the survey showed its efforts had made a difference."The work in primary and secondary schools funded by Sport Wales over the last 10 years, with after-school clubs and the wider sports community, has opened up opportunities for every child to try out a wider variety of sports and physical activities."These have been delivered in an enjoyable and fun environment, building children's confidence and interest to do more."The School Sport Survey results build on other evidence suggesting an increase in participation since the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games - for instance sports club membership in Wales passed the 500,000 mark for the first time ever and there has been a big rise in disability sport opportunities."Although London 2012 was a point of inspiration, we need to sustain growth in sports participation through better understanding of young people and by delivering services they want."</body>

      <title>Lake legal row to end after 20 years</title>
      <description>A farmer is expected to win a 20-year-long legal battle for planning permission for a large lake on his land.</description>

      <date>1381300439</date>
      <body>A farmer is set to win a 20-year-long legal battle for planning permission for a large lake on his land.John Rogers built the Bwlchyllan lake and embankment in Lampeter in 1991 without permission and two years later Ceredigion council said the land had to be restored following safety fears.Mr Rogers has been fined twice by magistrates for ignoring an enforcement notice to restore the land.But now the council is set to accept the lake is now part of the landscape.The lake is on sloping land and is about 180m (590ft) long and 80m (262 ft) at its widest point with a depth of 3.7m (12 ft).A retrospective planning application was refused in January this year because it again failed to demonstrate that the lake was safe.But it has since been deemed "as safe as can reasonably be expected," allowing planners to approve the plans.Despite the long legal history, councillors are being asked to deal with this fresh application on its own merits.A planning report says the lake has now become part of the natural environment and landscape."Whether rightly or wrongly the lake has now been in existence since 1991, a period of over 20 years," says the report."As a result the site has been given the opportunity to develop naturally so it is surrounded by natural vegetation with reeds along the lake shore and on a small island in the centre of the lake."The embankment is now completely covered with mature vegetation which broadens densely on the lower reaches of the embankment."Meanwhile, structural engineers say because the lake and embankment have managed to survive significant flooding over the last 20 years, they should be considered stable.Councillors have also been told that there may be water voles at the lake and Natural Resources Wales wants an investigation to see if they do live there.But opponents are worried that the embankment is not safe and could give way at some point.Geoffrey Stubberfield, who lives near by, said: "We have concerns that the bank could be well unstable."Nobody saw how it was built. It's terribly dangerous. If there's a catastrophic collapse, it could mean lives."And Michael Jones, who also lives close to the lake, added: "There's evidence of weeping from it but it hasn't collapsed."</body>

      <body>Prestwick Airport can be profitable if the right approach is taken, the deputy first minister has said.The Scottish government announced at Holyrood on Tuesday it was negotiating to buy the airport.The Ayrshire facility, which was put up for sale last March by New Zealand-based owners Infratil, has been running annual losses of £2m.Nicola Sturgeon said she believed that "over time" Prestwick could go "back to profit".A six-weeks timetable of detailed negotiations has now begun with Infratil.Ms Sturgeon told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "We are embarking on commercial negotiations with the current owners of the airport so thing like purchase price for the airport will require to be resolved in terms of he negotiation."The minister defended the government's decision to step in to buy the airport, saying it was the "only realistic alternative to closure".She explained that, once the airport was in public ownership, there would be a detailed business case made which would include levels of investment and a timescale on turning around its fortunes.Ms Sturgeon added: "With the right financial investment, with the right commercial management, the right marketing over a period of time, Prestwick can be brought back into profit."The Scottish government's bid to buy Prestwick comes just months after struggling Cardiff Airport was sold to the Welsh government for £52m.Although publicly owned, Cardiff Airport is being by an "at arm's length" body rather than by the government, and "on a commercial basis".In a ministerial statement to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said the closure of Prestwick would be a "serious and unwelcome development" for the Ayrshire and the Scottish economies, with about 1,400 jobs linked directly or indirectly with the airport.Infratil has agreed to ensure the airport is kept fully open and operational while the negotiation process involving the government is ongoing.The only scheduled passenger airline at Prestwick, Ryanair, welcomed the likely government takeover.</body>

      <title>Stillbirth rate 'poor' says doctor</title>
      <description>More must be done to tackle Scotland's poor record on stillbirths, according to the Scottish government's advise on maternity and women's health.</description>

      <date>1381273847</date>
      <body>More must be done to tackle Scotland's poor record on stillbirths, according to the Scottish government's adviser on maternity and women's health.Dr Catherine Calderwood told BBC Scotland: "Other countries are doing very much better than us."She said: "At the moment one in 200 babies are stillborn in Scotland. Our rate ranks Scotland 31st out of 33 high income countries in the world."Three hundred babies are stillborn every year in Scotland.That is 10 times as many as those who die through cot death.A stillborn child is defined as a baby born dead after 24 weeks gestation.Dr Calderwood said Scotland is about to begin a programme to try to reduce the rate.She said: "We need to make sure women are as healthy as possible before starting a pregnancy."We also know that we can improve things when we're looking after them."We know that small babies are more at risk and so there is various monitoring we can put in place so that we can pick those babies up and hopefully deliver them in time"Gavin Moir and his wife Kirsty lost their first child when Kirsty was 38-and-a-half weeks pregnant.Kirsty mentioned at a routine appointment that she had not felt the baby move much in the last day.An ultrasound test revealed there was no longer a heartbeat."The baby's room was all ready," said Mr Moir."The bags were all packed. To be told that there's nothing there anymore was absolutely devastating for us all. To this day I don't know how we managed to cope."The Take That star and X-Factor judge Gary Barlow and his wife lost a baby daughter as a result of a stillbirth in August last year.Dr Calderwood said that there had been a general assumption that nothing much could be done to reduce the number of stillborn children, but that has now changed.She said: "We have always perhaps believed that some bad things will happen when women are pregnant and we don't want to worry women because most babies will be fine."But in fact evidence from other countries shows us that, far from not being able to do something about it, we know that we actually can."Ann McMurray, Scottish network co-ordinator for the stillbirth charity SANDS, has been working with the Scottish government to increase awareness amongst pregnant women.In particular, it is interested in following the example of Norway which reduced its stillbirth rate by a third by encouraging women to get a check-up if they noticed their baby was not moving.Ms McMurray said: "We've been telling people they should get reduced foetal movements checked out."Also it's just about making people aware that stillbirth does happen because it's not really spoken about at antenatal clinics."It's not that we're scaremongering, because people are told that other things can go wrong."Gavin and Kirsty Moir have had another son but say they do not think they'll ever get over the trauma of their stillborn first child, whom they named Fraser."We still look back and think there could have been more done," said Mr Moir."Kirsty had to go to hospital to have tests on the levels of her waters, which had dropped quite considerably."It's only with hindsight that we're wondering if there was a problem which should have been monitored more closely."</body>

      <body>Only English people should play football for England, says midfielder Jack Wilshere.Manchester United's Adnan Januzaj could play for England if he passes Fifa's five-year residency requirement, as he is yet to commit to another country.Midfielder Januzaj, 18, is eligible for selection by Belgium, Serbia, Albania and Turkey.Asked about the issue, Wilshere said: "If you live in England for five years it doesn't make you English."The 21-year-old Arsenal player added: "If I went to Spain and lived there for five years, I'm not going to play for Spain."England boss Roy Hodgson has confirmed he has been monitoring Januzaj.Wilshere, who earlier this week insisted he is not a smoker despite being pictured with a cigarette outside a nightclub, added: "We have to remember what we are."We are English. We tackle hard, are tough on the pitch and are hard to beat."We have great characters. You think of Spain and you think technical but you think of England and you think they are brave and they tackle hard. We have to remember that."The only people who should play for England are English people."Liverpool's Raheem Sterling, born in Jamaica, and Wilfried Zaha of Manchester United, born in Ivory Coast, are part of the England Under-21 set-up along with West Brom's Saido Berahino, who left war-torn Burundi as a 10-year-old."It's a difficult one," said England Under-21 coach Gareth Southgate. "He [Januzaj] has not played for anyone else."We have lots of boys in our squad who were not born here, whose families have fled here."There are some wonderful stories and they are all incredibly proud to play for England."I'm torn with it. The world is changing. People move and work abroad. It is important to know why someone wants to play for you."Former Football Association chairman David Bernstein said England must "play within the rules and get the best team we can".He told BBC Radio 5 live: "There is much more fluidity in terms of population movement."I would say we must play within the rules but if players are eligible, I would be inclined to pick the best players we can get. Other countries do that."Cricketers Kevin Pietersen, Matt Prior and Jonathan Trott play for England despite being born in South Africa.Southgate added: "We seem to have embraced the cricket team that has won the Ashes, but it is a really interesting, philosophical debate."Januzaj, who joined United in 2011 from Belgian club Anderlecht for a reported fee of nearly £300,000, was born in Brussels.He has turned down the advances of Belgium, and has not won a cap at any level for any country.Januzaj qualifies for Albania through his Kosovan-Albanian parents, Turkey through his grandparents and Serbia as Kosovo's independence has not been recognised by the United Nations.Kosovo's national team are not members of Uefa or Fifa.Fifa, the sport's governing body, states a player is eligible if "he has lived continuously for at least five years after reaching the age of 18 on the territory of the relevant association".That would mean Januzaj would have to wait until 2018 to represent England, assuming he remains in the country until he turns 23.</body>

      <body>Former England boss Glenn Hoddle is set to return to the Football Association 14 years after being sacked.Hoddle, 55, will take up a role on the commission announced by FA chairman Greg Dyke as part of a bid to transform the fortunes of the national team.The pair have met twice in recent months and it is understood Dyke consulted Hoddle before his speech on the state of the English game.Hoddle is expected to be named on Dyke's FA commission on Wednesday.The former Chelsea manager will be just one of a number of key figures on the commission, which is also expected to include former players, FA board members, representatives from Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) and the League Managers' Association (LMA).It is understood further details will emerge during Dyke's speech at the Leaders in Football Conference at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.In September, Dyke said England should aim to reach the semi-finals of Euro 2020 and win the World Cup in 2022.England have not gone beyond a World Cup quarter-final since they reached the last four in 1990 and have only won it once - in 1966. Their best performances at the European Championship were semi-final appearances in 1968 and 1996.The commission will ask why England are in this situation, what can be done to improve their prospects and how any changes can best be implemented.In a lengthy speech, Dyke laid out a vision to address what he called the "frightening trend" of the reduction in the number of English players in the Premier League.In recent weeks, Hoddle has praised Dyke's analysis. Speaking to his website, Zapsportz.com,  the former England and Tottenham midfielder said he shared his concern at the growing number of foreign players in the Premier League."We've got foreign owners, who bring in foreign managers, who bring in foreign players above English players and it's a downward spiral," he said."The England manager's job is a hard job as it is and it's going to get harder and harder unless we readdress it with a rule change."Hoddle was appointed England manager in 1996 and oversaw 27 games, leading the national side to the last 16 of the World Cup in 1998 before being dismissed a year later following controversial comments about disabled people.</body>

      <body>England head coach Stuart Lancaster says he will turn to rugby league to help his players reach the same level as New Zealand and South Africa.Lancaster went on a fact-finding mission to Australia and New Zealand in August to visit leading league clubs.In particular, he thinks a lot can be copied to boost England's try-scoring."We have a huge amount to learn from rugby league, particularly in terms of attacking and core skills," Lancaster told BBC Radio 5 live."Sometimes we can forget about the core skills bit. League is rugby in the simplest form in the sense that it's about great defence, great tackling technique, good handling, good passing, catching and great kicking."I think they concentrate on the basics better than us. You only have to look at some of the tries scored in the Grand Final last weekend."Lancaster spent time in Sydney with the Roosters and the Rabbitohs and also went to see Melbourne Storm before observing Australian Rules Football following England's tour to Argentina.The 43-year-old, who will be a keen observer of the forthcoming Rugby League World Cup, plans to take further inspiration from the other code."I have been hugely influenced by rugby league and I'm a massive league fan," said Lancaster, who observed Leeds Rhinos at close quarters while director of rugby at Leeds Carnegie."You look at the number of coaches that have come from rugby league into rugby union and influence the game, the list goes on."We have had the likes of Kevin Sinfield and Jamie Peacock come and speak to our players."Lancaster also wants to create a rugby union culture similar to that of world champions New Zealand and believes there is room for significant improvements in what it means to play for England."New Zealand have a strong emphasis on culture and identity," he added."The shirt means a huge amount to them. Playing for New Zealand is huge and the players are great role models for the country."We have a lot of work to do in that area. Real emotional glue brings a team together. And we have tried to look deeper into the history of our shirt."I wrote to five or six former players from the 1950s onwards to help us reconnect with what the shirt means, about what it means to play for England."England head coach Stuart Lancaster was speaking to Radio 5 live's Mark Pougatch which can be heard on the 5 live podcast.</body>

      <title>Too rich for its own good</title>
      <description>DR Congo is potentially one of the richest countries on earth, but colonialism, slavery and corruption have turned it into one of the poorest, writes historian Dan Snow.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24396390</url>

      <body>The Democratic Republic of Congo is potentially one of the richest countries on earth, but colonialism, slavery and corruption has turned it into one of the poorest, writes historian Dan Snow.The world's bloodiest conflict since World War II is still rumbling on today.It is a war in which more than five million people have died, millions more have been driven to the brink by starvation and disease and several million women and girls have been raped.The Great War of Africa, a conflagration that has sucked in soldiers and civilians from nine nations and countless armed rebel groups, has been fought almost entirely inside the borders of one unfortunate country - the Democratic Republic of Congo.It is a place seemingly blessed with every type of mineral, yet consistently rated lowest on the UN Human Development Index, where even the more fortunate live in grinding poverty.I went to the Congo this summer to find out what it was about the country's past that had delivered it into the hands of unimaginable violence and anarchy.The journey that I went on, through the Congo's abusive history, while travelling across its war-torn present, was the most disturbing experience of my career.I met rape victims, rebels, bloated politicians and haunted citizens of a country that has ceased to function - people who struggle to survive in a place cursed by a past that defies description, a history that will not release them from its death-like grip.The Congo's apocalyptic present is a direct product of decisions and actions taken over the past five centuries.In the late 15th Century an empire known as the Kingdom of Kongo dominated the western portion of the Congo, and bits of other modern states such as Angola.It was sophisticated, had its own aristocracy and an impressive civil service.When Portuguese traders arrived from Europe in the 1480s, they realised they had stumbled upon a land of vast natural wealth, rich in resources - particularly human flesh.The Congo was home to a seemingly inexhaustible supply of strong, disease-resistant slaves. The Portuguese quickly found this supply would be easier to tap if the interior of the continent was in a state of anarchy.They did their utmost to destroy any indigenous political force capable of curtailing their slaving or trading interests.Money and modern weapons were sent to rebels, Kongolese armies were defeated, kings were murdered, elites slaughtered and secession was encouraged.By the 1600s, the once-mighty kingdom had disintegrated into a leaderless, anarchy of mini-states locked in endemic civil war. Slaves, victims of this fighting, flowed to the coast and were carried to the Americas.About four million people were forcibly embarked at the mouth of the Congo River. English ships were at the heart of the trade. British cities and merchants grew rich on the back of Congolese resources they would never see.This first engagement with Europeans set the tone for the rest of the Congo's history.Development has been stifled, government has been weak and the rule of law non-existent. This was not through any innate fault of the Congolese, but because it has been in the interests of the powerful to destroy, suppress and prevent any strong, stable, legitimate government. That would interfere - as the Kongolese had threatened to interfere before - with the easy extraction of the nation's resources. The Congo has been utterly cursed by its natural wealth.The Congo is a massive country, the size of Western Europe.Limitless water, from the world's second-largest river, the Congo, a benign climate and rich soil make it fertile, beneath the soil abundant deposits of copper, gold, diamonds, cobalt, uranium, coltan and oil are just some of the minerals that should make it one of the world's richest countries.Instead it is the world's most hopeless.The interior of the Congo was opened up in the late 19th Century by the British-born explorer Henry Morton Stanley, his dreams of free trading associations with communities he met were shattered by the infamous King of the Belgians, Leopold, who hacked out a vast private empire.The world's largest supply of rubber was found at a time when bicycle and automobile tyres, and electrical insulation, had made it a vital commodity in the West.The late Victorian bicycle craze was enabled by Congolese rubber collected by slave labourers.To tap it, Congolese men were rounded up by a brutal Belgian-officered security force, their wives were interned to ensure compliance and were brutalised during their captivity. The men were then forced to go into the jungle and harvest the rubber.Disobedience or resistance was met by immediate punishment - flogging, severing of hands, and death. Millions perished.Tribal leaders capable of resisting were murdered, indigenous society decimated, proper education denied.A culture of rapacious, barbaric rule by a Belgian elite who had absolutely no interest in developing the country or population was created, and it has endured.In a move supposed to end the brutality, Belgium eventually annexed the Congo outright, but the problems in its former colony remained.Mining boomed, workers suffered in appalling conditions, producing the materials that fired industrial production in Europe and America.In World War I men on the Western Front and elsewhere did the dying, but it was Congo's minerals that did the killing.The brass casings of allied shells fired at Passchendaele and the Somme were 75% Congolese copper.In World War II, the uranium for the nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki came from a mine in south-east Congo.Western freedoms were defended with Congo's resources while black Congolese were denied the right to vote, or form unions and political associations. They were denied anything beyond the most basic of educations.They were kept at an infantile level of development that suited the rulers and mine owners but made sure that when independence came there was no home-grown elite who could run the country.Independence in 1960 was, therefore, predictably disastrous.Bits of the vast country immediately attempted to break away, the army mutinied against its Belgian officers and within weeks the Belgian elite who ran the state evacuated leaving nobody with the skills to run the government or economy.Of 5,000 government jobs pre-independence, just three were held by Congolese and there was not a single Congolese lawyer, doctor, economist or engineer.Chaos threatened to engulf the region. The Cold War superpowers moved to prevent the other gaining the upper hand.Sucked into these rivalries, the struggling Congolese leader, Patrice Lumumba, was horrifically beaten and executed by Western-backed rebels. A military strongman, Joseph-Desire Mobutu, who had a few years before been a sergeant in the colonial police force, took over.Mobutu became a tyrant. In 1972 he changed his name to Mobutu Sese Seko Nkuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga, meaning "the all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, goes from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake".The West tolerated him as long as the minerals flowed and the Congo was kept out of the Soviet orbit.He, his family and friends bled the country of billions of dollars, a $100m palace was built in the most remote jungle at Gbadolite, an ultra-long airstrip next to it was designed to take Concorde, which was duly chartered for shopping trips to Paris.Dissidents were tortured or bought off, ministers stole entire budgets, government atrophied. The West allowed his regime to borrow billions, which was then stolen and today's Congo is still expected to pay the bill.In 1997 an alliance of neighbouring African states, led by Rwanda - which was furious Mobutu's Congo was sheltering many of those responsible for the 1994 genocide - invaded, after deciding to get rid of Mobutu.A Congolese exile, Laurent Kabila, was dredged up in East Africa to act as a figurehead. Mobutu's cash-starved army imploded, its leaders, incompetent cronies of the president, abandoning their men in a mad dash to escape.Mobutu took off one last time from his jungle Versailles, his aircraft packed with valuables, his own unpaid soldiers firing at the plane as it lumbered into the air.Rwanda had effectively conquered its titanic neighbour with spectacular ease. Once installed however, Kabila, Rwanda's puppet, refused to do as he was told.Again Rwanda invaded, but this time they were just halted by her erstwhile African allies who now turned on each other and plunged Congo into a terrible war.Foreign armies clashed deep inside the Congo as the paper-thin state collapsed totally and anarchy spread.Hundreds of armed groups carried out atrocities, millions died.Ethnic and linguistic differences fanned the ferocity of the violence, while control of Congo's stunning natural wealth added a terrible urgency to the fighting.Forcibly conscripted child soldiers corralled armies of slaves to dig for minerals such as coltan, a key component in mobile phones, the latest obsession in the developed world, while annihilating enemy communities, raping women and driving survivors into the jungle to die of starvation and disease.A deeply flawed, partial peace was patched together a decade ago. In the far east of the Congo, there is once again a shooting war as a complex web of domestic and international rivalries see rebel groups clash with the army and the UN, while tiny community militias add to the general instability.The country has collapsed, roads no longer link the main cities, healthcare depends on aid and charity. The new regime is as grasping as its predecessors.I rode on one of the trainloads of copper that go straight from foreign-owned mines to the border, and on to the Far East, rumbling past shanty towns of displaced, poverty-stricken Congolese.The Portuguese, Belgians, Mobutu and the present government have all deliberately stifled the development of a strong state, army, judiciary and education system, because it interferes with their primary focus, making money from what lies under the Earth.The billions of pounds those minerals have generated have brought nothing but misery and death to the very people who live on top of them, while enriching a microscopic elite in the Congo and their foreign backers, and underpinning our technological revolution in the developed world.The Congo is a land far away, yet our histories are so closely linked. We have thrived from a lopsided relationship, yet we are utterly blind to it. The price of that myopia has been human suffering on an unimaginable scale.</body>

      <title>Have drug scandals actually made sport more interesting?</title>
      <description>Usually drugs in sport are the subject of universal condemnation, but have they actually made things more interesting, asks Paul Dimeo.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24329252</url>
      <date>1381280236</date>
      <body>Usually drugs in sport are the subject of universal condemnation, but have they actually made things more interesting, asks Paul Dimeo.I was 17 when Ben Johnson became a household name. Not for winning the 100m gold in the 1988 Olympics, but for losing that medal two days later after a positive test for the steroid stanozolol.Twenty-five years after Johnson's ignominy, he is now promoting an anti-drugs message, while I teach and study sports policy, and in particular drugs in sport. I've watched the Johnson race hundreds of time, telling my students to watch Carl Lewis's face drop in amazement at Johnson's speed.It is now one of the most famous events in sports history - famous for Johnson's positive and for the fact that many of the other runners were implicated in doping at some stage of their career.I've also become fascinated by professional cycling, a sport of which I knew nothing about until 10 years ago when the story of the Lance Armstrong miracle was increasingly circulating - the great hero who recovered from cancer to dominate the sport.As a lecturer in sports I often come across people who are wholly devoted to the ethical purpose of sport, to the idea that sport can help improve lives. I also meet people whose approach to sport is about performance - sports scientists, coaching experts and others who are helping to develop training techniques, nutritional strategies or technologies that can support what my Danish friend and colleague Verner Moller calls the will to win.Over the 25 years since Johnson's eye-popping, steroid-fuelled brilliance was savagely cut short and his life ruined, I have increasingly found myself fascinated by the moral ambiguities produced by the tensions between these competing paradigms. And I have come to see the ongoing war between the dopers and the anti-doping policing agencies as a manifestation of these historical dilemmas.After a doping scandal, we are encouraged to take the side of traditional ethics and support anti-doping. However, if we can empathise with athletes' will to win and desire for competitive advantage, which as spectators we celebrate and admire, we might be less harsh in our judgement.Ben Johnson and Lance Armstrong both thought others were doping - and they were right. They both felt they could not trust the anti-doping system to protect the idea of fairness - and they were right about that, too. Their doping was driven by the belief that they were only doing what they had to do to win. Yet they have both been punished very severely while others have got away with it. I can't help but have some sympathy.And when you start looking at the question from that angle, another thought presents itself. What if doping has done something good for sport? What if, in fact, doping has helped make sport what it is today?The best example is the Olympics, which was in crisis for most of the post-war period. Essentially it is a series of minority interest sports brought together with reference to the historical idealism of international peace and co-operation. In theory it was entirely amateur and the big professional sports like football, cycling, tennis, golf and American football were not represented. In the words of Jim Mills Sr, it was little more than PE for grown-ups.Few countries wanted to host the event , there was little sponsorship money and, beset by boycotts, the movement nearly collapsed. However, what made the Olympics interesting through the 1960s, 70s and 80s - breathed life into the whole affair - was the Cold War rivalry between the Soviet Union, East Germany and the US and their respective allies.This rivalry created meaning and a culture of excellence. Records were regularly broken in almost all disciplines. Great performances were admired while ongoing rivalries - individual and national - made for great stories. But we know now that many of the Olympic medal winners from those countries in these decades were on steroids. The growing popularity and media coverage of the Olympics was based upon excellence fuelled by steroids.The writer Umberto Eco once argued that sport isn't really about the actual event - that's over quickly, few people participate and only a relatively small number will be there to see it in real life. Instead, Eco wrote, sport is about reporting an event, then discussing the reporting of the event, then discussing the discussion. And drugs have certainly enhanced the discussion as much as they have enhanced the athletes. The discussion around sport - from newspaper headlines to in-depth biographies - has benefited greatly from drugs. The public love stories where drugs make sports stars seem like human beings - tragically flawed.But it goes beyond that. Anti-doping is a moral and controlling force which aims to protect the purity of sport, but like all moral forces runs up against human nature - in this case athletes' will to win, and their occasional lapses in concentration.Anti-doping would not exist without doping as its nemesis - the two are locked together, they need each other. It is a war in which each side defines the parameters of the other. And this has created a real sense of fascination among sports fans, and even those not normally interested in sport.Personally, I have made a career from discussing doping - writing and teaching about Cold War rivalries, doping at the Olympics and the wider history of drugs in sport. People talk to me almost every day about it. One of my students asks for my thoughts on the latest scandals and new policies. My weekend cycling buddies ask me what they are allowed to take to enhance their chances of success. Even a friend who is a former church minister once asked me why people are so angry with Lance Armstrong. After all, she said, in the bigger scheme of things he hasn't done much wrong.Most of all though I get to indulge my curiosity about sport, which is also about life, to explore that liminal space between what is judged to be right and what is wrong. My critical anti-authoritarian streak relishes instances where supposedly bad turn out to be good, and the supposedly good turn out to be bad.When I look back at Ben Johnson and at others - Marion Jones, Michael Rasmussen, David Millar, Marita Koch and so many more - I see people driven by a desire to win, for themselves and their families, and I can't bring myself to see anything wrong in that.This is an edited version of Paul Dimeo's Four Thought, which will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 20:45 BST on 9 October 2013.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>Is the British weather unique in the world?</title>
      <description>It's often said the British weather is unique, but is it really different from everywhere else?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24305230</url>
      <date>1381198849</date>
      <body>It's often said by laymen that the UK's weather is unique. But what makes it so different from anywhere else?Whatever you think of the British weather, if you don't like it one day there's always a good chance you might like it the next.Weather, in meteorological terms, refers to the daily elements like temperature, wind and rain. And in Britain they can all change hour by hour and day by day.It's this diversity and changeability that makes British weather so distinct, say meteorologists. While temperatures are fairly mild and there are four distinct seasons, you can also get warm weather in the middle of February and freezing rain in the middle of August - or both in one day."Other countries might have more dramatic weather," says Dr Liz Bentley, head of the Weather Club at the Royal Meteorological Society. "In India and Pakistan you get monsoon season, but you can usually predict the day it will start and the day it will finish."In the UK you sometimes have to look at the weather forecast several times in one morning just to plan a trip out that afternoon. Things can change that quickly."Many meteorologists call the British weather unique, although some say you could argue the weather in all countries is unique because no two are the same geographically and geologically. But they agree it is hard to find another country in the world with weather that compares to the UK.So what makes it so distinctly variable?"Britain's unique weather is all down to the fact it is an island and where it's positioned on the planet, between the Atlantic Ocean and a large land mass, continental Europe," says Helen Chivers from the Met Office. "There is a lot going on meteorologically where we are."Britain is under an area where five main air masses meet. An air mass is a large body of air that has similar temperature and moisture properties throughout.In the UK they are either polar or tropical, depending on where the air mass originated; they are also divided into maritime or continental, depending on whether the air has passed over land or sea.They come from all directions and can bring all types of weather.When they meet it creates a weather front. The air masses fight it out and the one that wins dictates the weather. The bigger the difference the worse the weather can be. There is a sixth air mass, the returning Polar Maritime, which is a variation of the Polar Maritime.One more important thing to throw into the mix is the jet stream. It is a high-altitude ribbon of fast-moving air that is associated with weather systems in the UK. The position of the jet stream can make a huge difference to the type of weather we experience.All in all, it's quite an extraordinary mix of atmospheric conditions battling it out."It's what makes the British weather so fascinating," says Bentley. "Experiencing such big changes so quickly is unique."Fascinating or frustrating, the layman might argue, but no other country in the world gets the same weather, say experts."Japan is probably the only other place that has similarities to the UK when it comes to weather," says Chivers."It is similar to us but in reverse. It is an island and has the Pacific Ocean to the east and Eurasian continent to the west. Britain's variations in weather really are that rare."These variations pose problems, from when to have a barbecue to effective planning for businesses. Companies spend millions trying not to be caught out by the British weather."From energy companies, supermarkets and insurance firms to banks, technology companies and local authorities, they all need to plan for the weather," says Richard Tipper, director of Ecometrica, which works with companies to get the climate and weather data they need to plan efficiently."It's the amazing changeability in British weather that is unique. It also means planning for it isn't always easy."Subtle changes in the weather are happening and will continue, says Bentley."We are starting to see more record-breaking weather, record droughts and record rainfall," she says.Last year is a good example. The dramatic switch from drought in early 2012 to the wettest April to June on record was of a magnitude never seen before, according to the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH).Hosepipe bans were brought in early in the year but by early autumn levels of groundwater were "well above" average.But the country's fascination with the weather probably won't change. Nor will some people's love for it."There is a real beauty about the weather in the UK," says Bentley."You might be guaranteed sun in other countries but constant sunshine can get dull. People move to other countries but often they end up missing the British weather and the seasons."There are also some real upsides. When we get unexpected sunshine in the UK everyone's day is better. It just feels like we are getting a special treat and we are so much happier."The Great British Year is on BBC One at 21:00 BST on Wednesday 9 October or catch up with iPlayer.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook</body>

      <title>UK reopens Iran diplomatic channels</title>
      <description>The UK will restore some diplomatic relations with Iran by appointing a charge d'affaires to work with the country, Foreign Secretary William Hague announces.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24444390</url>
      <date>1381247637</date>
      <body>The UK will restore some diplomatic relations with Iran by appointing a charge d'affaires to work with the country, William Hague has announced.But the foreign secretary warned the country's president to follow up his more "positive" words on its alleged nuclear weapons programme with "concrete actions".Mr Hague told MPs further progress would require "substantial change".Iran will appoint a charge d'affaires to work with London in return.Mr Hague said it was hoped this would help "on the way towards eventual re-opening of both our embassies".The UK shut its embassy in Tehran in November 2011 after it was attacked by protesters. It then ordered the closure of the Iranian embassy in London.Mr Hague said the recently elected government of President Hassan Rouhani had "presented themselves in a much more positive light than recent governments".But Iran was still in breach of six United Nations resolutions over its alleged development of nuclear weapons, he said, adding: "We must test the Iranian government's sincerity to the full."Mr Hague also said: "We are looking forward to serious proposals from Iran to follow up on their stated desire to make rapid progress on negotiations."It will be very important for Iran's relations with the international community for the marked change of presentation and statements to be accompanied by concrete actions and a viable approach to negotiations.He added: "In the absence of change to these policies, we will continue to maintain strong sanctions. A substantial change in British or western policies requires a substantive change in that programme."For Labour, shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander criticised the government for not moving more quickly to restore relations with Iran, saying it had "misjudged" the situation and risked being "left behind".He added: "On Iran, it is time for the government to catch up with our American allies."</body>

      <body>Ex-children's minister Tim Loughton has been given permission for an emergency Commons debate after being issued with a police information notice.The Conservative MP for East Worthing and Shoreham complained to Commons Speaker John Bercow after he received the notice, which is sometimes called a harassment warning notice.In a statement, Mr Bercow told MPs the matter should be given "the precedence accorded to matters of privilege".But he did not reveal any more details.The debate will take place on Wednesday at 12:30 BST, unless it is delayed by any urgent questions or ministerial statements.Although the subject of the debate has not yet been disclosed, Mr Loughton has been involved in a long-running row with a constituent who accused him of racism.In a Commons debate in March, he said his constituent had "worked tirelessly to try to make my life hell".Mr Loughton said the constituent had sworn at him, accused him of lying and arrogance and published "creatively doctored photographs" on his blog - including one depicting the ex-minister "toting a smoking gun in a playground full of screaming, fleeing children".After he had responded to the constituent in an angry email that also included some swearing, Sussex Police began an investigation, interviewing the MP for 90 minutes under caution on suspicion of sending a malicious communication.Six months later, Mr Loughton said, he was informed that no further action would be taken.He told MPs that he planned to make a formal complaint against the force.A police information notice may be issued where there are allegations of harassment, but do not imply that the police believe the alleged harassment has taken place.</body>

      <title>Diane Abbott axed as shadow minister</title>
      <description>Diane Abbott is sacked as shadow health minister by Labour leader Ed Miliband, telling the BBC: "I think Ed wanted more message discipline."</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24443444</url>
      <date>1381256485</date>
      <body>Outspoken Labour MP Diane Abbott has been sacked as shadow public health minister by Ed Miliband.She told the BBC: "I think Ed wanted more message discipline."She recently questioned the party's stance on immigration and suggested that, although the Labour leader was "doing his best", he was being swayed by polls.The news that Ms Abbott was being sacked came as Mr Miliband completed the reshuffle of his frontbench team.In a blog on the Guardian website, Ms Abbott said the Labour leader had been "very nice" as he sacked her, and she had told him that his decision "must be right"."My first thought was that I was sorry to be no longer working with Andy Burnham and the health team," she wrote."I am also sad to be leaving some of the good friends that I made in the public health world. My role enabled me to engage with some fascinating subjects, like the sexualisation of women and girls and I plan to continue working on those issues."She concluded: "I have enjoyed being on the frontbench."But I plan to enjoy being a free agent on the backbenches even more."The BBC News Channel's chief political correspondent Norman Smith raised speculation that her sacking could clear the way for Ms Abbott to stand as Labour candidate for London mayor in 2016.Ms Abbott, a Cambridge graduate and MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington, hit the headlines last year after saying on Twitter that "white people love playing divide and rule".More recently, she has hit out at the "pornification" of British culture, calling for a purge of "sexualised" imagery from High Streets, and warning of a "crisis in masculinity".In 2012, Ms Abbott resigned from a cross-party group on counselling given to pregnant women by abortion providers, dismissing it as a "front" for those who want it outlawed.For much of her career, Ms Abbott was known as something of a left-wing maverick, rebelling against the Blair-Brown governments numerous times on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq.She also became a regular pundit on the BBC current affairs show This Week, sharing the sofa with former Conservative cabinet minister Michael Portillo.She was promoted to Ed Miliband's front bench following her unsuccessful bid to become Labour leader in 2010, in which she came last out of the five candidates to stand.In other changes to the Labour line-up confirmed on Tuesday, Shabana Mahmood has been moved from shadowing the department of business to shadowing the Treasury; ex-shadow housing minister Jack Dromey moves to the Home Office brief; Dan Jarvis moves from culture to justice; Luciana Berger moves from energy to health; Stella Creasy moves from Home Office to business; and Chris Bryant moves from immigration to work and pensions.</body>

      <body>The average Briton gets six-and-a-half hours' sleep a night, according to the Sleep Council. Michael Mosley took part in an unusual experiment to see if this is enough.It has been known for some time that the amount of sleep people get has, on average, declined over the years.This has happened for a whole range of reasons, not least because we live in a culture where people are encouraged to think of sleep as a luxury - something you can easily cut back on. After all, that's what caffeine is for - to jolt you back into life. But while the average amount of sleep we are getting has fallen, rates of obesity and diabetes have soared. Could the two be connected?We wanted to see what the effect would be of increasing average sleep by just one hour. So we asked seven volunteers, who normally sleep anywhere between six and nine hours, to be studied at the University of Surrey's Sleep Research Centre.The volunteers were randomly allocated to two groups. One group was asked to sleep for six-and-a-half hours a night, the other got seven-and-a-half hours. After a week the researchers took blood tests and the volunteers were asked to switch sleep patterns. The group that had been sleeping six-and-a-half hours got an extra hour, the other group slept an hour less.While we were waiting to see what effect this would have, I went to the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford to learn more about what actually happens when we sleep.In the Sleep Centre, they fitted me up with a portable electro-encephalograph, a device that measures brain wave activity. Then, feeling slightly ridiculous, I went home and had my seven-and-a-half hours of sleep.The following day I went to discuss what had happened inside my head during the night with Dr Katharina Wulff.The first thing she pointed out was that I had very rapidly fallen into a state of deep sleep. Deep sleep sounds restful, but during it our brains are actually working hard. One of the main things the brain is doing is moving memories from short-term storage into long-term storage, allowing us more short-term memory space for the next day. If you don't get adequate deep sleep then these memories will be lost.You might think: "I'll cut back during the week and then make up for it at the weekend." Unfortunately it doesn't work like that, because memories need to be consolidated within 24 hours of being formed.Since deep sleep is so important for consolidating memories it is a good idea if you are revising or perhaps taking an exam to make sure that you're getting a reasonable night's sleep. In one study, people who failed to do so did 40% worse than their contemporaries.Deep sleep only lasts for a few hours. My electrode results showed that during the night my brain went through multiple phases of another kind of activity, called REM sleep."This is the phase when you are usually paralysed - so you can't move," Wulff explained. "In fact the only muscles which are not paralysed are the eye muscles, and that's why it's called rapid eye movement sleep."During REM sleep an extraordinary thing happens. One of the stress-related chemicals in the brain, noradrenalin, is switched off. It's the only time, day or night, this happens. It allows us to remain calm while our brains reprocess all the experiences of the day, helping us come to terms with particularly emotional events.We get more REM sleep in the last half of the night. Which means that if you are woken unexpectedly, your brain may not have dealt with all your emotions - which could leave you stressed and anxious. Drinking alcohol late at night is not a good idea as it reduces your REM sleep while it's being processed in your body.Back at the University of Surrey our sleep volunteers had finished their second week of the experiment. What we wanted to see was the effect switching from six-and-a-half hours to seven-and-a-half hours, or vice versa, would have on our volunteers.Computer tests revealed that most of them struggled with mental agility tasks when they had less sleep, but the most interesting results came from the blood tests that were run.Dr Simon Archer and his team at Surrey University were particularly interested in looking at the genes that were switched on or off in our volunteers by changes in the amount that we had made them sleep."We found that overall there were around 500 genes that were affected," Archer explained. "Some which were going up, and some which were going down."What they discovered is that when the volunteers cut back from seven-and-a-half to six-and-a-half hours' sleep a night, genes that are associated with processes like inflammation, immune response and response to stress became more active. The team also saw increases in the activity of genes associated with diabetes and risk of cancer. The reverse happened when the volunteers added an hour of sleep.So the clear message from this experiment was that if you are getting less than seven hours' sleep a night and can alter your sleep habits, even just a little bit, it could make you healthier. "Have a lie-in, it will do you good" - that's the kind of health message that doesn't come along very often.You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on FacebookTrust Me I'm a Doctor is broadcast on 10 October on BBC Two at 20:00 BST, or catch up with iPlayer</body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Help to Buy mortgage scheme</title>
      <description>How will the new mortgage scheme work?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24447335</url>
      <date>1381239589</date>
      <body>The government says that its Help to Buy scheme will assist people trying to get on the housing ladder who can afford mortgage repayments but are struggling to raise a deposit.But critics say that the government guarantee, that forms part of the second phase of the scheme, could create a housing bubble in the UK.Not all mortgage seekers will be able to sign up, and those who do will still have to go through "rigorous" affordability checks by their lender.Haven't I heard about this for a while?Yes, in fact some parts of the scheme have been operating for a few months.The first phase started in April in England. This sees the government offering a 20% equity loan to buyers of newly-built properties. These buyers must offer a 5% deposit.Similar schemes operate in Wales and Scotland - all of which are aimed at encouraging housebuilding.But that's not all, is it?No, the second phase of the scheme, originally planned for January 2014, has been brought forward so mortgage products are available from now.Under this system, borrowers across the UK can put down a deposit of as little as 5% of the property price. The lender offers a mortgage covering the other 95%.Lenders can sign up to the Help to Buy scheme and pay a fee to the government, which will provide a seven-year taxpayer guarantee covering 15% of the loan value. That guarantee can be called in if the borrower defaults.It is available for properties sold for up to £600,000 in the UK. The scheme is expected to continue for three years.Are the lenders keen?There has been a mixed response so far.RBS and Lloyds Banking Group - both of which are taxpayer backed - are participating in the second phase of Help to Buy.Smaller lenders Virgin Money and Aldermore have announced that they will be involved as well, from January.However, among the lenders still deciding whether to sign up are Barclays, Santander and Nationwide Building Society.How much do these mortgages cost?A few lenders have started to reveal the pricing of these 95% mortgages.RBS and NatWest are offering a two-year, fixed-rate mortgage starting at 4.99% for those with a 5% deposit, with no fee.Halifax will be taking applications in a few days at a rate of 5.19% with a £995 fee for those with the same deposit.That is relatively competitive compared with prices outside of Help to Buy, although borrowers are likely to get a better deal if they save up longer for a deposit. These 95% mortgages have all but disappeared from the market since the start of the financial crisis.Is there a chance of a return of irresponsible lending?The government says that various rules have been included to ensure this does not happen.For example, no interest-only or offset mortgages will be allowed. The system cannot be used for the purchase of second homes or for mortgages for buy-to-let investors.In addition, lenders must put these borrowers through new affordability checks. These were brought in for everyone to avoid a return of the reckless lending of the last boom.You mention boom, isn't this just going to create another one?That's the fear from many commentators who say that Help to Buy is simply going to help some relatively well-off people move up the housing ladder.Critics, including Labour, say that this does nothing to tackle the shortage of affordable homes to buy, so it wants more focus on housebuilding.Treasury officials suggest that the system will correct a failure in the market and stimulate builders to get going again with bricks and mortar.</body>

      <title>'I used to watch 800 films a year'</title>
      <description>Why London Film Festival boss watches 500 films a year</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24443426</url>
      <date>1381303531</date>
      <body>The BFI London Film Festival (LFF) opens later with sea piracy thriller Captain Phillips, starring Tom Hanks, directed by British film-maker Paul Greengrass.The film is based on the true story of Captain Richard Phillips, who was taken hostage by Somali pirates in 2009.The festival will close on 20 October with Saving Mr Banks, in which Hanks stars alongside Emma Thompson in the story of how the Disney classic Mary Poppins made it to the big screen.Among the 234 fiction and documentary features over 10 days are screenings of Stephen Frears' Philomena, the true story of a woman's search for her lost son starring Dame Judi Dench and Steve Coogan, and Steve McQueen's 12 Years A Slave, starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender and Benedict Cumberbatch.Other gala screenings include Alfonso Cuaron's space-set thriller Gravity, starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, Ralph Fiennes' The Invisible Woman, a period romance centring on the affair between Charles Dickens and actress Nelly Ternan, and the Coen Brothers' Inside Llewyn Davis, about the 1960s New York folk scene.We spoke to the festival's director Clare Stewart, in charge for a second year, ahead of Wednesday's opening night.The festival is about to start. Is this the calm before the storm?[laughs] There are various elements of the storm along the way. There's the storm of the programme being locked down, there's the pre-production storm that we're in now, and there's the storm of the festival itself.Was it important to you to have a British director opening the festival?Having a British director for the first time since 2006 was a really exciting element, but it was the film itself that completely won me over and, of course, Paul Greengrass knows how to direct a fantastic thriller.Captain Phillips is much more complex than your average action film in that it's based on the true story of a 2009 hijacking of a US container ship by Somali pirates. It looks at two men caught up in something they are not in control of and it reflects on broader global economies and politics.Tom Hanks book-ends the festival. How important is the Hollywood "A list" presence?The LFF plays an increasingly important role in the awards season build-up for both the Baftas and Academy Awards.Big films like Philomena, Gravity, 12 Years a Slave and Inside Llewyn Davis and Jason Reitman's Labor Day are definitely going to be featuring in awards season campaigns.But they also open the festival out to a broader audience and help us to introduce other more surprising, discovery films to people who might be attracted in by these big films.What did you learn from your debut experience in London last year?We made a lot of change to last year's festival, we opened it up to a wider footprint across London, we introduced new programme sections, such as Thrill, Dare and Sonic, and we took a number of big screenings out across the UK.That changed the landscape of the festival by opening it up for new audiences and if that hadn't worked I would have reassessed it. But we had a 13% increase in attendance and 33% of the people coming to the festival last year were first timers.How has that influenced this year?I felt for this year it was important to consolidate that, and let those changes really prove themselves.You previously ran the Sydney Film Festival. Do audiences in London and Sydney differ?I feel that one of the similarities is that there is an adventurousness and an openness to new things. One tangible difference is that here in London the connection to European films is much stronger, whereas obviously in Australia the Asian connection is much stronger.Was there a particular film you had to go the extra mile for to get on your programme?That's a festival director's best kept secret! A number of films are very fresh out of the edit suite and when that happens there's still a lot of thinking going on about release strategy around the world. I was really thrilled to be able to secure our closing night film Saving Mr Banks, which is a world premiere.The one that almost got away is 12 Years Slave. I'm so glad it's there - Steve McQueen's new film is in hot demand around the world and had only just finished in time for Toronto. I was pleased to secure the European premiere for London.What do you say to those who say the LFF is in the shadow of Toronto and Venice film festivals?I think not. Our timing means we have an important role in exposing the great films that have screened in other festivals in the course of the year but have not yet had exposure in the UK, alongside building the profile for films that are gearing up for Bafta and Academy campaigns.We are becoming increasingly important as an entry to Europe for number of significant films. Both our opening and closing night films did not play in either Venice or Toronto.You grew up in a small Australian town with no cinema. How much does that account for the fact you're now running one of the world's biggest film festivals?My usual line is that I've been over-compensating ever since. The passion for movies took me by surprise in my teenage years when I moved to Melbourne to study at university and the journey has been an incredibly exciting one. On a daily basis, it does feel like I'm a long way from Korumburra.How many films do you see in the course of year?I surprised someone the other day when I said it used to be about 800 and now it's down to 500. I've got a great team of internal programme advisers here at London. I had to do a lot more personal viewing in Sydney than I do here.But I loved that response because for most people 500 films is still a hell of a lot of films in one year.The BFI London Film Festival runs from 9-20 October.</body>

      <title>The band who opened a record shop</title>
      <description>Is this Britain's hardest working band?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24437766</url>
      <date>1381284402</date>
      <body>When indie band Frankie and the Heartstrings released their second album this summer, they were so alarmed by the lack of record shops in which to sell it that they decided to open their own."We were coming to the completion of our second record and the main story on the news one day was the fact HMV had gone bust," says singer Frankie Francis."At the time, a couple of local record shops had gone bust as well. We thought 'We've got this record coming out, but there might not actually be anywhere to sell it on the High Street.'"So we thought we'd take a stand and open our own record shop."With help from Sunderland City Council, the band took over the empty tourist office in their home town. "There's no call for it any more, for various reasons," Francis says solemnly.Pop Recs Ltd was only supposed to open for two weeks to mark their album's release in June. But the band say the reaction has been so good that they are keeping it open for as long as they can and have plans for in-store gigs through to next February.Four out of the five bandmates work there full time and, last month, the venture earned them the title of hardest working band in Britain from the Association of Independent Music.When I visit, the lead singer is manning the coffee machine, busily grinding beans and frothing milk as the shop fills up before an in-store gig by visiting Manchester band Dutch Uncles.Drummer Dave Harper and bassist Steve Dennis are behind the counter in a state of harangued dishevelment - passing coffee cups, jabbing the till, fetching supplies, pausing to chat to friends.Indie circuit stalwarts, Frankie and the Heartstrings made the top 40 with their debut album in 2011 and have a loyal live following, but are still waiting for that breakthrough to the big time."We're a band with not much money… and we've put what money we have into this project just to show bands can take a stand," Francis says."If we can do it on a street level, why can't people further up in the music business be as proactive as us?"We're engaging with loads of bands and labels to come and do things and because of that we're selling records in Sunderland for all these bands. That wouldn't have happened if this project didn't exist."But does it really matter whether we have real record shops selling real records any more? "I guess it matters more to us because we're in a band and we know how many records people sell," Francis replies."Even 10 years ago you would have sold double, three times, four times the amount of records that you sell now."I think it's very important to engage with people and make them realise the value of actually owning music, especially on vinyl because we're very romantic in that we take a lot of time over the artwork and the way it's laid out and the way the whole thing feels and looks."We just want to try and make that connect with people and explain to them why it's such a cherished item."A few months ago, Francis was simply a flamboyant indie rock front man. Now, he talks about business plans and the deals he has struck with various record labels."We're five kids from Sunderland who have been messing around in the back of a van for five years touring the world," he says."It's quite easy to slip back into the crazy gang mentality, but we've had to put our businessmen heads on."The group's second album missed the top 40 and they are now between record contracts. With minimal money to be made from album sales, mid-ranking indie bands must find other sources of income.Dutch Uncles are critical favourites but their three albums have not troubled the top 40. Singer Duncan Wallis says the idea of making money from selling records just does not occur to bands such as his."It's just not something you really consider," he says. "You only think about the money to be made out of touring, at this level anyway."Frankie and the Heartstrings say they have sacrificed summer festival fees in order to work in the shop, which earns them "enough to get by, and that's all we care about".The alternative would be much worse - getting proper jobs."The shop, if you maintain it correctly, could become an income for the band," Francis says. "If it wasn't for the shop we would all have to be in work now."Until now, the band have survived on the money they have made from their music. When a pizza company used one of their songs in a TV advert, the group lived for a year on the proceeds.Francis says: "I don't think there's any shame in that any more because you don't make any money from selling records, so you've got to make an income somehow."In the store, the band also sell their own coffee blend and brand of beer, and Francis admits they make more money from coffee than records most days. Like many other independent record stores, they know they cannot survive by selling music alone.Work by local artists and photographers adorns the walls and there are dedicated racks promoting records by local bands."We've had kids from the local area who've come into the shop, bought some records and the next week they've come in and said, 'We've just started a band, can we have a gig in here?'" Francis says.But the most prominent space is reserved for the new album by Frankie and the Heartstrings.The singer laughs: "If we're going to run a record shop, we're going to be number one in the charts every week in this store."</body>

      <title>CSI Scotland: How forensics caught Peter Tobin</title>
      <description>How forensics caught serial killer Peter Tobin</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-24430345</url>
      <date>1381273998</date>
      <body>The discovery of the body of young Polish woman Angelika Kluk hidden under the floorboards of a Glasgow church led to one of the most high-profile forensics investigations in recent years. Senior Forensic Scientist Carol Weston was the woman who gathered the evidence which would eventually catch serial killer Peter Tobin.Angelika Kluk, a 23-year-old languages student, went missing in September 2006. She had last been seen in the grounds of St Patrick's Roman Catholic Church in the Anderston area of Glasgow.Days later her body was found hidden below a small wooden hatch in the floor of the church, her hands were tied and she was covered by a tarpaulin.The chief investigating officer on the case, Det Supt David Swindle, tells the BBC's Crime Scene Scotland the way she was found showed a "total disrespect for human life".Det Supt Swindle says he was "mindful of removing the body without disturbing evidence" and so he called in a specialist forensics team. The key person was Carol Weston.Ms Weston, 39, says she felt "very strongly" that Angelika's body should not be moved and samples should be taken "in situ"."So I wanted to actually go under the floorboards down beside the body so I could get the maximum amount of forensic evidence," she says.However, the entrance to the hatch containing the body was very small and it was "bisected" by a beam.The team discussed cutting the beam but instead it was decided that Ms Weston would squeeze in through the hole beside the body."The first thing we had to do was remove the items which were obscuring the body, which was a tarpaulin and a black bin bag with items in it," says Ms Weston."At first we were worried because they smelt so strongly of decomposing matter."We were worried there were perhaps other body parts or something else down there biological."But it turned out it was very heavily blood-stained clothing, a towel and what, in our opinion, was the murder weapon used to stab Angelika - a knife."Angelika had suffered a "very violent death", with multiple stab wounds to the head and body.Her clothing was in disarray, suggesting a sexual motive for the attack.Ms Weston says: "Eventually we did take all her clothing off in situ."The reason for that was to preserve anything that was on the clothing."Once Angelika had been stripped we could look at moving the body."She adds: "I thought the whole examination would take an hour. I was shocked when I came out from the floorboards and realised how long I had actually been there - three and a half hours."The earth beneath Angelika's body had to be laid out in grids, removed and sieved in case there was something significant buried in the soil. Key exhibits were logged. The pathologist took "intimate samples", which would prove any sexual activity.Ms Weston says it is only after all the work is complete that there is time to deal with human aspect of her job.She says: "You have finished your examination, stopped thinking so much just as a scientist and that's when it becomes a bit real."You are always very aware that you are dealing with somebody's daughter, somebody's brother. It's not some evidence. It is always a person."The last man to see Angelika alive had been the church handyman, who was known as Patrick McLaughlin.He quickly became the police's prime suspect but evidence was needed.Officers had been unable to find where the murder had taken place.Angelika had last been seen at the garage attached to the church parish house but at first there was no evidence of a violent murder.Crime scene examiner Michael Young says: "It was not obvious to anyone there was anything in there."I remember Carol finding a very tiny blood spot within the garage and she put a highlighter around it."Then she found another one and another and I remember standing back and seeing the fine spray."At first the spray was not visible because of the dark red sandstone brick but then they traced evidence of "impact spatter blood spots", which are produced when someone is beaten or struck or kicked."As soon as we found these blood spots we knew we had the right place," Ms Weston says.It took four days to painstakingly log every item in the garage.Having found evidence of the crime being committed they still needed to link their prime suspect to the murder.Seminal fluid inside Angelika's body indicated that she had sexual intercourse about the time she was murdered.Ms Weston was confident that swabs of the fluid would be able to give her a DNA profile which would match with the Scottish DNA database, which contains about 280,000 profiles.But, surprisingly, there was no hit on the database.Ms Weston says: "It is your worst nightmare. You do a lot of work. You get a profile and you've got no name."The murder was in Scotland, the prime suspect was Scottish, so a hit in England seemed remote.However, the English database came back with the name Peter Tobin, who had been convicted of a sex offence in Hampshire in 1993 and released in 2003.Fingerprint evidence from the bin bag and tarpaulin was also linked back to Tobin.There was also a wooden table leg with blood on it found in the garden of the church.The hunt was on for Tobin and he was discovered by chance when a nurse at a hospital in London recognised his picture in the media.When Tobin was arrested he was wearing a T-shirt which was stained on the lower front.The staining proved to be a mixture of his semen and cellular material matching Angelika Kluk.In May 2007, Tobin was found guilty of raping and murdering Angelika.Judge Lord Menzies said Tobin should serve a minimum of 21 years, describing him as "an evil man".The case later helped link Tobin to the murders of two other young women: Vicky Hamilton and Dinah McNicol.Crime Scenes Scotland: Forensics squad is one BBC One Scotland on Wednesday 9 October at 22:35.</body>

      <title>Why did Nelson Mandela thank Glasgow?</title>
      <description>Why did Nelson Mandela thank Glasgow?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-22976781</url>

      <body>Three years after his release from almost three decades in prison, Nelson Mandela went to Glasgow to thank the city for its support in the fight against apartheid in his native South Africa.Nelson Mandela praised the "Citizens of Glasgow" for being the first to offer him the Freedom of the City, at a time more than a decade earlier when many others were still condemning him as a terrorist for his role in challenging the system of racial segregation in his home country.In a speech at the City Chambers in Glasgow on 9 October 1993, he said: "While we were physically denied our freedom in the country of our birth, a city 6,000 miles away, and as renowned as Glasgow, refused to accept the legitimacy of the apartheid system, and declared us to be free."Mandela's visit to Scotland's largest city in 1993, the year before he became president of the Republic of South Africa, was the culmination of a long association between people in the city and his campaign for freedom, which began when he was imprisoned in 1962.Scottish anti-apartheid activist Brian Filling campaigned from the 1960s against the system in South Africa which allowed the white minority to oppress the majority black inhabitants.He had joined the campaign when his parents got to know the English theatre director Cecil Williams, who had allowed Mandela to pretend to be his chauffeur and had been in the car with him when he was arrested.Mandela had been convicted of charges including conspiring to commit acts of sabotage and guerrilla warfare for the purpose of violent revolution.However, the trial was condemned by the United Nations Security Council and nations around the world.Mr Filling says that, despite some of the dreadful things happening in South Africa in 1960s and 70s, it was "not fashionable to be associated with Mandela because he was widely regarded and reported in our media as a terrorist".However in 1981, Glasgow Council decided to set its face against this opinion and awarded Mandela the Freedom of the City.Mr Filling remembers that just a couple of years earlier the previous Lord Provost of Glasgow, David Hodge, had hosted a lunch with the South African ambassador, which had sparked a protest outside the City Chambers and a threat by catering staff not to prepare the food.He says: "The incoming Lord Provost, Michael Kelly, partly as a reaction to all this, wanted to give the freedom of the city to Nelson Mandela."Dr Kelly says: "It was a bold step for the Labour Party in Glasgow because Mandela was regarded as a terrorist by a lot of people and many people thought Glasgow should not become involved in this at all."So it was an uphill struggle and we received a lot of bad publicity, but eventually when Mandela's story got through people began to see that we and he were in the right."Glasgow's promotion of Mandela's cause quickly led to other cities following suit and within a year Kelly had launched a declaration for the release of Nelson Mandela. It went on to gain support from 2,500 mayors from 56 countries around the world.The declaration got the backing of the United Nations in New York and Dr Kelly, on behalf of the city of Glasgow, had the "privilege" of being invited to speak first in support of the petition.In 1986, Glasgow brought more attention to the jailed freedom fighter by changing the name of St George's Place in the city centre to Nelson Mandela Place.The name change was made more significant by the fact that the South African consulate-general was based on the fifth floor of the Stock Exchange building, at an address which now bore the name of the country's most famous political prisoner.By now the efforts to free Mandela had become mainstream with global pop stars such as Jim Kerr, from Glasgow band Simple Minds, writing songs and playing concerts in support of his freedom.International pressure, in the form of sanctions against the South African regime, eventually led to Mandela's release.At the age of 71, Mandela was freed on 11 February 1990 after 27 years in prison.During the 1980s he had been given the Freedom of the City by nine UK regions - Aberdeen, Dundee, Greenwich, Islwyn in Gwent, Kingston Upon Hull, Midlothian, Newcastle, Sheffield and, of course, Glasgow.It was the city which was chosen to host Mandela as he arrived to accept all these awards in October 1993.Brian Filling, who set up the 1993 trip and spent two years getting agreement from all the other cities that Glasgow should be the venue, says: "He was very appreciative of the people of Britain for their support, rather than the government - which seemed to hold out against imposing sanctions on South Africa."I think there is a special place in terms of his heart and mind for the people of Scotland."Dr Kelly was able to ask Mandela if he knew about Glasgow awarding him the freedom of the city back in 1981, while he was locked up on Robben Island.The former lord provost says: "He confirmed there was a grapevine and through that he'd received these snippets of information. So at the time he had known about the award, and it kept him and his fellow prisoners going."Mr Filling says there had always been a concern about whether the man he had campaigned to free for so many years would live up to the "legend"."But in fact, he did. If anything, he was even greater than he had been imagined."</body>

      <description>Fresh call for tuition fee rise hits headlines</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24455393</url>
      <date>1381294577</date>
      <body>The Independent reports that the vice-chancellor of Oxford University believes leading colleges should be allowed to raise their tuition fees to £16,000 a year to "meet the true costs" of educating their students.Professor Andrew Hamilton says Oxford's "world class education system" is being jeopardised by an annual shortfall of £70m.The paper's editorial argues that the funding gap did not start when fee changes came in two years ago and it says it is too soon to judge whether the current arrangements are working.According to the Times, students facing the prospect of higher fees are likely to turn to a new lender to help them fund their education - the "bank of gran and grandad".It says a report by an equity release group has found that an estimated 364,000 grandparents have contributed towards university fees and living costs.It predicts that by 2023, 1.7 million people will have dipped into their savings to help their grandchildren avoid graduating with heavy debts.Both the Express and the Mirror lead with the news that the mother of Madeleine McCann has applied to appear in court in Portugal in her libel action against a former Portuguese detective.Kate McCann is said to be desperate to defend herself against claims that she and husband Gerry covered up the death of their daughter in an accident.The Daily Express says she is expected to use new evidence uncovered by Scotland Yard which will be revealed in a Crimewatch special on Monday.The Daily Mirror says she hopes that "giving an emotional account" will help to win the case.A group of charities has written a letter to the Daily Telegraph urging members of the House of Lords to support changes in the law that would ensure people in foster care receive support beyond the age of 18.The chief executives of the NSPCC, Barnardo's and the Children's Society, among others, say care leavers are "more likely to be unemployed, single parents, mental health service users, homeless or in prison".The charities say allowing people to remain with their foster carers until they are 21 "makes financial and moral sense".Many of the papers reserve space for Professor Peter Higgs, the physicist awarded the Nobel Prize for proposing the existence of a particle that helps explain how matter formed after the big bang."It's the boson what won it" is the headline in the Sun.There is also much head-scratching over the whereabouts of the scientist, who is described by the Guardian as being "as elusive as the Higgs boson".The paper explains how Prof Higgs has "disappeared off on holiday without a mobile phone" to escape the media attention.The Daily Mail says the man who "solved one of the greatest mysteries in the universe" is at the centre of one himself after vanishing into a black hole where even the Nobel Prize officials could not find him.The Times says there are rumours that Professor Higgs may have retreated to the Cairngorms, the spot where he came up with his theory 50 years ago.</body>

      <title>Failings found in border safeguards</title>
      <description>A report highlights a series of failings in the government's £500m "e-borders" programme to gather information on passenger movements in and out of the UK.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24453677</url>
      <date>1381300904</date>
      <body>A report has found failings in the government's £500m "e-borders" scheme to gather information on passenger movements in and out of the UK.The independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, John Vine, found that fewer than two-thirds of passenger movements were covered.And almost 650,000 records relating to smuggling had been deleted, he found.The Home Office said UK border technology was the most advanced in Europe but agreed there was more to do.The aim of the e-borders programme, devised by the Home Office in 2003, was to improve immigration controls by collecting advanced passenger information (API) on every scheduled inbound and outbound journey to and from the UK.That would enable staff to "export the border" - preventing passengers from travelling where this was considered a threat to the UK.A target was set to collect data on at least 95% of passenger movements by December 2010 but, at the time of the inspection last year, only 65% were being recorded.The report, parts of which are deleted from the public version, said: "We found that the e-borders programme had failed to deliver the planned increases in API and this had a detrimental impact on the delivery of all anticipated benefits."It blamed legal difficulties surrounding the collection of API on European flights and a failure to test the e-borders concept on train and sea routes.Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Vine said people with an alert against their name for "terrorist sympathy or activity" should be met at airport arrivals gates by border staff, but that was only being done at Heathrow among Britain's airports.He also said the e-Borders system was supposed to stop people flying to the UK if they had previously been excluded or deported from the country, but "not one person" had been stopped under that system.This method of stopping people flying when they tried to check in at foreign airports was supposed to be a "key benefit" of e-Borders, Mr Vine added.The Home Office said it now carried out advance checks on 78% of those flying to Britain and required API from everyone coming from outside the EU.Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: "We have the best coverage of any country in Europe but we are working to improve our coverage further."We will take the findings of the independent inspector into account as we continue to develop our API policies and coverage."Inspectors found that the data set was not extensive enough for the e-borders programme to meet another objective - to "count in and out" all foreign national passengers - and that this wouldn't be possible until 2018 at the earliest.The report, which contains 14 recommendations, also criticised the "poor quality" of data on watch lists used by the e-borders system to alert border staff of criminals, terrorists and other suspects.It said this created inefficiencies and a greater volume of work which officials were unable to manage."This, coupled with a policy of prioritising immigration work over customs work, resulted in the deletion... of over 649,000 records concerning potential drug and tobacco smuggling, over a 10-month period," the report said.It said the deletions had a "significant impact on the ability of staff at the border to seize prohibited and restricted goods and deal with those responsible."However, the Home Office played down the importance of the information that had been deleted, saying that anyone who had committed a serious offence would already be on a separate "warnings index" and intercepted on arrival.Officials said the details that had been removed were potential matches between two databases, less than 1% of which would have prompted an alert.Among a series of positive findings, inspectors said information gathered as a result of the e-borders scheme had resulted in the arrest of thousands of people for offences including murder and rape.Immigration caseworkers were able to conduct travel history searches using the data and identify people who had left the UK after being ordered to do so.Mr Vine said he was pleased that the e-borders "high-profile alerts" system was being used to intercept high-risk individuals at the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport - but pointed out that this was not happening at any other port or airport.He suggested that a fundamental re-think was needed for the programme, which, it is estimated, will cost £536m by 2015.Mr Vine said: "The Home Office should now define clearly what the aims of the e-borders programme are ahead of the new procurement exercise, and be transparent about what e-borders will deliver and by when."</body>

      <title>Extension sought for badger cull</title>
      <description>The original targets for culling badgers are changed as new, more accurate information on population numbers becomes available.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24443110</url>
      <date>1381299980</date>
      <body>A pilot badger cull in west Somerset may be extended by up to three weeks as marksmen have failed to kill enough badgers to reach their target.Sources at Defra say that 850 badgers have been shot in the area over the six-week trial, just over 40% of an initial target of 2,081.But those sources insist the Somerset scheme has proven to be effective.They say new population data means there are far fewer badgers in the pilot area than originally thought.The controversial pilot culls set out to study if badgers could be killed safely, effectively and humanely.It is being carried out in an attempt to control TB in cattle, which can be spread by badgers, though opponents say it will have no impact.The plan was to kill 70% of the badgers in the areas of west Somerset and Gloucestershire by free shooting.Across both regions this meant around 5,000 badgers were to be killed in total.But Defra sources said these targets were based on population estimates from 2012 that have proved to be highly inaccurate."We have high confidence that between 2012 and 2013, there has been a decline in the badger population in both areas," said a source.As the cull started, hundreds of hair traps were set so that DNA could be extracted and analysed to give a more up-to-date assessment of badger numbers.In west Somerset, the population, which had been estimated at 2,400, has now been revised downwards to 1,450. In Gloucestershire, the numbers have been lowered from 3,400 to 2,350.There are a number of reasons behind the apparent decline according to Defra, including the impact of last winter's bad weather, disease and lack of food.As a result, the targets for culling have also been revised downwards to around 2,600 for both areas combined.To kill 70% of the badgers now estimated to live in west Somerset, the culling company needed to kill 1,015 badgers.After six weeks of shooting, they achieved 59%, and the company is now seeking an extension of its licence for another two to three weeks.Peter Kendall, president of the National Farmers' Union, said the number of badgers to be killed had been reduced because it was important not to "wipe out" entire populations.He told BBC Breakfast the marksmen needed "a few more weeks" to "meet the best criteria that the scientists have set"."Last year 38,000 cattle were killed and we've got to do something about the spread of this ghastly disease," he added.Asked why the desired number of badgers had not been killed, especially given the lower total population now estimated, Mr Kendall said these were pilot schemes and those involved are "learning as we go".He said there had been some "protester activity" and all shooting had been stopped whenever a person has been "spotted in a vicinity", though he said the protesters were not the reason the target number had not been reached.Defra sources believe that even on the lower figures, the exercise has been effective."This level of culling is a significant culling of the badger population and sufficient to achieve cattle disease benefits at the start of a four-year... period," the source said.There was a "possibility" that the company carrying out the Gloucestershire cull will also seek an extension.Reports in recent days suggested that the exercise in west Somerset was in trouble, with a Conservative MP admitting it had not worked as well as hoped.</body>

      <title>Home Office 'Go home' adverts banned</title>
      <description>The Advertising Standards Authority bans a Home Office mobile advert telling illegal immigrants to "go home or face arrest".</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24452551</url>
      <date>1381308334</date>
      <body>The advertising watchdog has banned a Home Office advert telling illegal immigrants to go home, saying it was misleading.But the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) cleared the campaign of being offensive and irresponsible.The campaign saw two vans drive around London for a week in July, carrying the message "Go home or face arrest."The ASA said the posters on the vans referred to inaccurate arrest statistics.It received 224 complaints about the vans from individuals, campaign groups, legal academics and the Labour peer Lord Lipsey.During the campaign, the advertising vans drove around the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Barnet, Brent, Ealing and Hounslow, some of the most diverse areas of the capital where it is thought a lot of illegal immigrants live and work.The poster displayed a picture of handcuffs and read: "In the UK illegally?... GO HOME OR FACE ARREST."ASA chief executive Guy Parker told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the campaign was considered unlikely to cause "widespread offence".But he said the phrase "go home" was "reminiscent of the racist slogan" and "clearly carries baggage".He added: "It clearly upset some people and I think it might be wise, if the government uses the poster van again, to perhaps think about using a different phrase - like return home."The campaign split the coalition, with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg saying Liberal Democrat ministers had not known about them in advance.Business Secretary Vince Cable said the campaign was "stupid and offensive".The advert said there had been 106 arrests in the area in the past week and encouraged illegal immigrants to contact immigration officials for information on how they could be helped to leave the country.In its ruling, the ASA said the reference to the number of arrests was misleading because it did not relate to those detained in the specific areas where people would have seen the vans.It said the figure referred to arrests which occurred across a large part of north London more than two weeks before the campaign began."The ad must not appear again in its current form," said the ASA report."We told the Home Office to ensure that in future they held adequate substantiation for their advertising claims and that qualifications were presented clearly."But it dismissed complaints that the slogan "Go home" had been offensive or irresponsible. It said that, while the phrase had been used in the past to attack immigrants, the Home Office was now using it in a different context.The report said: "We concluded that the poster was unlikely to incite or exacerbate racial hatred and tensions in multi-cultural communities."It was not irresponsible and did not contain anything which was likely to condone or encourage violence or anti-social behaviour."Ministers have not clarified if or when the ad vans will be used again and they have not published any data on whether the campaign led to an increase in illegal immigrants turning themselves in.However, a Home Office spokesman said: "We are pleased the ASA has concluded that our pilot was neither offensive nor irresponsible."We have always been clear that this campaign was about encouraging illegal immigrants to leave the country voluntarily and was not targeted at particular racial or ethnic groups."In respect of the ASA's other findings, we can confirm that the poster will not be used again in its current format."</body>

      <body>The UK will restore some diplomatic relations with Iran by appointing a charge d'affaires to work with the country, William Hague has announced.But the foreign secretary warned the country's president to follow up his more "positive" words on its alleged nuclear weapons programme with "concrete actions".Mr Hague told MPs further progress would require "substantial change".Iran will appoint a charge d'affaires to work with London in return.Mr Hague said it was hoped this would help "on the way towards eventual re-opening of both our embassies".The UK shut its embassy in Tehran in November 2011 after it was attacked by protesters. It then ordered the closure of the Iranian embassy in London.Mr Hague said the recently elected government of President Hassan Rouhani had "presented themselves in a much more positive light than recent governments".But Iran was still in breach of six United Nations resolutions over its alleged development of nuclear weapons, he said, adding: "We must test the Iranian government's sincerity to the full."Mr Hague also said: "We are looking forward to serious proposals from Iran to follow up on their stated desire to make rapid progress on negotiations."It will be very important for Iran's relations with the international community for the marked change of presentation and statements to be accompanied by concrete actions and a viable approach to negotiations.He added: "In the absence of change to these policies, we will continue to maintain strong sanctions. A substantial change in British or western policies requires a substantive change in that programme."For Labour, shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander criticised the government for not moving more quickly to restore relations with Iran, saying it had "misjudged" the situation and risked being "left behind".He added: "On Iran, it is time for the government to catch up with our American allies."</body>

      <body>Ex-children's minister Tim Loughton has been given permission for an emergency Commons debate after being issued with a police information notice.The Conservative MP for East Worthing and Shoreham complained to Commons Speaker John Bercow after he received the notice, which is sometimes called a harassment warning notice.In a statement, Mr Bercow told MPs the matter should be given "the precedence accorded to matters of privilege".But he did not reveal any more details.The debate will take place on Wednesday at 12:30 BST, unless it is delayed by any urgent questions or ministerial statements.Although the subject of the debate has not yet been disclosed, Mr Loughton has been involved in a long-running row with a constituent who accused him of racism.In a Commons debate in March, he said his constituent had "worked tirelessly to try to make my life hell".Mr Loughton said the constituent had sworn at him, accused him of lying and arrogance and published "creatively doctored photographs" on his blog - including one depicting the ex-minister "toting a smoking gun in a playground full of screaming, fleeing children".After he had responded to the constituent in an angry email that also included some swearing, Sussex Police began an investigation, interviewing the MP for 90 minutes under caution on suspicion of sending a malicious communication.Six months later, Mr Loughton said, he was informed that no further action would be taken.He told MPs that he planned to make a formal complaint against the force.A police information notice may be issued where there are allegations of harassment, but do not imply that the police believe the alleged harassment has taken place.</body>

      <title>Hugh Grant warns of press 'betrayal'</title>
      <description>Actor Hugh Grant says any "further compromise" by ministers over press regulation would be a "betrayal of promises" made to victims of press abuse.</description>

      <body>Actor Hugh Grant has said any "further compromise" by ministers over press regulation would be a "betrayal of the promises" made to media abuse victims.He said the government was "terrified of the press" and was doing all it could "to oblige the press barons".On Tuesday Culture Secretary Maria Miller said newspapers' proposals for regulation had been rejected.But she suggested the government was willing to consider some of the ideas put forward by publishers.Mr Grant, a member of the Hacked Off campaign, accused senior Tories of an "abuse of democracy" by trying to "sabotage" plans for a royal charter agreed by all parties in Parliament.The report of the Leveson Inquiry into press standards recommended a tougher form of self-regulation backed by legislation, and Mr Grant said any suggestion such a system would limit free speech was "propaganda on the part of the press".He said some of the main newspaper groups "refuse to accept any system which would make them accountable for any of their actions".Mr Grant said Lord Leveson had made "very mild" recommendations but the press was determined to "mark its own homework".He said victims of press abuse, such as the families of Madeleine McCann and Milly Dowler, had been told by David Cameron that new rules would protect people from the press."Any further compromise would be a betrayal of the promises made by the secretary of state and above all by the prime minister to them," Mr Grant added.Bob Satchwell, executive director of the Society of Editors, said Ms Miller was simply talking about "tidying up" press regulation plans.He said the minister agreed with Lord Leveson that a regulation system forced on the press without its consent would be "unworkable".On Tuesday Ms Miller announced that the Privy Council - an ancient body which advises the Queen, mostly made up of senior politicians - had rejected press proposals for a royal charter.She referred to principles in the Leveson report such as independence and access to arbitration and said an alternative plan would now be "improved", adding that ministers were said to be willing to consider some of the industry's ideas.Changes will now be made to the alternative plan backed by politicians and campaigners, and the Privy Council's decision is expected on 30 October.Roger Alton, executive editor of the Times, later said newspapers could take legal action in the European courts against new rules.He told the BBC's Newsnight programme the proposed system would be an "unjust law"."What we don't want to have is a statutory body because that is essentially the end of 300 years of a free press," he said.Mr Alton appeared on Newsnight in a personal capacity, not as a representative of his newspaper.Options for the self-regulation of the press were proposed in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry, set up in July 2011 after it emerged journalists working for the now-closed News of the World had hacked into the mobile phone of murdered Surrey schoolgirl Milly Dowler.Political involvement:"Recognition" panel:Appointments process:Corrections and apologies:Arbitration:</body>

      <title>MI5 chief warns of threat to public</title>
      <description>Thousands of Islamist extremists in the UK see the British public as a legitimate target for attacks, the director general of MI5 warns.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24454596</url>
      <date>1381282153</date>
      <body>Thousands of Islamist extremists in the UK see the British public as a legitimate target for attacks, the director general of MI5 has warned.Andrew Parker was making his first public speech since taking over as head of the UK Security Service in April.Al-Qaeda and its affiliates in Pakistan and Yemen present "the most direct and immediate threats to the UK," he said.He also warned of the damage done to British security by the leaking of classified documents from GCHQ.Addressing the Royal United Services Institute in Whitehall, Mr Parker added the security services must have access to the many means of communication which terrorists now use.Threats to the UK are growing more diverse and diffuse, he said, but warned: "It remains the case that there are several thousand Islamist extremists here who see the British public as a legitimate target."He explained that "knowing of an individual does not equate to knowing everything about them"."Being on our radar does not necessarily mean being under our microscope," he said."The reality of intelligence work in practice is that we only focus the most intense intrusive attention on a small number of cases at any one time."The challenge therefore concerns making choices between multiple and competing demands to give us the best chance of being in the right place at the right time to prevent terrorism."Mr Parker added: "We are not perfect, and there are always things we can learn, do better and sharpen up on."With 30 years in MI5, Mr Parker was previously deputy director general and before that director of its counter-terrorism division at the time of the London bombings in 2005.In his speech, he named al-Qaeda and its affiliates in south Asia and the Arabian peninsula as presenting "the most direct and immediate threats to the UK".By that he meant primarily its elements in Pakistan and separately in Yemen, from where al-Qaeda has three times succeeded in smuggling explosives past security on to planes in the last four years.Referring to the ongoing conflict in Syria, he said a growing proportion of MI5's casework concerned individuals from the UK who had travelled to fight there.He said extremist Sunni groups in Syria were aspiring to attack Western countries.This has long been a concern of Western governments - that British-based jihadists will one day return from the killing fields of Syria and turn their new-found skills on the population back home.A number of people have been stopped at airports and some have been arrested on suspicion of terrorism."For the future, there is good reason to be concerned about Syria," he said.Mr Parker said 330 people had been convicted of terrorism-related offences in Britain between 11 September 2001 and 31 March 2013.He added that in the first few months of this year, there had been four major trials related to terrorist plots.Chillingly, he reminded the public that these included plans for a 7/7-style attack with rucksack bombs, and named two other plots.There were guilty pleas in each case, he said, with 24 terrorists convicted and sentenced to more than 260 years in jail.Mr Parker's speech also went on to reveal some of the fears and frustrations his service was experiencing over both the advances in technology and those who leak government secrets into the public domain.He warned that terrorists now had tens of thousands of means of communication "through e-mail, IP telephony, in-game communication, social networking, chat rooms, anonymising services and a myriad of mobile apps".Mr Parker said it was vital for MI5 - and by inference its partner GCHQ - to retain the capability to access such information if the Security Service was to protect the country.Intelligence officials in both the US and Britain have been absolutely dismayed at the wealth of secret data taken by the former CIA contractor Edward Snowden when he fled to Russia.Some 58,000 of the files are from GCHQ, whose intelligence, Mr Parker said, had played a vital role in stopping many UK terrorist plots over the past decade.Without mentioning Mr Snowden by name, he said ''it causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques".Doing this, he added, handed the advantage to the terrorists.In conclusion, Mr Parker said he did not believe the terrorist threat was any worse now than before. But it was "more diffuse, more complicated, more unpredictable".</body>

      <body>Outspoken Labour MP Diane Abbott has been sacked as shadow public health minister by Ed Miliband.She told the BBC: "I think Ed wanted more message discipline."She recently questioned the party's stance on immigration and suggested that, although the Labour leader was "doing his best", he was being swayed by polls.The news that Ms Abbott was being sacked came as Mr Miliband completed the reshuffle of his frontbench team.In a blog on the Guardian website, Ms Abbott said the Labour leader had been "very nice" as he sacked her, and she had told him that his decision "must be right"."My first thought was that I was sorry to be no longer working with Andy Burnham and the health team," she wrote."I am also sad to be leaving some of the good friends that I made in the public health world. My role enabled me to engage with some fascinating subjects, like the sexualisation of women and girls and I plan to continue working on those issues."She concluded: "I have enjoyed being on the frontbench."But I plan to enjoy being a free agent on the backbenches even more."The BBC News Channel's chief political correspondent Norman Smith raised speculation that her sacking could clear the way for Ms Abbott to stand as Labour candidate for London mayor in 2016.Ms Abbott, a Cambridge graduate and MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington, hit the headlines last year after saying on Twitter that "white people love playing divide and rule".More recently, she has hit out at the "pornification" of British culture, calling for a purge of "sexualised" imagery from High Streets, and warning of a "crisis in masculinity".In 2012, Ms Abbott resigned from a cross-party group on counselling given to pregnant women by abortion providers, dismissing it as a "front" for those who want it outlawed.For much of her career, Ms Abbott was known as something of a left-wing maverick, rebelling against the Blair-Brown governments numerous times on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq.She also became a regular pundit on the BBC current affairs show This Week, sharing the sofa with former Conservative cabinet minister Michael Portillo.She was promoted to Ed Miliband's front bench following her unsuccessful bid to become Labour leader in 2010, in which she came last out of the five candidates to stand.In other changes to the Labour line-up confirmed on Tuesday, Shabana Mahmood has been moved from shadowing the department of business to shadowing the Treasury; ex-shadow housing minister Jack Dromey moves to the Home Office brief; Dan Jarvis moves from culture to justice; Luciana Berger moves from energy to health; Stella Creasy moves from Home Office to business; and Chris Bryant moves from immigration to work and pensions.</body>

      <title>Baker: I'll fit in at Home Office</title>
      <description>New Lib Dem Home Office minister Norman Baker says he is looking forward to working with Theresa May, despite their differences.</description>

      <date>1381237920</date>
      <body>The new Lib Dem Home Office Minister, Norman Baker, has said he is looking forward to working with Home Secretary Theresa May, despite their differences.As a backbench MP, Mr Baker claimed government scientist David Kelly was murdered in 2003 and said this may have been hushed up by the UK authorities.Home Secretary Theresa May is reported to be unhappy with his appointment.But the MP described his views on Dr Kelly as "history" and his relations with Mrs May as "friendly".Asked on BBC Radio 4's The World at One programme whether he stood by the views he published in his book The Strange Death of David Kelly, he said: "You're talking about events of 10 years ago, when we had the Blair government and their fictional weapons of mass destruction."That's history: we've moved on; it's ten years on, and what I'm doing now is looking forward to contributing to the government's anti-crime policy in the Home Office."Mr Baker's promotion from the Department of Transport, where he had been a minister for the past three years, to the Home Office was a surprise feature of Monday's government reshuffle.He has replaced Jeremy Browne, previously regarded as one of Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg's closest allies.His new role as minister of state for crime prevention hands him responsibility for policy on drugs, organised and violent crime and anti-social behaviour.In his book, the Lib Dem MP claimed Dr Kelly had been killed by Iraqi dissidents opposed to Saddam Hussein and his murder may have been passed off as suicide by the British security services for "reasons of political expediency".But Mr Baker said: "I entirely respect the work of MI5 and the security services, who are doing a great job protecting us from terrorism."On whether his new boss was happy with his appointment, he was asked if it was true that she had been "spitting tacks". He replied: "No, or if she was, then I didn't notice it. I had a very friendly chat with Theresa last night."He continued: "Theresa and I come from different places, but we'll work together."The coalition works well. We're a mature bunch of people. We understand where we're coming from, where our differences are, and there's no reason why we shouldn't work in a consensual way."I'm looking forward to working with her and her colleagues."The Lib Dems have said the minister's views on the death of government scientist David Kelly in 2003 are irrelevant to the job.On BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said Mr Baker had proved he could be trusted with sensitive information.Mr Alexander, one of the most senior Lib Dems in government, said his colleague's views on the death of Dr Kelly were "well explained" and he personally did not agree with them.But he added: "It is an excellent appointment. As we enter the last third of this government, there are a whole range of areas that we, as Liberal Democrats, need to sharpen our campaigning edge."The Home Office represented one such area, he said.Dr Kelly, a weapons expert, was found dead in an Oxfordshire wood after he was named as the source of claims about Iraq's weapons capability which triggered a furious row between the then Labour government and the BBC.Mr Baker spent six months investigating the circumstances of Dr Kelly's death, stepping down from his frontbench role at the time. He has maintained his calls for a fresh public inquiry.The 2004 Hutton Inquiry concluded that Dr Kelly committed suicide.A formal inquest has never been held but Attorney General Dominic Grieve has rejected calls for the case to be reopened, saying the evidence about the causes of death was "overwhelming".The Lib Dem Voice website - which is read by party activists - quoted a source close to the party leadership as suggesting Mr Browne had failed to leave a "liberal imprint" during his time at the Home Office.Stephen Tall, the website's co-editor, said Mr Baker's appointment could also be explained by the party's "sluggish" response to the "Go Home Vans row" where billboards were driven around parts of the UK warning illegal immigrants to either leave the country voluntarily or face arrest.The Lib Dems claimed they were not consulted about the policy, with Mr Browne saying he was away at the time.</body>

      <title>IMF cuts global growth forecast</title>
      <description>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has trimmed its forecast for global economic growth at the same time as lifting its UK growth projection.</description>

      <date>1381259442</date>
      <body>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has trimmed its forecast for global economic growth at the same time as lifting its UK growth projection.It now expects global growth of 2.9% this year, a cut of 0.3% from July's estimate. In 2014 it expects global growth of 3.6%, down 0.2%.It cited weakness in emerging economies for the cut.The forecast for UK growth this year received a significant upgrade to 1.4%, up from July's estimate of 0.9%.And for next year the IMF expects UK growth of 1.9%, up from July's projection of 1.5%.The IMF's upgrades for its outlook on the UK are larger than those it made for any other country in its World Economic Outlook - its twice-yearly assessment of the global economy.It credited recent data indicating higher consumer and business confidence, for the increase.However, it warned that it would still take years for the UK economy to recover fully from the 2008 financial crisis. It suggested that the government could help boost growth by bringing forward planned public infrastructure spending, such as building new homes.The UK Treasury said the IMF upgrade showed the government's economic strategy was working."But risks to the global economy remain high, and the recovery cannot be taken for granted. That is why the government will not let up in implementing its economic plan," a spokesman added.Despite the improvement in growth in advanced economies such as the UK and US, the IMF warned that a slower pace of expansion in emerging economies such as Brazil, China and India, was holding back global expansion.It expects growth in Russia, China, India and Mexico to be slower than it forecast in July.In part, it says this is due to expectations of a change in policy by US central bank the Federal Reserve. Simply the expectation that the US could trim back its efforts to stimulate the US economy has already had an impact on interest rates in emerging economies, the IMF said.It said an increasing belief that China's growth rate would slow would also hit global growth.The IMF expects the US to drive global growth.But it warns that the political standoff over raising the US government's borrowing limit, if it results in the US defaulting on its debt payments, "could seriously damage the global economy".It expects growth of 1.6% in the US this year and 2.6% next year, down 0.1% and 0.2% from its July forecast.In the US capital on Tuesday, Republicans in Congress and Democratic President Barack Obama remained at an impasse over a shutdown of the US government and legislation to increase the US borrowing limit.At a news conference, Mr Obama stressed that failing to raise America's so-called 'debt ceiling' would undermine the world's confidence in the United States and might permanently increase borrowing costs.Mr Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, leader of opposition Republicans who have demanded major policy concessions from the Democrats in exchange for approving a government budget and allowing debt limit increase, spoke on the telephone on Tuesday but failed to reach a resolution.Mr Boehner's office criticised the president for what it described as his unwillingness to negotiate, while the White House said Mr Obama was happy to negotiate with the Republicans but only after the US government was reopened and the borrowing limit raised.The impasse continued as the US sold one-month bonds at its highest interest rate in five years on Tuesday as investor fears rose over whether the government would reach a deal to avert a default on its debt payments.In the euro area, the IMF says business confidence indicators suggest activity is close to stabilising in peripheral economies, such as Italy and Spain, and already recovering in core economies such as Germany.Overall, it predicts growth will fall 0.4% this year, an improvement of 0.1% on its July prediction, and grow 1% next year."In short, the recovery from the crisis continues, albeit too slowly," said Olivier Blanchard, economic counsellor at the IMF."The architecture of the financial system is evolving, and its future shape is still unclear. These issues will continue to shape the evolution of the world economy for many years to come,"</body>

      <title>EDL boss Tommy Robinson quits group</title>
      <description>English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson leaves the group, saying he has concerns over the "dangers of far-right extremism".</description>

      <date>1381269415</date>
      <body>English Defence League leader and founder Tommy Robinson has left the group, saying he has concerns over the "dangers of far-right extremism".The EDL organises protests across the UK against "radical Islam".Mr Robinson said it was still his aim to "counter Islamist ideology", although "not with violence but with better, democratic ideas".Several senior figures have quit, but an EDL spokesman said the group "will not die because they're walking away".He added that supporters would spend the next few weeks discussing how to proceed.The EDL, formed in 2009, has organised marches and demonstrations in several cities across the UK, which have seen sometimes violent confrontations with anti-fascism campaigners.Mr Robinson's co-leader, Kevin Carroll, has also opted to leave.Their decision follows discussions with the Quilliam group, which describes itself as a "counter-extremism think tank".Mr Robinson said: "I have been considering this move for a long time because I recognise that, though street demonstrations have brought us to this point, they are no longer productive."I acknowledge the dangers of far-right extremism and the ongoing need to counter Islamist ideology not with violence but with better, democratic ideas."He explained his motives for leaving, telling BBC Radio 5 live's Nicky Campbell: "When some moron lifts up his top and he's got the picture of a mosque saying 'boom' and it's all over the national newspapers, it's me, it's when I pick up my kids from school the parents are looking at me, judging me on that."And that's not what I've stood for and my decision to do this is to be true to what I stand for. And whilst I want to lead the revolution against Islamist ideology, I don't want to lead the revolution against Muslims."I believe that the revolution needs to come from within the Islamic community and they need to stand up. And I believe this is a step forward not a step back."Mr Robinson said his decision would be a "massive problem" for him.He added: "Do I feel English Defence League members are going to plant bombs and target my family? No I don't. [But] I feel there will be a backlash."Mr Robinson also said he wanted to become a more "credible voice" through working with Quilliam: "I'm going to be more hated than I was yesterday. That's for sure. If I saw this as a way out [of public life]... I would have just quit the English Defence League."In a press conference, he later added: "I apologise for the fact that what I've represented and said has not resonated individually with Muslims."From day one in the English Defence League, we've wanted to embrace everyone: all colours and all creeds."Later, in an interview with the BBC's Newsnight programme, he reiterated his beliefs that there should be better regulation of mosques in the UK to curb the influence of "preachers of hate" and "an end to Islamic immigration until the problem is solved".Quilliam said it hoped Mr Robinson would "invest his energy and commitment in countering extremism of all kinds, supporting the efforts to bring along his former followers and encouraging his critique of Islamism as well as his concern with far-right extremism".Chairman Maajid Nawaz said: "As well as being a very positive change for the United Kingdom, this is a very proud moment for Quilliam. This represents not a change but a continuation for us, as challenging extremism of all kinds forms the basis of our work."We have been able to show that Britain stands together against extremism regardless of political views and hope to continue supporting Tommy and Kevin in their journey to counter Islamism and neo-Nazi extremism."Mr Robinson and Mr Carroll are due to face trial later this month, charged with obstructing police officers near the scene of the killing of soldier Lee Rigby.The men allegedly tried to defy a ban on marching to the scene in Woolwich, south-east London, via a major mosque, on 29 June.Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Muslim youth organisation the Ramadhan Foundation, said: "I met Tommy Robinson last week and during that meeting he indicated that he was leaving the EDL because he couldn't control the extremist group, impact on his family and wider legal cases he faces."At no stage did he reject his previous disgusting attacks on Islam and Muslims or apologise to the British people for the millions wasted policing their protests."I cannot take Tommy Robinson or Kevin Carroll's announcement seriously until they reject their fascist views on Islam and Muslims and would caution other organisations celebrating this announcement as a massive personal achievement."And Professor Matthew Goodwin of Nottingham, who has studied the EDL, said: "I would treat the announcement with extreme caution given Stephen Lennon's (aka Tommy Robinson's) recent comments against Islam in general on Twitter, and already signs that a new movement that is not geared around demonstrations may be formed."In hindsight, this may all owe more to the quest for publicity than to a genuine conversion to democratic ideas"</body>

      <title>EU exit would be suicide, says Clegg</title>
      <description>It would be "economic suicide" for Britain to leave the European Union and supporters must "speak up", Nick Clegg says.</description>

      <date>1381230965</date>
      <body>It would be "economic suicide" for Britain to leave the European Union, Nick Clegg has warned.The deputy PM said a new "coalition in the national interest" was needed to make the case for membership, and asked businesses and charities to help.He attacked David Cameron's proposed referendum, calling it a "short-sighted political calculation" which could see the UK "stumble out" of the EU.Eurosceptic group Business for Britain accused Mr Clegg of "scaremongering".In a speech at the London headquarters of Swiss technology firm Buhler Group, Mr Clegg said EU withdrawal would leave Britain "isolated and irrelevant in our own backyard" and not "taken seriously" by world superpowers.He has written to 100 businesses, charities and trade groups urging them to speak out about the benefits the EU brings."My great fear, in all of this, is that pro-Europeans are being too slow to wake up to the danger ahead," the Liberal Democrat leader said."The day I dread - the day I hope never comes - is a time when it is all too late: Britain has stumbled out of the EU, and we look back to these days and say we should have done more."It will not be enough to speak up on the eve of a referendum. We need to start challenging some of the ludicrous myth-making by the isolationists now."Mr Clegg said he accepted a referendum was inevitable but believed it should be held after the change to EU rules.Mr Cameron has promised a public vote on EU membership in 2017 if the Conservatives win the next general election.But Mr Clegg said that was designed to "plaster over" internal Tory divisions over Europe until after the 2015 general election.Mr Clegg said: "Next May the Euro elections are bound to become a proxy for the bigger questions of 'in versus out' - a debate that will play out in the 2015 general election, too."He argued that "you cannot overstate the damage" that leaving the EU would do and predict that having to negotiate individual trade treaties would take a decade."We simply will not be taken seriously by the Americans, the Chinese, the Indians, all the big superpowers, if we're isolated and irrelevant in our own backyard," he said.On Sunday Conservative backbench MP Adam Afriyie said he would try to force the government to hold the referendum in 2014, and Mr Clegg said it was "not even clear" Mr Cameron would be able to delay the vote until 2017.He also questioned whether any reform of Britain's relationship with the EU would "ever be acceptable to the large swathes in the Conservative Party who want to be semi-detached from the EU or out of it altogether".Business for Britain chief executive Matthew Elliott said: "Nick Clegg has shown today that he is out of touch with how the majority of the British people, including thousands of British business people, feel about the European Union."He added: "Contrary to what he said in this speech, it is the deputy prime minister rather than David Cameron who is 'playing with fire'. By writing off the process of renegotiation before it has even properly begun, Nick Clegg is increasing the likelihood of Britain voting to leave."But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: "Nick Clegg is right to make the case for the EU and say that paid holidays and other workplace rights are some of the best arguments for EU membership. Leaving the EU would be disastrous for jobs and investment."Separately, in a Westminster debate on UK-US relations, Conservative MP Michael Fabricant said: "The United States is very keen that we remain in the European Union but that is partly because some US diplomats have said privately they think the United Kingdom is the only sane voice in the European Union when it comes to some issues."</body>

      <title>Lenders in Help to Buy waiting game</title>
      <description>Three large UK mortgage lenders are still undecided on whether to join the government's expanded Help to Buy scheme.</description>

      <date>1381244905</date>
      <body>Three large UK mortgage lenders remain undecided on whether to join the government's Help to Buy scheme.Barclays, Santander and Nationwide Building Society all said they were reviewing the details of the scheme, published on Tuesday, before reaching a decision on participation.Other lenders have unveiled the cost of mortgages they plan to offer.The government's initiative is designed to allow those who can afford only small deposits to buy a home.RBS, NatWest and Halifax will start taking applications this week, with HSBC, Virgin Money, Lloyds, TSB and Aldermore joining later. That means lenders representing about 40% of the UK mortgage market have committed to the scheme.RBS and NatWest are offering a two-year, fixed-rate mortgage starting at 4.99% for those with a 5% deposit, with no fee.RBS, which owns NatWest, said it had already filled all of its mortgage appointments across its branch network for the rest of the week. And it said its new online Help to Buy pages were being viewed 40 times per minute.Halifax will be taking applications by the end of the week at a rate of 5.19% with a £995 fee for those with the same deposit.Prime Minister David Cameron said he was happy with the interest being shown so far."I am very content that we are going to get a good range of products in the market and that is going to help people who want to get on to the housing ladder, who want to own their own home, who can afford mortgage payments but can't currently get mortgages," he said."Those are the people we want to help."Comparisons on the interest rates are difficult, as there are so few 95% mortgages on the market at present.The most competitive, widely available two-year fixed rate mortgage before Help to Buy, for those offering a 5% deposit, has an interest rate of 5.95%, according to financial information service Moneyfacts.For those able to offer a 10% deposit, the cheapest mortgage deal was 3.54%, with a fee of £1,675, Moneyfacts said.The first phase of the Help to Buy scheme in England started in April, when buyers of newly built homes were eligible for a 20% equity loan from the government on top of their 5% deposit.Similar schemes are operating in Scotland and Wales.Under the second phase, buyers across the UK only need to provide a small deposit, with the government offering a guarantee of 15% of the loan to the lender - for a fee - to encourage the bank or building society to offer the loan.That fee charged to the lender is up to 0.9% of the original loan level. This is a one-off fee dealt with entirely by the lender, which guarantees 15% of the mortgage for seven years.Borrowers who apply will face checks to make sure that they can afford the mortgage payments. The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), which represents lenders, said affordability checks would be as "rigorous" as they were with any borrower.The scheme will be available for first-time buyers and home movers borrowing to buy new and old homes valued at no more than £600,000. It is expected to continue for three years.It means a buyer looking to purchase a home costing £200,000 would have to put down a deposit of around £10,000. Demands have been much higher than this for many first-time buyers since the start of the financial crisis, usually about 20% of the value of a home.An influential group of MPs has echoed concerns about the potential effect of the Help to Buy scheme. The Treasury Select Committee said that great care was needed from the government when setting up and running the scheme."Mistakes could distort the housing market or carry threats to financial stability," it said.It said that - without care - the scheme could raise house prices, rather than stimulate the number of homes for sale."We continue to believe that the government of the day will face strong incentives to extend the scheme, with the attendant risk that the mortgage guarantee scheme becomes a permanent feature of the UK mortgage market," it said.Last month, Chancellor George Osborne asked the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) to make annual reviews of the scheme, starting next September. The committee had been due to make an assessment only after its first three years of operation.Treasury officials said that the FPC would advise on the fee that lenders had to pay, which could be changed each year, and whether to change the £600,000 limit.Mr Osborne said that the housing market was recovering from low levels of activity and the latest extension of Help to Buy would help many more people get a foot on the ladder.Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, questioned whether homes as expensive as £600,000 should be included in the scheme, and said that more affordable homes should be built."Unless George Osborne acts now to build more affordable homes, as we have urged, then soaring prices risk making it even harder for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder. You can't tackle the cost of living crisis without building more homes," he said.The scheme is getting under way as surveyors report their sales levels are at their highest for nearly four years.The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said a large majority of surveyors were expecting house prices to rise.</body>

      <title>Watchdog warning on gagging clauses</title>
      <description>The use of "gagging clauses" risks stopping employees from speaking out about failures in the public sector, the National Audit Office warns.</description>

      <date>1381247387</date>
      <body>The use of "gagging clauses" risks stopping employees from speaking out about failures in the public sector, the National Audit Office has warned.The spending watchdog found evidence of "unnecessary" confidentiality agreements being used in the health sector which it said may prevent "genuine concerns" from being raised.It has urged officials to provide clear guidance on when clauses are justified.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has raised concerns about their use in the NHS.Mr Hunt wrote to all NHS Trusts in England in February to tell them that staff who raised concerns about patient safety should be "celebrated" and not prevented from speaking out.It came after Gary Walker, former chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust (ULHT), said he had been forced out of his job and gagged from speaking out about his concerns over patient safety.In a new report, the National Audit Office said it had reviewed 84 cases where government departments and other public sector employers had reached "compromise agreements" with staff to facilitate their departure.Of these, 31 contained clauses preventing the employee from disclosing confidential information obtained during their employment while 27 prohibited staff from making derogatory or disparaging statements about their employer after they had left the organisation.In two cases, contractual arrangements had been reached "that might be considered gagging clauses", it added, in which individuals agreed not to pursue complaints against a range of organisations including the Department of Health and the hospital regulator, the Care Quality Commission.The details of the employers concerned have not been published.But in one of the cases, the NAO found there was no evidence that the employee was a potential whistleblower and "it is not clear from the papers that we reviewed why such clauses were considered necessary".In the other, the individual concerned - a hospital manager - had reported concerns about fraud and patient safety but was dismissed following complaints from a member of staff about their behaviour.An interim employment tribunal ruled that the individual should be re-instated but, by then, their post had been axed in a restructuring and they subsequently reached a termination agreement including a confidentiality clause."There is a risk that clauses like these might discourage the employee raising genuine concerns about service failure with the appropriate oversight bodies," the report concluded.The Treasury is considering a new framework to ensure consistency across Whitehall over the use of severance payments and confidentiality agreements for departing staff.The NAO report found that the Treasury had sanctioned severance payments totalling more than £250,000 to four individuals whose performance and conduct in their jobs had been questioned.It said the Treasury had taken into account due process, the risk of litigation and the chances of winning a case at an employment tribunal before deciding the payments represented "value for money" for the public.The NAO has said "clear and published" guidance must be available on the use of confidentiality agreements and that any agreements should not prejudice individuals' right to disclose information in the public interest.</body>

      <title>Deal is agreed to pass Welsh budget</title>
      <description>Labour ministers agree a deal with Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats to ensure the Welsh budget is passed in the Senedd.</description>

      <date>1381231766</date>
      <body>Welsh Labour ministers have agreed a deal with opposition parties to ensure their budget is passed in the Senedd.Around £100m will be devoted to Plaid Cymru and Liberal Democrat priorities, including money to treat more patients in the community rather than hospital.There is also a doubling of funding for a scheme to help poorer school pupils.Lacking an overall majority, Labour needs agreement to approve its 2014/15 spending plans, expected to be the toughest since devolution in 1999.The full draft budget, worth around £15bn, will be published on Tuesday afternoon, with AMs due to vote on the final version before Christmas.£50m will be spent on the fund to keep more patients, who do not need to be admitted, out of hospital and treated in the community.A further £9.5m will be used to provide robotic prostate cancer treatment in north and south west Wales and to improve telemedicine services, allowing more specialist consultations closer to patients' homes.£35m was secured to expand a Liberal Democrat flagship policy, the pupil deprivation grant.It currently gives schools £450 for every child eligible for free school meals.This will now rise to £918 per pupil in 2014/15.A £5.5m fund to prevent homelessness amongst vulnerable people was also announced.A joint statement from First Minister Carwyn Jones, Plaid leader Leanne Wood and Welsh Lib Democrat leader Kirsty Williams called it an "unprecedented £100m agreement".The deal between government and opposition was announced as public services braced themselves for spending cuts, expected to be announced a few hours later by Finance Minister Jane Hutt.Local councils had already been warned they will be exposed to more cuts than in previous years.A Welsh government source said ministers were preparing to deliver "the toughest budget since devolution".John Rae, director of resources with the Welsh Local Government Association, said: "We estimate we are facing cuts of around 4% after the local government minister warned us we'd be looking at English-style reductions."Speaking on BBC Radio Wales, he said there had been "a level of protection" to local government in Wales, and a study had shown that until now councils in Wales probably had taken "half the cut that councils in England had faced".He added that all the councils in Wales had their own priorities, but services in "discretionary areas" such as leisure, culture, planning, libraries, highways, street lights and economic development would be affected.The Conservatives have previously criticised Labour for not protecting the health budget against inflation.Spending on the NHS has been frozen in recent years - meaning it has been cut in real terms after taking account of inflation.A review of the health budget was carried out over the summer.Speaking ahead of the draft budget, shadow finance minister Paul Davies AM criticised the situation in the NHS in Wales where "patients are routinely waiting over four hours to be seen in AandE".He added: "For the sake of our NHS, Carwyn Jones must use this draft budget to reverse Labour's damaging health cuts."In the last two years, Labour has done separate budget deals with Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats.This year, Plaid and the Lib Dems have joined forces to negotiate a deal with the government.An assessment by the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank said the UK government's block grant to Wales in 2013/14 would be around 9.4% smaller in real terms than it was in 2010/11.More cuts announced for the two years after that would take the reduction to 12.2%.</body>

      <body>David Cameron vowed to get behind business to create a "land of opportunity for all", in his big speech to close the Conservative conference.His 50-minute address sought to set out dividing lines with "the 1970s-style socialism" he said Labour now offered.He claimed the economy was "turning the corner" and the "land of hope is Tory", while "the land of despair was Labour".Mr Cameron also hinted that benefits for under-25s could be cut in an effort to get more young people into work.But Labour said the prime minister had failed to address the "cost-of-living crisis" and offered a land of opportunity "for just a privileged few".During the 50-minute speech, Mr Cameron contrasted his own party's philosophy with that of the opposition, saying: "If Labour's plan for jobs is to attack business, ours is to back business."He criticised Labour leader Ed Miliband, who promised in his end-of-conference address last week to freeze energy prices and increase corporate tax on big firms, telling Tory activists that "profits, tax cuts and enterprise... are not dirty, elitist words".Mr Cameron argued that adding more state borrowing and spending to ease the "cost-of-living crisis" would risk putting the UK on the economic trajectory of Greece."It's all sticking plasters and quick fixes cobbled together for the TV cameras - Red Ed and his Blue Peter economy, " said the prime minister.Earlier in the week, Chancellor George Osborne announced plans to make the long-term unemployed undertake work placements if they want to continue receiving benefits.In his speech, Mr Cameron did not make any specific policy announcements, but suggested his party was looking at further changes to the welfare system to include in its manifesto for the 2015 general election.It was wrong that young people could "choose the dole" and right to "offer them something better".Mr Cameron added: "And let no one paint ideas like this as callous."Think about it: with your children, would you dream of just leaving them to their own devices, not getting a job, not training, nothing?"No - you'd nag and push and guide and do anything to get them on their way… and so must we. So this is what we want to see: everyone under 25 - earning or learning."Mr Cameron, who did not repeat previous no-notes speeches, often looked straight into the lens of the TV camera to address directly the audience outside the Manchester conference centre.The BBC's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said it was a surprisingly sober speech in parts, with Mr Cameron stressing there was still much work to do to fix Britain's economy.It was not enough just to clean up Labour's "mess" and pay off the deficit, he wanted to "build something better in its place".He added: "In place of the casino economy, one where people who work hard can actually get on; in place of the welfare society, one where no individual is written off; in place of the broken education system, one that gives every child the chance to rise up and succeed."Mr Cameron invoked the spirit of his predecessor Margaret Thatcher, the winner of three general elections, who died earlier this year, saying she had "made our country stand tall again, at home and abroad".He also made efforts to distance his party, and himself, from the Liberal Democrats, with whom the Tories have ruled in coalition for more than three years.He promised: "When the election comes, we won't be campaigning for a coalition, we will be fighting heart and soul for a majority Conservative government - because that is what our country needs..."This party at its heart is about big people, strong communities, responsible businesses, a bigger society - not a bigger state."To cheers, Mr Cameron attacked the Lib Dems for "trying to take all the credit" for lowering the minimum earnings threshold at which people start paying income tax.He joked: "Well, memo to the Lib Dems: you lecturing us on low taxes is like us lecturing you on pointless constitutional tinkering."We are Tories, we believe in low taxes and, believe me, we will keep on cutting the taxes of hard-working people in our country."Mr Cameron received a standing ovation after the speech, his ninth to conference since becoming leader in 2005.But, afterwards, Labour leader Ed Miliband said the prime minister had offered nothing to address "the cost-of-living crisis facing Britain's hard-working families".The Lib Dems said they, not the Conservatives, had made a manifesto commitment in 2010 to raise the level at which people start paying tax to £10,000.And UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the pro-business message conflicted with the reality that membership of the EU was costing the UK "billions in red tape and direct payments from high taxes".But there was a more favourable response from business groups, with CBI director-general John Cridland saying the prime minister had "sent out a strong message about how vital British business is to the future prosperity of people across the UK".Simon Walker, director-general of the Institute of Directors also welcomed the speech, but warned that firms would "be looking for him to match the sentiment with action - if tax cuts aren't dirty, let's have a few more of them".</body>

      <title>Miliband: We'll freeze energy prices</title>
      <description>Ed Miliband tells his party conference Labour will freeze energy prices if they get into power - but energy firms criticise the plan.</description>

      <body>Labour would freeze gas and electricity bills for every home and business in the UK for 20 months if it wins the 2015 election, Ed Miliband has said.The big energy firms would be split up and governed by a new tougher regulator to give people "a fairer deal".Labour says the move will save average households £120 and businesses £1,800 - but cost the energy giants £4.5bn.But energy companies said the policy could lead to power shortages, and jeopardise investment and jobs.The Labour leader said firms had been overcharging "for too long" and it was time to "reset" the energy market.The Tories accused him of a "sleight of hand", saying people would have to "pay more for their electricity" under the plans.Speaking for more than hour without notes at his party's annual conference in Brighton, Mr Miliband set out his vision of how "Britain can do better" under Labour, with an economy that works for "ordinary people once again".In other developments at Labour's conference:Mr Miliband used his speech to pledge action on what he has called Britain's "cost of living crisis", setting out an alternative vision of Britain's economy to that pursued by the Conservatives, with higher skills and wages."David Cameron talks about Britain being in a global race. But what he doesn't tell you is that he thinks the only way Britain can win is for you to lose."Mr Miliband said that means "the lowest wages, the worst terms and conditions, and the fewest rights at work - a race to the bottom", adding: "The only way we can win is in a race to the top."In an upbeat speech peppered with swipes at David Cameron and George Osborne for being out touch and lacking aspiration for the country, Mr Miliband repeatedly used the phrase "We're Britain, we're better than this" to cheers and applause from Labour activists.He received standing ovations for defending the NHS and promising to axe "the bedroom tax" - and tackled Tory criticism that he lacks leadership skills head-on, saying: "If they want to have a debate about leadership and character - be my guest."Unlike David Cameron, he told the party faithful, he had stood up to vested interests on media regulation and the tobacco lobby and made the right call on Syria. There was no mention in the speech of Mr Cameron's coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats.Explaining what he believes has gone wrong with the economy under the coalition, he said: "Too many of the jobs we're creating in this country are just too low paid, too many of the gains in our economy are just scooped up by the privileged few, including those big bonuses, and too often you are left being charged over the odds."They used to say 'a rising tide lifts all boats'. Now the rising tide just seems to lift yachts."The Labour leader has used his week in Brighton to set out some of the policies on which he will fight the next election but saved what is likely to be one of the centrepieces of the manifesto for his big speech.He vowed to abolish energy watchdog Ofgem and replace it with a new regulatory regime that ensures customers get a "fair deal"."We will legislate for this in our first Queen's Speech and it will come into effect in 2017," the Labour leader told activists."But in the meantime I am not willing to just stand by. So the next Labour government will freeze gas and electricity prices until the start of 2017."Your bills will be frozen, benefitting millions of families and millions of businesses. That's what I mean by a government that fights for you, that's what I mean when I say: Britain can do better than this."The companies won't like it because it will cost them money. But they have been overcharging people for too long because of a market that doesn't work. It is time to reset the market."Labour says the energy giants have been overcharging customers to the tune of £3.9bn since 2010 by not passing on reductions in wholesale prices to consumers.The party denies that the policy is a return to discredited "price controls" of the 1970s, arguing it is a temporary measure aimed at helping consumers while the party sets up a new regulator, which would force firms to openly sell their wholesale energy in a pooled market.But RWE npower, one of the big six energy firms targeted by Labour, criticised what it said were "easy", "simple solutions"."In reality, there are three main factors that influence prices - fixing inefficient housing stock, the investment required to replace the UK's energy infrastructure, and the cost of the buying energy on the global market," said chief executive Paul Massara.Another firm, SSE, said bills were rising because of "well-intentioned" government initiatives, not fuel costs.Chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said: "Instead of price freezes which will lead to unsustainable loss-making retail businesses, the Labour Party should put policy costs into general taxation, taking them off energy bills."Angela Knight, of industry body Energy UK, said freezing prices could hit the sector, making "energy shortages a reality, pushing up the prices for everyone".In his speech Mr Miliband also pledged to help small firms by freezing business rates in England, paid for by halting a planned increase in UK-wide corporation tax for large companies.And he said that by 2020 under Labour 200,000 houses would be built a year, with a fresh generation of new towns and "garden cities".An incoming Labour government would also scrap the £1,3bn Energy Companies Obligation, launched earlier this year to make the energy giants improve efficiency, and replace it with a more "cost-effective" regime.Unite union general secretary Len McCluskey said he was "pleased" with some of the issues raised by Mr Miliband."The most important thing was he highlighted the problems with the minimum wage and low pay and that fact that wage depression is something that needs to be tackled," he added.But John Longworth, from the British Chambers of Commerce, said talking about "controlling prices and wages sends a very bad signal" to businesses.John Cridland, from the CBI, said the plan "will deter much-needed investment" and would be viewed by business as "a setback for Labour's pro-enterprise credentials".Every Labour activist in the hall was given a copy of a book called One Nation Economy after the leader's speech.</body>

      <title>We must stay in government - Clegg</title>
      <description>The Lib Dems must be part of a coalition government after the next election to stop the Tories or Labour "messing up", Nick Clegg tells his party conference.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24137394</url>
      <date>1379527774</date>
      <body>Nick Clegg has urged the British people to put the Liberal Democrats back in government in 2015 to curb the excesses of the Tories or Labour."We are the only party that can finish the job of economic recovery, but finish it fairly," he told the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow.After three years of coalition Britain was now a "step closer" to the death of single party government, he claimed.He also spoke at length about his family and personal values.The BBC News Channel's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said Mr Clegg stuck to the argument he has been making all week - namely that coalition government works and the Lib Dems want another go at it.In a 51-minute speech aimed at preventing the Conservatives from claiming all the credit for the economic upturn, Mr Clegg said Lib Dem policies such as infrastructure spending and more apprenticeships had made all the difference."The big question mark that has always hung over the Liberal Democrats - could we handle government? And handle it when the going got tough? - that question mark is now gone."This recovery wouldn't be happening without us."He said Lib Dems had proved wrong the critics who said coalition would never work - but he also looked ahead to the next election, saying that "left to their own devices" Labour or the Tories would "mess it up".Speaking openly about forming a power sharing deal with the two bigger parties - something he avoided doing before the last election - he said: "Labour would wreck the recovery. The Conservatives would give us the wrong kind of recovery."He listed a series of Conservative policies which he claimed the Lib Dems had blocked, including "inheritance tax cuts for millionaires, profit-making in schools, firing workers at will, regional pay for public sector workers, scrapping housing benefit for young people, ditching the human rights act and closing down the debate on Trident".But he stressed that the Lib Dems were "no-one's little brother", adding: "We have our own values and beliefs."The speech contained no new policies, following Tuesday's headline-grabbing announcement on free lunches for all children in their first three years at school in England.Saying Lib Dems would extend the scheme to all primary school children, he said: "Their (the Conservatives) priority is to help some families over others, with a tax break for married couples."That tells you everything you need to know about their values."By contrast, he said his party was helping "young children get the best possible start in life, and that tells you everything about ours".The Lib Dem leadership have seen off challenges from activists to its nuclear weapons and economic policies, although delegates voted for a review of housing benefit rules - what critics call the "bedroom tax".And he scoffed at suggestions that coalition was all about personal chemistry between the party leaders, saying any coalition depended on the result of the election.In what will be seen as a hint that he is thinking of stepping down after the next election, he told activists in Glasgow that he "will not be in politics forever".But he used the speech to set out how his liberal values came to be formed, his "privileged" childhood and his "internationalist" outlook.He said the Lib Dems had always backed "home rule" for Scotland but would be urging a "no" vote in next year's independence referendum to keep the UK together.But he hoped the cross-party consensus would continue after the referendum to push for "the next advance in Scottish devolution".And he said the Lib Dems would be the party of "in" when it came to an EU referendum.Summing up what his pitch would be at the next election, he said: "In the past the Liberal Democrats would eke out an existence on the margins of British politics."Now we hold the liberal centre while our opponents head left and right. I have spent my entire life watching the other two mess it up. We cannot stand idly by and let them do it all over again."Lib Dem colleagues praised Mr Clegg's "intensely personal speech" but Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman said that, far from restraining the Conservatives, the Lib Dems had backed them all the way."He didn't mention the million young people out of work on his watch, the tax cuts for millionaires his party helped to introduce, or the cost of living crisis that means that since he became deputy prime minister wages are down an average of £1,500 a year," she added."Nothing he said today made any difference to the fact that Nick Clegg is propping up a Tory-led government that's making things worse for ordinary families."</body>

      <title>We want Britain back, says Farage</title>
      <description>UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage calls for an immediate EU exit, telling his party's conference the UK could go it alone.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24163335</url>
      <date>1379689172</date>
      <body>Britain would flourish outside the EU, Nigel Farage has said, predicting UKIP will cause a "political earthquake" in European elections next year.Addressing the party's annual conference, he said leaving the union would "open a door to the world".He described his party as the "true Europeans" as he claimed credit for shifting the terms of the debate on immigration and holding a referendum.But the speech was overshadowed by a row over remarks by MEP Godfrey Bloom.Mr Bloom has had the whip removed after he referred to a group of female activists as "sluts" - although he maintained that it was meant and taken as a joke.UKIP has reached unprecedented heights in the opinion polls under Mr Farage, coming second in the European elections in 2009 and winning hundreds of seats in the May local elections.Mr Farage has refused to predict how the party's Westminster candidates would fare in an election in 2015 but said he wants to turn the next European elections "into a referendum on EU membership"."My ambition and my conviction is that we can come first across the United Kingdom," he told activists."Let us send an earthquake through Westminster politics and let's say we want our country back."The party has sought to broaden its appeal beyond its core message of EU withdrawal, announcing policies in recent days on energy and welfare.But, in a speech dominated by Europe, Mr Farage said the European Commission had "hijacked" the EU's original ideals and the UK would begin a process of "national renewal" by going its own way.Those who warn that British trade would be harmed by a UK exit were the "true voices of Little England", he told party members."Those 10,000 trucks a day coming in from the Continent bringing goods into this country. They won't stop coming," he said."The idea that the EU will start a trade war with Britain is simply not credible. The real reason the EU won't be able or willing to stop trading with us is that the German car industry won't allow it."UKIP was growing in strength and, by the time of the next election, Mr Farage said it would be the third largest party in the country in terms of membership, overtaking the Liberal Democrats.The party is meeting just days after one of its former deputy leaders quit the organisation, frustrated by what he had described as its "totalitarian" leadership.Mike Nattrass, West Midlands MEP and a member for 15 years, accused Mr Farage of silencing dissent and surrounding himself with "cronies".But Mr Farage, by far the party's best-known figure, outlined his popularity with voters, saying in his speech: "They are fed up to the back teeth with the cardboard cut-out careerists in Westminster, the spot-the-difference politicians... the politicians who daren't say what they really mean."While there was no mention of the members who quit in protest at his leadership, he acknowledged internal clashes.Mr Farage told party members he had a "blistering row" with Godfrey Bloom, the UKIP MEP who courted controversy recently by claiming British foreign aid goes to "bongo-bongo land".Alluding to the comments, he referred to "public pronouncements that I would not always choose myself" and urged those with passionate views to focus on the "big messages".Immigration was the "biggest single issue facing" the UK, he said, as he warned of an "even darker side to the opening of the door".He claimed London had been gripped by a "Romanian crime wave"."This gets to the heart of immigration," he said. "We should not be opening our doors on 1 January to Romanian criminal gangs."The "Establishment" had dismissed anyone wanting to debate immigration as "bad and racist", he claimed.UKIP gained 16.5% of the popular vote, second only to the Conservatives, in the 2009 European elections and returned 13 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs).But, at the 2010 general election, support dwindled to 3.1% and UKIP did not win a Westminster seat.Earlier on Friday, the party's energy spokesman Roger Helmer announced it would invest profits from shale gas extraction in a sovereign wealth fund.The two-day conference is also set to discuss plans to ensure migrants have private health insurance and for social housing to be prioritised for people whose parents or grandparents were born locally.</body>

      <body>Northern Ireland's former first and deputy first ministers have criticised the current Stormont Executive.David Trimble and Seamus Mallon were speaking after they were conferred with honorary doctorates by Dublin City University.Mr Trimble said the current administration was not delivering very much apart from its existence.Mr Mallon said the DUP and Sinn Féin were lacking in political leadership.The two men travelled to Dublin to receive their doctorates in recognition of their "courage, dedication and a lifetime of commitment to the service of others".The pair were awarded the honour at the Helix on the 15th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.Mr Mallon told the Irish Times on Tuesday that Northern Ireland "could become apolitical because that leadership is not there"."Every single important issue that has cropped up, they have walked away from it," he said."The most recent one was the Maze, then there is the whole question of education."Northern Ireland's former first minister David Trimble told the paper that the differences faced by today's Executive were "of a different order" to what they were 15 years ago, but would have to be resolved at a local level.In his acceptance speech, he said the present administration was "not delivering very much apart from its existence, which is important".</body>

      <title>Prestwick Airport 'can make profits'</title>
      <description>Prestwick Airport, which is on the brink of being brought into public ownership, can be profitable if the right approach is taken, the deputy first minister says.</description>

      <body>Prestwick Airport can be profitable if the right approach is taken, the deputy first minister has said.The Scottish government announced at Holyrood on Tuesday it was negotiating to buy the airport.The Ayrshire facility, which was put up for sale last March by New Zealand-based owners Infratil, has been running annual losses of £2m.Nicola Sturgeon said she believed that "over time" Prestwick could go "back to profit".A six-weeks timetable of detailed negotiations has now begun with Infratil.Ms Sturgeon told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "We are embarking on commercial negotiations with the current owners of the airport so thing like purchase price for the airport will require to be resolved in terms of he negotiation."The minister defended the government's decision to step in to buy the airport, saying it was the "only realistic alternative to closure".She explained that, once the airport was in public ownership, there would be a detailed business case made which would include levels of investment and a timescale on turning around its fortunes.Ms Sturgeon added: "With the right financial investment, with the right commercial management, the right marketing over a period of time, Prestwick can be brought back into profit."The Scottish government's bid to buy Prestwick comes just months after struggling Cardiff Airport was sold to the Welsh government for £52m.Although publicly owned, Cardiff Airport is being by an "at arm's length" body rather than by the government, and "on a commercial basis".In a ministerial statement to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said the closure of Prestwick would be a "serious and unwelcome development" for the Ayrshire and the Scottish economies, with about 1,400 jobs linked directly or indirectly with the airport.Infratil has agreed to ensure the airport is kept fully open and operational while the negotiation process involving the government is ongoing.The only scheduled passenger airline at Prestwick, Ryanair, welcomed the likely government takeover.</body>

      <title>£600m in major projects unveiled</title>
      <description>More than £600m is to be handed out towards major projects in a bid to stimulate the economy in Wales, as local councils reel from cutbacks in funding from the Welsh government.</description>

      <body>More than £600m is to be handed out towards major projects in a bid to stimulate the economy in Wales.It includes £62m for the South Wales Metro transport project and £140m for a help-to-buy housing scheme.Finance Minister Jane Hutt says it will create or sustain 11,000 jobs and tackle poverty.The announcement comes a day after she unveiled big cuts for councils and in other areas to pay for a £570m increase in the health budget.One senior council figure warned some local authorities could "go bust".Ms Hutt announced a series of capital spending commitments, including:Ms Hutt said: "The tough economic conditions continue but I am determined to use every pound available to invest in infrastructure and boost economic growth in the long-term."Councils were still reeling from Tuesday's funding announcement by Ms Hutt and the likely knock-on on services such as leisure centres and libraries.Local government spending will fall from £4.648bn this year to £4.466bn next year, a cut in cash terms of 3.91% or 5.81% in real terms.Their budgets will be around 9% lower in real terms between now and 2015-16.Councillor Russell Goodway, cabinet member for finance on Cardiff council - Wales' largest local authority - said: "I think there will be some local authorities in Wales that will go bust in the next two or three years. They will run out of money."From where I am sitting we are in a very dark place this morning and I don't think that some local authorities are going to survive."He told BBC Radio Wales that Cardiff has to save £20m this year which it was struggling to achieve let alone the £50m in cuts it needs to find in 2014-15."Even if we stopped spending every single penny that we spend on discretionary services that would not be enough to cut our spending. We have got to find different ways of doing things."Steve Thomas, chief executive of the Welsh Local Government Association said the cuts will affect services."It's a very tough budget and it's £175m coming out of council services," he told BBC Wales."We can't keep delivering the range of services that we're currently delivering so it will impact on things such as leisure services, libraries, refuse collections and the conditions of our roads."We run something like 735 services so there's going to be a massive impact for the Welsh public."He added: "We're not the number one priority and clearly what has happened is with the mixture of Westminster cuts and the prioritisation of health spending, local government has become in effect the poor relation in terms of this budget."Mr Thomas said one way of making up the shortfall would be to raise council tax - he did not expect any councils to freeze their rates next year."We've yet to see the local government settlement but once we see it, I think there will be more pressure on the council tax," he said."It is a source of income but I think we've got to consult the public and see what services they want to prioritise."We've got three years to make these cuts and it's going to be a very tough period for local authorities to do that."In announcing her draft budget, Ms Hutt said it was not possible to "shield" all services from UK government spending cuts.She stressed the priority was to protect health, schools and universal benefits such as free prescriptions, school breakfasts and bus passes for older people.</body>

      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21013771</url>
      <date>1358939858</date>
      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant?What has happened?Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning.Why the big deal about the speech?Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech.So what did Cameron say?Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech.What sorts of powers does the UK want back?The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK."Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders?The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK.So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU?David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market."What has been the reaction in the UK?Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement.Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party.The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts.What about the reaction around Europe?The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction.What about the reaction from business?A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".Where can I get more detail on the speech?If you click on the link below you can read the whole text, with key bits picked out and analysed by BBC expertsAnnotated transcipt: Key excerpts</body>

      <description>The details of Labour leader Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet following the recent reshuffle.</description>

      <date>1381232529</date>
      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his October 2013 reshuffle.The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction.He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire.The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011.As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper.Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children.The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign.Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury.Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011.Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development.Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. The MP for Leeds West was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament.A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader.As the son of former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest.One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress.Moving to defence from shadow Northern Ireland secretary in October 2013, the MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted having smoked cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip.The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing". Like many leading female MPs, the former union worker entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide. Responsible for the controversial eco-town project as housing minister before becoming Europe minister in 2008. Supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011.One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the Cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. She supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leader of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.Chris Leslie has been appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in the latest Labour frontbench reshuffle. The former Bradford councillor was elected MP for Shipley - a Tory stronghold in Yorkshire - in 1997. He held several junior positions in the former Labour government within the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Constitutional Affairs. He lost his Shipley seat in 2005, but re-entered Parliament in 2010 as MP for Nottingham East. He went on to serve as shadow financial secretary to the Treasury on Labour's front bench in the Commons.Mary Creagh has moved from shadow environment secretary to shadow transport secretary in October 2013. When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before. The Wakefield MP worked for the European Parliament and in academia before entering Parliament in 2005. A keen Europhile, she is fluent in French and Italian. Worked as parliamentary private secretary to Andy Burnham but voted for David Miliband in the leadership contest.Maria Eagle moved in October 2013 to shadow environment secretary in a job swap with Mary Creagh. She is the sister of Angela but chose to support Ed Miliband in the leadership contest. Ms Eagle was a solicitor in Liverpool before entering Parliament in 1997. She held a series of ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including children's minister and equalities minister. Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player.Jim Murphy was moved - demoted in many people's eyes - in October 2013 from shadow defence secretary. He is a Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign. He has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football.Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. But when that constituency was torn up in boundary changes she made the move to Westminster in 2010. Under her, Labour took back Glasgow East having lost it in a by-election defeat by the SNP in 2008. In Holyrood, she held various posts, including minister for communities, overseeing the executive's flagship anti-social behaviour laws. Before entering politics she was a lecturer in community education. The then 52-year-old took up her first full shadow cabinet role in October 2011.Jon Trickett takes over from the departing Tom Watson as deputy Labour party chair. Gordon Brown's former parliamentary aide, Mr Trickett previously attended shadow cabinet as a junior minister and became a full member as shadow Cabinet Office minister in Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle. The then 61-year-old MP for Hemsworth took over the role from Tessa Jowell.Michael Dugher became shadow Cabinet Office minister in October 2013 after attending the shadow cabinet as shadow minister without portfolio. Mr Dugher won the seat of Barnsley East at the 2010 General Election, after serving as chief political spokesman for the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Having joined the ranks of the Labour parliamentary party, he then became a parliamentary private secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband. He is also currently vice-chairman of the Labour Party.Gloria De Piero was appointed shadow women and equalities minister in the October 2013 reshuffle. The former GMTV political editor was an political admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as party leader. She was elected as MP for Ashfield at the 2010 General Election and appointed to a junior role in the shadow Department for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport. Since October 2011, Ms De Piero has served as a junior shadow Home Office minister.Former BBC radio producer and special adviser who has risen quickly through the ranks. The then 40-year-old was elected in 2010 for Pontypridd, but previously stood unsuccessfully in the 2006 Blaenau Gwent by-election where he lost to independent Dai Davies. He supported Ed Miliband for the leadership and was given a role in his shadow team five months after entering the House, first as shadow Wales minister and then in the shadow Treasury team. This is his first shadow cabinet role.Moving from shadow minister for international development in October 2013, former charity worker and chief executive of the Manchester Jewish Federation, Mr Lewis held a string of junior ministerial posts in the Labour government after becoming an MP in 1997 at the age of 31. He started out as a parliamentary private secretary to then Trade Secretary Stephen Byers, before going on to be an education minister, Treasury minister, health minister and international development minister.

      <title>Will EDL survive leader's exit?</title>
      <description>Tom Symonds on the impact of leader's decision to quit group</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24441879</url>
      <date>1381235375</date>
      <body>The English Defence League (EDL) began life as a street movement in opposition to Islamist extremists who protested against British troops in 2009 in Luton.It has stayed on the streets, its marches attended by men and women who say they are working class, and anti-Muslim.But the EDL has rarely been able to mobilise thousands for its marches. And often the hundreds who have turned out have been met by similar numbers of anti-racist campaigners.It has struggled ideologically too. There has been growing tension between supporters who appear to oppose all Muslims and the EDL's leaders who say they only oppose Muslim extremists.It has been suggested the leadership has "marketed" the EDL in this way, in contrast to the views of most of its members.Officially the EDL denies being racist, and rejects the suggestion it is of the far right.The group says it does not condemn all Muslims, and Tommy Robinson has said he does not "want to lead a war against all Muslims".However, in the past, he has talked about "Muslim communities feeling the full force of the EDL" - a comment he explained by suggesting this would be through democratic processes, not violence.For its part the British National Party appears to believe the EDL's leadership has not been radical enough.An article on its website states: "As genuine nationalists we have deep ideological differences with the EDL leaders who openly support the ethno-cultural genocide of the indigenous English through mass colonisation and multi-racialism."This tension is probably the best explanation as to why twelve senior members of the EDL have now left.Mr Robinson appears to have decided that a street movement that seems to confront all Muslims is not changing minds.But there is another explanation. EDL members say the personal pressure on Tommy Robinson in particular has been intense.In the wake of the stabbing of Lee Rigby in Woolwich, Mr Robinson tweeted that he'd received 200 death threats, including to cut off his head.He told BBC Radio 5Live that when supporters threatened to bomb mosques he would be blamed "when I pick my kids up from school". He insisted "that's not what I stand for".That pressure may simply have got to him.The anti-extremism group Quilliam appears to have played its part too.It has suggested that there is a negative symbiotic relationship between far-right extremism and Islamism, and this argument appears to have helped convince Tommy Robinson to make his announcement - through Quilliam itself.It is not yet clear in what ways the group has engaged with Mr Robinson and other EDL members.Their departure has weakened the movement, and its mobilisation of anti-Muslim working class sentiment.It remains to be seen if new leaders will emerge, or whether the EDL will melt away, leaving the British National Party alone on the right.</body>

      <title>The reshuffled face of politics</title>
      <description>What impact will the frontbench changes have?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24438875</url>
      <date>1381180644</date>
      <body>Reshuffles. Like the old cliché about buses, you wait ages for one then three come along at once. But how much of an impact will the latest changes in personnel have?Inside the coalition, the Conservative and Lib Dem leaders independently decided the fate of their ministers.And Ed Miliband, no longer encumbered with a shadow cabinet chosen by his MPs, had a free hand to promote fresh talent.But has the political territory shifted, or is it just the personalities that have been moved?In some ways, the face of politics is changing.Across the board, women are taking more prominent roles - so far, a net increase of four in government, and 44% of Labour's shadow cabinet are female.Among the beneficiaries are two former stars of GMTV - Esther McVey for the Conservatives, and Labour's Gloria De Piero.The equation telegenic + down to earth = promotion has been proven. Though some rather less telegenic but talented people have done well too.For the Conservatives, the reshuffle has also, in part, been about class as well as gender.That isn't a misprint.For the Conservatives, the reshuffle has also, in part, been about class.What some of our tabloid colleagues have depicted as a process of replacing the "top hats" with the "flat caps".In fact Monday didn't really amount to a revolution in millinery. It's simply that some of those who haven't been to public school are winning more prominence.Racing up the junior ranks is Sajid Javid, son of a bus driver from Rochdale.And Mike Penning - a plain-speaking former soldier and fireman - will welcome the challenge of taking the heat for welfare reforms. As a former spokesman for Iain Duncan Smith, he should, at least, have a good working relationship with his boss.So expect some of the non-cabinet ministers to speak with less expensive accents.Allies of the chancellor have also done well from the reshuffle: the aforementioned Mr Javid; Matthew Hancock, a former chief of staff to George Osborne; and the former Treasury whip Greg Hands, are all moving up.Their careers may be moving forward but their advancement doesn't signal a change in direction.None of the better-known Conservative figures around the cabinet table have been moved - any purge at the top will await the outcome of next year's European parliament elections.It was, in fact, Nick Clegg rather than David Cameron that engaged in the night of the long knives. Or, rather, the long knife.It was plunged into the front rather than the back of Micheal Moore, the Secretary of State for Scotland.He had very competently carried out negotiations on the forthcoming referendum on Scottish independence.But now that thorny issues over timing and, crucially, what question to put to the Scottish people, have had been smoothed over, it was felt that it was time to move on from the constitutional niceties and in to campaigning mode.So step forward the robust figure of the former Lib Dem chief whip Alistair Carmichael, whose job it is now to tweak Alex Salmond's tail.But at more junior level, Jeremy Browne was dismissed. This surprised some at Westminster as he had been seen as close to Nick Clegg, and he could never be described as a coalition-sceptic. Certainly working with Conservative ministers didn't seem to trouble his conscience.So it's possible that the Lib Dem leader - while continuing to liaise closely with David Cameron's colleagues - also wants his own ministers to spell out the differences between the two coalition partners more clearly in the run-up to the next election.But even Lib Dems raised eyebrows at Mr Browne's replacement at the Home Office, the former transport minster Norman Baker, the author of a book alleging a cover-up over Dr David Kelly, the government scientist whose death led to the Hutton inquiry.At first glance Ed Miliband's reshuffle marks more of a shift in position - away from his party's Blairite past.At education, Stephen Twigg - who had praised a "free school" in his area and worked hard to find a way of reconciling Michael Gove's creations with Labour's existing (and more hostile) policy - has been dumped from the shadow cabinet, as has Liam Byrne - the former shadow work and pensions secretary who accepted the principle of a cap on benefits payments.And it just so happens that in an interview with the left-of-centre New Statesman earlier, the leader of the Unite trade union Len McCluskey had described both politicians in unflattering terms.Labour sources, naturally, say that Ed Miliband didn't discuss his reshuffle with union leaders.And certainly Tristram Hunt's appointment to replace Stephen Twigg hardly marks a lurch to the left.He is close to Peter Mandelson and was parachuted into his Stoke constituency at the last election with the blessing of the then leadership.And while he has reportedly described free schools as "a vanity project for yummy mummies", expect him to champion "parent-led academies" in the future .Rather, he represents a bit of generational shift - someone who is younger than the Labour leader (not yet 40) and who can potentially appeal beyond the Westminster village - albeit to viewers of TV history shows on BBC Two and Four, rather than breakfast telly.Labour insiders say they wanted to make space for some of the 2010 intake who could prove to be energetic campaigners. That was more important than whether they were Brownite or Blairite, David or Ed.The new shadow women's and equalities minister Gloria De Piero is an admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as her party leader.And there was additional ballast against the "Blairite purge" stories - which some of the papers will write tomorrow - in the shape of Lord Falconer. He is Tony Blair's former flatmate and he has agreed to advise the party on the transition from opposition to government.The shunting of the former shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle to the environment brief has led to speculation that Labour is preparing to derail HS2.Instead, party sources insist, Mary Creagh's move to transport from shadowing Defra is a tribute to her campaigning flair during the horsemeat scandal.She is now going to be tasked with standing up not for the consumer but the commuter, arguing against higher fares as part of Labour's pre-election theme of tackling what it calls the cost-of-living crisis.But if she is a fan of HS2, she may have to turn her campaigning skills to greater effect against some of her shadow cabinet colleagues who think the money could be better spent.Amongst the sceptics is Ed Balls, supportive of the rail project in principle, but in practice stressing he can't back it "at any price".And the shadow chancellor, like his opposite number, will be pleased to see some of his key allies in important posts - including Rachel Reeves, his former number two, taking over the work and pensions brief, and Vernon Coaker moving to shadow defence.Michael Dugher, a redoubtable attack-dog who initially backed Ed Balls for leader, has been given a key role in planning for the next general election.He will be joined by Douglas Alexander (in addition to his foreign affairs role) and Spencer Livermore - the former Gordon Brown apparatchik who was - he believed unfairly - criticised by some of his colleagues for the handling of the 2007 election-that-never-was.Well, with fixed-term Parliaments now, there is little doubt when the next election will come.But perhaps the wider significance of the Labour reshuffle is what it says about the other Ed.The fact that Messrs Twigg and Byrne accepted demotions, and Jim Murphy moved from defence to international development, suggests that his leadership is secure - that there is no prospect of a shadowy group of Blairites outside of the shadow cabinet waiting - or campaigning - for Ed Miliband's political demise.At least, not this side of an election.So, in the days and months ahead, the battle lines will be more clearly drawn between rather than within the parties.</body>

      <title>EU law and budget: a video guide</title>
      <description>Matthew Price explains EU laws and budget</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23782683</url>
      <date>1377100903</date>
      <body>The EU has a reputation for being slow and cumbersome - largely because of the difficulty of getting agreement among 28 member states with different languages and traditions.Here BBC Europe correspondent Matthew Price gives a video guide to the complex bargaining that results in new EU laws and the EU budget.The right to initiate legislation in the EU belongs to the European Commission - the union's civil service and rule-enforcer.Usually Commission proposals go through many amendments before becoming law - a process that takes years.In most policy areas the Council of Ministers - representing EU governments - and the European Parliament reach joint decisions through negotiation. Their role is called "the ordinary legislative procedure". During their negotiations they come under pressure from lobby groups, for example industrial firms or environmentalists.Often EU laws arise because national governments and MEPs tell the Commission that there is a need for them. Public consultations, scientific research and impact assessments also feed into the legislation.Once a measure becomes EU law the member states have two years to adopt it nationally - "transpose" it, in the jargon. The Commission can fine them for failure to do so.The budget is one of the most contentious policy areas among the member states, whose priorities differ greatly. The 2013 EU budget is 132.8bn euros (£113bn; $178bn).The size of the budget has to be decided annually, but there is also a seven-year budget framework, agreed in advance so that money can be set aside for long-term projects.This year for the first time EU leaders agreed to cut the multi-year budget (for 2014-2020), under pressure from the UK and some other countries, including the Netherlands and Sweden.The eurozone crisis has exacerbated tensions in the budget negotiations. Net contributors to the budget - the richer countries including the UK - argue that it should reflect the tough austerity policies adopted nationally. But net beneficiaries, such as the new member states in Central and Eastern Europe, oppose EU cuts to key areas like agriculture and infrastructure projects.EU spending is a small fraction of what the national governments spend in total, but those governments have to pay for big public sector areas like education and health, which are largely outside the EU's remit.</body>

      <title>University regulation 'inadequate'</title>
      <description>A lack of regulation of England's universities means students are at risk of attending failing institutions, the Higher Education Commission says.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24447151</url>
      <date>1381281659</date>
      <body>A lack of regulation of England's universities means students are at risk of attending failing institutions, the Higher Education Commission (HEC) says.The HEC says current checks are not adequate for a sector that has a new funding system in the wake of higher tuition fees introduced last year.It says the situation could threaten the UK's higher education reputation.The government says a "robust but proportionate" regulatory system is needed.The HEC - an independent body made up of leaders from the education sector, business and the three main political parties - conducted its research over an eight-month period and concludes that current regulation is too "piecemeal".The commission says that the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce), which distributes the teaching grant to universities, was previously able to attach regulatory conditions to the grant.But now that the teaching grant has been reduced and is being replaced with increased student tuition fees since 2012, the ability to regulate universities through Hefce has been reduced in turn.Its report - Regulating Higher Education - says all degree providers in England should be "captured" by proper regulation.It says: "It [higher education] is a valuable part of our national infrastructure and we must therefore ensure that students investing thousands of pounds in their futures are receiving top quality provision, and that the institutions they are attending are financially viable."The HEC study expresses particular concern about newly established higher education providers, saying "more providers are entering the market... and online providers gaining traction"."Regulation as it sits is not adequately prepared for the diversity of these current and future developments."New market entrants are not facing the scrutiny they should, takeovers and complex corporate structures are being used to evade fundamental protections for students, and institutions are facing more pressure than ever to recruit students and crucially, therefore, bring in funding."The report continues: "In this new, reformed higher education landscape, the chances of an institution failing are increased. An institution failing would damage both students and the highly-valued brand of UK higher education."The HEC calls on the government for urgent legislation to tackle the problems.It suggests an overarching regulatory body - the Council for Higher Education (CHE) - should be created, incorporating the current body Hefce, the Office for Fair Access (Offa), the Student Loans Company and a new body called the Office for Competition and Institutional Diversity.The commission also calls for better information about the various degree providers now operating in the UK and says all of these should be subject to a new regulatory framework, with kitemarks for those meeting approved standards.It also proposes an insurance scheme, paid into by every institution, to safeguard students should an institution or course fail.Professor of government at Hull University and HEC inquiry co-chairman Lord Norton of Louth said: "Regulation is fundamental to the health and success of our HE sector and will make or break the effectiveness of the institutions that have made the UK a world leader in higher education."In the context of current reforms, the absence of legislation to provide a coherent regulatory architecture for the rapidly changing and increasingly dynamic sector is creating major headaches for its players."It is a situation crying out for urgent rectification by government, a refrain that was a constant throughout the course of the inquiry from those who gave evidence."Fellow co-chairman and former vice chancellor of Lincoln University Prof Roger King said: "Our proposals seek to build upon the existing regulatory strengths displayed by the sector and to ensure that more external and formalised external regulatory arrangements work with these."Above all, however, we need to urgently address the outstanding requirement for a more systematic and less piecemeal approach to the external regulation of the sector. This can only be achieved by early legislation by government."A spokeswoman for the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills said: "It is essential that there is a robust but proportionate regulatory system in place to protect students and the reputation of the wider sector."At the same time though a balance must be struck to protect institutional autonomy and academic freedom. These elements are key to the success of our university system."When the time comes for legislation we want to get it absolutely right."Prof Les Ebdon, director of Offa, said: "I believe that fair access is too important to be rolled up within the wider concerns of a multi-focused regulatory body."An independent director, with a sole focus on access, can challenge institutions to set themselves stretching widening participation targets and ensure that fair access remains high on the agenda, both for institutions and policy-makers."</body>

      <title>Oxford challenges tuition fee limit</title>
      <description>Oxford University's vice-chancellor questions the long-term sustainability of the £9,000 fixed upper limit for tuition fees.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24444600</url>
      <date>1381255629</date>
      <body>Oxford University's vice-chancellor has questioned the long-term sustainability of the £9,000 fixed upper limit for tuition fees.Andrew Hamilton told a university gathering the real cost of an Oxford undergraduate course was £16,000.He asked how a "market" in higher education could operate if everything "regardless of content and quality, is the same price".The university faced an annual funding gap of £70m, said Prof Hamilton.He argued that different types of institutions should be able to charge different levels of fees."Given the great diversity of the institutions in our higher education system, the notion of different universities charging significantly different amounts, doesn't feel inherently unnatural."It is the current situation that seems out of kilter. What matters surely is that an institution's charges are clearly aligned with what it offers and that they are demonstrably not a barrier to student access."A university spokesman said that the speech was not proposing that students would have to pay fees of £16,000 per year to bridge the shortfall.But Prof Hamilton suggested a "system of tuition charges more closely related to the true cost", with the "strongest guarantees" of support for poorer students.Prof Hamilton argued that there needed to be a more sustainable funding model for universities where £9,000 did not cover their costs.He had heard that some universities were "doing very nicely thank you" with fees of £9,000."That may or may not be the case for them, but one thing I am quite sure about is that it doesn't add up for Oxford, where the new regime of increased tuition charges for students, but greatly reduced government spending on teaching, have done little to change the basic financial equation."Along with ideas such as increasing philanthropic donations, he floated the idea of raising funds through issuing bonds to investors.The raising of tuition fees to £9,000 was a highly controversial measure, prompting violent protests and occupations, in the biggest upsurge of student activism for decades.Academics at the University of Oxford passed a symbolic motion of no confidence in Universities Minister David Willetts and his higher education funding reforms.But with the funding changes in place, the speech on Tuesday by Prof Hamilton shows there are still far-reaching financial questions for such leading institutions.How can they compete on an international stage with better-funded rivals?Harvard University's financial figures, released last month, showed the US university has an endowment that has grown to $32.7bn (£20.3bn).A fundraising drive by Harvard, launched last month, aims to raise an additional $6.5bn (£4bn).Last year, Oxford hailed the donation of £75m as "the largest such benefaction for undergraduate financial support in European university history".Responding to the speech, Sally Hunt, general secretary of the UCU lecturers' union said: "Prof Hamilton should perhaps be applauded for going after one of the rawest nerves in politics to try and get higher education funding back in the spotlight - something we fear no party will be keen to do this side of the general election."However, higher university fees are not what this country needs."Prof Hamilton is correct to say our universities need more funding - we invest just 1.4% of GDP on higher education, compared to an international average of 1.7%."However, he is wrong to argue that students should pick up tab when we already have the most expensive fees in Europe."</body>

      <title>Toddler brain scan language insight</title>

      <date>1381280295</date>
      <body>The brain has a critical window for language development between the ages of two and four, brain scans suggest.Environmental influences have their biggest impact before the age of four, as the brain's wiring develops to process new words, say UK and US scientists.The research in The Journal of Neuroscience suggests disorders causing language delay should be tackled early.It also explains why young children are good at learning two languages.The scientists, based at King's College London, and Brown University, Rhode Island, studied 108 children with normal brain development between the ages of one and six.They used brain scans to look at myelin - the insulation that develops from birth within the circuitry of the brain.To their surprise, they found the distribution of myelin is fixed from the age of four, suggesting the brain is most plastic in very early life.Any environmental influences on brain development will be strongest in infanthood, they predict.This explains why immersing children in a bilingual environment before the age of four gives them the best chance of becoming fluent in both languages, the research suggests.It also suggests that there is a critical time during development when environmental influence on cognitive skills may be greatest.Dr Jonathan O'Muircheartaigh, from King's College London, led the study.He told the BBC: "Since our work seems to indicate that brain circuits associated with language are more flexible before the age of four, early intervention for children with delayed language attainment should be initiated before this critical age."This may be relevant to many developmental disorders, such as autism, since delayed language is a common early trait."Early childhood is a time when language skills develop very rapidly.Babies have a vocabulary of up to 50 words at 12 months but by the age of six this has expanded to about 5,000 words.Language skills are localised in the frontal areas of the left-hand side of the brain.The researchers therefore expected more myelin to develop in the left-hand side of the brain, as the children learned more language.In fact, they found it remained constant, but had a stronger influence on language ability before the age of four, suggesting there is a crucial window for interventions in developmental disorders."This work is important as it is the first to investigate the relationship between brain structure and language across early childhood and demonstrate how this relationship changes with age," said Dr Sean Deoni from Brown University, a co-researcher on the study."This is important since language is commonly altered or delayed in many developmental disorders, such as autism."Commenting on the study, Prof Dorothy Bishop of the department of Developmental Neuropsychology at the University of Oxford said the research added important new information about early development of connections in brain regions important for cognitive functions."There is suggestive evidence of links with language development but it is too early to be confident about functional implications of the findings," she said."Ideally we would need a longitudinal study following children over time to track how structural brain changes relate to language function."The study was funded by the National Institutes for Mental Health (US) and the Wellcome Trust (UK).</body>

      <title>Baby Peter mother 'can be released'</title>
      <description>The Parole Board says it has directed the release of the mother of Baby Peter, Tracey Connelly.</description>

      <date>1381303393</date>
      <body>The mother of Baby Peter, Tracey Connelly, should be released from jail, the Parole Board has said.She was jailed indefinitely, with a recommended minimum term of five years, in May 2009, for causing or allowing her son's death in north London.A Parole Board panel recommended her release from prison following a second review of her case.The board said arrangements and the date of the release were a matter for Justice Secretary Chris Grayling.A spokesman for Mr Grayling said the Parole Board's decision was final.A statement from the board said: "We can confirm that a three-member panel of the board has directed the release of Tracey Connelly."Tracey Connelly first became eligible for parole in August 2012 and at that time a Parole Board panel made no recommendation to release."Peter died on 3 August 2007 at home in Haringey after months of abuse.He had more than 50 injuries, despite being on the at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers, police and health professionals over eight months.Connelly was jailed with her boyfriend Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen, who were convicted at trial of the same offence.Barker was jailed for life with a minimum of 10 years for raping a two-year-old girl and given a 12-year term to run concurrently for his "major role" in Peter's death.Owen was jailed indefinitely with a minimum three-year term but later won an appeal to lower it to a fixed six-year term.He was freed in August 2011 but was then recalled to prison in April this year.When making its decision, the Parole Board will take into account the nature of the offence, the prisoner's offending history, the prisoner's progress in prison and any statements made on behalf of the victim.Reports from psychologists, probation officers and prison officers are also taken into account.Connelly will remain on licence for the rest of her life and if she breaches any of the conditions, she would most likely be recalled to custody.Conditions can include curfews, restrictions on movements and frequent meetings with an offender manager, said a Ministry of Justice spokesman.</body>

      <title>England lags on young adult literacy</title>
      <description>Young adults in England and Northern Ireland have performed poorly in international tests of literacy and numeracy.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24433320</url>
      <date>1381232917</date>
      <body>Young adults in England have scored among the lowest results in the industrialised world in international literacy and numeracy tests.A major study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows how England's 16 to 24-year-olds are falling behind their Asian and European counterparts.England is 22nd for literacy and 21st for numeracy out of 24 countries.The OECD's Andreas Schleicher warned of a shrinking pool of skilled workers.Unlike other developed countries, the study also showed that young people in England are no better at these tests than older people, in the 55 to 65 age range.When this is weighted with other factors, such as the socio-economic background of people taking the test, it shows that England is the only country in the survey where results are going backwards - with the older cohort better than the younger.The study shows that there are 8.5 million adults in England and Northern Ireland with the numeracy levels of a 10-year-old."This shocking report shows England has some of the least literate and numerate young adults in the developed world," said Skills Minister Matthew Hancock."These are Labour's children, educated under a Labour government and force-fed a diet of dumbing down and low expectations."Ministers in England have announced a new maths qualification for 16 to 18 year olds as part of a drive to improve numeracy and its requirement that maths should be studied until the age 18 for those who do not have a good GCSE in the subject.The newly-appointed shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt defended Labour's record."Labour drove up standards in maths and English across our schools, evident in the huge improvements we saw in GCSE results between 1997 and 2010."He said a future Labour government would "ensure all young people study maths and English to 18" and would not allow "unqualified teachers to teach in our classrooms on a permanent basis".Young adults in Northern Ireland performed better in the OECD tests than in England, but they were also in the bottom half of these rankings.The highest-performing countries among this younger age group were Japan, Finland and the Netherlands. The country with the lowest numeracy skills was the United States, plummeting from once being one of the strongest education systems.This landmark study from the OECD set out to measure the level of skills within the adult population - testing actual ability in literacy, numeracy and digital skills, rather than looking at qualifications.It involved 166,000 adults taking tests in 24 education systems, representing populations of 724 million people. From the UK, adults in England and Northern Ireland participated.The study looked at the level of skills across the adult population, between the ages of 16 and 65. England and Northern Ireland are below average for both literacy and numeracy, in league tables headed by Japan and Finland.But for most industrialised countries the younger population are much better at such tests than the older generations.Mr Schleicher pointed to the examples of Finland and South Korea where there had been huge progress in recent decades.However, for England, when the results are separated from Northern Ireland, there was a different and unusual pattern, with almost no advance in test results between the 55 to 65-year-olds and those aged 16 to 24.This younger group will have many more qualifications, but the test results show that these younger people have no greater ability than those approaching retirement who left schools with much lower qualifications in the 1960s and 1970s.The grandchildren are not any better at these core skills than their grandparents.Mr Schleicher says it might suggest evidence of grade inflation and it shows that better qualifications do not necessarily mean better skills."When you look at this snapshot you do have to conclude that these young people are not any better skilled when it comes to those foundation skills than people in the older generation," he said.He warned of the serious economic implications of a failure to provide a skilled workforce.The influential OECD expert showed how there was an increasing demand in the jobs market for those with higher skills - and a static or falling jobs market for those with lower skills.England and Northern Ireland have particularly high levels of adults with the lowest skill level in literacy and numeracy.The economic and social rewards for having high skills are particularly strong in England and Northern Ireland, says the research, with significant advantages in health, job opportunities and income.The global economic race is strongly linked to educational performance and the OECD report shows how the UK's share of the highest skilled workers is falling.An even sharper decline is faced by the United States, an education superpower of a previous generation. Last year the OECD warned that the US was almost the only developed country facing educational "downward mobility", where the younger population is less well educated than the older generation.This latest study shows that the US once had 42% of the world's highest-skilled adults but this had now fallen to 28%.Mr Schleicher set out the scale of the difference in ability, saying that many secondary school pupils in Japan were ahead of graduates in England.Neil Carberry, the CBI's director for employment and skills, said the UK's economic future depended on improving the skills of the workforce."This survey simply emphasises that the UK cannot afford to stand still on skills."Ian Brinkley, director at the Work Foundation think tank, said the study showed the UK faced a "relative decline in the economy's skills base"."We face a major generational challenge."</body>

      <title>BBC plans to help get UK coding</title>
      <description>The BBC will launch an initiative in 2015 to get coding more widespread in schools and homes.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24446046</url>
      <date>1381233705</date>
      <body>The BBC's director general, Tony Hall, has announced plans to "bring coding into every home, business and school in the UK".It comes 30 years on from a BBC push to make computing mainstream by putting BBC Micro computers in the majority of schools.In a speech to staff, Mr Hall said that the initiative would launch in 2015."We want to inspire a new generation to get creative with coding, programming and digital technology," he said.Government and technology experts are becoming increasingly worried that vital computing skills are no longer being taught in schools.Meanwhile interest in higher-education IT and computing courses is falling, giving rise to fears about a massive skills gap.This term a new computer science curriculum has been introduced to schools in England, and Education Minister Michael Gove has made it clear that he wants to see coding taught as a priority.Ralph Rivera, director of future media at the BBC, said: "The BBC has played a hugely important role in inspiring a generation of digital and technology leaders in the past, and now it's time to reignite that creativity.""We want to transform the nation's ability and attitude towards coding," he added.Details of the programme were limited, but the BBC said that it would partner with government, educators and technology companies."From working with children and young people, to stimulating a national conversation about digital creativity, the BBC will help audiences embrace technology and get creative," the corporation said in a blog post.A range of tools would be made available to give people "the skills to solve problems, tell stories and build new business in the digital world", it added.Experts appearing in a video to accompany the speech, agreed that action was needed.Martha Lane Fox, charged with getting more people online via her organisation Go on UK, said: "We are going to need a million more people who can work in the technology sector over the next 10 years. We don't have them. We've got to help to encourage people to go into that sector."Meanwhile, Eben Upton - founder of the Raspberry Pi budget computer project - said he looked forward to seeing how the scheme developed."A generation of UK developers got their start thanks to the original BBC Computer Literacy Project and the BBC Micro," he said."This initiative represents a welcome return to computing education from the organisation that was responsible for my interest in the subject."However, the comparison of the project to the BBC Micro raises potential controversy.The broadcaster's decision to partner with Acorn Computers three decades ago angered Sir Clive Sinclair as he prepared to launch a rival machine, the ZX Spectrum."They are marvellous at making programmes and so on, but by God they should not be making computers, any more than they should be making BBC cars or BBC toothpaste," he told Practical Computing magazine in 1982."They were able to get away with making computers because none of us had sufficient power or pull with the government to put over just what a damaging action that was. They had the unmitigated gall to think that they could set a standard - the BBC language. It is just sheer arrogance on their part."However, Apps for Good - an organisation which has helped students research, design and make software for three years - was not concerned by the new scheme."The BBC is entering a market where there's a number of players, but players who already work quite collaboratively," said Debbie Forster, the organisation's chief operating officer."Because there is such a big issue at stake and it is so important to so many different organisations what we are finding is that partnerships are formed more easily and more positively."Obviously the devil is in the detail in making it work - it always is - but it's a fascinating space and we look forward to hearing more and would be delighted for the BBC to join forces with everyone who is in here doing something."Learning Tree International - a firm which makes money from running programming training courses - was also unworried about the idea of the BBC becoming a competitor."From the point of view of getting people more inspired about IT and into that world, as such, it can only be a positive thing," said the firm's marketing director Christian Trounce.</body>

      <title>Threat to close Muslim free school</title>
      <description>A Muslim free school in Derby is warned to "urgently" improve "unacceptable" standards or face closure.</description>

      <body>A Muslim free school in Derby will be closed unless "unacceptable" teaching standards improve and discrimination against female staff and pupils stops.In a letter to the chair of the Al-Madinah Education Trust, Education Minister Lord Nash laid out 17 issues.These included forcing female teachers to cover their hair and failing to carry out background checks on staff.The interim principal said its pupils were treated equally. The school's trust said it was seeking legal advice.Dr Stuart Wilson, the acting head teacher, said there were areas the school needed to address and it was co-operating with Ofsted.When asked if staff and children are treated equally at the school, Dr Wilson replied: "Yes, they are treated equally and fairly."The Al-Madinah School Education Trust said in a statement on the school's website that "the letter had come out of the blue" and while it intended to co-operate fully with the Department for Education, it would also be speaking to the school's solicitors.Lord Nash's letter stated if urgent steps were not taken by 15 October, funding will be pulled.The school was closed for a week on the first the day of an Ofsted inspection on 1 October citing "health and safety issues".Ofsted released its statement to "clarify media reports" about why the school had closed.In it, HM Inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw said: "Inspectors discovered that staff records showing whether they were cleared to supervise children were either missing or incomplete."The school remained closed until yesterday [Monday] when inspectors made a return visit to satisfy themselves that the necessary safeguarding arrangements were in place and that there were sufficient numbers of adults with the necessary clearance for the school to function safely."A full Ofsted report is expected soon, he added.Addressing chair Shazia Parveen, Lord Nash wrote: "The trust has manifestly breached the conditions of its funding agreement by:"I will not tolerate breaches of the commitments you gave when entering into the funding agreement," he added.He has urged the school's trust to take five "urgent steps" by 15 October, including providing written confirmation that "you have ceased any practices and procedures that have as their reason, cause or effect that women and girls are treated less favourably than men and boys".The school has been given a deadline of 22 October for nine further action points and must provide a plan setting out a clear management structure by the start of November.</body>

      <title>Too many pupils 'failures at seven'</title>
      <description>Children who fall behind at school before the age of seven are likely to stay behind, says a report from Save the Children</description>

      <date>1381194837</date>
      <body>Children who fall behind at school before the age of seven are likely to stay behind, a charity has warned.Save the Children analysed 2012 data on the performance of pupils at schools in England.It shows the poorest pupils are less likely to have made good progress than their better-off peers.The charity's chief executive, Justin Forsyth, said: "Many children starting school this term already have the odds stacked against them."In his foreword to the report, he writes "Seven is too young to write off a child," but he adds that without good reading skills "all other subjects are a closed book".The report cites official figures that suggest that by the age of seven the future gap in GCSE results between rich and poor children has already been established.In 2012, about 13% of seven-year-olds, or 76,000 pupils, were not at the expected reading level.Underlying this figure is the achievement gap between children on free school meals and their classmates. Almost a quarter (24%) of children eligible for free meals did not reach the expected level, compared with only 10% of children from better-off families.A different set of figures from the 2012 National Pupil Database shows that fewer than a sixth of pupils who had fallen behind at the age of seven caught up to meet the benchmark of five GCSEs graded A* to C at the age of 16.This suggests that 84% of children who fail to meet expected standards in reading and mathematics at seven are likely to continue to struggle throughout their school careers.The authors recognise "steady and welcome progress" over the past five years on the number of seven-year-olds who can read and write to the expected level.Their analysis has found that even continuing to make this rate of progress between now and 2020 could still leave almost half a million children having fallen behind in their reading by the age of seven.They add that continued progress may be difficult to achieve so even these figures may be optimistic without "bold policy change".Calculations based on lower rates of progress suggest that between 520,000 and 810,000 children could have fallen behind by 2020.A Department for Education spokeswoman said: "It is utterly unacceptable that so many disadvantaged children leave primary school without a firm grounding in the basics of reading, writing and maths and that is why we are urgently reforming primary education and giving specific support to disadvantaged pupils."This included the pupil premium paid to schools to support poorer pupils, the phonics test and the "rigorous new primary curriculum" which would mean that "many thousands of children will now receive the extra support they need to catch up with their peers."Save the Children is launching a programme called Born to Read, aiming to help about 23,000 children in England to read over the next four years.</body>

      <title>Scouts announce promise for atheists</title>
      <description>The Scout Association in the UK announces an alternative version of their membership promise for young people who do not believe in God.</description>

      <date>1381228981</date>
      <body>The Scout Association in the UK has announced an alternative version of its membership promise for young people who do not believe in God.From January, instead of vowing "to do my duty to God", scouts will be able to promise to "uphold our scout values".The new promise will exist alongside the core scout promise, which has remained unchanged for 106 years.The Church of England, the Church of Scotland and other faiths have welcomed the move.The step follows a 10-month consultation."I am confident that our relationship with the scouting movement will continue to flourish," said the Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham, the Right Reverend Paul Butler, who leads the Church's work with young people."In enabling people of all faiths and none to affirm their beliefs, scouting has demonstrated that it is both possible and I would argue preferable, to affirm the importance of spiritual life."The Right Reverend Lorna Hood, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, also welcomed the move."I am extremely happy that the Scout Movement has taken this very sensible and inclusive step while ensuring that faith and belief remain a vital element of their ethos," she said.This is the first time the scout movement has introduced a promise for new members who are atheists - although alternatives to the core promise have existed for nearly 50 years for Hindus, Muslims and Buddhists.Hindus and Buddhists are currently permitted to refer to "my Dharma" in the scout promise, while Muslims can refer to Allah.Wayne Bulpitt, the association's UK chief commissioner, said the move signified its "determination to become truly inclusive and relevant to all sections of society".Mr Bulpitt added the additional alternative promise would not alter the association's commitment to exploring faith and religion as a core element of its programme.He said he was delighted the move had been achieved with the support of key faith groups as well as the British Humanist Association (BHA).Andrew Copson, the BHA's chief executive, said the move could only strengthen scouting: "Scouting is an enormously significant youth organisation and in some parts of the country offers the only activities young people have."Their initiative sends out a strong signal that the vast majority of young people who do not see themselves as belonging to any religion have values that are worthy of respect and should be explicitly welcomed and catered for in any activity that seeks to be genuinely inclusive."The association's total UK membership has increased from 444,936 in 2005 to 536,787 this year and includes 77,472 girlsLast month the Guides dropped reference to God from their joining promise, following a consultation that found the movement needed to do more to include the non-religious and those of other faiths.A ban on atheist scout leaders will also be lifted.The Scout Association confirmed to the BBC that it would rewrite its equal opportunities policy which currently states: "The avowed absence of religious belief is a bar to appointment to a leadership position."</body>

      <title>Reeves promoted in Labour reshuffle</title>
      <description>Tristram Hunt is to replace Stephen Twigg as shadow education secretary and Rachel Reeves replaces Liam Byrne as shadow work and pensions secretary.</description>

      <body>Rachel Reeves will replace Liam Byrne as shadow work and pensions secretary, as Labour leader Ed Miliband reshuffles his top team.In other changes, shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy has been moved from his post to the international development brief.Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg is replaced by TV historian Tristram Hunt.But Andy Burnham will keep his current position as shadow health secretary.The two new members of the shadow cabinet, Tristram Hunt and Chris Leslie, as well as Ms Reeves, all entered the Commons at the 2010 general election - although Mr Leslie had a previous stint as an MP from 1997 to 2005.BBC News Channel chief political correspondent Norman Smith said senior Labour figures were keen to promote the message that their reshuffle was designed to bring in new talent.They note that nearly a third of the shadow cabinet are now from the 2010 intake, and more than 40% are women.Ex-shadow cabinet members Mr Twigg and Mr Byrne take on more junior roles as shadow minister for political and constitutional reform and shadow minister for higher education.Mr Twigg, Mr Byrne and Mr Murphy all served as ministers under former PM Tony Blair, and their demotion is fuelling speculation of a "purge of the Blairites", Norman Smith added.But aides to Mr Miliband have denied trying to remove any faction of the party, he said.In other changes Mary Creagh leaves the environment, food and rural affairs brief to become shadow transport secretary.Previous incumbent Maria Eagle had been a strong defender of HS2, the proposed high-speed rail link.Her departure from that role is likely to be seen as adding to the likelihood of a Labour rethink on support for the scheme.In a blog post, Mr Murphy pledged to apply "just as much commitment and energy" to his new brief on international development as his previous defence job, and also said he would now play a "bigger role" in the campaign to persuade people in Scotland to vote against independence in the forthcoming referendum.Vernon Coaker moves from his job as shadow Northern Ireland secretary to shadow defence secretary, replacing Mr Murphy.In other moves, Emma Reynolds replaces Jack Dromey as shadow housing minister.Ivan Lewis takes over the Northern Ireland brief from Mr Coaker, having previously been shadow international development secretary.Gloria de Piero becomes shadow minister for women and equalities - a shadow cabinet post that was previously held by Yvette Cooper, who continues in her main role as shadow home secretary.</body>

      <body>Classroom support staff say they are increasingly being asked to stand in for fully qualified teachers, a union is claiming.A third (32%) of support staff in UK state schools polled by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) said they took classes for absent teachers.Over a fifth (22%) said they took more classes in 2012-13 than in 2011-12.A Department for Education (DfE) spokeswoman said: "The rules are clear - they should not be teaching."The DfE said teaching assistants and other classroom support staff played a vital role in the classroom, short of teaching whole classes of children."The government's recent review of school efficiency showed that, when properly trained and deployed, teaching assistants play an important role in helping to improve learning," the spokeswoman said."It is for school leaders to use the expertise of all staff to ensure any disruption to pupils is minimal and that taxpayers get value for money."The ATL polled more than 1,400 of its members working as support staff in state schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.A spokeswoman for the union said the rules allow classroom assistants to teach small groups of children under the supervision of a qualified teacher, but they should not teach whole classes or prepare teaching material.Higher level teaching assistants may prepare material under the supervision of a teacher but should not be teaching whole classes, while cover supervisors are employed to supervise classes while pupils complete work set by a teacher.A quarter (25.4%) of the teaching assistants and learning support workers surveyed and almost half (49.1%) of higher level teaching assistants said they were asked to cover lessons.Of the 400 who said they stood in for the regular class teacher, 60% said they did the same work as fully qualified teachers, claims the union, while a third (31%) of these staff said they had been used to take classes for three or more consecutive days.The union quotes a higher level teaching assistant at a secondary school in England: "I prepare, teach and mark at least four lessons for two year-7, bottom-set classes, and a year-8 set for at least three hours a week. It is teaching on the cheap."A cover supervisor said: "I have even been asked to give copies of lessons I have prepared to members of teaching staff."A primary school teaching assistant added: "It is unfair that many teaching assistants are teaching classes in the absence of a teacher, and doing the same job as a teacher for much less money."ATL general secretary Dr Mary Bousted said: "Schools are selling children short by using teaching assistants to teach classes when the regular teacher is unavailable."We are totally opposed to this exploitation of support staff who are being used as a cheap option to teachers."It is grossly unfair on them and on the children and their parents who rightly expect their children to be taught by qualified teachers."</body>

      <description>A Muslim free school in Derby reopens after a temporary closure over "health and safety" concerns.</description>

      <body>A Muslim free school in Derby has reopened almost a week after it was closed during an Ofsted inspection.The Al-Madinah School shut last Tuesday, citing "health and safety concerns", after one day of inspections.Sources said the school had been rated inadequate in all areas by Ofsted, but a final report has not yet been filed.The school has insisted it was closed on undisclosed health and safety grounds and not due to the inspection.Sources said Ofsted found incomplete records of child protection checks being done for all staff.There have been reports that female teachers at the school were forced to wear hijabs even if they were not Muslim.It was also claimed girls were made to sit at the back of the classroom and boys at the front.Free schools - which can be opened by anyone - are state funded but not overseen by the local authority.National Union of Teachers (NUT) spokesman Nick Raine said: "It is a publicly-funded school - if there are health and safety concerns that were serious enough to close the school then what were they and have they been an issue for some time? "Over the weekend Labour politicians asked Education Secretary Michael Gove to clarify matters urgently "to reassure the public".The Department for Education said it was already investigating allegations against the school.Several parents with children at the school told BBC News that they were happy with the school."I would rather it close and they sort it out and now she can back to school and the health and safety is going to be fine," one mother said.The Al-Madinah school, which opened in September 2012, claimed to be the first free school in England with a Muslim ethos, catering for all reception, primary and secondary pupils.But concerns over the application of strict Islamic practices led to a scheduled full inspection being brought forward.A statement on the school website said: "Unsurprisingly, there has been a number of rumours circulating."While unfortunate, my decision to close the school related to a short-term health and safety issue that has now been completely resolved and will not reoccur."</body>

      <title>School maths results 'disappointing'</title>
      <description>"Disappointing" standards in maths among 14 to 16-year-olds in Wales must be tackled, says an education watchdog.</description>

      <body>"Disappointing" standards in maths among 14 to 16-year-olds in Wales must be tackled, says an education watchdog.Estyn's report said maths was the lowest performing core subject at key stage four - when pupils work towards GCSEs - and the lowest in the UK.Last year the proportion of students in Wales achieving C grade and above at GCSE lagged well behind England.The Welsh government said the report had highlighted both successes and areas that could be improved.Estyn said schools must work hard to raise standards.Chief inspector Ann Keane said some employers were having to invest in numeracy skills training for school and college leavers."Many Welsh employers are concerned at the lack of mathematical skills demonstrated by employees," she said.The Estyn report by inspectors said there was a lack of support for the professional development of mathematics teachers.The findings and recommendations were drawn from visits to 18 secondary schools around Wales.The report recommended more support, advice and professional development opportunities should be provided for schools.It highlighted best practice at some schools such as Bishop Gore Comprehensive School in Swansea where it said 20% of pupils gained A* or A grades in GCSE maths in 2012.But the report found there was an 11 percentage point gap between England and Wales in the number of students getting a C grade and above last year.Its author Rob Davies told BBC Radio Wales: "Inspectors are noting that schools are setting their sights too low and and focusing too much on just doing enough to reach grade C and not stretching pupils enough."He pointed to various factors affecting results in Wales."I think there are question marks over whether key stage three [age 11-14] is preparing pupils suitably in Wales," he said."The inspectors have noted that pupils lack confidence in key aspects such as number work and algebra skills."They are the foundations of mathematics and they give pupils the skills to solve problems."Mr Davies said the weaker results were a combination of low expectations, poor teaching in some cases and the current set up of the GCSE, which allows schools not to enter pupils for higher grade material which Mr Davies said too many schools in Wales were doing.He also said too many weaker students were being entered early for the exam, and that there needed to be more consistency across Wales about networking between schools and sharing good practice.Last year the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) published a survey saying there was a "disconnect" between what employers needed and the basic skills of young job seekers.In July, the Welsh government revealed plans to introduce at least four new GCSE exams from September 2015, including two in numeracy and mathematics.It followed a qualifications review in Wales for pupils aged between 14 and 19 also affecting English language and Welsh exams.A Welsh government spokesperson said: "This report shows where we have been successful in developing mathematics in our schools at key stage four, and where we need to sharpen our performance."We welcome its findings and want to congratulate the schools highlighted in the report for their diligence and commitment to improving standards."We have clear evidence that, at an operational level, the best results in mathematics teaching at key stage four are achieved where schools and regional consortia work together, and where teachers have opportunities to share best practice and benefit from appropriate professional development and regular network opportunities."</body>

      <description>A gay couple say they had to go to England to adopt because of confusion over the law in Northern Ireland.</description>

      <body>A gay couple have said they went to England to adopt because of confusion over the law in Northern Ireland.The Court of Appeal ruled that legislation which prevented gay, lesbian and unmarried couples from adopting children in NI was unlawful.It was the only part of the UK where the policy existed.However, Stormont's health minister plans to go to the Supreme Court to try to overturn that decision and get the ban reinstated.John Davis and Jason Scorer, who live in County Antrim, had hoped to adopt children from Northern Ireland, but with uncertainty over the legal position they were advised to consider other options."We were very lucky that our original social worker in Northern Ireland had done a lot of homework before she came, to say that we could not move things any further forward," said John, who has lived in Northern Ireland for 20 years."The problem is a lot of people may not be aware there is another option."They contacted adoption and fostering charity PACT (Parents and Children Together).It helped the couple, who are in a civil partnership, go through the process in England with the aim of giving children from there a home in Northern Ireland."There are children waiting in the system (in Northern Ireland) to find families but, unfortunately, we were not allowed to go down that route," said Jason."And that is to the hardship of the children who are here."They adopted two boys at the start of the summer and they started primary school last month."They are getting loved, they are getting looked after and they are getting cared for," said John.They say they know of other gay couples from Northern Ireland who are now considering going through the adoption process elsewhere in the UK, because the issue is still being debated in the courts.The Department of Health at Stormont confirmed that Health Minister Edwin Poots has now applied to the Supreme Court for leave to appeal against the Court of Appeal's decision that the ban was discriminatory.And he insisted the issue was about stability not sexuality."Unlike other parts of the UK... we have a strong list of adoptive parents who want to take on adopted children," said Mr Poots."I think we should be cautious about changing the system which actually provides the stability those children need."It is not a human right to adopt a child for either a mixed-sex couple or a same-sex couple."Gay and lesbian groups, as well as organisations like BAAF (British Association for Adoption and Fostering), have criticised the minister's decision to continue fighting the issue in the courts.But he said surveys had shown support for his position."What I look at it is where the Northern Ireland public are on these issues and what is in the best interests of the children," he said."There is a lot of public opposition to it."In Belfast, there were people with strong views on both sides of the argument.Those against gay couples having the right to adopt argued that children needed both male and female role models and some claimed it was against their religious beliefs.However, many said that the only important thing was providing a stable home for a child, irrespective of whether the couple were married or their sexuality."You could argue all day about the gay thing - whether it is right that someone who is gay should be gay," says John Davis."But I believe it goes back to the loving, caring environment and stability that you can give these children, that they have not had up to this point."</body>

      <title>'Over half of schools failing in RE'</title>
      <description>More than half of schools in England are failing pupils on religious education, says watchdog Ofsted.</description>

      <date>1381051158</date>
      <body>More than half of England's schools are failing pupils on religious education, the schools watchdog Ofsted has said.Its report accuses schools and the government of failing to focus effectively on the subject.It adds that six in 10 schools are not "realising the subject's full potential" in an increasingly globalised and multicultural century.The Religious Education Council for England and Wales called the findings disappointing but not surprising.The report highlights low standards, weak teaching, weak examination provision and confusion about the purpose of RE.In particular, it says the recent introduction of the English Baccalaureate measure for pupils who achieve grade C or above in English, mathematics, science, a language and either history or geography, ignores RE and has further marginalised the subject.The report echoes comments by the Education Secretary Michael Gove. In July he told religious leaders RE had "suffered" because of government changes.He said he had thought that because schools have a statutory duty to provide RE lessons the subject was protected.Ofsted's report, Religious Education: realising the potential, says the subject "plays a key role in promoting social cohesion and the virtues of respect and empathy, which are important in our diverse society" but it finds "many pupils leave school with scant subject knowledge and understanding".It adds: "Moreover RE teaching often fails to challenge and extend pupils' ability to explore fundamental questions about human life, religion and belief."Inspectors visited a sample of 185 schools, both primary and secondary, between September 2009 and July 2012.They found achievement and teaching in RE was less than good in six out of 10 primary schools, and in fewer than half of secondary schools and that not enough had been done to improve provision since a previous report in 2010.Teaching in primary schools was "not good enough because of weaknesses in teachers understanding of the subject", they found.Standards were higher for GCSE and sixth form students but even at GCSE level teaching often "failed to secure the core aim of the examination specifications, that is to enable pupils to adopt an enquiring, critical and reflective approach to the study of religion."The authors urge the Department for Education (DfE) to consider whether the quality and quantity of statutory RE provision should be decided locally by schools and local authorities - or specified by central government.They want the DfE to work with professional RE teaching associations to "clarify the aims and purposes of RE" and to improve teacher training.Schools should ensure that teaching deepens "pupils' understanding of the nature, diversity and impact of religion and belief in the contemporary world," they urge.John Keast, chairman of the Religious Education Council for England and Wales said they had been warning "for some time about the poor state of religious education in many schools".He said they would publish their own report and RE curriculum later in October."It is now vital that the DfE works with the Religious Education Council on putting things right. We can do better than this."Stephen Evans of the National Secular Society said the recommendations did not go far enough."With the freedom to determine their own syllabus for RE, many schools with a religious character abuse the subject and use it for missionising."Young people would be better served by a new national curriculum subject for all pupils that covers a variety of religious, non-religious and secular philosophies and world views."Meanwhile, Gail Larkin from the National Association of Head Teachers said consecutive governments were responsible for schools placing less emphasis on the subject.She said: "Some of the major policy changes that we've had, the impact has been to convey the message that RE is of less value than other subjects."So, as a head teacher... we are concentrating more - as we've been told to do by consecutive governments - on core subjects and subjects that can be measured.""Unfortunately", she added, "I think RE has fallen off the radar".</body>

      <body>Students in England face a cost-of-living crisis as loans and grants fail to keep pace with rents and bills, claims the National Union of Students.The gap between income and expenditure for a typical student amounts to more than £7,600 according to NUS analysis.The union compared the cost of living and studying for the 39-week 2013-14 academic year with typical income from government grants and loans.The government said it was targeting support at those who needed it most.Rent, bills and other outgoings continue to rise year after year above the rate of inflation but grants and loan rates were frozen this year and will only rise by 1% next year, says the union.It estimates that a student living outside London will pay an average of £21,440 in tuition fees, books, equipment, rent, travel and other living expenses.Against this, they have a potential income of £13,747 composed of their tuition fee loan plus maintenance loans and the grants available to those on average and low incomes.This leaves a shortfall of £7,693.In London, higher rents mean students typically spend £23,187 says the union - but they are also eligible for a higher maintenance loan of £6,090 though this still leaves them with a shortfall of £7,654, says the union.The union adds that some students from less well-off families who are eligible for grants are facing an additional squeeze as the level at which they can claim maximum support has remained at a household income of £25,000 since 2008.NUS president Toni Pearce said: "Those who do not have the rare luxury of resorting to the 'bank of mum and dad' are increasingly being driven to work full-time alongside study where jobs can be found, or worse still, into the arms of predatory pay day lenders just to make ends meet."We need a financial support system that ensures students get what the support they need, when they need it."A spokeswoman for the Department for Business Innovation and Skills said the government's student finance package was designed to target support at students from the poorest households."This year, students from the lowest income households can access over £7,100 of living-cost support, of which over £3,350 does not have to be repaid."The government also provides additional, non-repayable support to students in specific circumstances, such as students with children and disabled students."Scholarships and bursaries are also available from most universities, and students in hardship can apply for additional support through the Access to Learning Fund."</body>

      <title>Gove pressed over Muslim free school</title>
      <description>Labour asks the education secretary to explain what checks his department have carried out on the Al-Madinah Muslim free school.</description>

      <body>Michael Gove is coming under pressure to explain what checks his department carried out on a Muslim free school which has been closed since Tuesday.Al-Madinah, in Derby, cited "health and safety concerns" when it shut last week. It is due to reopen on Monday.But Labour called on the education secretary to "reassure the public" amid persistent concerns over the school.The Department for Education was already investigating allegations against the school, a spokesman said.Free schools - which can be opened by anyone - are state-funded but not overseen by the local authority.Al-Madinah says it has a "strong Muslim ethos" and when it opened last year claimed to be the first such school in the country for pupils from reception age to 16.Preliminary findings from an Ofsted inspection into the school gave it the lowest possible rating.The Department for Education had asked Ofsted to bring their inspection forward. Allegations had been made by parents and staff that pupils at Al-Madinah had been told to follow strict Islamic practices.Former staff have claimed non-Muslim female teachers came under pressure to wear the hijab head-scarf.It has also been reported that girls were made to sit at the back of class.The school denies pupils have been segregated and says its dress code was made clear to anyone wanting to work at the school.Sources have told the BBC the closure was due to incomplete records of child protection checks being done on all staff.But ahead of the school re-opening to pupils on Monday, shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said the situation must be "urgently clarified in order to reassure the public".In a letter to Mr Gove the Labour MP said: "This is, of course, not the first time that there have been questions surrounding your department's oversight of a free school."While I understand that there is an ongoing investigation, the reports concerning this school are of extreme concern to parents and the wider community."Given the confusion as to why the school has closed, and that pupils may be returning to the school on Monday, I would ask that these matters be clarified urgently in order to reassure the public."He called on the department to say what "due diligence" was carried out when the school was approved.And he asked whether there had been "appropriate vetting" of staff and what oversight ministers had had since it opened.Interim principal Stuart Wilson closed the school after Ofsted inspectors shared their preliminary findings with him."While unfortunate, my decision to close the school related to a short-term health and safety issue that has now been completely resolved and will not reoccur," a statement on the school's website read.The school "will be open as normal on Monday," Mr Wilson added.A Department for Education spokesman said: "We were already investigating this school before the allegations became public."We discussed the problems with Ofsted and it launched an immediate inspection. We are waiting for Ofsted's final report and considering all legal options."Mr Twigg also questioned what would happen to children at the school if it did not reopen on Monday or had to close again.</body>

      <title>Fewer children 'read in spare time'</title>

      <body>Fewer children across the UK are reading in their own time and one in five is embarrassed to be caught with a book, a survey suggests.Just over a quarter of 35,000 children from 188 schools told the National Literacy Trust that they read outside of school.About the same number said they did not think their parents cared if they read.The trust says a similar survey in 2005 found one in three children read in their own time.The survey for the trust involved children filling in online questionnaires last winter.Half of those taking part said they enjoyed reading either "very much" or "quite a lot" and a high proportion (four out of five) agreed with the statement "the more I read, the better I become".Nearly two in five agreed reading was "cool", but about one in three said they only read when they had to.Report author Christina Clark, from the Literacy Trust, said young people who enjoyed reading very much were four times as likely to read above the level expected for their age compared with those who did not enjoy reading at all.Those who read outside of class every day were five times as likely to read above the expected level compared with those who never did.And children who do not think "reading is cool" were four times more likely to be below-average readers, the report says.National Literacy Trust director Jonathan Douglas said: "Our research not only reveals that children are reading less and developing more negative attitudes towards reading, but also that there is a clear correlation between this and their performance in reading tests."The study, of children aged from eight to 16, found that the proportion who read e-books outside of school had doubled since 2010 to 12%.Reading is most popular among eight to 11-year-olds, the survey suggests, although teenagers are more likely to read for longer.The charity released the research to coincide with a new campaign to find the UK's "literacy heroes".It is asking the public to name people who might have inspired a love of books or helped to improve reading skills.Anyone from a parent, teacher or young person who has overcome a personal literacy problem to a favourite author or celebrity can be nominated, the Literacy Trust said.The campaign is being supported by the Duchess of Cornwall, who said: "I firmly believe in the importance of igniting a passion for reading in the next generation."In a world where the written word competes with so many other calls on our attention, we need more literacy heroes to keep inspiring young people to find the pleasure and power of reading for themselves."</body>

      <title>Concerns delay schools' flu vaccine</title>
      <description>A programme to vaccinate children against flu is delayed in Glasgow after concerns from Muslim parents that it contains products derived from pork.</description>

      <date>1380868054</date>
      <body>A programme to vaccinate schoolchildren against flu has been delayed in Glasgow after concerns from Muslim parents that it contains products derived from pork.About 100,000 primary school pupils in Scottish health board areas taking part in a pilot programme are being offered the Fluenz vaccine.It is given as a nasal spray rather than the traditional jab.But parents in Pollokshields, which has a high number of Muslim pupils, have complained the spray contains gelatine.A letter sent to Glasgow schools in the wake of concerns cites a World Health Organisation study in 2001 which indicated that Islamic and Jewish scholars had agreed pork gelatine was permissible within a vaccine.However, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC), whose area contains most of Scotland's Muslims, said it had put back the rollout of the vaccinations "following concerns raised by a small number of parents".The programme is due to resume next week when parents will be offered a choice of the nasal spray or the more traditional jab.Scottish government public health minister Michael Matheson said flu was a "very serious infection" which needed to be vaccinated against.He said: "That is why, for the new programme for children, we are using a quick and painless nasal spray Fluenz, which has proven to be more effective in children and avoids the use of needles."Parents should be reassured that the existing guidance issued in 2001 from the World Health Organisation, prepared by religious scholars, advises that gelatine of porcine origin used in vaccines and other medicines is judicially permissible as the gelatine in the final product is a completely changed substance."Vaccination is voluntary and we want all parents to have the information they need to make an informed choice."If parents continue to have any concerns, children can be given an alternative safe injectable vaccine which does not contain any porcine gelatine but provides less protection than the nasal spray."He added: "The Scottish Government very much appreciates the help and advice provided by Muslim councils in response to these concerns and a letter has been issued to parents of children in Glasgow to offer reassurance about the use of the Fluenz vaccine."A fifth of the Scottish population will be offered a free flu vaccine, including people aged over 65 and those with conditions that put them at greater risk.For the first time, all two and three-year-olds - about 120,000 children - will be offered the vaccine, as well as 100,000 primary school pupils in health board areas which are taking part in a pilot programme.The programme will be rolled out to eventually see about one million children aged between two and 17 have the chance to be immunised towards the end of 2015.</body>

      <title>Harvard plans to boldly go with 'Spocs'</title>
      <description>Harvard develops the next big thing for online learning. Is this the real deal?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24166247</url>
      <date>1380062273</date>
      <body>Keep up, keep up. If you've only just caught on to the concept of online university courses called Moocs, then you're in danger of falling behind again.Harvard, one of the world's most influential universities, is moving on to Spocs - which stands for small private online courses. Nothing to do with Star Trek and sombre Vulcans, but plenty to do with ambitions "to boldly go".And could these be the real deal? The academic chairing Harvard's online experiments says we are already "post-Mooc".Moocs - massive open online courses - have been something of a hurricane in universities, making a lot of noise and promising to rip everything up.Pioneered by some of the most prestigious US universities, they have been re-packaging course units into online lessons and making them available to anyone with an internet connection.But it's still not clear whether this is a passing storm or something that will fundamentally change how higher education is delivered.Last week the UK joined the fray, with more than 20 universities launching an online platform called FutureLearn, which will challenge the dominant players on the east and west US coasts.The biggest success for online courses and their greatest problem are the same - the huge numbers attracted.It demonstrates the scale of the unmet demand for higher education, but at the same time it's not clear how tens of thousands of students on a course could ever satisfactorily be taught, assessed and accredited. Most of these signs-up will sign off without completing courses.At Harvard, more people have signed up for Moocs in a single year than have attended the university in its entire 377-year history. That's a great success story in opening up education, but what do you do with all those hungry minds?Enter the Spoc. And the clue is in the "small, private" part of the name. These courses are still free and delivered through the internet, but access is restricted to much smaller numbers, tens or hundreds, rather than tens of thousands.It means a selection process for applicants and the capacity for a more customised experience. Looking further down the track, it wouldn't be difficult to imagine fees and course credits.Harvard and University of California, Berkeley, part of the edX online alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are among the universities beginning to experiment with this more refined model.Next week a popular and highly topical course in US national security strategy will begin at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Alongside the campus students in Cambridge, Massachusetts, there will be a parallel Spoc version with a limit of about 500 online students.Students wanting to get into this online classroom have to submit a written assignment about the US government's response to the conflict in Syria, along with details of their academic credentials.Even though this online course won't have a formal academic credit at the end, it's going to require eight hours of work a week and a capacity to tackle questions about "Iran's nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria's civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information".These Spoc students might include Harvard students who couldn't get into the campus course, alongside those who might be studying from home or at work.Harvard isn't abandoning Moocs, but rather like Russian dolls sitting inside each other, a single course might now be delivered to a large open Mooc audience, to a much smaller number of Spoc students and then down to an even smaller number enrolled at the bricks-and-mortar campus.It's taking the limited and expensive resource of a Harvard course and amplifying it for widening rings of audiences.Prof Robert Lue chairs the committee of academics that runs Harvard's online experiments, under the banner of HarvardX.He describes the current online learning experiments as a "remarkable moment of possibility".And he sees the move towards more flexible and refined formats such as Spocs as an "almost inevitable evolution"."The Mooc represents just the first version of what we can do with online education," says Prof Lue. And this first version has now been overtaken. "We're already in a post-Mooc era.""What has become very clear is that the engagement you get from a very large group with a wide-ranging set of priorities can be radically different from what you get from a more focused group," says Prof Lue.It also paves the way to tackling one of the biggest problems for Moocs. How can they provide formally-recognised qualifications?The smaller class size will allow "much more rigorous assessment and greater validation of identity and that will be more closely tied to what kind of certification might be possible," he says."It's safe to say that in the quite near term there will be announcements of experiments in this area."There are voices of caution about over-hyped expectations for online learning.A report published last week by the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggested there remained many uncertainties over Moocs.The lack of a clear business model was described as a "burning issue".The edX project is in the fortunate position of being given $60m by Harvard and MIT, but few universities have the resources to give away so much expensively-produced content and staff time.Prof Lue suggests that the really tough questions raised by Moocs are not only about online learning but about what it means for the rest of the traditional campus."What is it that a student gets out of being on campus and being in the classroom?"If students on campus prefer learning online, what does it mean for the funding model for universities? What happens if a recorded online lecture is preferable to a mediocre live talk? How do universities show their "added value"?Prof Lue argues that the significance of Spocs is that online learning is now moving beyond trying to replicate classroom courses and is trying to produce something that is more flexible and more effective.Universities that ignore such developments, or think that Moocs can just be showreels for conventional courses, are putting themselves at risk, he suggests."The really big questions for university are about what students get from the classroom, what works, what could be done better.""Institutions that sit back and watch, they may be in trouble. One can imagine a large institution where there isn't much difference between online and classroom - and then you'd be silly not to realise there's a problem."</body>

      <title>UK enters online university race</title>
      <description>The UK's biggest online university project is being launched, with a partnership of more than 20 universities offering free courses.</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest online university project has been launched, with more than 20 universities offering free courses.Students will be able to follow courses on mobile phones as well as computers.The UK's project, called FutureLearn, sees UK universities entering the global market in so-called Moocs - massive open online courses.It could "revolutionise conventional models of formal education", says universities minister David Willetts.Mr Willetts, speaking at the British Library, said that the expansion of access to higher education was no longer necessarily about "bricks and mortar".He said that the FutureLearn partnership would help to serve the unmet demand for university courses, particularly overseas.The launch of FutureLearn sees 21 UK universities, plus Trinity College Dublin and Monash University in Australia, offering courses that are taught and assessed on the internet.The UK universities include Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham, Warwick, Bristol, Reading, Southampton and the Open University, which has headed the project.The British Library, British Museum and British Council will make material available to students.There are 20 short courses announced, with eight starting this year.In this experimental phase, students taking these courses will carry out multiple choice questions, without any formal qualifications.But universities are hoping that many people will be attracted by the chance to follow university-level courses without any travel or cost and at a time that suits them.It will also provide taster courses for youngsters considering their university options.When the University of Edinburgh offered Moocs through a US network it had more than 300,000 students signing up. The University of London international programme had more than 200,000 registrations.FutureLearn will see the UK taking a much bigger step into the rapidly expanding online university market - with claims that higher education is now facing its own online revolution.They are anticipating that each Mooc course will attract 20,000 students.Universities also see the project as a way of recruiting students to degree courses. Martin Bean, vice chancellor of the Open University, described it as a "digital storefront".But Mr Bean says he expects some universities to begin thinking about how to offer formal credits for Moocs.Reading University is going to offer a Mooc course about basic computer programming."Offering free taster courses online is a no-brainer," says David Bell, the university's vice-chancellor."Universities shouldn't be afraid to open up teaching and research, either in the UK or beyond. Learning never stops and as the economy's demand for higher skills rises, universities should be in the vanguard when it comes to providing new opportunities."Making courses accessible online, on mobiles and tablets means that people can fit their studying around their lives, rather than their lives around study."Southampton University is offering a course in web science, Leicester University's course looks at England at the time of Richard III and the University of Warwick has a psychology course.FutureLearn's chief executive Simon Nelson says it will offer a "fresh approach" with all its courses designed to work across all kinds of online platforms, so that a student could begin a course on a laptop at home and then continue on a mobile phone while commuting.He also promises a less isolated experience for students learning at home. He says that it can be a "solitary experience", but that FutureLearn will try to create a supportive online community, with "very strong social architecture".This will allow students to discuss their courses and ask questions, using social networking-style comment pages alongside the lesson content.This consortium will also draw upon the experience in distance learning of the Open University."Time and again we have seen the disruptive impact the internet can have on industries - driving innovation and enhancing the customer experience. I have no doubt Moocs will do the same for education," says Mr Bean.There were also suggestions from the Department for Education last week that Moocs could be used for vocational courses for students in further education colleges and sixth forms in England.Moocs have already had a major impact in the US, launching last year and spearheaded by alliances of top institutions, including Harvard, MIT and Stanford.Coursera, set up by Stanford academics in California and backed by venture capital, has signed up more than four million students in its first 18 months for courses provided by more than 80 universities.These projects have revealed a high level of demand for courses, but also exposed the difficulty in retaining students, with very high levels of drop-out rates.It has sparked a debate about the cost of higher education and what students are paying for when so much information and so many high-quality university materials are available online.These US online courses have begun to develop ways of giving students formal credits, such as students paying to take invigilated exams.Among the Mooc pioneers has been the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which set up the edX online platform with Harvard.On Tuesday, MIT announced a series of new online courses which will have an identity verification system using webcams and with plans for certification for courses.But there have also been questions asked about the long-term financial viability of online university courses.Last week, William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, challenged whether many universities could afford to invest in the type of free online courses offered by wealthy institutions such as Harvard and MIT.He suggested that online courses might work better as part of a "blended" course, where students spend some time together in the classroom as well as studying online.Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said that online universities represented an overdue technological advance."The models of higher education that marched triumphantly across the globe in the second half of the 20th Century require radical and urgent transformation. My fear is that the nature of change is incremental and the pace of change too slow."The establishment of FutureLearn represents an important step in realising this change and seizing the opportunities technology offers in creating a broader, deeper and more exciting education system."Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: "I encourage all our institutions to explore the opportunities offered by new modes of technology, such as Moocs. This will keep the UK ahead in the global race to deliver education in worldwide markets."</body>

      <title>Gordon Brown's Syrian refugee school plan</title>
      <description>Syria's refugee crisis is also threatening to become a long-term education disaster.</description>

      <body>Syria's refugee crisis is threatening to become a long-term education disaster. There will soon be 500,000 refugee children in Lebanon, with few having access to school. But Gordon Brown, former UK prime minister and UN special envoy for global education, says that lessons could be in place in weeks."A few days ago, global education campaigner Malala Yousafzai was able to speak over Skype to Zahra and Om Kolhtoum Katou, teenage Syrian twins exiled in Baalbeck in East Lebanon.As they talked, the three girls realised that they shared something in common. All three are victims of violence that threatened to destroy their youth and their future, and all three cannot do what most other girls and boys do every morning: leave the home in which they grew up and go to school.Now there is a plan that could help the biggest single group of Syrian child refugees - 300,000 of those exiled to Lebanon - which could see them in school and being fed within weeks.It has been prepared by Kevin Watkins of the Overseas Development Institute for the charity, A World at School, which campaigns to get an education for the millions of children without access to school.But this plan can only be put into practice - and this seems unlikely today - if the international community, which is financing just 2% of schooling needs in humanitarian crises, offers an additional $500m (£319m).The plan involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double or even triple shift system; hiring Syrian refugees as teachers in Arabic in community colleges; providing school meals to tackle hunger as we tackle illiteracy.This strategy is also rooted in the realistic presumption that the plight of the Syrian children is more than a short-term emergency: their exile could last years. It has the active support of the Lebanese government, but it is an open question as to whether the world community will put up the funds.Children are always the most neglected and forgotten victims of conflict. Already deprived of food and shelter, boys and girls are also denied their right to education, condemned to forfeit a childhood that, once lost, can never be re-run or re-lived.The one million Syrian children, who make up half of that country's refugees, are simply the most recent victims of this monumental gap in our global system. They are among 28 million children worldwide now being denied their right to schooling in conflict zones and under broken-down regimes.Soon small, unstable Lebanon will have absorbed 500,000 Syrian boys and girls. Already in just a few months, the refugees have grown in number to an astonishing 25% of Lebanon's child population.But today, and for the foreseeable future, there are school places for only a small fraction of them - just 30,000. If they suffer the typical exile of children in conflict they could spend 10 years in camps and without schooling.The traumas engulfing Syrian children underscores an enduring global failure. One hundred years ago, through support for the Red Cross, the world decided it would meet people's basic health needs, even in theatres of war.Forty years ago Médecins Sans Frontières established that healthcare should be available across the most dangerous and violent of war zones.Today, the concept of "Education Without Borders" still remains an unfamiliar idea, a concept yet to be built into our system of humanitarian relief.Yet the cost of inaction for young people deprived of an education, destroyed by anger, restlessness, and desperation and sentenced to tents and camps often for years, will haunt us for generations.Because these millions of young unemployed will become the adult unemployable, and many will graduate not into jobs but into violence.On 23 September in New York, organisations that have for years fought valiantly to deliver education in emergencies will build on pioneering work by UNICEF, UNHCR, UN Refugees and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) to bring to life the Education Without Borders initiative for Lebanon's Syrian refugees.In New York, young people from conflict zones around the world, joined by Malala and backed up by a petition presented to the UN Secretary General, will lead an appeal for funds.It will show that while we cannot do everything we can do something, that hope can survive even amid horror and that good can yet triumph over the worst evils, even in the most troubled and desperate parts of the world."</body>

      <title>Zombie apocalypse: The future of universities?</title>
      <description>A US university is going to create an online course based on the TV drama the Walking Dead.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23931078</url>
      <date>1378381975</date>
      <body>Can zombies be the stuff of serious academic study? And could they be shuffling towards a new type of future for higher education?In what is being claimed as the biggest ever experiment in "edutainment", a US television company is forming a partnership with a top-ranking Californian university to produce online courses linked to a hit TV show.This blurring of the digital boundaries between academic study and the entertainment industry will see a course being launched next month based on the post-apocalypse drama series the Walking Dead.Television shows might have spin-off video games or merchandising, but this drama about surviving disaster and social collapse is now going to have its own university course.Academics from the University of California, Irvine, who are setting up the online courses, say these will be academically rigorous and tackle serious scientific issues, related to events in the show.A physicist will look at the "science behind decay"; the public health department will use the series to study questions such as "What can we learn from past epidemics?" and maths lecturers will show how "post-calculus maths can be used to model population and epidemic dynamics".Showbiz lessonsThe show is made by AMC, which also produced cult series such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Killing, and AMC vice-president Theresa Beyer says this showbiz-academic partnership will create a "legitimate educational experience".She says AMC will be the "first entertainment group to make the foray into the online education arena" and wants the course to "drive a deep, sustained connection with the show".The TV series has an audience of 10 million and student numbers for the online course are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands. If this experiment proves successful, the online platform provider, Instructure, suggests there could be further TV show and university hybrids.It's not difficult to imagine an advertising course being built around a series such as Mad Men, suggests Josh Coates, Instructure's chief executive.This partnership also marks another development in the rapidly-expanding world of MOOCs - the massive open online courses - an acronym sufficiently established to have made it into the Oxford online dictionary last week.Millions of students have signed up for online courses in the past year, suggesting the scale of demand for higher education.And millions of students have failed to complete those courses suggesting the scale of the challenge of online learning.Dumbing down?This eight-module course will begin in mid-October and will be accessible without charge to anyone with an internet connection.There will be online tests and discussion groups, but students taking the course will not get any formal qualifications or credits towards a degree, so it's going to be for students who want to follow the course in their own time.But isn't there a risk of dumbing down? The University of California, Irvine, has Nobel prize-winning researchers, it contributes $4.3bn (£2.77bn; 3.3bn euro) to the local economy, does it want to have zombies on its prospectus?"When we entered this partnership it was really important to make each of the modules as academically strong as they would be in our classes at UC Irvine," says Melissa Loble, associate dean of distance learning at the university."The lessons will be academically rigorous and rich and still have connections to the show."Joanne Christopherson, social science lecturer, says that it's taking another step forward from how universities already use contemporary media examples."In all of my classes I have to bring in current issues to keep it interesting. Not just because they're young adults coming out of high school, but because it's important to make these classic theories relevant to them. What we're doing is using this series as an example through the whole course."Apocalypse studiesJosh Coates, head of Instructure, which provides the Canvas online platform, says it will present science and social science issues, using the hook of a TV show."This is real curriculum about infectious diseases, public health, nutrition, psychology and sociology. The fact that the context is this fictional world of an apocalypse is incidental.""This is very topical. We have terrorist attacks, we have Katrina, Fukushima, all these things happen in our world today, which create small vignettes of a local apocalypse. This is an opportunity to educate people about the science of these disasters."Mr Coates says a significant part of this experiment will be to see if it can crack one of the biggest weaknesses of MOOCs, the high drop-out rate. Will the pulling power of television keep people switched on to learning?"Can we get more students through because it's linked to a TV show they really like?" he says.He describes the link between the university and the TV industry as the "cross-pollination" that comes with the internet."The internet tears down walls of tradition and the isolation of different areas of research and interest," he says.Personal learningFor the university, it's a shop window putting their brand in front of a global audience. It also allows them to refine the process of putting courses online."The first MOOCs had great videos and great quizzes, but didn't help students really interact with one another," says Melissa Loble."The next step for MOOCs is to figure how to make them personal without it being overwhelming for the institution trying to deliver that."These are the type of practical questions that come with the huge numbers of online students.Dr Christopherson says that scale of the demand for MOOCs has been a "wake-up call" for universities.But it remains a challenge to provide an online structure that can allow so many students to follow a course without feeling anonymous and disconnected.William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, says there also remains a longer term question about the funding model for MOOCs.And he suggests that universities which have begun to invest in them might become wary at the extent of the drop-out rate.They might work better as part of a "blended" course, where there is a taught, classroom element as well as online study, he says.Spoiler alertAlan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, also has reservations about the value of TV-related online courses.Without formal assessment and personal content, he says it remains to be seen how this delivers more than a good television documentary."The student must be able to sift the evidence."For genuine learning, personal contact really matters," he says.Prof Smithers says such links with a popular TV show might work as a way of attracting students, but the academic element needs to outweigh the entertainment.But don't expect the march of the MOOCs to stop any time soon. And Mr Coates says he wants people to look back at the Walking Dead course as a watershed when education and entertainment connected.With the online course available globally and when different series are being shown at different stages in different countries, this could also be the first university course that has to come with its own spoiler alert.</body>

      <title>Harvard tops global CEO league table</title>
      <description>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most common place to have studied.</description>

      <body>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most likely place to have studied.The Times Higher Education magazine ranked the universities attended by chief executive officers of Fortune Global 500 companies.There are four US universities in the top 10, with three from France, two from Japan and one from South Korea.The highest ranked UK university is Oxford in 21st place.This league table, described as the Alma Mater Index, shows which universities around the world taught the bosses of some of the world's biggest companies.One in 20 had a degree from a single institution, Harvard.This included Margaret C Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Jeffrey R Immelt of General Electric and Vittorio Colao of Vodafone.This academic powerhouse regularly appears at the top of university league tables, including the rich list, with an endowment worth $31bn (£20bn' 23.5bn euro).But the top 10 for producing business leaders does not contain all the usual names that appear at the top of university rankings.Oxford and Cambridge are absent, but the University of Pennsylvania in the US and Keio University in Japan are included, along with three French universities, headed by the Ecole Polytechnique.It means that in this top 10 cradles of global CEOs, there are two institutions from Paris, two from the Boston area and two from Tokyo.Across the top 100, universities from the US dominate, followed by universities in China, Japan, France and Germany. There are more CEOs who went to university in Asia than in Europe.In terms of national comparisons, UK universities produced the sixth highest number of global chief executives, with Oxford in 21st place and Cambridge in 45th place.But even though Harvard might have taught the biggest number of bosses from the top 500 companies, it was not attended by any of the heads of the biggest 10 companies, who were from a more diverse range of universities.Royal Dutch Shell is headed by a graduate of Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Wal-Mart is headed by a student of Georgia Tech and Exxon Mobil has a chief executive from the University of Texas, Austin.Three of the leaders of these biggest companies went to university in China and the head of Volkswagen went to university in Stuttgart.</body>

      <title>The scientists who escaped the Nazis</title>
      <description>A first-hand memory of the scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23261289</url>
      <date>1374016582</date>
      <body>When Gustav Born's family were advised in early 1933 that it was time to leave Nazi-controlled Germany, it was from a good authority.The advice was from Albert Einstein, who told his friend and fellow scientist Max Born to "leave immediately" with his family while they were still able to travel.They packed their bags and headed across the border, first to Italy and then to England, where they arrived as part of what must have been the best-qualified refugee trail in history.Gustav Born was 11 at the time, living in Gottingen, Lower Saxony, where his father, Max, was director of one of the world's leading centres for physics research.The Borns were Jewish, and when Hitler took power, Max Born and his Jewish colleagues were prevented from working at the university. This pioneering, elite group of theoretical scientists were turned into asylum seekers.Gustav now lives in London, a few days short of his 92nd birthday, and he looks back with great clarity on the remarkable flight of these German academics. The conversation is like opening a 1930s Mitteleuropa time capsule.He is now one of the last living links to these academic refugees, who between them went on to win 16 Nobel prizes - his father received the award for his work in quantum mechanics.Did these scientists realise the extent of the threat from the Nazis?"Yes, I think my father probably did. Among his Jewish colleagues, some did, but some didn't believe for some time. But the scale of what the Nazis were doing became apparent in the first three to six months."Gustav remembers that the ugly mood of anti-Semitism had even reached the playground, with some children not allowed to play with him.There were also positive examples of human nature, such as the academics who stood by their Jewish colleagues. The Nobel prize winner Max von Laue showed great support, says Gustav.The physicist Max Planck went to see Hitler in person to challenge the exclusion of Jewish scientists, but Hitler "foamed at the mouth and wouldn't let him talk any more".It was still tough to leave. Max Born had to give up running an institute, his wife was heartbroken at the prospect of emigrating."They hated to be uprooted in this crude and dangerous way."When the Borns left, they were not under any illusions that this would be a temporary departure. "Nazification" was happening rapidly and there were political murders."My parents were pretty sure this was a one-way journey."While the Borns were watching the swastikas appearing in Gottingen, a much more tweedily humanitarian response was being marshalled by university staff in Britain.The economist William Beveridge had set up the Academic Assistance Council, with the aim of rescuing Jewish and politically vulnerable academics.It was an organisation that would help 1,500 academics escape Germany and continue their research work in safety in Britain.It was quickly backed by academics whose names now read like a row of text books - J B S Haldane, John Maynard Keynes, Ernest Rutherford, G M Trevelyan and the poet A E Housman.Albert Einstein supported this high-brow escape committee with a highly-charged speech in the Albert Hall in London in October 1933.He set out an epic defence of Western liberal values of "tolerance and justice" against the "temptations of hatred and oppression", at a time of deepening extremism and economic and political turmoil."It is in times of economic distress such as we experience everywhere today, one sees very clearly the strength of the moral forces that live in a people."He told his audience that it was "the liberty of the individual that has brought us every advance of knowledge and invention - liberty without which life to a self-respecting man is not worth living".The council launched its "rescue operation", arranging for academics to come to Britain and providing practical support in the form of grants, accommodation and most importantly jobs.This was a remarkably talented group being cast aside by the Nazis. As well as the trawl of Nobel prizes, there were 18 future knighthoods and over 100 fellows of the Royal Society or British Academy.According to the Association of Jewish Refugees there were about 70,000 Jewish refugees who came to Britain before the outbreak of war in 1939.Max Born and his family went first to Cambridge and then to Edinburgh University. He paid his way by writing a science text book that became a school standard.There were others who moved on to the United States. Mathematician Richard Courant went to New York where one of the foremost centres for applied maths, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is named after him.Losing such intellectual powerhouses was a self-inflicted wound for the Nazi war effort.In the race to develop atomic weapons, German refugees played a key role in making sure that it was the United States that won.Even though Max Born refused on moral grounds to work on atomic weapons research, Robert Oppenheimer, the US-born "father of the atomic bomb", had been Born's PhD student at Gottingen.There were signs at one stage that the Nazis might have realised their mistake.In 1934, Max Born and his family were visited in Cambridge by Werner Heisenberg, another Nobel prize winner and old colleague who had continued working at Gottingen.Heisenberg brought a message from the Nazi government inviting Max Born to return to continue his scientific work in Germany. The invitation left Born "beside himself with fury", his son recalls.But Max Born and his wife did eventually go back to Germany, after the war was over and after he had retired. He died there in 1970 and is buried in the same cemetery in Gottingen as Max Planck and Max von Laue.Gustav, who became a professor of pharmacology at King's College London, says that his parents were committed to trying to rebuild Germany in a way that would prevent the return of such political extremism.What lessons should be learned from all this?Gustav Born remains a strong supporter of the campaign to rescue academics, which is now marking its 80th year.It has become the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara) and its current chair, Anne Lonsdale, says that after 80 years the organisation "would love to be out of a job", but the problems in Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq and Syria mean that academics still need help in places where "civil society no longer functions".There is an "urgent need for scholars from across the Middle East to get to exile in a place of safety", she said.The stories of refugees from the Nazis, with grainy photos of faces with lines like old railway maps of Europe, might seem like something from a lost world.But Gustav Born says that Cara's ongoing work shows that it is as relevant as ever. It is also a reminder not to make hasty judgements about refugees and what they might be able to achieve.His descriptions of that academic world of the 1930s are also a last glimpse of a highly cultured society. His father, remembered for his science research, played Bach on the piano every day. These were internationalists, their ideas and research moving across national and political boundaries.Such a world proved fragile in the face of the Nazis. And Gustav Born says people can too often overlook that Germany had still been a young country in the 1930s, little more than 60 years old, and that it hadn't built the institutions able to resist its own "militaristic and nationalistic" tendencies.He is very much aware that he is now one of the few remaining people who can talk first-hand about such a legacy."I'm sad that it almost ends with me."I want them not to forget that things like this, the suppression of a country by a gang of murderous crooks and the victimisation of people of good nature and good intention, it could happen again."</body>

      <title>Education is a 'security issue', says UN</title>
      <description>Unesco chief says even though pledge for education for all will be missed, huge progress has been achieved.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23197565</url>
      <date>1373478808</date>
      <body>The tinderbox mix of high youth unemployment, lack of education and the threat of extremism is turning access to school into a "security issue", says Irina Bokova, director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation.The volatile prospect of millions of uneducated, illiterate youngsters in developing countries, under pressure from the financial downturn, has brought an unprecedented political significance to the campaign to give every child a primary school education, she says.Ms Bokova was speaking ahead of a speech later this week at the United Nations from Malala Yousafzai, who will call for all children to have the right to go to school.The Pakistani schoolgirl, who will make her speech in New York on her 16th birthday, defied the bullets of the Taliban in defence of her right to an education.But behind the optimism of Malala's campaign and the creation of an annual "Malala Day" is a much more complex global story, with failure as well as success.In 2000, in the warm glow of a new millennium, world leaders pledged that universal primary education would be achieved by 2015. No child would miss out on the basics of schooling.After an initial surge, progress stalled and achieving the target in the next 18 months now seems unlikely."By 2015, it's impossible," says Ms Bokova, the Paris-based head of Unesco.But she says that rather than being a cause of pessimism, the pursuit of the target has brought "huge progress". There were 108 million children out of school when the pledge was made; the most recent figures suggest this has fallen to 57 million."If the right strategies are in place, and you put your head where your heart is, then things can be improved. In Afghanistan in 2000 only 4% of girls were in school, now there are more than 70%."Ms Bokova says that another positive outcome has been a much stronger recognition of the importance of measuring the quality of education, rather than simply counting heads going into a classroom.Among the more sobering discoveries has been that many pupils have spent years in school but remained functionally illiterate.So in the autumn, Unesco is planning to produce a new set of global metrics to measure what's actually being learned in primary classrooms around the world. "It will give a global understanding of what quality education means," says Ms Bokova.It remains unclear whether there will be more targets after 2015, but anything that emerges will be more about quality of education, rather than simply volume of places.Ms Bokova says the financial crisis delivered a major blow to achieving the goal of universal primary education. Donor countries pulled the plug and left an "alarming gap" in funding.In sub-Saharan Africa there remains a shortage of 1.7 million teachers.But despite this gloom, she says that the financial crisis has given education a "paradoxical" political importance.Youth unemployment is a major threat in many countries and education and training are seen as vital investments."Education is now becoming in some cases a security issue," she says, with examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq and across the Middle East, where there is huge pressure to provide education to promote stability and democracy and to avoid extremism."The same is true of big emerging powers. In Brazil, the government recognises that the education system is one of the biggest challenges as it moves forward to a competitive economy and an inclusive society."The social tensions of deepening inequality and a lack of social mobility are also shaped by decisions about education systems, she says.Economic and political stability are now inextricably linked to improving education, says the Bulgarian-born Unesco director general."Education is becoming the key issue now in discussions about overcoming the economic crisis."But how are we going to make this happen? Budgets and international aid are shrinking."We try to convince countries that if they want to invest in coming out of the crisis, then invest in education."Another barrier to getting all children to school is a lack of fair access, particularly for girls.Ms Bokova says it's not acceptable for countries to hide behind ideas of "cultural differences" or "tradition" as a reason for discriminating against girls.Malala Yousafzai has become a powerful emblem."One event can spark a huge reaction and understanding and I think it was the case with Malala," she says."It was a stunning example of courage and a desire to learn."And she says that getting more girls into school is the single most important goal."It's not just a human right, it's what is needed to have normal societies. If a girl goes to school, she is less likely to have an early marriage, she will have healthier children, she'll find it easier to earn an income, she's less likely to be subjected to violence, less likely to have an early pregnancy."There are so many advantages, healthier communities, less violence, more economic growth. It has such an incredible multiplying effect."This is the best thing that could happen to humanity."The pledge for education for all has also highlighted where the problem is most acute.A meeting organised by the UN in April brought together eight countries - Bangladesh, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen - which between them have about half the children in the world who are missing out on school.It was an unprecedented attempt to systematically work out what has been going wrong.A minister from the DR Congo said that about 60% of those missing out on school did so because of the cost of school fees with the other 40% blamed on armed conflict.In Ethiopia the problem was identified as being focused on rural communities and lack of access for girls. In South Sudan it was a lack of trained teachers and a low level of school participation among girls.In Nigeria, which has the most children out of school, the difficulty was not necessarily about money, but was caused by low participation among girls in some areas and problems with "infrastructure" about providing teachers. Weaknesses in state authorities delivering the plans of the national government were also blamed.The country has also seen brutal attacks on schools. Secondary schools in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe were ordered to close this week after a massacre in which suspected Islamist extremists killed 22 students.Ms Bokova says that there is now a willingness among such countries to recognise what needs to be changed.Despite the failure to make the 2015 deadline, she says the attempt has shown the international community what can be achieved. Countries such as India and Ethiopia have taken substantial steps forward.This has disproved the feeling that "education is too complex, too costly and it takes too long to show results".But there is no escaping the harsh truth that millions of children, born a decade after the world promised universal primary education, still won't have even the most basic access to school.It's been possible to launch hundreds of satellites and put a spacecraft on Mars, but not to put children into classrooms a few hours south of Heathrow."In many cases we have failed, but it shouldn't discourage us. We're winning the argument."</body>

      <title>Old slides shine light on Great War</title>
      <description>An old box of lantern slides sheds light on the men from Belfast who died in the Great War.</description>

      <date>1380728126</date>
      <body>When Fay Rice opened a box of old lantern slides lying hidden in the organ loft of a north Belfast church, she unearthed a treasure trove of bitter sweet memories.Under the dust and the cobwebs, more than 100 men stared back at her.Who knows what their thoughts were as photographer Alex R Hogg had them stand to attention.For some, these were the last portraits - scrubbed up and ready for action in the First World War.In 1918, the committee minutes for Castleton Presbyterian Church - now Alexandra Church - state that Mr Hogg was asked to put together a lantern slide exhibition of "our men at the front".It was to be shown on 16 December of that year - tickets were sent to the families of serving men.They stare solemnly at the camera - some in their uniforms, some in civilian clothes."There are about 77 slides and the images of 137 men are captured there," said Fay."There photographs are very clear and very fresh looking. Some of the men in the pictures had obviously told lies to join up - one man was just 15 and you had to be 17 years old."There are very young men and older men as well."Fay was moved by the portraits and by what happened to those men and their families."It is horrendous - for the ones who did not come home and the tragedy that was for their families and for those who came home and were seriously injured or affected by what they had seen. How could they live with that?"But the slides did not carry the names of the soldiers pictured.When Fay showed her daughter, Karen O'Rawe, she set up a website called: Castleton Lanterns... Shining a light on our men who served in the Great War.So began the quest to name all of the Castleton men. To date, about 20 have been identified."Within a couple of days, 300 people were looking at the site and from that, interest has just mushroomed," said Fay.People started contacting Fay and Karen to identify their relatives and tell their stories - men like James Magill, Ernest McCann and James McCann."The example of James Magill, Francis Ernest McCann and James McCann demonstrate just how closely connected all the Castleton Lanterns men were. They were brothers, best friends, pals and colleagues," said Karen."It's important to find their stories and tell them, to understand their lives and remember them, coming up to the anniversary of the start of the Great War. It is sad to hear the stories of those who were lost or wounded beside those who lived and flourished and I'm sure the families who gathered to watch the lantern slide show in 1918 must have felt something similar."Interest has spread and people from as far away as Australia and Canada have been in touch.Now Frankie Quinn, director of the Red Barn gallery in Belfast has stepped in to help in the quest to identify all of the men pictured in the lantern slides.An exhibition of the slides opens on Thursday 3 October from 18:00 BST to 21:00 BST at the gallery at 43b Rosemary Street in the city.</body>

      <body>A subject called "computing" should be created to replace information and communications technology (ICT) in school, a report suggests.ICT is no longer regarded as relevant for the future, the report by a steering group says.It said its replacement should encourage creativity, develop real-life problem solving and be flexible enough to evolve to stay current.Education Minister Huw Lewis called the report detailed and thorough.The report also suggested grouping computing with the three main science subjects."A career in IT typically involves some degree of logic, creativity, com­munication and collaboration, managing uncertainty, and problem solving," the report said."This is at odds with the current ICT curriculum that is prescriptive, outdated and documentation heavy, focusing on the consumption rather than cre­ation of software and digital content."It added: "We feel strongly that ICT has lost its meaning and become synonymous with word processing and spreadsheets."By renaming and rebranding it as computing as part of a new curriculum we will have an opportunity to improve these perceptions."The new subject would be broken down into two areas - computer science and information technology.Computer science would include the academic side and encompass programming, while information technology would focus on the use of computers in industry, commerce, arts and elsewhere.The report, prepared by an independent steering group chaired by Stuart Arthur from software experts Box UK, recommended computing should be designed with input from the industry and have an online assessment tool.It also added that digital literacy - the general ability to use computers - should start in primary school when pupils are five years old."We should equip children with the skills and empower them with the knowl­edge and confidence to become innovative digital creators, effective digital citizens and successful entrepreneurs so they can take advantage of the global growth opportunities that exist in the digital economy and beyond," the authors said."We have a unique opportunity to learn from the challenges identified in this report and aspire to become truly world class, not just by delivering a digital Wales but by becoming a world leader in computing and digital skills."It is essential to empower our children by giving them the skills required to con­tribute to the rapidly growing digital economy."Education Minister Huw Lewis said: "ICT in Wales is global and dynamic and I want Welsh learners to be given opportunities to develop the skills required to work in and contribute to the sector."We have concerns that fewer Welsh learners are seeing the value in pursuing a career in ICT and that many learners, as well as the wider public, perceive learning about computing in a negative way."It's therefore of great importance what is currently being taught is relevant to the global economy of the future."We will now take time to consider the report's findings in the context of our wider review of assessment and the national curriculum."</body>

      <body>London has four universities in the top 40 of a global league table - more than any other individual city - although only one makes the top 10.US universities are still the most dominant international force in the Times Higher Education rankings.In top place, as last year, is the California Institute of Technology.In the UK there are concerns that, outside Oxford, Cambridge and London colleges, many major universities are slipping down international rankings.The so-called "golden triangle" of UK universities - Oxford, Cambridge and leading London institutions - is seen as a breakaway elite group, with these universities consolidating their international reputations.Imperial College, University College London, LSE and King's College London are all in the top 40. London has more universities in this league table than all of Japan, although only Imperial College makes the top 10.Phil Baty, editor of the rankings, says this is part of a global pattern of clustering of "excellent universities". Boston in the US has eight universities in the top 200, more than entire countries such as China, Switzerland and Australia.But there are warnings from the rankings organisation that prominent UK regional universities are falling away.Edinburgh, Manchester, Bristol, Sheffield, Warwick, Southampton, Nottingham and Newcastle are all seen as going downwards against international rivals.However the University of Leicester has risen sharply, which has been described as the "Richard III effect", after the high-profile research associated with the discovery of the body of the medieval king.This is described by the Times Higher Education rankings as showing that "power is draining from the UK regions".The top 20 still reflects the dominance of wealthy US university powerhouses, taking 15 of the top 20 places, with institutions such Harvard, MIT and Stanford in the leading pack behind the California Institute of Technology.The highest UK university is Oxford and the highest ranked continental European university is ETH Zurich in Switzerland, which is also the only non-English speaking university in the top 20."No university can rest on its laurels. No-one is guaranteed to retain a top-200 place when the US, Far East and others are investing in research so heavily," said Sir David Bell, vice-chancellor of Reading University, which has fallen from 176th to 194th place."There are some dramatic year-on-year rises and falls this year, so we should be careful not to read too much into a single set of figures.""It is no surprise that a small number of UK universities at the very top end will remain more stable, with others more likely to fluctuate."Sir Christopher Snowden, president of Universities UK, said the rankings showed that the UK had "the second-strongest university system in the world after the US"."What is clear, however, is that the UK must continue to invest in higher education if we are to maintain this global competitiveness."</body>

      <description>An "inspirational" head teacher is given a suspended prison sentence after admitting false accounting.</description>

      <body>An "inspirational" head teacher has been given a suspended prison sentence after admitting false accounting.Sir Alan Davies, 66, of Grants Close, the former head at Wembley's Copland School, in north London, pleaded guilty to creating a false paper trail on bonus payments and allowances.Davies, knighted for his services to education, resigned in 2009.At Southwark Crown Court, Judge Deborah Taylor said: "Your dishonest behaviour represents a fall from grace."Davies had pleaded guilty to six counts of false accounting after he admitted creating eight back-payment documents at the same time.The court heard that Davies paid himself, three staff members and two governors a total of £2.7m over several years through bonuses and salaries.Defending Davies, William Clegg QC, told the court he was an "inspirational" teacher and the offences needed to be taken in context.He said: "This is not a case of documents being forged to permit payments to be made that were unlawful and not agreed or made dishonestly. The position is the opposite."The payments were honestly made and honestly received. This is not somebody seeking to obtain money he was not entitled to."Prosecutor John Black QC added there was no dishonesty in the making or receiving of the payments.He said: "The dishonesty relates to false paper trails in order to legitimise these payments."The Crown say they [paperwork backing up payments] were all generated at the same time, after Sir Alan Davies had become aware of the impending or likely scrutiny, to give the impression the right procedure was being adhered to."Two counts of money laundering and conspiracy to defraud were dropped and conspiracy charges against five others were also dropped.Following the case Davies said: "In some instances I have felt that we were being tried by the media and there were a lot of misrepresentations made in the press, many of which were wholly unfounded."I do, however, have to accept that I did not have all the necessary paperwork in place and I made a profound error of judgment by backdating eight documents."In a statement, Brent Council, said: "The council will always act robustly and take action where allegations of financial irregularities have been made, to investigate and pursue legal action."In this case the guilty plea of false accounting vindicates the actions taken although we are disappointed the Crown Prosecution Service saw fit not to pursue the conspiracy to defraud."</body>

      <title>Disabled students 'need campus help'</title>
      <description>Disabled students are calling on universities across the UK to do more to help them take part fully in campus life.</description>

      <body>Disabled students are calling on UK universities to do more to help them take part fully in campus life.A study by the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign's Trailblazers suggests many students are unable to access areas such as lecture theatres and libraries.It says many institutions are failing to signpost key information such as details of accessible accommodation.The Equality Challenge Unit said many universities were working hard to be as accessible and welcoming as possible.The Disability Discrimination Act 2005 means it is illegal for education providers to treat disabled students less favourably because of their disability.A Trailblazers' survey of 100 UK universities found only half of those questioned confirmed that all teaching rooms, study rooms and libraries were fully accessible for students with mobility difficulties.The research found half of universities questioned said that not all inter-campus transport was accessible.Only a quarter of the universities surveyed had considered disabled students when planning freshers' week information and only a third had a society representing disabled students in the student union.Tanvi Vyas, manager of Trailblazers, said: "We continue to hear about how many universities are still missing the mark when it comes to helping people planning on entering higher education - and helping them to complete their time there."There are plenty of simple measures that universities can take. Providing inclusive freshers' guides, handy information on accessible transport and buildings and support networks can all make a huge difference to students adapting to campus life."We also need the government and local authorities to examine the issue of relocating care packages, which continues to be an enormous struggle for many students studying away from home."Chris Brill, senior policy adviser for the Equality Challenge Unit, which helps universities ensure equality for staff and students, said: "Trailblazers' audit highlights a number of small changes that would make big improvements for students."For example, making sure information is clearly signposted on websites, and ensuring the needs of disabled students are reflected in freshers' week programmes."Students' unions, often a conduit between universities and students, could also be encouraged to consider how they involve disabled students in the democratic structures."Through this, we may see an increase in societies representing disabled students, and better involvement of disabled people in higher education."</body>

      <title>Murdered Keanu 'failed' by agencies</title>
      <description>A serious case review into the murder of two-year-old Keanu Williams finds police, social services and health workers "failed" to prevent his death.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-24365700</url>
      <date>1380809518</date>
      <body>There were "a number of significant missed opportunities" to save a two-year-old boy from being beaten to death by his mother, a report has found.Rebecca Shuttleworth is serving a life sentence for murdering Keanu Williams.The toddler was found with 37 injuries including a fractured skull and torn abdomen, in Ward End, Birmingham.A serious case review said social care workers, the police and health professionals had "collectively failed to prevent Keanu's death".Shuttleworth, 25, was spoken to in prison by members of the serious case review team, telling them she was "surprised" social workers allowed her to keep custody of Keanu.The report states: "She expressed some surprise that Keanu had not been removed from her care when born."As Rebecca Shuttleworth is intending to appeal her sentence, although it is unclear if that is possible, she was not able to talk more about services which might have prevented Keanu's death."The report found different agencies had "become confused" as their strategy discussions had focused on the medical and forensic aspect of his injuries, the report said.It concluded that although Keanu's death on 9 January 2011 could not have been predicted, the agencies involved could have seen that he was "likely to suffer significant harm".The toddler should have been subject to a child protection plan "on at least two occasions" to address issues of neglect and physical harm, the report said.Jane Held, from the Birmingham Safeguarding Children Board, said Keanu died because there were "failings across every agency"."No-one walked in his shoes, staff were distracted by his mother's needs and by taking what she had told them at face value," she said.Ms Held said there had been "double-figure sackings" since Keanu's death, but added: "It is unfortunately an appalling situation."We are unequivocally sorry about the fact that unacceptable failures in 2011 and from the start of Keanu's life meant that we did not prevent his death and we failed to protect him, and that is something that I think all the board feel incredibly distressed about."Shuttleworth, of Cottingham Road, Manchester, was convicted of murder and four counts of child cruelty after a five-month trial. She was ordered to serve at least 18 years.Keanu was born in Torbay, Devon, and the report also found Torbay's Children's Services should have been aware of the risks even before his birth.It states: "There was enough information available to raise concerns that the unborn child was likely to be at risk of suffering significant harm."The authority also later received two anonymous reports of concerns about Rebecca Shuttleworth's care of Keanu which should have led to a reassessment of his safety.It concluded: "If a child protection plan had been in place, there would have been more robust arrangements to safeguard and promote Keanu's interests."Torbay Council's director of children's services, Richard Williams, said: "This is an extremely sad case and I would like to reassure everyone that we take the recommendations in this review very seriously and have acted upon them all."The serious case review makes eight recommendations:The report was told there has been an "end-to-end" review of the child protection system since Keanu's death, as it became clear there had been poor performance and a general lack of compliance with child protection procedures.In a comment that echoes those made after the death of starved four-year-old Daniel Pelka, the report says that Keanu had become "invisible".The serious case review into the death of Keanu Williams is the twenty-third to be published in Birmingham since the Local Safeguarding Board's inception in 2006.Peter Hay, from Birmingham City Council said admitted that its track record over recent years was "poor" and said the council was "unequivocally sorry"."Keanu's death is another tragic reminder of the consequences of failing children's services," he said.Edward Timpson, the government minister for children and families, said he has issued the council with a "final warning"."There is no quick fix, however I have been very clear with Birmingham that unless I see rapid improvement further action will follow," he added.Ofsted will return to Birmingham in autumn to determine what progress has been made, the minister said.The National Children's Bureau said it was "particularly worrying" that the review found that no conversations were held with Keanu to find out what he was feeling.Dr Hilary Emery, from the children's charity, said no child at risk should ever be "only seen and not heard"."We urgently need to review how best to support children within the child protection system - especially the very young ones - to ensure their voices are listened to at every opportunity," he said.West Midlands Police said their officers need to "challenge social workers and doctors" in future.Assistant Chief Constable Sharon Rowe said: "Of course it's a collective failure and we paid a key role in that."Ultimate accountability rests with Keanu's mother who was convicted of his murder - let's not forget that."Fay Baillie, director of nursing for NHS England in Birmingham, Solihull and the Black Country said: "I don't think children in Birmingham will ever be completely safe."We are always going to have deceptive mothers and families, however we can aim to make it as safe as possible by working together and improving education."</body>

      <title>UK A&amp;Es seeing 'drunk children'</title>
      <description>Nearly 300 children aged 11 or under were admitted to A&amp;E units across the UK last year after drinking too much, a BBC Radio 5 live investigation has found.</description>

      <body>Nearly 300 children aged 11 or under were admitted to AandE units across the UK last year after drinking too much, a BBC Radio 5 live investigation shows.Revealing UK-wide data for the first time, it said a total of 6,500 under-18s were admitted in 2012-13.Charities and public health bodies say fewer children are drinking overall, but those who do may be drinking more.The five years of data comes from Freedom of Information requests to 125 of the 189 UK NHS organisations.Prof Ian Gilmore, chairman of the UK Alcohol Health Alliance, told the BBC: "I think in under-11s, it's mainly experimenting, but I think we see children in the 11 to 16-year-old range who are beginning to drink regularly."He added: "There are some encouraging signs in that the numbers of under-18s drinking is probably falling, but those that are drinking are probably drinking earlier and drinking more heavily, so we certainly can't be complacent."Over the last five years AandE departments across the UK have dealt with nearly 48,000 incidents where under-18s have been admitted for drink or drug related illnesses.During 2012/13 there were 293 cases of children aged 11 or under attending AandE with alcohol-related conditions - a third more than in 2011/12 when there were 216 cases.Among teens, more girls than boys are now being admitted, a reversal of the past trend.Ayrshire and Arran Health Board dealt with the highest number of cases last year - with 483 alcohol-related attendances.Morten Draegebo, an AandE consultant at Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock, said children were exposing themselves to significant danger.He said: "The typical patient may be found in a field. They often need to hide away from any sort of adults in the area so they're picked up by the ambulance service."They have difficulty locating where they are because the description comes through from a distressed half-drunk teenager potentially saying that they're under a tree somewhere in a large park."Eventually they're found but even in summer-time in Scotland they're vaguely hypothermic."They have vomited. The vomit may go down the wrong way into the lungs. They are unable to defend themselves even from assault."Dr Draegebo added: "We have had many cases where teenage, young teenage females have come in saying that they may have been sexually assaulted and they're that intoxicated and are distressed and say, 'I may have been', but they don't even know if they have been or not."On a humane level that is very distressing. I'm a parent, I would hate for that to happen to my daughter."Elaine Hindal, chief executive of Drinkaware, said the incidence of drunkenness among under-11s was "really alarming" and parents must be vigilant."It's really unlikely that children are buying alcohol. When children talk to us in our research, they tell us they get alcohol from home, primarily from their parents and from friends," she said."But parents need to simply be aware of the dangers of drinking, particularly with younger children. Their bodies can't take it, they're more at risk of alcoholic poisoning, they are more likely to be a victim of alcohol-related violence."Across the UK, experts agree that fewer children are drinking now than several years ago, but say the amount being consumed by those underage has stayed the same - suggesting those who do drink are consuming more.Public Health England says one in four underage drinkers consumes more than 15 units a week - the equivalent of seven pints of lager.The official advice from the chief medical officers across the UK is that no children should be given alcohol until they are 16, and alcohol should only be given to older teenagers under supervision of a carer or parent, and never on more than one day a week.A Department of Health England spokesman said: "We know that fewer young people are drinking and being admitted to hospital as a result."But with more than one million alcohol-related hospital admissions overall in the last year we know too many people are drinking too much and that alcohol places a heavy burden on the NHS, costing around £3.5bn every year.

      <title>Library visits drop as cuts bite</title>
      <description>The number of people visiting public libraries in the UK has dropped by a quarter in the past eight years, according to a government survey.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24296825</url>
      <date>1380290457</date>
      <body>The number of people visiting public libraries in the UK has dropped by a quarter in the past eight years, according to a government survey.The proportion of adults using libraries has fallen from 48% to 36% since 2005, according to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS).The drop comes as some councils shut branches in an attempt to save money.Around 350 libraries are thought to have shut since April or be at risk, according to Public Libraries News.But cities including Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester have had major schemes to open or refurbish their central libraries.The decrease in library visitors has been a relatively steady trend since the DCMS' annual Taking Part survey began in 2005.The drop has been seen in all parts of the UK and all age groups, the survey found.The Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (Cilip) said the figures were "deeply disappointing".Cilip chief executive Annie Mauger pointed out reductions in staff numbers, spending and opening hours that had been felt over the past few years."Local authorities have had to make tough choices, but libraries are under pressure and cuts to services will mean that visits drop," she said.The body, which represents library workers, called for "stronger political leadership that supports a clear national vision to provide high quality, relevant and well used library services in communities across the country".The figures come days after Cilip passed a vote of no confidence in culture minister Ed Vaizey for his "failures" to intervene on library closures.In a speech in March, Mr Vaizey insisted libraries were not in crisis, saying: "I'm delighted our library service continues to thrive and modernise."Referring to the survey results, a DCMS spokesman said libraries were "still hugely important", with 4.5 million visits per week."Local authorities, of course, are best placed to decide the scale and nature of the services they provide, based on local needs," he said."But it is crucial that they understand what important resources library services are, and adapt and develop services to meet people's expectations in our rapidly changing world."There are great examples of innovation and creativity in the delivery of library services, and we want to see more local authorities doing that."Cllr Flick Rea of the Local Government Association said fewer than 5% of libraries had closed and councils were "working hard to innovate and re-design them" for the future."What is clear is that government can't keep reducing funding and expect councils to be able to keep protecting popular library services in this way," Cllr Rea said."Any further cuts would certainly result in widespread library service closures and stop this positive work in its tracks."Other figures from the survey showed that the proportion of adults visiting museums or art galleries had risen from 42% to 53% since 2005.The East Midlands and north of England have shown the biggest rises in people watching or taking part in the arts, the survey found.Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the overall figures "show once again just how important the nation's arts and culture are to people".</body>

      <title>Freshers' fun? Not for the cleaners</title>
      <description>Fun for students but not the university cleaners</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24275092</url>
      <date>1380759129</date>
      <body>Students are returning for the new university term. There will be parties, long beery nights and bleary late mornings. It's the binge-fest of freshers' week.But for cleaners at one London university, it is the "worst week of the year" when there is "double work".The students and the cleaners share the university campus; they both work here, but to very different timetables. The cleaners are on the way to work before some of the students will be on the way home.University cleaners start work from 04:00, travelling through the dark streets on buses from the edges of the capital.Mostly Spanish speakers from South and Central America, many will have begun their journey more than an hour earlier.While the new term means freshers' parties for students, there's a different kind of freshening going on for the cleaners.They will have cleaned the toilets, emptied the bins, swept the floor, wiped the desks, while the students and their teachers will have been asleep. It's a double life for this university.As the first students begin to come through the doors in the morning, holding on to their textbooks and takeaway coffees, the cleaners have already finished their shifts.But they haven't finished working. Many will have multiple jobs, a few hours at a time, criss-crossing London by bus because the Tube fares are too expensive and they're not paid for the travelling in between.One university cleaner, who wants to remain anonymous, describes his daily timetable and gives his perspective on university life.He leaves his home at 03:00 for the first of three cleaning jobs. He works shifts from 04:00 - 06:00 and then 06:00 - 16:30 in central London and then finishes with a two-hour shift in south London, between 17:30 and 19:30.Then he goes home to his three children and gets ready to start work again the next morning.He works five days a week, but he says he has colleagues who work like this six or seven days a week."Sometimes I don't want to wake up. But I can't afford to miss a single day."It's dirty. People leave their rubbish on the floor. You think they would appreciate you, but you get into the lift and they turn away from you."That affects me. When you're trying to clean the toilets, people get cross. There's a lack of respect - it's very hard."Is it because we're cleaners? Because we're foreigners and we don't speak the language?"It's easy for families to break up, he says. Children without parents around can get into trouble. With no spare cash, people have to borrow and quickly get into high-interest borrowing. Long hours are worked to pay high London rents.And before making any assumptions about who gets caught up in this cycle, he says he works alongside cleaners who in their own countries had been a lawyer, a psychologist and a teacher. He is a graduate himself, before coming to the UK more than a decade ago.What's the worst part of cleaning?He says it's the toilets. And he can't understand how people can leave the bathrooms in such a bad way.Just as crushing is the sense of not being valued, particularly in an educational institution, where students debate ideas of equality, labour rights and social justice."I thought people would behave well, they would have courtesy, good manners."Instead, he says, even when he has been taking out a bin from below someone's desk they've refused to acknowledge him.These might be corridors of learning. But someone still has to clean them.Not speaking much English, competing at the most precarious end of the temporary labour market, cleaners are vulnerable to being exploited. It's part of the reason that he doesn't want to be identified.A previous contractor owed the cleaners money for three months, he says.They can't take their concerns to the university, because they work for an international outsourcing company. And there have been long-running campaigns over pay and conditions.But without being part of the university staff, the cleaners still share the same buildings, a parallel set of footsteps in the libraries, the lecture halls, the classrooms, unseen during the hours before dawn.He says they see the photos of families on the desks each day, they prepare the rooms. Without any sign of self-pity, he says: "Some of these tables are cleaned with tears."It's a tale of two cities invisible to one another.</body>

      <title>The state school sixth formers twinned with Eton</title>
      <description>State and public school sixth formers twinned</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24289105</url>
      <date>1381016264</date>
      <body>From a busy junction at Stratford High Street in East London, there is a great view of a symbol of one of the UK's most glittering recent successes - the Olympic Park - and the modern station created to go with it.And close by is an unusual school which is striving to bring together the old and the new traditions of England - much like the spectacular opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics.The London Academy of Excellence is a government-funded sixth-form serving the East End of the capital which is trying to bridge the gap between private and state schools.It opened its doors as London basked in the glow of the Olympics last year.In an unusual partnership, pupils there share lessons, sport and teachers with a local community school and several independent fee-paying schools including Eton, Brighton College and Highgate.It is easy to miss the London Academy of Excellence. Its modern building looks like any other shiny office block, perched on the edge of a busy road.It is as far from the green playing fields and quads of Eton and Brighton College as you could imagine - but pupils at these and the other schools involved are sharing more than lessons and aspirations.Through a buddy system, they are getting to know each other during visits and getting a window on each other's lives.Yousef, 17, was one of the first group of sixth-formers to join the academy."I was attracted by the links with Eton and the other schools," he said."This has built a bridge between us and independent schools. It's taught us a lot. It's illustrated that we have far more in common than difference."I get to visit Eton House boys with tailcoats. That was a bit of an experience, out of the ordinary, but behind that we saw a lot of similarities between us."Do the teenagers feel envious when they see the very different surroundings of pupils at the other schools?Curtis, 17, says no."One buddy took us on a tour and I studied a lesson of history with them. There was a similar-sized classroom, a similar way of teaching and talking. I felt at home there," he said."I did not feel envious. I am not that kind of individual. But who would not want to study at Eton?"Some of the sixth-formers say they feel lucky, because they do not have to pay for their education."We have this free. They are paying vast amounts to go to a college similar to ours", says Clinton.Ellie says the students at the other schools seemed really pleased to meet them."They were just as interested in us as we were in them. My buddy was asking so many questions about what we do."Most of their education takes place in the bright modern, business-like surroundings of their academy, in a converted office block.Their "uniform" is a "smart, professional dress code".The walls are white, the furniture bright. Big bold canvases with faces of famous intellectuals, scientists, artists and writers decorate the walls, dotted with their words of inspiration.In front of one of them is the academy's headmaster Robert Wilne, an energetic man, who bubbles over with enthusiasm for his pupils' success, their futures - and the aims of this experimental school."There are many schools doing interesting partnerships," he said."But this is a third way for independent schools, aside from giving bursaries or sponsoring academies."It is an experiment. I would love another city to look at it."It's a genuine, deep-seated partnership between eight schools that are woven in to the DNA of this academy."It's not window dressing or surface gloss."It is an experiment praised by the head of England's schools inspectorate Sir Michael Wilshaw, who in the summer accused many independent schools of living in "splendid isolation" from the state sector.He drew criticism from some in the private school sector this week too, for saying some schools' links with state schools were small, like crumbs from their tables.Some responded angrily, saying that their schools saved taxpayers money by educating children outside of the state sector.Both Labour and coalition governments have called for more links between private and state sector schools.All the academy's funding is from the government, says Mr Wilne and there is no direct funding from private schools.But there is support "in kind" and through links. Some of the governors are from the independent schools in the partnership."We draw on their various expertise and resources," says the headmaster."So if I want a scheme of work [curriculum plan] for maths, I go to to Highgate and ask for that. The head of economics at Brighton College is de facto head of economics here."They have been down and given feedback and mentoring support."Mr Wilne hopes the school will help social mobility."Education is the fuel of social mobility, education changes lives," he says."This 360 degree education we are offering here should fuel that mobility. Students will get the grades that will unlock doors to top universities and they are taking up extra-curricular activities and sports."They are interested in meeting others and they are not going to be daunted by meeting Etonians in the future."Sport, it seems, has also proved to be a good ice-breaker between students at the various schools."We enjoy visiting them as much as the sport," says Yousef.Curtis says he is enjoying trying out new sports."There is so much sport available. We do rowing. In my secondary school, we did rowing on a rowing machine, now we get to go on the water."With the first full exam season under its belt, the academy is now into its second year. The pioneer year looks to be a hard act to follow, having achieved 70% of their AS-levels at grades of A or B.Three students, including Ellie, spent part of the summer in the USA on a summer school after being encouraged to apply."I always wanted to go to university but did not aspire to the top ones," she said.The students say the school has widened their horizons, with encouragement to do so often coming in the shape of one of the many emails pumped out by their headmaster telling them of various opportunities."I get worried if I don't get an email from the head," one teenager says.They are getting help with their university applications and personal statements from one of the visiting teachers from the private sector.Student Harmanpreet says: "Our old head was always saying it's not about where you come from but where you are going."We know we are from a deprived area but LAE has shown us where we want to go."</body>

      <title>Angry Birds fires into the classroom</title>
      <description>Do video games have a place in the classroom?</description>

      <body>From Angry Birds to Minecraft, computer games are invading the classroom. But this is not going on behind the teacher's back anymore: it is part of the lesson plan.The average young person will have spent 10,000 hours gaming by the time they are 21 years old, research suggests.This has been mainly for entertainment, providing light relief from the maths textbooks and science experiments taking place in classrooms. But gaming is taking up more time of a child's life.For a child in the US with perfect attendance, 10,080 hours will be spent in school from fifth grade (age 10) to high school graduation, according to game designer Jane McGonigal.In the UK, computer games offering "stealth learning" have been used by many schools. But the big developers have generally, so far at least, not been keen to get involved.Angry Birds creator Rovio has brought Angry Birds Playground, a schools initiative devised with the University of Helsinki in Finland, into the kindergarten classroom of children, aimed at six-year-olds.With the initiative already in use in Finland, Rovio has now entered into an agreement with schools in China."With small children, the Finnish approach to education is very much play-orientated," says Sanna Lukander, vice president of book publishing at Rovio Entertainment."These characters and their world seemed to inspire children. You can't not think about how you might motivate children to do more than play."Finland is rated as having the best education system in the developed world.And it is not just the same edition of Angry Birds re-packaged: it is using the now-famous characters in new education-based games and a "full 360-degree approach to learning" involving books, teachers and digital devices.But what is it that children can learn from computer games which can really help with the hard learning needed in the classroom?"Games have a larger effect on learning than traditional materials in particular areas, like language acquisition, science, mathematics and social studies," says games scholar Professor Constance Steinkuehler, a former White House analyst."It's not just making the game, it's then about going back and assessing it - is it having the impact and educating in the way you hoped?"If you're talking about games in the classroom, games aren't the only vehicle for learning. You have a teacher, you have peer interaction and a structure of activities, that all plays a role, whether it's productive or whether it's rubbish."It's just like giving a textbook - you can have a fabulous one you can do great stuff with or not."And Rovio is keen to point out that it is not just the games having an impact in the classroom."Angry Birds Playground is not an educational game, it's an educational environment," says Ms Lukander."We couldn't put Angry Birds stickers on learning and just export it. It's a lot of careful RandD and research. It's been in the works for two and a half years."What this means is more than just using a slingshot to launch birds at pigs.Rovio has already worked with the publishers Penguin, National Geographic, Nasa, the National Geographic and others on educational books. It is not even branding itself as a games company but as a media company,But it is not the only media company in educational games.At the more avant garde end of games aimed at educating children, there are shooting games attempting to make chewing vegetables seem cool right through to combating sexually transmitted infections with a choice of superhero characters like Willy the Kid.Yes, really.More widely, Minecraft, the virtual world game, is being used in classrooms in all sorts of innovative ways."Minecraft is one of the most important games for learning right now," says Prof Steinkuehler."What kids are doing with Minecraft is mind-blowing. It's just amazing."In a classroom at Reykjavik University in Iceland, just like many others, Minecraft is used as a 3D graphical interface to help young people understand the basics of telling a computer what to do.According to MinecraftEdu, which is working with around 1,000 schools, the game is being used in every subject area across all school age groups, providing digital building blocks of what a lesson can demonstrate and teach.But interestingly, Minecraft is blocked by a number of school firewalls.And there are those who think games in the classroom do more harm than good."Gaming in the classroom might be frivolous at worst or entertaining at best," says teacher and author Dr Gary Stager.Current systems of education, Dr Stager argues, are seen as "unpleasant, tortuous and create a league table of winners and losers". But games in the classroom are not the way to fix it."The games developed for education tend to be a lot less fun, interesting and merely test prior knowledge," he says."Worst of all, they're coercive. Adults are taking something kids love - games - and using them in a coercive fashion to deliver curriculum."But the technology companies working with children see the move towards gaming and technology as inevitable. LeapFrog's LeapPad2 tablet device was one of the best-selling toys last year."Children already live in a multi-screen environment," says Sally Plumridge, LeapFrog's international marketing director."The whole world they work in is much more interactive. Bringing gaming into their lives really allows them to develop those cognitive skills.""There's still a need to learn in a traditional way; however, the way that traditional learning extends into new technologies just gives a different dimension to education and a more practical dimension."Children develop in role play and looking what their parents do. From a very early age, they see their parents with tablets and phones."Their instincts in that world of what to do and when to do it are much more enhanced than our own. We're learning it and they're growing up with it."Perhaps that is why so many parents look to their children for help when their phone stops working - they've spent 10,000 hours on these devices before they turn 21.</body>

      <title>The parents' long goodbye</title>
      <description>How parents cope when children head to university</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24208545</url>
      <date>1380157439</date>
      <body>More than 400,000 youngsters are starting university in the UK this year. That means hundreds of thousands of parents saying goodbye.The approach road to the student village is a long traffic jam of family cars, stuffed full with boxes, pillows, nervous families, memories and expectations.This is the very first day at university - parents taking their children and getting ready to say goodbye.It's one of those big events that never makes the headlines but will have been ringed in the diaries of hundreds of thousands of families.On motorways and trains, more than 421,000 youngsters will be making this symbolic journey. After months of anticipation, checklists on fridge doors, last meals at home, last drink with friends, it's now here.At the University of Sheffield, a stream of parents arrive with their sons and daughters at the Endcliffe Student Village. There are balloons, music, banners and the upbeat banter of student radio in a well-orchestrated welcome.It's like the first day at an academic holiday resort. Parents and their teenage children look around the newly-refurbished student union bar as if they are about to begin one last family trip.But under the South Yorkshire autumn sunshine there's no escaping the poignancy. For parents, this is what they've always wanted for their children and many will have quietly dreaded. It's a bittersweet journey.No one wants to spoil this big first day, but it's no secret that they'll be thinking about the empty room at home.There are T-shirted volunteers all around ready to help anyone looking lost. They know the teenagers are going to have worries.And what do the new arrivals most want to know about? Internet connection, of course. It's their most urgent concern, say the helpers. Not so much Generation Y as Generation Wi-fi.Meanwhile their dads, looking misty-eyed, have the conversations that they have at times of big emotions. They talk huskily about parking problems and the fleeting nature of mobile phone signals.It's a mixture of epic understatement and Alan Partridge as parents fill the long silences by talking about the ring roads that have brought them there.Suitcases and boxes full of gadgets are lugged along neat paths in the shade of newly planted trees. There will soon be 3,000 youngsters living here. There's a beach-themed party already lined up and a whole week of ice-breaking activities.There's a long gaggle of arrivals waiting to check in. There are girls who have travelled with clingy soon-to-be ex-boyfriends; there are siblings suddenly close to each other instead of fighting.But the biggest group are mothers, fathers and a teenager now taller than them. They stand together like they might have done on the first day of primary school. If there was a Club 45 to 55, it would look like this.Their estates and people-carriers look like the cars bought a few years ago for a young family, the ghosts of child seats still pressed into the upholstery.The university has put on a friendly face to help the new students over this threshold.In fact, universities have had a major collective make-over in their bid to attract students. There has been a campus building boom since the increase in tuition fees.Alongside the rigorous academic stuff, universities are also selling a leisure experience. It's part-science park, part-theme park.The student union bar at Sheffield has been re-vamped. Forget student unions with sticky carpets and punctured leatherette. It's now all clean, airy and comfortable and the bar manager at Sheffield says these days it's driven more by food than booze.If parents want to visit, Sheffield has just opened its own campus hotel.Even on their first day, it won't be an entirely unfamiliar environment for the new students. Before they arrive they will have been using social networking to get to know their future flatmates. They're bringing enough computer technology to launch a space mission, so keeping in touch with home should be easier than ever before.There is still time for some instant re-invention. Starting at university is one of the most significant changes for any young person. They will have spent several weeks deciding the big academic questions, like what they should wear in the bar.The first night is the stuff of myth. There are people you meet and then spend three years avoiding and people you meet on a corridor and then become friends with for the rest of your life. There will be freshers' week stories of excessive drinking, ineffective cooking and misguided outfits.These new students are entering their own soap opera of romance, friendship and ambition. It's a huge adventure that they've worked hard for years to achieve and for which they'll be paying for many years afterwards.But after the small talk over cups of coffee and a constant stream of text messages, there is no escaping where this is heading. For many families, if childhood has a final moment, this is it.The door closes on a student's room and parents and children go their separate ways.</body>

      <title>Fellowes defends Downton storyline</title>
      <description>Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes has defended a controversial storyline in the latest episode of the costume drama, which drew complaints from viewers.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24448002</url>
      <date>1381242722</date>
      <body>Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes has defended a controversial storyline in the latest episode of the costume drama, which drew dozens of complaints.ITV received 60 complaints after Anna May Bates (Joanne Froggatt) was attacked and raped by a guest's valet."The whole point of the way we do things on Downton is we don't do them gratuitously," Fellowes told the BBC."We are interested in exploring the resultant emotions and the effect these things have on people," he added.Fans took to Twitter on Sunday to express their "shock" and "distress" at the "sick" and "sensationalist" storyline.But Fellowes, who won an Oscar for the screenplay of Gosford Park in 2002, rejected the criticism, saying he was "sorry" if fans felt the show couldn't "go there".He pointed out the attack took place behind closed doors, saying: "If we'd wanted a sensational rape we could have stayed down in the kitchen with the camera during the whole thing and wrung it out."The point of our handling is not that we're interested in sensationalising but we're interested in exploring the mental damage and the emotional damage," he said.Froggatt also defended the scenes, telling BBC Breakfast she was "proud" that the show could tackle such a weighty subject."I think it's a really brave thing to do... I believe that Julian has written it in a way that is not gratuitous at all," she said."We all felt a big responsibility to get it right."Fellowes said the plot development did not signal a new direction for the drama, which is now in its fourth series."Downton deals in subjecting a couple of characters per series to a very difficult situation and you get the emotions that come out of these traumas."When you handle very difficult and sensitive story lines, the minus is that they do expect more work from the audience but the plus is they can take you to a helpful place in terms of self analysis," he said."The fact that [viewers] engage with it is sort of what you pray for as a programme maker, because with most series that's not happening."It's always a compliment that everyone gets so involved in the show," he added.An average of 9.2 million viewers watched Sunday night's episode, with a peak audience of 9.9 million.A warning alerting viewers to the upsetting scenes involving Mrs Bates and Lord Gillingham's valet Mr Green was broadcast before the episode aired.ITV said on Monday it had received 60 complaints, while broadcasting watchdog Ofcom also received a number of complaints - although it cannot yet release figures."All of this is about taking characters to the brink," explained Fellowes."We know Anna is a strong personality but it doesn't mean she will be able to be strong through this."The whole rest of the series, for her story and for Bates' story, is seeing how she negotiates her way through this. I don't think we ever have a sense that she leaves it behind," he said.Froggatt said later episodes would "explore the emotional journey of Anna and Bates after this event", adding that Fellowes had "done a beautiful job at hitting the right note with it".She said that the writer was "adamant" that they would not depict "that kind of violence against a woman" on screen, adding: "That's something he didn't want in a show of his, and that's an incredible thing in this industry in this day and age."She said the show still had "shock value" without "anything graphic" being shown.The actress explained that the series' historical advisor, Alastair Bruce, had told her that 100 years ago, when the story was set, women felt unable to tell the police about sexual assaults."There was still such a stigma attached to any kind of attack like this that you were very much in danger of losing all of that," she said."And if a woman lost her reputation that would bring shame upon the house, she could lose her job, she could lose her husband. And society still saw it as no smoke without fire, 'well he's only a man - he couldn't help himself.'"Nigel Harman, who played Anna's attacker, previously told ITV's This Morning he was "amazed" by the storyline, "because for a show like Downton it really leaped out as a bold and risky idea".The drama has not been afraid to shock viewers in the past, with the unexpected death of key character Matthew Crawley bringing last year's Christmas episode to a sombre conclusion.</body>

      <title>Robin Thicke ad ruled 'too sexual'</title>
      <description>An advert featuring singer Robin Thicke performing his number one hit Blurred Lines must not be shown before 19:30 as it is too sexual, the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) rules.</description>

      <body>An advert featuring singer Robin Thicke performing his number one hit Blurred Lines must not be shown before 19:30 as it is too sexual, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has said.The ruling was made after 97 complaints about the ad for Beats Pill speakers, which features scantily clad women.The ASA said while it accepted some viewers might find the ad distasteful, it would not cause widespread offence.However, it ruled the "overall tone" was sexual.The advert, which is based on the controversial music video for Thicke's song, shows three female models dancing and interacting with the product while dressed in hot pants and crop tops.It also features one woman kneeling on her hands and knees with a Beats Pill laid on her back.Those that complained said the commercial was sexist, objectified women and was degrading to women.Others said it was inappropriate at a time when children would be watching.In its response, Beats Electronics International said the advert was not intended to be offensive or encourage any inappropriate stereotypes, saying the women were confident, self-assured individuals who were "not subservient to the male character".It added the dominant images were of the product being used as dumbbells, a hotdog, binoculars and medicine, which were "strong, playful images that most viewers would not see as having any sexual connotation".In its ruling, the ASA acknowledged some viewers could find elements of the advert distasteful - "particularly the shots of the women's bodies with their heads obscured and the shot of the woman on all fours".It said as the shots were brief, it did not consider the ad - when taken as a whole - showed any sustained, overtly sexual or provocative behaviour.However, it concluded the overall tone was sexual and was not suitable for broadcast before 19:30.The unrated video for Thicke's Blurred Lines - in which the female models appeared topless - was branded misogynistic and banned from YouTube earlier this year.A second version of the video, featuring the women in the same outfits they wore in the Beats Pill advert, later replaced the original.</body>

      <title>BBC plans to launch BBC One +1</title>
      <description>The BBC is planning to launch a BBC One +1 channel and will offer a 30-day catch-up service on the iPlayer, director general Tony Hall announces.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24442265</url>
      <date>1381237766</date>
      <body>The BBC is planning to launch a BBC One +1 channel, its director general Tony Hall has announced.Speaking at his first major speech since joining in April, Lord Hall said audiences expected a timeshift service that would give people "more of what they've already paid for".Other innovations he announced included a revamped, personalised iPlayer, offering a 30-day catch-up period.The service will also allow users to watch shows before they are broadcast.Explaining the decision to introduce a "plus one" service, which would show BBC One programmes with a one-hour time delay, Lord Hall said: "BBC One needs to be on top form. It has to be the nation's favourite channel, and also its bravest."He added the corporation would be investing more in drama and entertainment "so that all audiences find something they love on the BBC".In addition, a BBC Store will be launched, offering people in the UK the chance to buy BBC shows to watch and keep.Lord Hall said he wanted BBC Music to be a well-recognised brand like BBC News and BBC Sport, and that he wanted to offer more moments like this year's Glastonbury festival coverage, where six stages were streamed live to TV, radio, computers, consoles, tablets and phones."Our audiences loved it. I loved it. I watched on my phone. Glastonbury reached more viewers and listeners on that one weekend than had attended the festival in its entire 40-year history," he said.He also announced a new product - BBC Playlister - which will allow audiences to tag any piece of music they hear on the BBC and listen to it later, via streaming services like Spotify, YouTube and Deezer.The director general promised the corporation would have a closer relationship with its audience in future, treating them as "owners" rather than licence fee payers.A "personalised BBC" will allow viewers to rate and discuss programmes, and that "will influence what we commission," he said."People should not be saying 'the BBC', but 'my BBC', 'our BBC'," he added."Audiences demand to be involved and expect to participate. In future they will talk to us and we will listen."In a wide-ranging speech, Lord Hall announced the following innovations, although he noted the biggest changes would have to be submitted to the BBC Trust for approval:Lord Hall said that, while the BBC was continuing to make savings following the licence fee freeze, his plans would require "another £100m a year" - which the BBC will have to find by redirecting "resources, money [and] people".He also praised the strength of BBC News, saying: "While I want BBC News to be alive to its critics, I don't want BBC News to be cowed by them.""We are going to show the British public, who pay for this service, that we know - and will never again forget - what we are here to do."The people of this country make a bold and generous commitment in paying for the BBC. They own it, they love it, and they expect only the best from it. Every day we are going to show that we are worthy of that commitment."Lord Hall acknowledged his vision for the BBC came under the shadow of recent scandals including those involving Jimmy Savile and senior manager pay-offs."No organisation as big as ours can avoid making mistakes. But I want to ensure that when we do make mistakes they are caused by trying to serve our viewers, not by looking after ourselves."And when we do make mistakes - and we will - let's own up to them quickly, learn from them, and move on."He later told BBC Radio 4's World at One he "wouldn't consider closing a channel" to help free up cash for the rest of the network, adding: "I think people know that the public feel very strongly about all the services that the BBC does."He also said he had not been in contact with any former senior BBC figures to ask them to return portions of their payoffs.The BBC has been criticised for paying £25m to 150 outgoing executives - £2m more than their contracts stipulated - between 2009 and 2012."I feel that the payoffs were things agreed by the BBC for those people but, look, I acknowledged in what I said this morning - this organisation has been through a really, really tough time," Lord Hall said."When I go round the organisation, when I speak to people outside, I know how people feel, that the organisation has not been the organisation they wanted."</body>

      <title>Missing Doctor Who episodes found</title>
      <description>A number of early episodes of Doctor Who which were thought to have been lost have been located.</description>

      <date>1381239706</date>
      <body>A number of early episodes of Doctor Who, which were believed to have been permanently lost, have been returned to the BBC.BBC Worldwide is expected to confirm the find at a press screening in London later this week.It follows weeks of speculation that some lost episodes had been located.A total of 106 episodes featuring the first two actors to play the Doctor, William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton, are currently missing.The BBC destroyed many of the sci-fi drama's original transmission tapes in the 1960s and 1970s.However, the majority of the episodes had been transferred on to film for foreign broadcasters. It is often these prints found in other countries that are the source of retrieved episodes.In 1991, all four instalments of the Patrick Troughton adventure The Tomb of the Cybermen were discovered in Hong Kong.The latest find comes as Doctor Who celebrates its 50th birthday. A special episode featuring the current Doctor Matt Smith and his predecessor David Tennant will be shown on the programme's anniversary on 23 November.A raft of other programming to celebrate the long-running drama was also recently announced by the BBC.Details of how fans will be able to watch the recovered episodes are also expected to be revealed later this week.</body>

      <body>Author Sarah Hall has been named the winner of the BBC National Short Story Award 2013 for her story Mrs Fox.She picked up the £15,000 prize at a ceremony at BBC Broadcasting House in London, from this year's judges' chairwoman, Mariella Frostrup.Mrs Fox tells the story of a woman who turns into a fox to her husband's confusion and dismay.Frostrup said from the outset of deliberations the judges had all been "seduced by our winning story"."The poetic use of language, the dexterity and originality of the prose made Sarah Hall's Mrs Fox utterly unique," she said.Hall has won a growing list of awards for her short stories and four novels and has been selected as one of this year's Granta's Best Young British Novelists.Speaking about Mrs Fox, she said she was "fascinated by situations in which human beings are challenged and placed outside the usual codes of conduct".She was previously shortlisted for the BBC short story award in 2010.Lucy Wood was selected as this year's runner-up, receiving £3,000 for her story Notes From the House Spirits, taken from her debut book, a collection of short stories entitled Diving Belles, inspired by Cornish folklore.The other shortlisted authors, Lionel Shriver, Lisa Blower and Lavinia Greenlaw, each received £500.The judging panel was made up of Mariella Frostrup, Mohsin Hamid, Peter Hobbs and Deborah Moggach.The BBC National Short Story Award, which is run in collaboration with the Book Trust, was launched in 2006 and is open to writers resident in the UK.Last year the award was opened out to international writers to mark Olympic year.Previous winners include James Lasdun, Julian Gough, Clare Wigfall and David Wilson.</body>

      <title>Blu-Ray albums target hi-fi fans</title>
      <description>Record companies are trying to tempt fans away from MP3s by releasing albums in a crystal-clear Blu-Ray format.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24441979</url>
      <date>1381241353</date>
      <body>Record companies are trying to tempt fans away from MP3s by releasing albums in a crystal-clear Blu-Ray format.Nirvana's Nevermind and Amy Winehouse's Back To Black will be among the first records to be released in the format, which comes to the UK this month.Listeners will need a Blu-Ray player and a stereo system to play the discs, which promise to deliver "the sound as it was intended by the artist".However, high-fidelity audio products have failed to catch on in the past.DVD-Audio and Super Audio CD (SACD), both of which launched in the early 2000s, delivered better quality sound than ordinary CDs but faltered in the marketplace.The new format, officially called Pure Audio, uses similar encoding techniques to those predecessors but, crucially, has the support of all the major record labels from the outset.Pioneered by Universal Music, it launched in France earlier this year, where the initial batch of 35 titles have already achieved sales of more than 500,000.One album, Mylene Farmer's Monkey Me, has sold 84,000 copies on Blu-Ray alone - which would be enough to ensure a top 10 placing in the UK charts.The BBC was given several tracks to audition, comparing them directly to the equivalent songs on CD and MP3 through a home stereo system.Stevie Wonder's I Wish opened up, with a rounder, fuller bass and the intricate hi-hat work sounding crisp and bright.Bob Marley's Is This Love sounded more spacious than the muddy MP3, with Marley's soulful vocals so clear he could almost have been in the room.The clarity wasn't always an advantage, however: Serge Gainsbourg's spittle-flecked come-ons in L'hotel Particulier sounded doubly creepy in full resolution.But despite the improvement in clarity, the question remains: Will fans accept the format?Although they are lower quality than a CD, the portability of MP3s and Apple's iTunes format proved more alluring to consumers than either SACD or DVD-Audio, which are no longer manufactured in any great number."It's all about timing," said Olivier Robert Murphy, global head of new business at Universal."When SACD launched it was supported by only part of the industry, and you had to buy a 1,000 euro (£842) player. Here, we have 33% of the population that already has a Blu-Ray player at home.""The magic of this format is that you buy a £60 player, you put the disc in, you play it through a basic stereo sound system - the sound is incredible."Warner Music and Sony have already released albums on Blu-Ray in France and Japan, while Universal plans to issue 200 albums in 14 countries "very quickly".At launch, the UK catalogue will contain albums such as The Velvet Underground and Nico's self-titled debut, Queen's A Night At The Opera and Marvin Gaye's What's Going On?Classical releases include the Berlin Philharmonic's interpretation of Mahler's Symphony No.5 and Rolando Vilazon's collection of Verdi's works for the tenor.Murphy acknowledged the selection relied heavily on heritage acts."It's not necessarily a strategy," he told the BBC, "but what we realised is that initially we're talking to specialists, we're talking to a niche"."I'm talking about the guy who spent 40 grand on his hi-fi system. Let's face it, this guy is probably 35-plus, and likes heritage artists."However, Murphy said the long-term goal was to release new albums in the format, too."For me, it could represent a very nice percentage of physical sales," he said."When I see that we're selling more vinyl now than in 2002, I know there is an appetite for this kind of music."But, in an admission of modern listening habits, albums purchased in the Blu-Ray format will come with a free copy of the lower-quality digital version."Blu-Ray is a copy-protected format," said Murphy. "If someone has spent £15 on a product, he should have the right to put it on their iPod and listen to it when he's doing his fitness programme."Eventually, the Pure Audio files could be distributed digitally themselves - but with a four-minute song needing 1GB of storage space, Murphy said it would be "three to four years" before that was a reality.</body>

      <title>Papers' regulation plans rejected</title>
      <description>Newspaper industry proposals for a royal charter on press regulation have been rejected, Culture Secretary Maria Miller tells the House of Commons.</description>

      <body>Newspaper proposals for a royal charter covering press regulation have been rejected by the Privy Council, the culture secretary has told the Commons.Maria Miller said they did not comply with some "important" principles of the Leveson report into the press, such as independence and access to arbitration.The alternative plans proposed by the government after cross-party talks would now be "improved", she added.Ministers were said to be willing to consider some of the industry's ideas.The charter will then be put forward for approval at a specially convened meeting of the Privy Council - a cross-party, governmental advisory body - on 30 October, Mrs Miller said.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the decision to reject the industry plans was taken by a sub-committee of four Tories and two Lib Dems and it had been clear for some time that they felt the industry proposals were not independent enough.But government sources have told the BBC they are seeking "workable press regulation".Our political editor said there was a fear at ministerial level of a possible legal challenge by newspapers to the Privy Council decision.Campaign group Hacked Off said the rejection of the industry's charter was "long overdue".Its director Brian Cathcart said: "This is a solution to a long-standing problem affecting many, many ordinary people..."It is time now [the press] stepped up and accepted what is a workable, fair solution that poses no threat whatsoever to freedom of expression in this country."Options for the self-regulation of the press were proposed in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry, set up in July 2011 after it emerged journalists working for the now-closed News of the World had hacked into the mobile phone of murdered Surrey schoolgirl Milly Dowler.But politicians and the newspapers have clashed over the details of a royal charter - a formal document used to establish and lay out the terms of a body - to underpin the new regulator.The government's proposals, published in March, won Parliamentary backing.The industry's plans were formally proposed by the majority of the UK's newspaper groups in July amid concerns the government charter gave politicians too much power.Mrs Miller told MPs: "The committee of the Privy Council is unable to recommend the press's proposal for a royal charter be granted."Whilst there are areas where it is acceptable, it is unable to comply with some important Leveson principles and government policy."But she said the committee had identified issues where the cross-party charter could be improved, including arbitration and the editors' code of conduct.Mrs Miller told MPs: "We have an opportunity to take a final look at our charter, an opportunity to bring all parties together and ensure that the final charter is both workable and effective."We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to get this right. We all want it to be the best we can do to give individuals access to redress whilst safeguarding this country's free press which forms such a vital part of our democracy."Spectator magazine editor Fraser Nelson, writing in a blog on the publication's website, said it would "have no part in any government-mandated regulator" for the press."Spectator readers would be appalled if we signed up to some kind of regulatory hierarchy which had politicians at the top," he said."They expect us to be holding these guys to account, not dancing to their tune."Political involvement:"Recognition" panel:Appointments process:Corrections and apologies:Arbitration:</body>

      <body>BBC drama Accused is leading the field at this year's International Emmys with two nominations.The Jimmy McGovern series, which featured a different character accused of a crime in each episode, is nominated for best drama series.Sean Bean, whose character becomes embroiled in a crime of passion in the series, is up for best actor.There were six nominations in total for the UK, along with six for Brazil and three for France.McGovern's first series of Accused won two International Emmys in 2011, when former Doctor Who Christopher Eccleston took home the award for best actor, and the programme itself won best drama series.It was also announced that JJ Abrams, currently directing the latest Star Wars film, will be presented with the honorary 2013 International Emmy Founders Award at the ceremony which takes place on 25 November in New York.British star Sheridan Smith, perhaps best known for her West End stage roles, is up for best actress for her title role in ITV drama Mrs Biggs.Based on the true story of the wife of great train robber Ronnie Biggs, the role won Smith the Bafta TV award for best actress earlier this year.The other British nominees are BBC One's Imagine programme, Freddie Mercury: The Great Pretender, Chris O'Dowd's Sky One comedy Moone Boy and Channel 4 political thriller Secret State.Brazilian actor Marcos Palmeira is recognised in the best actor category for his role as a criminal lawyer in HBO's Latin America series Mandrake Especial.Fernanda Montenegro, who was Oscar-nominated for her role in 1998 film Central Station, is up for the best actress award in TV Globo's Sweet Mother.TV Globo dominated Brazil's nominations, with four other recognised programmes produced by the company - How To Enjoy The End Of The World, Next In Line, Brasil Avenue and Side By Side.Two countries are first-time nominees - Angola for Windeck in the telenovela category and Uruguay for SOMOS-Cadaver Se Necesita in the TV movie/mini-series category.</body>

      <title>Press plan for regulation 'rejected'</title>
      <description>Senior Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have rejected the press's own favoured version of a royal charter for press regulation, the BBC's Newsnight has learned.</description>

      <date>1381228314</date>
      <body>Senior politicians have rejected the newspaper industry's version of a royal charter setting up a press regulator, the BBC's Newsnight has reported.A source said a sub-committee of the Privy Council, containing Lib Dem and Tory cabinet ministers, thought the proposals were "flawed".But sub-committee chair Danny Alexander insisted no decision had been made.The full Privy Council is also looking at an alternative plan backed by politicians and campaigners.Maria Miller, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, will make a statement on press regulation in the House of Commons later.But the full Privy Council is not expected to meet and announce its decision on the press proposal until Wednesday. Its decision on the plan put forward by politicians and campaigners should be announced on 30 October.Press regulation options are being considered in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry, which was set up in July 2011 after it emerged journalists working for the now-closed News of the World had hacked into the mobile phone of murdered Surrey schoolgirl Milly Dowler.Politicians and the press have been at odds over the details of a royal charter - a formal document used to establish and lay out the terms of a body - to underpin the regulator.The government's proposals published in March have cross-party backing and the support of campaign group Hacked Off.There are a series of key differences between the industry's plan for press regulation and that agreed by politicians and campaigners.Newsnight's political editor Allegra Stratton was told Privy Council members felt proposals for self-regulation put forward by newspapers did not meet the requirements of Lord Justice Leveson's report.Mr Alexander, who told the BBC the sub-committee met on Monday and the full Privy Council will meet on Wednesday to consider the press proposal, said there were a "few remaining" details to be decided - but insisted "no final decision has been made".But ministers "do look set to reject" the form of regulation put forward by newspapers, BBC political editor Nick Robinson said.Political involvement:"Recognition" panel:Appointments process:Corrections and apologies:Arbitration:The Privy Council sub-committee consists of four Tories and two Lib Dems - and both parties have been critical of the press proposals, he added.The full Privy Council is expected to endorse the recommendation of the sub-committee.Steve Hewlett, presenter of BBC Radio 4's The Media Show, told Newsnight that newspaper publishers felt the process had been far from transparent.He said: "People I have spoken to are furious and are now considering whether there might be a legal challenge to this decision by the Privy Council."Trevor Kavanagh, associate editor of the Sun, said the news was not a shock."It's what we'd been given fairly clear clues would happen," he said."I think it has to be seen as a great victory for the forces of oppression of a free press - Hacked Off in particular - and the politicians who have gone along for the ride."Brian Cathcart, executive director of Hacked Off, said the press's plan had been a "delaying manoeuvre" by the big national newspapers."The problem with the papers is that they do not want to deal fairly with complaints," he said.Mr Cathcart said there was a "rare unanimity" in Parliament on this issue, and the press was refusing to compromise "like an errant child on the naughty step with his fingers in his ears".He said only the press stood against the consensus in politics and the public which said: "We want Parliament's royal charter - Leveson's royal charter - and we want it now."Earlier, Gerry McCann said the newspaper industry's plans for press regulation were "a gentlemen's club agreement" and should be rejected by politicians.The father of missing Madeleine McCann said the recommendations of the Leveson Inquiry were the "minimum acceptable".Mr McCann and his family were subject to intense press attention after Madeleine went missing while they were on holiday in Portugal in 2007.</body>

      <date>1381172264</date>
      <body>Playwright Sir Tom Stoppard has collected this year's Pen Pinter Prize at the British Library in London.The 76-year-old gave an address at the event, which also featured readings from his plays.Sir Tom also announced he had chosen Belarusian journalist Iryna Khalip as the recipient of this year's writer of courage award.The prize recognises an international writer who has been persecuted for speaking out about their beliefs.Sir Tom said Khalip was chosen in recognition of her vocal criticism of her native government in spite of intimidation and imprisonment.The journalist, who is a correspondent for the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, has long written and protested against alleged human rights abuses.In 2010, Khalip and her husband were arrested after taking part in protests against Belarus's presidential election, which were surrounded by accusations of fraud.She was given a two-year suspended sentence for "organising and preparing activities severely disruptive of public order" in 2011. The sentence was dropped in July this year.Sir Tom said he was "proud to share the prize with a brave reporter".Khalip added: "It's a real honour for me but, more than this, it's a recognition of the just fight of the people of Belarus for human rights and for our dignity."The Pen Pinter Prize was established in 2009 in memory of playwright Harold Pinter and is awarded to a writer who casts an "unflinching, unswerving" gaze upon the world and shows a "fierce intellectual determination...to define the real truth of our lives and our societies".Sir Tom is known for co-writing the Oscar-winning screenplay for Shakespeare in Love, as well as his stage works The Real Thing and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead.Lady Antonia Fraser, Pinter's widow, said: ''Harold would have greeted Tom's win with enthusiasm as a great admirer of his work; he would have been particularly pleased by the award to Iryna, since the Belarusian cause was close to his heart."</body>

      <body>Doctor Who actor Matt Smith is to star in a musical version of the controversial novel American Psycho.The 30-year-old has been cast as the psychopathic serial killer Patrick Bateman in the adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis's 1991 thriller.The production will run at London's Almeida Theatre from 3 December to 25 January 2014.The show almost completely sold out within hours of Smith's involvement being revealed.Set in the 1980s, American Psycho tells the story a 26-year-old Manhattan investment banker whose sanity slowly disintegrates, turning him into a brutal murderer.It was previously adapted for the big screen in 2000 with Christian Bale in the lead role.The show, which was announced minus cast details in January, will be directed by the Almeida's new artistic director, Rupert Goold, who developed the musical with his former company, Headlong.Tony Award-winning composer Duncan Sheik has collaborated with Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark scriptwriter Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa to adapt the book for the stage.Smith said he was "excited" to be part of the production."The opportunity to work with Rupert Goold, a director of great vision and flair, combined with the brilliant story and music, seemed like such a cool challenge," he said.Goold added: "Matt Smith is a wonderful stage performer and the perfect actor not only to lead our exceptional cast but also my first show as artistic director here at the Almeida."Smith has just finished filming his final scenes for the Christmas special of Doctor Who, which will see his character regenerate into the 12th Doctor, played by Peter Capaldi.</body>

      <title>Black Beauty author letters found</title>
      <description>A historian discovers a rare collection of letters by Black Beauty author Anna Sewell and brings them back to her home county of Norfolk.</description>

      <date>1381148938</date>
      <body>A rare collection of letters, signed by Black Beauty author Anna Sewell between 1820 and 1860, has been brought back to her home county of Norfolk.Local historian Glynn Burrows snapped up the letters, described by Norfolk archivist Frank Meeres as "valuable" in terms of social history.Mr Burrows said there are seven letters written by the author and a working manuscript of a poem.Anna Sewell finished her only novel in 1877 and died five months later.Mr Meeres, from the Norfolk Record Office, said to find letters from Anna Sewell was "quite uncommon".He said: "I'm sure they are valuable in terms of cash and they are valuable in terms of what they would tell us about life in Victorian England."They'd certainly be something we'd like to show to the public."Mr Burrows, who found the letters on an internet auction site, said there was one letter signed "your loving sister Anna Sewell" and several signed "Nannie", her family's pet name for her.Other documents in the collection include letters relating to her brother Philip, and from her mother, Mary, father Isaac and aunt Emma to Anna Sewell."The interesting ones are the family ones," said Mr Burrows.'For instance, when her brother lost one of his children, Anna wrote a poem all about his little girl who died, and there's actually a working copy of this poem... where she's crossed words out and changed the wording."Anna Sewell's biographer, Dr Adrienne Gavin said the find was exciting."It's a rare find," she said."There are not many letters in her own hand that exist and they'll shed more light on the woman who wrote Black Beauty and who was active in charity work among the poor."She wrote Black Beauty on her death bed in her mid 50s, and died five months after it was published."For Mr Burrows, who hopes the letters will eventually be housed in the Norfolk Record Office, the collection brought back memories of his childhood."When I was little my dad always used to read me and my sister a couple of pages from this great big copy of Black Beauty before we went to bed," he said."So [the find] took me back to those days in the '60s."</body>

      <body>French cinema, opera and theatre director Patrice Chereau, whose work included the acclaimed film La Reine Margot, has died at the age of 68.Elisabeth Tanner, co-director of the Artmedia agency which represented Chereau, confirmed he had died after a long illness.French president Francois Hollande said: "The cultural world is mourning.""France loses an artist... who is its pride across the world," his statement continued.Ms Tanner added: "He had an extraordinary vitality right until the end."The Oscar-nominated La Reine Margot (Queen Margot) won the Cannes Jury prize in 1994.It starred Isabelle Adjani as a young Queen Margot, who found herself trapped in an arranged marriage against the backdrop of a religious war between Catholics and Protestants.Another of his films, Intimacy, won the Berlin Golden Bear best film award in 2001.Starring Mark Rylance, Timothy Spall and Marianne Faithfull, the tale of sexual obsession was based on the book of the same name by Hanif Kureshi.The controversial movie featured explicit sex scenes but Chereau defended it, saying: "It is not like a porno film, not at all erotic sometimes, but it is beautiful because it is life".While revered in his home country for his theatre productions, it was Chereau's production of Wagner's Ring Cycle at the Bayreauth opera festival that attracted international attention.Staged between 1976 and 1980, the production, set in the industrial age, is still seen as a groundbreaking piece.Chereau's assistant on the Ring Cycle, Nicolas Joel, is now the director of the Paris Opera.He said he was "overcome" by the news of Chereau's death."He did me the honour of asking me to go with him to the Bayreuth Festival for the centenary Ring Cycle," he added. "I still have wonderful memories of the time we spent together."</body>

      <description>Woody Allen stops his latest film, Blue Jasmine, from being screened in India after learning mandatory anti-tobacco adverts would be inserted during the movie's smoking scenes.</description>

      <body>Woody Allen has stopped his latest film, Blue Jasmine, from being screened in India after learning mandatory anti-tobacco adverts would be inserted into its smoking scenes.Indian law requires health warnings to be shown on screen when characters smoke in films, while cinemas must play anti-smoking ads before every movie.According to Reuters, Allen refused to accommodate the ads during his film.It had been due to open in around 30 cinemas at the weekend.Blue Jasmine stars Cate Blanchett as a wealthy New York socialite who suffers a humiliating fall from grace after her husband is arrested for financial fraud.The actress's critically acclaimed performance has seen her odds of winning an Oscar next year slashed to 1/4 from an initial 7/1 in August.The film features two smoking scenes that would have given cause for the on-screen disclaimers - typically scrolling text warning viewers of the dangers of tobacco use.A publicist for Allen told Reuters: "Due to content in the film, it cannot be shown in India in its intended manner. Therefore, the film is not scheduled to play there."The film's Indian distributor, PVR films, told DNA newspaper the director had overall creative control over the film."He wasn't comfortable with the disclaimer that we are required to run when some smoking scene is shown in films," Deepak Sharma said."He feels that when the scroll comes, attention goes to it rather than the scene. We had to abide by the law and we don't have control over the film."India's film censor board regularly requires changes to films and while some directors allow the alterations, others have refused.Many, including Martin Scorsese and David Lynch, argue changes to their films - including changing the aspect ratio in which some movies are shot - are unacceptable because they corrupt the artist's vision.</body>

      <body>Space film Gravity, starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, has shot straight to the top of the US box office in its opening weekend.According to early estimates, the movie took $55.55m (£34.62m) over the weekend, making it the biggest October opening since records began.The figure also ensured it was the biggest opening for a film starring Bullock or Clooney.The film, set almost entirely in space, is directed by Alfonso Cuaron.Bullock and Clooney play an astronaut and a medical engineer who work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space.Last week's number one, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2, dropped into second slot with $21.5m (£13.4m).Based on a children's book, the first film - Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs - was a breakout hit for Sony Animation in 2009.The follow-up is an original story, in which inventor Flint Lockwood must save the day after one of his inventions malfunctions, creating food-animal creatures, or animals made of food, that overtake the region of Swallow Falls.Runner Runner, starring Oscar-winner Ben Affleck and pop star and actor Justin Timberlake, opened in third place, taking just $7.6m (£4.7m).The crime thriller follows Timberlake as a graduate student who goes to Costa Rica to confront an online gambling tycoon played by Affleck, who swindles him.Former number one Prisoners, starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Hugh Jackman, slipped from second place to fourth.Formula One movie Rush, which depicts the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda, took fifth spot.Joseph Gordon-Levitt's directorial debut, Don Jon, about a porn addict looking for love, was next in sixth place."The adult drama is back, and fall is the season for the adult drama," said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for box-office tracker Rentrak."This is when you get your more challenging films, some of the more esoteric fare."</body>

      <title>Lennox calls for pop video ratings</title>
      <description>Pop star Annie Lennox describes modern pop videos as "pornographic", and says they should be subject to a ratings system.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24432329</url>
      <date>1381165254</date>
      <body>Pop star Annie Lennox has described the sexualised imagery of modern pop videos as "dark" and "pornographic"."I'm all for freedom of expression," she told BBC Radio 5 live, "but this is clearly one step beyond, and it's clearly into the realm of porn.""How do you stop your kids being exposed to it? It's so powerful. You don't want to see your seven-year-old girls twerking all over the place."The singer has called for pop videos to be rated in the same way as films.She previously wrote on her Facebook page that if a pop star created "a soft porn video or highly sexualised live performance, then it needs to qualify as such and be X-rated for adults only".She told 5 live pressure from parents could help to establish "very clear boundaries" on acceptable standards in videos.Her comments fuelled a debate started by Miley Cyrus's performance at the MTV awards last month, in which she danced provocatively with singer Robin Thicke and made suggestive gestures with a foam finger.That performance, and a similarly risque video for her single Wrecking Ball, prompted Sinead O'Connor to write an open letter to the pop star, warning her not to be exploited by the music business.Artists such as Britney Spears, Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga and Rihanna have also been criticised for explicit performances and costumes in the past.Lennox did not single out any one performer for criticism - referring instead to a "recent spate of overtly sexualised performances and videos" in her Facebook statement."I have nothing against these artists," she told 5 live's Anna Foster. "I was never bashing them."There's nothing wrong with sexuality and sensuality and I think these artists are beautiful. And, in many ways, what they do is fantastic, but it needs to be age-appropriate."These guys have young fan bases and they are being barraged with it."I don't think there's one parent of young boys and girls in this country that would honestly, comfortably say they were fine with seeing their kids being exposed to that kind of thing.""I think this debate is about getting the voice of reason back there to say 'look, we want to protect our kids.'"</body>

      <body>BBC 6 Music presenter Huey Morgan is to take over the station's Saturday morning 10:00 - 13:00 show in a shake up of the station's weekend schedule.The Fun Lovin' Criminals frontman's move from Sunday afternoons means Edith Bowman's Saturday slot will end.However, the BBC said she would continue to work on 6 Music special programmes planned for next year.The schedule changes will also see Cerys Matthews' Sunday morning show extended from two to three hours.The former Catatonia singer - who was named music broadcaster of the year at this year's Sony Radio Academy Awards - said her extra 60 minutes would give listeners "the perfect soundtrack to their Sunday lunch".Elbow's Guy Garvey, who joined 6 Music six years ago, will also move his Finest Hour show on Sundays from 22:00 to the higher-profile daytime slot of 14:00."I have been cosily tucked away in the 6 Music attic for six years but I think what we do on the Finest Hour will work just as well on a lazy Sunday afternoon," Garvey said.The Sunday Special slot, which features one-off guest playlists and documentaries will move to 13:00.It will also see the return of The First Time With... series, where Matt Everitt will explore the musical firsts of stars including David Lynch, Terry Hall, Elvis Costello, Smokey Robinson and Peter Gabriel.Another change will see film-maker and DJ Don Letts's show brought forward from midnight to 22:00 on a Sunday.Paul Rodgers, head of programmes for BBC Radio 6 Music, said: "This sharpening of the 6 Music weekend schedule is a further display of our commitment to showcase some of the most charismatic talent in music radio right now."It's great to bring Huey's New York attitude to Saturday mornings, which will be the perfect complement to Cerys' eclectic and absorbing music discoveries on a Sunday morning."Guy's exploration into music, hand in hand with his listeners, brings the perfect soundtrack to Sunday afternoons, with The Don's Culture Clash selections rounding off a blissful weekend."</body>

      <body>An Oxford University music student has won the Bryn Terfel Scholarship at the Urdd Gobaith Cymru youth competition in Aberystwyth.Flautist Chloe-Angharad Bradshaw from Hengoed, Caerphilly county, took the £4,000 prize following a concert at the Great Hall in Aberystwyth Arts Centre.Judges called her a "master at creating the fine sound of the flute".Ms Bradshaw plans to use the money to pay for travel expenses to overseas auditions for further study.As well as her studies at Oxford, she is also president of the university's music society and a member of the orchestra and sinfonietta.She said of the win: "I really enjoyed performing tonight, even though I was very nervous before performing my first piece."The other competitors were very professional, friendly and it was great to get a chance to share a stage with them."When they announced my name as the winner, I could not believe my ears and I just couldn't stop smiling."With the scholarship money, I am going to use it towards a masters degree. I've seen a few courses that appeal in Europe and the USA and this money will enable me to pay for flights to auditions abroad."Judge Eirian Owen praised all six competitors, adding: "They were all experienced in their field and mature performers but the winner did stand out."Even though it was close, we were unanimous that Chloe was the winner."Chloe's technique on the flute is excellent. She is obviously a master at creating the fine sound of the flute and I'm sure that she will go far."The prize was established by opera singer Bryn Terfel in 1999 to nurture young singing talent in Wales and is open to winners of eight specified competitions at the Urdd National Eisteddfod, an annual Welsh-language youth festival of literature, music and performing arts.</body>

      <body>Sales of British TV shows around the world in 2012 rose 4% to £1.2bn, boosted by programmes including Downton Abbey and Sherlock.The US remains the most lucrative market for British shows, up 11% to £475 million in 2012, figures from trade association Pact stated.Other dramas which boosted exports were Parade's End, Midsomer Murders and Come Dine With Me, Pact said.Sales to China rocketed up 90% to £12m, while exports to India went up 42%.Exports to South East Asia are up 26% but Australasia is the UK's second-biggest market with sales of £103m in 2012.Scandinavia spent £63m on UK content in 2012 - a 2% increase.Sales to Latin American countries are up by 24% and the Brazilian market has grown by 21%.Although exports of finished TV programmes - as opposed to formats - fell by 1%, they remained the largest source of TV revenue.A format is the concept for a TV show, for example, a premise for a gameshow. They can then be adapted for different countries.Dawn McCarthy-Simpson, director of market development at Pact, said: "This year's survey saw drama established alongside factual entertainment as a key driver of UK television exports."The organisation, which represents independent media companies, recently revealed figures showing that growth of international sales of UK television programmes has almost quadrupled since 2004.</body>

      <title>Viewers complain over Downton plot</title>
      <description>ITV say that 60 people have complained over Sunday's "shocking" episode of Downton Abbey.</description>

      <date>1381216756</date>
      <body>ITV has received 60 complaints over the latest episode of costume drama Downton Abbey, broadcast on Sunday.Viewers took to Twitter to express their "shock" and "distress" after Anna May Bates (Joanne Froggatt) was attacked and raped by a guest's valet.A warning alerting viewers to the upsetting scenes was broadcast before the episode aired.Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom has also received a number of complaints - although it cannot yet release figures.An average of 9.2 million viewers watched the episode, with a peak audience of 9.9 million.They saw Anna attacked while the rest of the servants, guests and family were watching an opera performance upstairs.Katy Rink writing in the The Daily Telegraph was one of those shocked at the episode. "Last night we writhed in our sofas, disbelieving and uncomfortable," she said, pointing out that the incident risked alienating viewers who watch Downton for gentle escapism.Viewer Lucy Raine tweeted: "I am genuinely so distressed at what just happened on Downton Abbey I feel sick."While Jennifer Durie tweeted: "I don't think I will ever forgive the writers of Downton Abbey for what they did to Anna."But Nigel Harman, who played attacker Mr Green, said in an interview with ITV's This Morning that the intention was to shock."It was a shocking and bold storyline," he said, adding that when he read the script he was "amazed and excited by it, if that makes sense, because for a show like Downton it really leaped out as a bold and risky idea".He added: "I'd worked with Joanne Froggatt and Brendan Coyle before and we had a rehearsal and went for it. And what we wanted to do was to try and not signal about what was to come."We went for something - as it would be in real life - very shocking."The show has not been afraid to shock viewers in the past, with the unexpected death of key character Matthew Crawley bringing last year's Christmas episode to a sombre conclusion.</body>

      <title>The band who opened a record shop</title>
      <description>Is this Britain's hardest working band?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24437766</url>
      <date>1381284402</date>
      <body>When indie band Frankie and the Heartstrings released their second album this summer, they were so alarmed by the lack of record shops in which to sell it that they decided to open their own."We were coming to the completion of our second record and the main story on the news one day was the fact HMV had gone bust," says singer Frankie Francis."At the time, a couple of local record shops had gone bust as well. We thought 'We've got this record coming out, but there might not actually be anywhere to sell it on the High Street.'"So we thought we'd take a stand and open our own record shop."With help from Sunderland City Council, the band took over the empty tourist office in their home town. "There's no call for it any more, for various reasons," Francis says solemnly.Pop Recs Ltd was only supposed to open for two weeks to mark their album's release in June. But the band say the reaction has been so good that they are keeping it open for as long as they can and have plans for in-store gigs through to next February.Four out of the five bandmates work there full time and, last month, the venture earned them the title of hardest working band in Britain from the Association of Independent Music.When I visit, the lead singer is manning the coffee machine, busily grinding beans and frothing milk as the shop fills up before an in-store gig by visiting Manchester band Dutch Uncles.Drummer Dave Harper and bassist Steve Dennis are behind the counter in a state of harangued dishevelment - passing coffee cups, jabbing the till, fetching supplies, pausing to chat to friends.Indie circuit stalwarts, Frankie and the Heartstrings made the top 40 with their debut album in 2011 and have a loyal live following, but are still waiting for that breakthrough to the big time."We're a band with not much money… and we've put what money we have into this project just to show bands can take a stand," Francis says."If we can do it on a street level, why can't people further up in the music business be as proactive as us?"We're engaging with loads of bands and labels to come and do things and because of that we're selling records in Sunderland for all these bands. That wouldn't have happened if this project didn't exist."But does it really matter whether we have real record shops selling real records any more? "I guess it matters more to us because we're in a band and we know how many records people sell," Francis replies."Even 10 years ago you would have sold double, three times, four times the amount of records that you sell now."I think it's very important to engage with people and make them realise the value of actually owning music, especially on vinyl because we're very romantic in that we take a lot of time over the artwork and the way it's laid out and the way the whole thing feels and looks."We just want to try and make that connect with people and explain to them why it's such a cherished item."A few months ago, Francis was simply a flamboyant indie rock front man. Now, he talks about business plans and the deals he has struck with various record labels."We're five kids from Sunderland who have been messing around in the back of a van for five years touring the world," he says."It's quite easy to slip back into the crazy gang mentality, but we've had to put our businessmen heads on."The group's second album missed the top 40 and they are now between record contracts. With minimal money to be made from album sales, mid-ranking indie bands must find other sources of income.Dutch Uncles are critical favourites but their three albums have not troubled the top 40. Singer Duncan Wallis says the idea of making money from selling records just does not occur to bands such as his."It's just not something you really consider," he says. "You only think about the money to be made out of touring, at this level anyway."Frankie and the Heartstrings say they have sacrificed summer festival fees in order to work in the shop, which earns them "enough to get by, and that's all we care about".The alternative would be much worse - getting proper jobs."The shop, if you maintain it correctly, could become an income for the band," Francis says. "If it wasn't for the shop we would all have to be in work now."Until now, the band have survived on the money they have made from their music. When a pizza company used one of their songs in a TV advert, the group lived for a year on the proceeds.Francis says: "I don't think there's any shame in that any more because you don't make any money from selling records, so you've got to make an income somehow."In the store, the band also sell their own coffee blend and brand of beer, and Francis admits they make more money from coffee than records most days. Like many other independent record stores, they know they cannot survive by selling music alone.Work by local artists and photographers adorns the walls and there are dedicated racks promoting records by local bands."We've had kids from the local area who've come into the shop, bought some records and the next week they've come in and said, 'We've just started a band, can we have a gig in here?'" Francis says.But the most prominent space is reserved for the new album by Frankie and the Heartstrings.The singer laughs: "If we're going to run a record shop, we're going to be number one in the charts every week in this store."</body>

      <title>'I used to watch 800 films a year'</title>
      <description>London Film Festival boss watches 500 films a year</description>

      <body>The BFI London Film Festival (LFF) opens later with sea piracy thriller Captain Phillips, starring Tom Hanks, directed by British film-maker Paul Greengrass.The film is based on the true story of Captain Richard Phillips, who was taken hostage by Somali pirates in 2009.The festival will close on 20 October with Saving Mr Banks, in which Hanks stars alongside Emma Thompson in the story of how the Disney classic Mary Poppins made it to the big screen.Among the 234 fiction and documentary features over 10 days are screenings of Stephen Frears' Philomena, the true story of a woman's search for her lost son starring Dame Judi Dench and Steve Coogan, and Steve McQueen's 12 Years A Slave, starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender and Benedict Cumberbatch.Other gala screenings include Alfonso Cuaron's space-set thriller Gravity, starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, Ralph Fiennes' The Invisible Woman, a period romance centring on the affair between Charles Dickens and actress Nelly Ternan, and the Coen Brothers' Inside Llewyn Davis, about the 1960s New York folk scene.We spoke to the festival's director Clare Stewart, in charge for a second year, ahead of Wednesday's opening night.The festival is about to start. Is this the calm before the storm?[laughs] There are various elements of the storm along the way. There's the storm of the programme being locked down, there's the pre-production storm that we're in now, and there's the storm of the festival itself.Was it important to you to have a British director opening the festival?Having a British director for the first time since 2006 was a really exciting element, but it was the film itself that completely won me over and, of course, Paul Greengrass knows how to direct a fantastic thriller.Captain Phillips is much more complex than your average action film in that it's based on the true story of a 2009 hijacking of a US container ship by Somali pirates. It looks at two men caught up in something they are not in control of and it reflects on broader global economies and politics.Tom Hanks book-ends the festival. How important is the Hollywood "A list" presence?The LFF plays an increasingly important role in the awards season build-up for both the Baftas and Academy Awards.Big films like Philomena, Gravity, 12 Years a Slave and Inside Llewyn Davis and Jason Reitman's Labor Day are definitely going to be featuring in awards season campaigns.But they also open the festival out to a broader audience and help us to introduce other more surprising, discovery films to people who might be attracted in by these big films.What did you learn from your debut experience in London last year?We made a lot of change to last year's festival, we opened it up to a wider footprint across London, we introduced new programme sections, such as Thrill, Dare and Sonic, and we took a number of big screenings out across the UK.That changed the landscape of the festival by opening it up for new audiences and if that hadn't worked I would have reassessed it. But we had a 13% increase in attendance and 33% of the people coming to the festival last year were first timers.How has that influenced this year?I felt for this year it was important to consolidate that, and let those changes really prove themselves.You previously ran the Sydney Film Festival. Do audiences in London and Sydney differ?I feel that one of the similarities is that there is an adventurousness and an openness to new things. One tangible difference is that here in London the connection to European films is much stronger, whereas obviously in Australia the Asian connection is much stronger.Was there a particular film you had to go the extra mile for to get on your programme?That's a festival director's best kept secret! A number of films are very fresh out of the edit suite and when that happens there's still a lot of thinking going on about release strategy around the world. I was really thrilled to be able to secure our closing night film Saving Mr Banks, which is a world premiere.The one that almost got away is 12 Years Slave. I'm so glad it's there - Steve McQueen's new film is in hot demand around the world and had only just finished in time for Toronto. I was pleased to secure the European premiere for London.What do you say to those who say the LFF is in the shadow of Toronto and Venice film festivals?I think not. Our timing means we have an important role in exposing the great films that have screened in other festivals in the course of the year but have not yet had exposure in the UK, alongside building the profile for films that are gearing up for Bafta and Academy campaigns.We are becoming increasingly important as an entry to Europe for number of significant films. Both our opening and closing night films did not play in either Venice or Toronto.You grew up in a small Australian town with no cinema. How much does that account for the fact you're now running one of the world's biggest film festivals?My usual line is that I've been over-compensating ever since. The passion for movies took me by surprise in my teenage years when I moved to Melbourne to study at university and the journey has been an incredibly exciting one. On a daily basis, it does feel like I'm a long way from Korumburra.How many films do you see in the course of year?I surprised someone the other day when I said it used to be about 800 and now it's down to 500. I've got a great team of internal programme advisers here at London. I had to do a lot more personal viewing in Sydney than I do here.But I loved that response because for most people 500 films is still a hell of a lot of films in one year.The BFI London Film Festival runs from 9-20 October.</body>

      <body>With hundreds of radio stations now broadcasting across the country, it is difficult to imagine how uncrowded the airwaves were 40 years ago. BBC Radio had a domestic monopoly - with no legal commercial competition on UK soil.That all changed on 8 October 1973 with the opening of the first Independent Local Radio station - LBC in London. Capital Radio, also in London, was next - and stations in Glasgow, Birmingham and Manchester soon followed. Within a decade, over 40 stations were on air.Here, as UK commercial radio celebrates a landmark birthday, spend a few minutes on a trip back in time to hear how it all started - and how the foundations of today's digital radio landscape were laid.All copyrights acknowledged.

      <title>Close encounters of the Arab kind</title>
      <description>How centuries-old genre in the Middle East is seeing a revival</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24403002</url>
      <date>1381277035</date>
      <body>Have you ever heard of Alif the Unseen, computer hacker and recipient of an ancient scroll written by mythological spirits?Or Ajwan, a teenager on an intergalactic quest to save her son from the clutches of those who wish to convert him into a super-warrior?Probably you haven't. Possibly you should have. Introducing the rapidly evolving face of Arabic science fiction literature.It is a genre that at times challenges a political reality in countries where even peaceful protest can be a one-way ticket to a lengthy jail term, while at other times helps to explain the otherwise unimaginable splendour of an almighty God.Such is its lure that a recent conference held at the Science Museum's Dana Centre in London was packed with those keen to exchange views on the subject.Rarely has mainstream sci-fi attempted to grapple with the complexities of the Arab world.As Lebanese Canadian sci-fi writer explained, the mainstream sci-fi she grew up with was "very, very white... except for the aliens, of course."Though it might at times have featured characters from ethnic minorities, rarely did it seek to positively engage with other cultures beyond exoticisation or fear-mongering.In fact, "what you tend to get is Western science fiction that is very normative; gender looks remarkably the same and race looks remarkably pale", said Ms Mohtar.It might come as a surprise that one of the first sci-fi novels written was not, in fact, Shelly's Frankenstein or HG Wells' The Time Machine, but the work of 13th Century Baghdad-based writer and physician, Zakariya al-Qazwini.Awaj bin Anfaq is the story of a curious alien who arrives on planet Earth to observe human behaviour and finds himself perplexed by the oddities of this apparently sophisticated species.Neither is Mr Qazwini's work a regional anomaly.There are numerous examples of early Islamic sci-fi or fantasy fiction from the Arab world, not least of course, the fabulous Arabian Nights, replete with flying carpets, mystical jinn and even a little intergalactic travel.The reasons why this fledgling expedition into new literary territory never fully made lift-off remains, of course, unknown.But for Pakistani writer and academic Ziauddin Sardar, it has to do with a change of outlook across the region.As the "golden age" of the Islam drew to a close, so did the optimism and enthusiasm felt by many for the mysteries of the future, he claims.The Islamic world turned to reflect on its glorious past, and to a certain extent, to the West, whose speed of expansion may well have seemed to be the stuff of sci-fi.For Ms Mohtar, the cultural imperialism that resulted from this shift still afflicts her home country today."While I was living in Lebanon in the 1990s, I read very few fairy tales, or the kinds of stories that nourish a child's soul, in Arabic. I read them in French and in English.""I do feel there's been a sort of rupture that this legacy of colonialism has left."Yet despite the great expanse of time that separates the sci-fi of the 13th Century Islamic world from that of modern Arab writers like Amal, in Mr Sardar's opinion, there are certain elements they share."I think there are two things you need before you can have science fiction in a society; one is an appreciation of what science is all about, and the second is some awareness of the future," he said.The Arab world may not know what the future holds, but it is acutely aware of its existence, hurling the region forward at an unprecedented pace.The Arab Spring and its continuing aftershocks are a part of that change, but they represent a mere fragment of a much broader upheaval.As one guest at the conference said: "Having grown up in Egypt, to me we are living in a sci-fi. Thirty years ago we didn't even have electricity in most of Egypt."Is it just a translation of a Western genre - a hamburger spiced with cardamom and rosemary? Unsurprisingly, the panellists didn't think so.For them, Arabic sci-fi is an opportunity to respond to the damaging stereotyping of the "Arab Other" in mainstream sci-fi, as well as a space to explore the complex challenges facing Middle East today."The problems of contemporary Islamic society - the problem of gender, the problems with authoritarianism - all of these are explored very thoroughly in Arab sci-fi. But most importantly of all, it is Arabs reflecting on themselves," said Mr Sardar.Few would argue that Arab sci-fi literature still has a long way to go before it breaks into the mainstream.Often it must wrestle with low budget allowances, political restrictions and audiences increasingly accustomed to televised entertainment.Yet if the buzzing enthusiasm of the sold-out audience at the Dana Centre was anything to go by, Arab sci-fi's place in the future it seeks to understand seems assured.</body>

      <body>The Queen is to begin the baton relay which will visit all 70 competing nations and territories ahead of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.The baton will contain the Queen's hand-written message to the Commonwealth.Unlike the Olympic Torch, there is just one baton and it will visit every country taking part in the Games, which begin on 23 July 2014.The 288-day relay starts from Buckingham Palace in London.It will travel to Scotland on Thursday before heading for its first international port-of-call in India on 11 October.The baton will visit the big Commonwealth countries such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, South Africa, Malaysia, Australia, Kenya, Ghana, Jamaica and Canada.And also smaller destinations, including Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, St Kitts and Nevis and the Falklands Islands.It will not now visit The Gambia, which last week withdrew from the Commonwealth, saying it will "never be a member of any neo-colonial institution".The relay arrives back in the UK in May next year, visiting Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Northern Ireland, Wales and England before a 40-day tour of Scotland in the run-up to the start of the Games.The final relay runner hands the baton, which contains the sealed, hand-written scroll, back to the Queen at the opening ceremony.About 200 invited guests will attend the event to mark the start of the relay, which will involve Commonwealth Games Federation president Prince Tunku Imran and Lord Smith of Kelvin, the chairman of Glasgow's games organising committee.Scottish Olympians Sir Chris Hoy and Allan Wells will take part in a ceremony which will see the Queen beginning the baton relay.Sprint legend Wells, winner of two Commonwealth golds and the 100m Olympic sprint title at the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games, will be the first athlete to receive the baton from the Queen and start it on its journey.He said: "As the final runner of the Queen's Baton Relay (QBR) at the last Commonwealth Games on Scottish soil in Edinburgh in 1986, the baton and what it symbolises is incredibly special for me."It is a real honour for me to now be named as the first baton-bearer for the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games."Sir Chris, a six-time Gold Olympian and double Commonwealth Gold medallist, will escort the baton as it makes the processional journey down the Mall, accompanied by pipers, to the ceremony itself.Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said: "The start of the Queen's Baton Relay, with two of Scotland's greatest-ever athletes, is another step towards what will be a momentous year for Scotland."2014 promises the greatest-ever Games and the relay will provide a fantastic celebration of sport and culture across the Commonwealth, with Glasgow and Scotland at its heart."The baton will spend an average of one to four days in each nation, with an extended duration of seven days in Wales, two weeks in England and 40 days in Scotland.The designers of the baton said the message from the Queen was "pivotal" and they were keen it should not be "hidden away".The baton has a lattice design, made from layers of titanium fused together by laser, which means the message is visible.The parchment, handmade in Glasgow using linen and plant fibre, is also "dramatically" illuminated by LED lights within a transparent cylinder to make the sealed scroll easier to see.The brief for designers stated that the baton should be easily handed from person to person, should weigh no more than 2kg and must be able to withstand all weathers for the 10-month relay.The baton's handle is made of elm wood sourced from the grounds of Garrison House on the Isle of Cumbrae and was constructed using a boatbuilding technique called bird-mouthing, which means it is light, strong and durable.The top of the baton contains a granite "gemstone" which will be detached by opening a puzzle mechanism and given as gift to each nation and territory.The gems are made of water-resistant granite unique to Scotland and were sourced from Ailsa Craig in the Firth of Clyde.Glasgow 2014 will be the 20th Commonwealth Games and will feature 17 sports in 11 days of competition, with 261 medal events.The Commonwealth of Nations has 54 members, but 70 teams participate in the Commonwealth Games because a number of British overseas territories, Crown dependencies and island states compete under their own flag.The UK nations - Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland - compete separately in the Commonwealth Games, as do the smaller home territories such as Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.The first Queen's Baton Relay was staged for the 1958 Commonwealth Games in Cardiff and has been the curtain raiser to the Games ever since.But until 1998, the relay would only travel through England and the host nation.By 2002, in Manchester, it was covering 100,000km and visiting 23 nations.Melbourne 2006 was the first baton relay to visit all the nations which sent teams to the Games.The baton's journey around the globe will be documented by adventurer and broadcaster Mark Beaumont for the BBC.</body>

      <title>Dying man told to take Gaviscon</title>
      <description>A man died after NHS 24 staff failed to spot he was suffering from blood poisoning - and told him to take heartburn remedy Gaviscon.</description>

      <body>A man died after NHS 24 staff failed to spot he was suffering from blood poisoning - and told him to take heartburn remedy Gaviscon.John Willock, 43, made a series of calls to the NHS telephone helpline after becoming ill after falling on ice on Christmas Eve 2009.A sheriff's report into his death found a "number of concerns and shortcomings" in the handling of Mr Willock's case.NHS 24 said it had made several improvements since the case.Mr Willock, a father of two from Erskine in Renfrewshire, had been delivering presents when he fell.He had hurt his knee, was "fluish", cold, shivery and feeling sick - but hid his vomiting and diarrhoea symptoms from his partner and family until Boxing Day because he did not want to spoil their Christmas.With doctors' surgeries closed over the festive period, he made a series of calls to NHS 24.In one recording played to the fatal accident inquiry into his death, training engineer Mr Willock pleaded: "Is there anything anyone could suggest or is there anything I can get for it? I cannot move. I am bed-ridden because of the diarrhoea."When Mr Willock rang for a second time the day before he died, call handler Ann McDermid failed to pass on to a nurse that he had called before.In his report, Sheriff Colin Pettigrew said the cause of Mr Willock's death had been septicaemia, although the source of the infection was uncertain.Sheriff Pettigrew said Ms McDermid had been guilty of "numerous failings."A recorded telephone conversation showed she said to the nurse: "The patient's got burnin' sensation" and "he's got a burning sensation in his chest for about 10 hours" and "an aw the other symptoms, OK?"Nurse Fiona McCulloch, who took over the call, ticked the wrong boxes on her computer diagnostic screen.If she had ticked the one marked "persistent abdominal upper abdominal discomfort" an emergency ambulance would have been sent for Mr Willock.She told him to take Gaviscon and cold milk, later admitting that this was inappropriate for someone suffering from sickness and diarrhoea.Another NHS 24 call handler, Carolyn Fergie, admitted at the inquiry she was "tired" when she took Mr Willock's third call to the helpline.She confessed to being "abrupt", rushing the call and failing to listen to what Mr Willock was telling her.She failed to record on the system that Mr Willock was a "return caller" and that his condition was "serious and urgent".As a result, nurse Pamela Scally treated it as a first call and advised Mr Willock to contact his GP practice within 36 hours.His condition deteriorated on 29 December - without ever having been admitted to hospital - and he died at home at tea-time that night after his partner Carolann Rogers dialled 999.Sheriff Pettigrew's report included the view of a leading infectious diseases expert, who said he believed Mr Willock had a survival chance of between 60% and 85% if he had been seen in hospital on 27 December, the day after he had admitted he was ill.He was visited at home on the day he died by his own GP, Dr Murray Macpherson, who decided the patient was not ill enough for hospital.However, Sheriff Pettigrew said he could find no "reasonable precautions" that may have prevented Mr Willock's death.He said: "There was insufficient evidence led before me to conclude that, even if a GP had visited Mr Willock (prior to the visit of Dr Macpherson) and given him an anti-emetic injection and arranged his admission to hospital, there was a 'real and lively possibility' that... would in any event have made a difference."I find that the correction of the numerous failings of the call handlers and nurse advisors... do not constitute 'reasonable precautions' whereby Mr Willock's death may have been avoided."A spokesman for Mr Willock's family said: "John was loved by his family and is greatly missed. Although the family is disappointed the sheriff did not make specific findings regarding the GPs, the sheriff's findings support the family view that there were significant failings on the part of the call handlers and nurse advisers involved in John's care."While there has been evidence of improvements since John's death, the family hope that NHS 24 further review their practices as suggested by the sheriff so that lessons are learned."NHS 24 medical director Prof George Crooks said: "NHS 24 would like to offer sincere condolences to the family of Mr Willock for their loss."Patient safety is always the guiding principle in the care and advice given by NHS 24 and we have made several improvements to our systems and processes since this case in 2009 in order to further safeguard patients and ensure they receive the most appropriate care."Following this case and the investigations which were carried out into NHS 24's role, all staff involved at that time have been subject to robust review of their practice and appropriate training and support was put in place."These learnings have also been shared across our frontline staff as part of ongoing continuous improvement of their practice."NHS 24 continues to work with our partners to ensure that people in Scotland have access to safe, effective, and appropriate services during the out of hours period."</body>

      <title>Prestwick Airport 'can make profits'</title>
      <description>Prestwick Airport, which is on the brink of being brought into public ownership, can be profitable if the right approach is taken, the deputy first minister says.</description>

      <body>Prestwick Airport can be profitable if the right approach is taken, the deputy first minister has said.The Scottish government announced at Holyrood on Tuesday it was negotiating to buy the airport.The Ayrshire facility, which was put up for sale last March by New Zealand-based owners Infratil, has been running annual losses of £2m.Nicola Sturgeon said she believed that "over time" Prestwick could go "back to profit".A six-weeks timetable of detailed negotiations has now begun with Infratil.Ms Sturgeon told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "We are embarking on commercial negotiations with the current owners of the airport so thing like purchase price for the airport will require to be resolved in terms of he negotiation."The minister defended the government's decision to step in to buy the airport, saying it was the "only realistic alternative to closure".She explained that, once the airport was in public ownership, there would be a detailed business case made which would include levels of investment and a timescale on turning around its fortunes.Ms Sturgeon added: "With the right financial investment, with the right commercial management, the right marketing over a period of time, Prestwick can be brought back into profit."The Scottish government's bid to buy Prestwick comes just months after struggling Cardiff Airport was sold to the Welsh government for £52m.Although publicly owned, Cardiff Airport is being by an "at arm's length" body rather than by the government, and "on a commercial basis".In a ministerial statement to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said the closure of Prestwick would be a "serious and unwelcome development" for the Ayrshire and the Scottish economies, with about 1,400 jobs linked directly or indirectly with the airport.Infratil has agreed to ensure the airport is kept fully open and operational while the negotiation process involving the government is ongoing.The only scheduled passenger airline at Prestwick, Ryanair, welcomed the likely government takeover.</body>

      <title>Stillbirth rate 'poor' says doctor</title>
      <description>More must be done to tackle Scotland's poor record on stillbirths, according to the Scottish government's advise on maternity and women's health.</description>

      <date>1381273847</date>
      <body>More must be done to tackle Scotland's poor record on stillbirths, according to the Scottish government's adviser on maternity and women's health.Dr Catherine Calderwood told BBC Scotland: "Other countries are doing very much better than us."She said: "At the moment one in 200 babies are stillborn in Scotland. Our rate ranks Scotland 31st out of 33 high income countries in the world."Three hundred babies are stillborn every year in Scotland.That is 10 times as many as those who die through cot death.A stillborn child is defined as a baby born dead after 24 weeks gestation.Dr Calderwood said Scotland is about to begin a programme to try to reduce the rate.She said: "We need to make sure women are as healthy as possible before starting a pregnancy."We also know that we can improve things when we're looking after them."We know that small babies are more at risk and so there is various monitoring we can put in place so that we can pick those babies up and hopefully deliver them in time"Gavin Moir and his wife Kirsty lost their first child when Kirsty was 38-and-a-half weeks pregnant.Kirsty mentioned at a routine appointment that she had not felt the baby move much in the last day.An ultrasound test revealed there was no longer a heartbeat."The baby's room was all ready," said Mr Moir."The bags were all packed. To be told that there's nothing there anymore was absolutely devastating for us all. To this day I don't know how we managed to cope."The Take That star and X-Factor judge Gary Barlow and his wife lost a baby daughter as a result of a stillbirth in August last year.Dr Calderwood said that there had been a general assumption that nothing much could be done to reduce the number of stillborn children, but that has now changed.She said: "We have always perhaps believed that some bad things will happen when women are pregnant and we don't want to worry women because most babies will be fine."But in fact evidence from other countries shows us that, far from not being able to do something about it, we know that we actually can."Ann McMurray, Scottish network co-ordinator for the stillbirth charity SANDS, has been working with the Scottish government to increase awareness amongst pregnant women.In particular, it is interested in following the example of Norway which reduced its stillbirth rate by a third by encouraging women to get a check-up if they noticed their baby was not moving.Ms McMurray said: "We've been telling people they should get reduced foetal movements checked out."Also it's just about making people aware that stillbirth does happen because it's not really spoken about at antenatal clinics."It's not that we're scaremongering, because people are told that other things can go wrong."Gavin and Kirsty Moir have had another son but say they do not think they'll ever get over the trauma of their stillborn first child, whom they named Fraser."We still look back and think there could have been more done," said Mr Moir."Kirsty had to go to hospital to have tests on the levels of her waters, which had dropped quite considerably."It's only with hindsight that we're wondering if there was a problem which should have been monitored more closely."</body>

      <title>Higgs boson wins Nobel physics prize</title>
      <description>Peter Higgs and Francois Englert have won the Nobel prize in physics for their work on the theory of the Higgs boson, discovered at Cern in 2012.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24436781</url>
      <date>1381240861</date>
      <body>Two scientists have won the Nobel prize in physics for their work on the theory of the Higgs boson.Peter Higgs, from the UK, and Francois Englert from Belgium, share the prize.In the 1960s, they were among several physicists who proposed a mechanism to explain why the most basic building blocks of the Universe have mass.The mechanism predicts a particle - the Higgs boson - which was finally discovered in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Cern, in Switzerland."This year's prize is about something small that makes all the difference," said Staffan Normark, permanent secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.Prof Higgs is renowned for shying away from the limelight, and he could not be located for interview in the immediate aftermath of the announcement."He's gone on holiday without a phone," his Edinburgh University physics colleague Alan Walker told the BBC, adding that Higgs had also been unwell."He is taking a break from all of this, taking some time to relax, because he knows when he comes back he'll have to face up to a media storm."But the university released a prepared statement from Higgs, 84, who is an emeritus professor of theoretical physics:"I am overwhelmed to receive this award and thank the Royal Swedish Academy," he said."I would also like to congratulate all those who have contributed to the discovery of this new particle and to thank my family, friends and colleagues for their support."I hope this recognition of fundamental science will help raise awareness of the value of blue-sky research."Francois Englert, 80, said he was "very happy" to win the award, speaking at the ceremony via phone link."At first I thought I didn't have [the prize] because I didn't see the announcement," he told the committee, after their news conference was delayed by more than an hour.Higgs was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, but it was in Edinburgh in 1964 that he had his big idea - an explanation of why the matter in the Universe has substance, or mass.His theory involved a missing particle in the Standard Model of physics, which has come to be known as the Higgs boson.Within weeks, Francois Englert had independently published his own, similar theory, alongside his now deceased colleague Robert Brout.Three other physicists - Gerald Guralnik, Tom Kibble and Carl Hagen - also made key contributions to the theory, and spoke at the announcement of the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012.Hagen has long argued for the name of the particle to be changed, protesting at the "rock star" status in which Higgs is held.And Higgs, too, has expressed his discomfort with the attention he has received, preferring to call the particle "the scalar boson".In a statement on Tuesday, Kibble, of Imperial College London, said he was "glad" the Nobel prize had gone to the work of Higgs and Englert."My two collaborators, Gerald Guralnik and Carl Hagen, and I contributed to that discovery, but our paper was unquestionably the last of the three to be published."It is therefore no surprise that the Swedish Academy felt unable to include us, constrained as they are by a self-imposed rule that the prize cannot be shared by more than three people."My sincere congratulations go to the two prize winners, Francois Englert and Peter Higgs."And the renowned physicist Prof Stephen Hawking added his praise: "In the early 60s, theorists were struggling to understand why particles have mass. Peter Higgs and Francois Englert proposed a mechanism called symmetry breaking. This mechanism also predicted a massive particle, the Higgs boson. The discovery last year at Cern of a particle with the correct properties confirms this prediction and is a triumph for theory."Proving the theory correct took almost half a century and involved creating the biggest and most sophisticated machine humankind has ever built.The LHC at Cern lies in a circular tunnel 27km (17 miles) round. It is so big it is partly in Switzerland, partly in France. It took 10 years and thousands of scientists and engineers to build it.Cern director general Rolf Heuer said he was "thrilled" that this year's prize had gone to particle physics."The discovery of the Higgs boson at Cern... marks the culmination of decades of intellectual effort by many people around the world," he commented.The Nobel prizes - which also cover chemistry, medicine, literature, peace and economics - are valued at 8m Swedish krona (£775,000; $1.2m). Laureates also receive a medal and a diploma.The official citation for Englert and Higgs read: "For the theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles, and which recently was confirmed through the discovery of the predicted fundamental particle, by the Atlas and CMS experiments at Cern's Large Hadron Collider".David Willetts, UK minister for universities and science, said the award was "an incredible endorsement of the quality of UK science".Prime Minister David Cameron said: "This brilliant achievement is richly deserved recognition of Peter Higgs' lifetime of dedicated research and his passion for science."It is also a credit to the world-leading British universities in which this research was carried out."It took nearly 50 years and thousands of great minds to discover the Higgs boson after Prof Higgs proposed it, and he and all those people should be extremely proud."</body>

      <title>UK 'best' for defence jobs prospects</title>
      <description>UK Defence Secretary Philip Hammond says thousands of Scottish defence jobs depend on the UK remaining together.</description>

      <date>1381249072</date>
      <body>UK Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said thousands of Scottish defence jobs depended on the UK remaining together.The claim was made to coincide with the latest Coalition paper on independence, titled Scotland analysis: DefenceThe Scottish government proposes a £2.5bn defence force if there is a "yes" in next September's referendum.Scotland's Veterans' Minister Keith Brown said the plan was for a defence force in Scotland growing from 11,000 personnel to 15,000.In a speech to a gathering in Edinburgh, Mr Hammond said the nationalists had created a "high degree of uncertainty with their plans, blighting the futures of thousands of families across Scotland".He added: "By their unwillingness to publish detailed defence proposals, they are doing nothing to dispel those concerns or allay the fears they cause."The Tory minister believed that by taking Scotland out of the integrated British armed forces all parts of the UK would be harmed.Mr Hammond said: "What little the SNP have published of their plans for the defence of an independent Scotland doesn't add up."And it does nothing to suggest that the Scottish people would benefit from anything like the level of security the UK armed forces currently provide, or the level of prosperity that Scotland's defence industry currently delivers."My message to the Scottish Government is simple. The debate on the future of defence in Scotland is too important to be ignored, or brushed under the carpet, or fobbed off with half-baked soundbite policies which are financially and strategically incoherent. The Scottish people deserve facts and answers."The SNP administration at Holyrood is expected to give further details on its defence plans when it publishes a White Paper in November.On Thursday, 18 September next year, the electorate in Scotland will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?"In response the UK government's analysis paper, Mr Brown said Scotland's defence personnel numbers were at an all-time low and that an independent Scotland should have 15,000 regular armed forces with 5,000 reservists.He added: "Some of the people will be employed doing different things. We have a different set of needs, for example we have no capability now in terms of the maritime patrols, we don't have a major Royal Navy surface vessel in Scotland any more."We no longer have the patrol that we should have for Nato purposes and otherwise on the northern flank of Scotland or in the air, so we would have different requirements, there is no doubt about that."The UK government's 86-page analysis paper was published after MPs on the Commons Defence Committee said it would be "remiss" of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) not to consider the implications of independence, including the future of Trident at the Faslane base.The document focussed on funding, jobs and the problems involved in splitting up an integrated military.The report concluded that the transition to an independent force would be complex.One extract from the analysis says: "Adapting the functions of Scotland's defence footprint would result in a substantial burden on the public finances of an independent Scottish state during establishment, and duplication of costs thereafter for the essential services currently provided on a UK-wide basis."It is difficult to predict how long the establishment phase would last, but given the complex, integrated nature of the UK armed forces and the absence of command and control structures and other essential components in Scotland, this would not be an easy process."Even basic re-design of military bases is a costly undertaking requiring substantial investment to cater for different operational needs."It added that negotiations over assets and liabilities such as equipment, basing and other infrastructure "would be difficult".The report also said that the issue of personnel would present an "extremely difficult challenge to overcome".However, the MoD said picking the UK military apart "would not be impossible".A Scottish government spokesman said he welcomed the "important acknowledgement" from the UK government that an independent Scotland would stand to "inherit a fair share of current UK defence assets".He added: "An independent Scotland will have first-class conventional forces which will play a full role in defending the country and co-operating with international partners - but we will not waste billions of pounds on Trident nuclear weapons."We have also been clear that we will retain all current defence bases, including Faslane, which will be Scotland's main conventional naval facility, and our long-term commitment will ensure continued support for jobs and local economies in all the communities around Scotland that are home to military bases."Meanwhile, the BBC has seen an internal Ministry of Defence (MoD) briefing document on Scottish independence.It raised concerns about the effect a "yes" vote would have on England, Wales and Northern Ireland, saying the debate matters because of the potential effect of Scottish independence on "our politics, our economy, our standing" - referring to the rest of UK.The document also suggested that about 500,000 votes could "swing the result" of the referendum "either way".</body>

      <title>Jobs boost as EnerMech seeks growth</title>
      <description>Mechanical engineering group EnerMech announces plans to create up to 700 new jobs, after securing a £90m funding package.</description>

      <body>Scottish mechanical engineering group EnerMech has announced plans to create up to 700 new jobs over the next year, after securing a £90m funding package from a trio of banks.The funds will be used to invest in new equipment and facilities and in growing its workforce from 1,800 to 2,500.About 200 of the jobs will be based in the UK, including 150 in Aberdeen.The rest will be spread between the Asia Pacific region, the Middle East, Africa and Norway.The move is part of a global push by the company, which aims to boost revenues to £280m in 2014.Aberdeen-based EnerMech said Norwegian bank DNB and HSBC had joined with original lender Bank of Scotland to form a "banking club", which would support the company's growth plans by consolidating its overseas banking arrangements.The firm operates in 30 locations around the world.Bank of Scotland will remain the lead bank and has refinanced a £60m package as part of the new arrangement.The funding move follows an increased investment earlier this year by private equity firm Lime Rock Partners.The investment supported EnerMech's acquisitions of UK-based pump equipment specialist Total Reclaim Systems and Australian firm Vicon Services, which specialises in high pressure water-jetting, coating systems and chemical services.To date, EnerMech has invested £30m on acquisitions and £80m on organic growth. It has put aside a further £15m for future acquisitions.EnerMech finance director Michael Buchan said: "The size and international reach of our operation means we have now outgrown a single bank."By establishing a banking club we have a dual advantage of pooling the funds necessary to facilitate our projected growth and can also call on a wealth of global financing expertise."He added: "This investment and the continued support or our original equity partner, Lime Rock, demonstrates the increased financial strength of EnerMech as it continues to grow both in the UK and international oil and gas sectors."</body>

      <body>A woman has told how she confronted an Aberdeen charity boss because of his "wandering hands".The woman - who cannot be named - claimed that former policeman Ian Paterson, 62, touched her inappropriately on a regular basis.The 35-year-old said she called the then chief executive of Aberdeen Council of Voluntary Organisations "Pervy Paterson".Mr Paterson denies indecency charges at Aberdeen Sheriff Court.Giving evidence, the woman told the court that Mr Paterson, of Tarves, Aberdeenshire, began massaging her about six months after she met him, when she complained about being stressed.She said: "I thought it was inappropriate but I didn't feel uncomfortable with it. I just felt he was being nice to be honest."I feel that his hands came far too down the front on that first occasion."The woman said the charity boss also "jiggled up" against her when she was standing at a photocopier.She said he would ask her about her sex life and described him as being "like a moth to a flame".The alleged victim became tearful as she told the court that she wanted him to stop doing it.The woman said she confronted Mr Paterson after he put his hand on her thigh at a Christmas party held for charity workers in Aberdeen.The court heard the woman complained about the alleged incident the next time she saw Mr Paterson.She said: "I said I was sick of the wandering hands. I didn't get much reaction at all. He kind of denied it. He said he was trying to comfort me."Defence lawyer David Moggach asked whether the woman had touched his client at all during the times they were in each other's company.She replied: "I've given him cuddles at the start. But it has never been sexual or inappropriate, no."Mr Moggach asked: "Would you accept that Mr Paterson was someone of a friendly nature and a touchy-feely sort of bloke?"She replied: "Yes."Mr Moggach asked: "And he would put his hand on your back or something like that when he was speaking to you?"She replied: "Yes. He shouldn't be putting his hand on my knee and speaking about sex."The trial continues.</body>

      <body>A man who caused a two-car crash during an overtaking manoeuvre has been convicted of causing the death of a father-of-four by dangerous driving.Paul Stewart overtook a car on a blind bend on the B743 Prestwick to Strathaven road on 11 February 2012.The 22-year-old's Renault Clio narrowly avoided hitting a bus but then spin out of control and hit a works van driven by Robert McPike.The 52-year-old, from Tarbolton, later died in hospital.The High Court in Glasgow heard that Stewart, from Mossblown, Ayr, was trapped in his car following the crash.He was heard screaming: "I'm dying, I'm dying" and also: "Oh what have I done."Eyewitness Lisanne Graham, a company director, who was driving in front of Stewart's car said she was intimidated by the way he was driving so close to her.She added: "He shouldn't have taken the corner like that."Advocate depute Bill McVicar, prosecuting, in his closing speech to the jury, said: "It was folly to take the blind corner on the wrong side and it amounts to dangerous driving."Stewart denied causing death by dangerous driving and did not give evidence.His defence counsel Gavin Anderson told the jury that the sporty Clio, which his client had bought four days earlier, had faulty brakes and a shock absorber and this may have contributed to the accident.The court heard that Stewart, who worked at a recycling plant, was badly injured in the crash and had to undergo an operation on his leg.Mr Anderson said that Stewart lost his job at the recycling plant which involved manual labour, as a result of the injuries he received in the crash.Judge Norman Ritchie QC deferred sentence on first offender Stewart until later this month.He told Stewart: "I am prepared to give you bail, but you are disqualified from this point from driving."</body>

      <body>A rare egg of an endangered bird from India has been discovered at the University of Aberdeen, and it is hoped it could help save the species.The breeding habits of the Jerdon's Courser are mysterious.DNA analysis was used to identify the egg as belonging to the bird, after it was unearthed within an old collection at the institution's zoology museum.It is now hoped the discovery could help conservationists working to save the species in India.Dr Alan Knox, the university's emeritus head of museums who found the egg among a collection dating back to the 1900s, said: "I was looking through drawers of uncatalogued eggs when I spotted an egg labelled as belonging to this species."It was one of those eureka moments - finding something nobody else knows about, something so rare and exciting. I could hardly believe my eyes."My first question was how do you identify something that the books say has never been discovered?"He continued: "Very little is actually known about this extremely rare bird which inhabits an area only a few kilometres wide."It was seen only a few times in southern India before it was presumed extinct around 1900. It was rediscovered in 1986 but is listed as a critically endangered species."Without any others to compare it with, the process of correctly identifying the egg was a challenge."Dr Knox took the egg to the Natural History Museum in Tring, Hertfordshire, and the identification was confirmed after DNA was extracted from dried-up membrane scraped from the inside of the egg.He added: "We are hoping the discovery will help conservationists working to save the species in India."</body>

      <body>Tram testing is due to start in Edinburgh between the depot at Gogar and Edinburgh Park Station.Pedestrians and drivers are being warned to take extra care on the roads at the points where the trams will cross.The test programme will build up gradually but eventually there will be more than 150 tram journeys a day along the line.The tests will continue until the service begins next year.The programme will allow the tram operators to carry out vital safety checks and will also give the public a chance to get used to seeing trams running on the city's streets.The council is warning people to take care, as the trams move quickly and quietly, and are wider than the tracks they run on.The test journeys will cross the road at two locations, Lochside Avenue and South Gyle Broadway.Cllr Lesley Hinds, the city's transport convener, said: "This is another significant step in the tram project and moves us closer towards completion."It will take some time for people to get used to seeing trams running on street and both pedestrians and drivers will need to take extra care while everyone becomes familiar with them."I've seen firsthand in Dublin how trams interact with traffic and as progress continues to be made along the route, it'll be important that people are aware of the differences."The tram service is due to be up and running for passengers in May 2014.Cllr Hinds added: "We'll bring this forward if we can."However, it's important to recognise the significance of this testing, commissioning and driver training programme. There is much to be done and it's vital that all the appropriate tests and checks are made."</body>

      <body>A newborn seal pup has been rescued by workmen after he fell into the sea at North Queensferry in Fife.Less than a week old and still fully furred, the male grey seal pup was spotted lying on rocks by men working on the new Forth Road crossing.As the men approached the pup he fell off the rocks and into the water.Grey seal pups cannot swim well until they have lost all their fur so the workmen fished the pup out of the water and called the Scottish SPCA.Animal rescue officer Joanna McDaid took the seal to the charity's national wildlife rescue centre at Fishcross, Alloa, where he is now receiving treatment and care. Staff have named him Tiller.Centre manager Colin Seddon said: "Tiller is our first grey seal pup of the season and he's quite unusual in that he was found in an area that is not a known pupping ground."He could have been washed off the established pupping ground at nearby Inchkeith Island or his mother may have been young and inexperienced."It sounds as though he took fright when he was approached and slid off the rocks and into the water which is bad news for a newborn seal pup as their thick fur coats act like a sponge and absorb water so he's unlikely to have survived on his own for long."Thankfully, the men scooped him out of the sea and called us for help."He added: "He's being tube-fed fish soup at the moment and that will continue for the next few weeks until he's old enough and strong enough to feed himself."The Scottish SPCA is now urging members of the public to contact its animal helpline if they see a distressed seal pup lying on the shore this winter, adding that they could be doing more harm than good by approaching or picking it up.</body>

      <body>Two men have been jailed for robbing a travel agent in North Ayrshire before embarking on a lavish spending spree.Connor Fitzpatrick, 20, and 19-year-old Jordan Honeyman admitted threatening staff and raiding the Thomas Cook store in Saltcoats on 24 August 2012.The High Court in Glasgow heard they were caught after boasting about spending their £23,000 haul.Judge Lord Bracadale jailed Fitzpatrick for four years while Honeyman was sentenced to 40 months imprisonment.The court heard that both men, who were 18 at the time, targeted the busy Bureau de Change area of the Thomas Cook store in Dockhead Street, Saltcoats, at about 17:00.The pair, who were wearing motorcycle helmets and armed with batons, ordered staff and customers not to use their phones before herding them towards the back of the shop.The court was told they forgot about one woman - who managed to escape and raise the alarm.A worker at the Bureau de Change was then told to fill a bag with money.Fitzpatrick and Honeyman were then caught on CCTV getting back on their bike and racing away from the scene.Police were initially were unable to trace the pair but later became aware they were making boasts and spending lavishly on clothes and hotel stays.Honeyman travelled to Ayr where he spent almost £400 on designer clothes and shoes.He then paid £120 to take a bunch of friends go-karting.Honeyman and Fitzpatrick then spent time at the £200-a-night Indigo Hotel in Glasgow city centre.During their stay they also spent cash on more designer clothes, with hotel staff at one point finding a room crammed with boxes of new trainers.The pair later checked in at two hotels in Kilmarnock for further nights away before they were arrested by police.Jailing the pair, Lord Bracadale told them: "This must have been a very frightening experience for those concerned."He also ordered that Fitzpatrick will be supervised for a further two years on his release.</body>

      <body>An ex-BBC DJ accused of sex offences against boys has told a court: "I only ever sought to enhance their lives."Former BBC Radio Norfolk and Radio Clyde presenter Michael Souter, 60, denies 19 sex attacks on seven boys aged 11 to 16.Mr Souter also denies nine counts of making and possessing indecent images of under-18s.Norwich Crown Court has been told Mr Souter was a "sexual deviant" obsessed with young boys in shorts and uniform.Mr Souter, of Loddon, Norfolk. was a leader in the Scout Association and was also involved in a Norfolk County Council youth mentoring scheme.He is alleged to have carried out the attacks between 1979 and 1999.Asked by his barrister Andrew Hill whether he had abused any boy, he said: "I only ever sought to enhance their lives."Mr Hill asked again: "Have you every abused any of them?"Mr Souter replied: "No."He previously told the jury he had a fetish for shorts, uniforms and spanking but that any activities only took place between consenting adults.Describing a spanking website he had used, he told jurors all images on it were "perfectly decent".A childhood friend of one of Mr Souter's alleged victims told the court about a telephone call he received when he was about 15 or 16.It was his friend, he said, telling him he had been abused by Mr Souter and asking him to make a statement to the police.He said his friend called again several days later, this time claiming he had made the allegations up."I felt, as a 16-year-old kid, just betrayed," he said."I was willing to make a statement for him and he said within a few days that he had made it up."Andrew Hill, defending, pointed out Mr Souter and asked the man if he had ever spoken to or had contact with him."No," he replied.Cross-examining him, Andrew Shaw, prosecuting, said a police statement showed the man did speak to police in 1993, telling them his friend had told him about the abuse allegations in person, not on the phone.The man said he did not remember."You have no way of knowing if he was telling the truth when he said he was abused, and no way of knowing that he was telling the truth when he said he made it up," said Mr Shaw."No, I don't," said the man.The trial continues.</body>

      <body>Artworks jumping out of their frames, a body artist who will paint art onto your fingernails and a gallery in which food and art are offered in equal measures.These are just some of the innovative art exhibitions on the agenda for next year's Glasgow International.The biennial festival has expanded dramatically since it first began six years ago.The already burgeoning art scene (much of it already known internationally) is augmented by artists from as far afield as Canada, Puerto Rico, Palestine and Brazil.This year's 18-day programme will include the first major solo show in an institution for Serbian artist Aleksandra Domanovic (in the Gallery of Modern Art - Goma), while British artist Simon Martin will produce a series of works responding to the collection in Kelvingrove Museum.Glasgow-based artist Sue Tompkins will create an exhibition and performance in Goma, inspired by concrete poetry and typewriter art, while body artist Alistair Frost will showcase new paintings alongside a functioning nail bar where he will paint his work onto visitors' nails.Meanwhile, the studio warehouse SWG3 will host a group exhibition that features artworks which jump out of their frames.Elsewhere, there will be shows featuring work by 80 artists, among them Bedwyr Williams, Jordan Wolfson, Michael Stumpf, Avery Singer, Anthea Hamilton and Nicholas Byrne.Most of what is on display will be new, or not shown previously in the UK.It is the first festival under new director Sarah McCrory, who previously curated events at the Frieze Art Fair, including a number for the cultural side of the Olympics.In Glasgow, she will offer a similar strand as part of the Commonwealth Games cultural programme. Among them, a new public artwork for a disused site near the Emirates Arena.Making the Most of Dalmarnock will involve architects, artists and the local community in making a work of art and an outdoor learning and play area.Further details of the programme for the 2014 Glasgow International - which begins on 4 April 2014 - will be announced early next year.</body>

      <body>Preparations are under way to ensure drivers are kept moving on Scotland's roads this winter.Almost 200 vehicles are available for spreading salt and ploughing trunk roads in the event of ice and snow, transport minister Keith Brown said.Salt stocks have been maintained and supplies of specialist de-icers which work in even lower temperatures have been increased.There are also additional frontline and patrol vehicles available.A dedicated adviser from the Met Office has also been installed at the National Traffic Scotland control centre in South Queensferry, West Lothian, which opened earlier this year.The public will be kept up to date with information on road conditions via the Traffic Scotland website and social media sites.Weather stations are now located across the country and mobile sensors are fitted to operational vehicles to feed back data on road temperatures and conditions.They will be used by the road-operating companies to decide when routes need to be treated.Speaking during a tour of the control centre, Mr Brown said: "Last winter, the Met Office issued 169 severe weather warnings for Scotland and that gives an indication of some of the challenges that we could face during the next few months."Our trunk roads play a vital part in our daily lives and that doesn't change with the seasons, so Transport Scotland and our road-operating companies do everything we can to keep the country moving, even during the most testing of conditions."Our new national control centre means that our response to major incidents like severe storms will be better co-ordinated under one roof with experts from all across the transport network working alongside each other."</body>

      <body>An Inverness-shire man has been named the world's best porridge maker for the second time in three years.John Boa took the prize at the 20th Annual Golden Spurtle World Porridge Making Championships in Carrbridge, Inverness-shire.The trophy goes to the maker of the best traditional porridge using only oatmeal, salt and water.Mr Boa told BBC Scotland his win was "a little overwhelming".He said this was only the third time he had entered the competition. He also won in 2011."I'm very proud and privileged. And it does make it a little bit special that it's a landmark year for the competition," he added.Mr Boa, who formerly lived in Edinburgh but now lives on Skye, said the trick to producing a world-class porridge was to "keep stirring", using a spurtle - a rod-shaped tool, traditionally used to stir porridge.He also said adding the salt was "always a key moment"."You have to make sure you don't oversalt or undersalt," he said. "It has to be just right."This year the speciality award was won by London-based Nick Barnard for his recipe for fruity date porridge, which used dried apricots, dates, apples and cinnamon.Past recipes in the speciality section have included the use of curry powder, sausages and seafood.</body>

      <title>Council confronts green goal shift</title>
      <description>How one of the few councils in the UK to provide one wheelie bin per household for domestic rubbish is adapting to a change in waste legislation.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-24380310</url>
      <date>1381191152</date>
      <body>Dumfries and Galloway Council is pretty unusual among UK local authorities - it provides just one wheelie bin per household.An Eco Deco facility, officially opened in 2007, allowed the region to move to single-bin collections.However, new regulations mean separate bins are being reintroduced and two new processing facilities are being built.MSPs have criticised the costs involved but the local authority insists it is a chance to make services "even better".Dumfries and Galloway Council signed a 25-year waste management Private Finance Initiative deal with Shanks Waste Management in 2004.The total Scottish executive commitment to the project over its duration was reported as more than £110m.The plant officially opened in late 2007, claiming to be the first of its kind in Scotland.It takes waste and breaks it down into five re-usable components - eliminating the need for homeowners to separate their own rubbish.Indeed, a 2011 study found the council was one of just two in the UK able to collect a single bin.But new rules mean a "fundamental change" is now needed.The Waste (Scotland) Regulations 2012 require the separate collection of paper, card, glass, metals and plastics for recycling - as well as food waste in most urban areas.It means that from one wheelie bin the local authority will start next year in rolling out five separate recycling containers to homes.It will cost almost £4m to implement, including the purchase of new collection vehicles and household bins.It will also see running costs of the service increase and two new waste management centres opened in Dumfries and Stranraer at a price of some £20m.Director of planning and environment services, Alistair Speedie, admitted it was a "fundamental change" but one the council would grasp "with both hands".He said the waste PFI contract had been "extremely successful" over nearly 10 years in operation."We have gone from diverting 5% of our waste away from landfill to now up to 66% so that has been a huge improvement," he said.Recycling rates have also gone from 4% to 21%."What has happened now is that the legislation has changed," he said."That legislation dictates that we have to collect our waste in a different manner."It is one of those things," he added. "It is no big deal. Legislation changes in all the services that we provide in the council regularly - for improvement, to better ourselves and to look after the environment - for all the right reasons."He added that the costs would not put pressure on council budgets with the Scottish government providing support to buy the bins and vehicles involved."How we pay for the rest of the infrastructure is quite simple - it is on a spend to save basis," he said."By diverting more and more waste away from landfill we will save a massive amount in landfill tax so that is what will pay for it."So there is no budget pressure on the council."He stressed, also, that the Eco Deco plant remained relevant despite the move away from single bin collection."The plant itself, Eco Deco, will still play a really important part in our whole system," he said."It is not that the plant is prejudiced in any way - the plant is there as the rock that we are building everything else on and it always will be."There has, however, been political concern about the costs involved in making the change.Conservative MSP for Galloway and West Dumfries Alex Fergusson said he had been "horrified" by a "reinterpretation" of environmental values which meant kerbside recycling would have to return."The extra expense is massive," he said."I understand that council officials expect only around a 40% compliance with the new system, and I wonder where all these bins are going to sit on some of our pavements."He said he did not believe the whole situation had been handled well."This has all cost the council tax payers an exorbitant amount of unnecessary money, but it has been brought about by the Scottish government's inflexible interpretation of EU rules," he said.Lib Dem counterpart Jim Hume has also criticised the situation.He accused the Scottish government of "running roughshod" over local decision-making and "forcing the council's hand" into making another change."The council will now incur £24.5m capital costs at waste management centres, nearly £4m capital costs of new waste trucks and multiple bins, and not to mention an estimated yearly shortfall in revenue costs of £422,000 from 2015-16," he said."How Dumfries and Galloway meets its recycling targets in the future will depend largely on the public information campaign running alongside the new arrangements"But I fear this change has already met with huge public opposition and efforts to engage communities will have to be immense for the region to meet its targets; another costly exercise for the council to bear."Labour environment spokesman on Dumfries and Galloway Council, Colin Smyth, said his party had consistently made clear that dependence on the Eco Deco plant "was never likely to be acceptable to the Scottish government"."That is why we opposed the move to close recycling sites and scrap the doorstep 'blue box' recycling scheme three years ago but we were overruled by Tory and SNP councillors," he said."It's a bit rich of those same parties to now claim the council are the innocent victim of a change in legislation."They were warned this was always likely to be the government's direction of travel but they buried their head in the sand and hoped it wouldn't happen."He said the council should have been building up recycling alongside the use of the Eco Deco plant.He said the U-turn was now going to cost the "hard pressed taxpayer a fortune".A Scottish government spokesman defended the goals it has set for councils."The Scottish government's Zero Waste Plan is one of the most ambitious waste policies in Europe," he said."Under that plan we now have measures that will significantly increase the recycling and reprocessing of key materials and in doing so reduce demand on primary resources and deliver new economic opportunities for Scotland."It is for local authorities to decide how they deliver services to meet these requirements."He said that support was available to help councils meet their targets."Greater recycling levels will deliver economic and environmental benefits to Scotland and overall savings to local authorities," he said."All councils in Scotland are working towards delivering these requirements and they can access funding and support from Zero Waste Scotland to help implement any changes required."A Zero Waste Scotland statement said it had supported the council to "review its recycling services and to implement changes needed to ensure it complies with new waste regulations"."The regulations are designed to maximise high quality recycling, which is about securing the best outcomes for the economy and the environment," it said."By introducing separate recycling collections the council is maximising the potential to create jobs and economic benefits from the materials people throw away."Most people want to do the right thing by recycling and it's important that people get behind these new services and support high-quality recycling."Shanks declined the opportunity to comment on the issue.As for homeowners, they will start to see the effects from next year as the new bin provision is rolled out across the region.</body>

      <body>Police officers were twice warned about a drink-driver before a crash which left a pedestrian with serious injuries, an investigation has found.The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC) said officers failed to carry out checks despite the alarm being raised in the hours before the accident in Forfar in June.The Tayside Division officers were also using out-of-date intelligence systems.Police Scotland said any concerns would be addressed.The force had asked the PIRC to investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident on 1 June, in which a 30-year-old woman was seriously injured.The driver involved in the crash was arrested and admitted various road traffic offences, including driving while under the influence of drink or drugs.Police officers had twice been provided with information by a member of the public about the man's fitness to drive.The commissioner, Professor John McNeill, said the officers did not obtain enough information, and did not circulate correct information.In addition, they did not carry out intelligence checks on the national police Scottish Intelligence Database which would have provided information that may have helped them stop and arrest the driver before the crash.The investigation also revealed that Tayside Division staff were accessing an old intelligence system which included out-of-date information.Professor McNeill said: "My investigation has revealed a number of areas of concern in relation to how Police Scotland handled this incident."There are clearly lessons to be learned by individual officers, but there are wider issues that should be addressed - specifically in relation to the use of out-of-date intelligence systems by Tayside Division."Police Scotland said: "We will consider the findings carefully and make sure that any concerns are addressed.''</body>

      <title>Union 'fiddling while Rome burns'</title>
      <description>Ineos accuses the Unite union at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant of "fiddling while Rome burns".</description>

      <body>Ineos has accused unions at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant of "fiddling while Rome burns".Workers have started an overtime ban and work to rule in a dispute centred on the treatment of a union convener.Unite the Union has called for an emergency summit and parliamentary debate in a bid to avert strikes.Ineos has warned the Grangemouth facility will close by 2017 if it does not find savings and fresh investment.It said the site had lost more than £150m over the past four years.Finance Secretary John Swinney said the Scottish government would make all efforts to bring both sides together to help resolve the dispute, and get to a position of financial sustainability for the plant.Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme he said: "We have been talking to the company about how we might be able to invest to support the development of the plant."We can only make investment if there is a viable business proposition and that's where we need to have all parties working together to support a proposition that can deliver the employment and the opportunities that we want to see for the plant in Grangemouth, because of its very wider significance for the Scottish economy."Unite workers voted for the industrial action in support of Unite convener Stevie Deans.He was suspended, then reinstated, by the company over allegations linked to his involvement in the row over the selection of a Labour candidate in Falkirk, where he is chairman of the local constituency party.Mr Deans faces an investigation by Ineos over issues linked to the Falkirk row.Unite have accused Ineos of trying to "provoke" a strike, which it warned would be "hugely damaging" to the UK economy.A previous three-day stoppage at the site in 2008 was said to have cost hundreds of millions of pounds in lost production and other knock-on effects.Workers have voted heavily in favour of action up to and including a strike - and Unite officials said they had not ruled out calling for a walkout.Pat Rafferty, the union's Scottish regional secretary, said the company was using the Stevie Deans dispute as an excuse to introduce sweeping reforms, including pension changes, job losses, an end to collective bargaining and worse pay and conditions for new employees.Unite called for a summit with the company and politicians, and urged the Scottish government to hold an emergency debate to help prevent the dispute escalating."The company is holding Stevie Deans hostage, and playing Russian roulette with fuel supplies," Mr Rafferty said."The changes being proposed are completely unpalatable to us and we feel we are being pushed into taking strike action."We are trying to make the company see sense, but we are not ruling anything out at this stage."Unite said the work to rule and overtime ban would slow down maintenance work at Grangemouth, which is split into refinery and petrochemical operations.Ineos has put forward a survival plan and has asked the Scottish and UK governments for grants and loan guarantees totalling £150m.Chairman Calum MacLean has warned "there is no plan B".Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland, Tom Crotty, group director with Ineos, said: "We have got a survival plan. We haven't been sitting on our hands wailing about it, we are doing something about it."What we can do is invest in new terminal facilities that will allow us to bring gas in from the US to replace the gas from the North Sea."But to do that we will have to put another £300m into a site that is losing £10m a month, and we will not do that unless we can sort out this cost base."He added: "While this crucial issue is facing us, which will close the site before 2017 unless something is done, Unite are ignoring it and focusing on this issue about Steven Deans."It is frankly fiddling while Rome burns."On Sunday, the company announced that one of its key customers in Hull, which traditionally took up to 100,000 tonnes of product from Grangemouth, had been forced to close down.The Ineos Vinyl Acetate Monomer (Vam) facility at Saltend said that low cost imports into Europe had made closure inevitable.Mr MacLean said: "Unfortunately the closure of this world-scale Vam unit at the Hull site has a significant knock-on effect at Grangemouth as we lose a major customer for good."</body>

      <body>The number of "malicious" calls to the fire service in Scotland has reduced to less than 5% of the total number of false alarms, according to new figures.Provisional statistics for the year to the end of March, show there were 47,043 false alarms but the majority were down to faulty equipment.There were 2,299 malicious calls, down from 6,877 a decade ago.Figures showed 46 fire deaths in 2012-13 - a decrease of 14 (23 %) on the revised figure of 60 for 2011-12.This is the joint lowest figure in 10 years.However, a rate of 8.7 fire deaths per million of the population remains much higher than England and Wales (5.1 and 5.5 per million).The most common way a fatal fire started was "smokers' materials and matches", which accounted for 17 deaths.In 2012-13, the total number of fires in Scotland was 26,613, down 18% on the previous year.Provisionally there were 1,311 non-fatal fire casualties, down 7%.About 60% of these fires involved cooking appliances.Scotland's eight regional fire and rescue services merged on 1 April to become the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service.The statistics cover the year to the date of the merger.The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said the drop in the number of malicious calls was partly because fire services were now challenging people making that type of call.It was also engaging in community youth programmes to show young people of the dangers of diverting firefighters from genuine emergencies.Community Safety Minister Roseanna Cunningham said: "While we know that statistics based on small numbers can fluctuate over time the positive downward trend is undoubtedly testament to the hard work of the fire and rescue services in Scotland and their continued focus on prevention."</body>

      <description>There has been a substantial rise in the number of students starting courses at Scottish universities, according to university admissions agency Ucas.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-24226624</url>
      <date>1380022443</date>
      <body>There has been a substantial rise in the number of students starting courses at Scottish universities.Figures from the university admissions agency Ucas indicated nearly 37,400 students were starting courses at Scotland's 19 universities.This represented a rise of nearly 700 on last year.There was an increase in the number of students from Scotland, England and Northern Ireland - but a drop in the number from other EU countries.The number of Scottish students was up by 430 to a record high of 27,990.The total number from other parts of the UK rose by 450. This was mostly because of a rise of about 350 in the number of students from England, while the number from Northern Ireland recovered after a drop last year.But there was a drop of around 100 in the number of students from other EU countries.The figures could help disprove claims Scottish universities would be flooded by undergraduates from other parts of the UK to the detriment of Scots.Scottish students do not pay tuition fees so a fixed number of places are available, paid for by the Scottish Funding Council. Under European law, these places are also open to citizens of EU counties outside the United Kingdom.But universities can decide for themselves how many students from England, Wales or Northern Ireland - who have to pay tuition fees of up to £9,000 a year - to admit.Universities have previously denied claims that Scots were being deprived of places in order to allow fee-paying students from the rest of the UK to get in.The figures confirmed that a greater number of funded places are available for Scottish and EU students - and that more of them are going to Scots.27,790 Scots gained a place at a Scottish university this year, compared to 27,550 last year and 27,230 the year before. The number of students from EU countries fell 170 to 4,110.The number of students from England accepted by Scottish universities rose by 350 to 4,180, while the number from Wales slipped slightly to 110.The number from Northern Ireland rose by 100 to 1,020 after a drop last year - but this year's figure is in line with 2010 and 2011.The figures do not distinguish between students who were offered places through the clearing system in August - designed to help find places for those who do not get the qualifications they had hoped for - and those who had already won their place or got the exam results they needed.Some parents and would-be students have expressed frustration that some courses were not considering applications through the clearing system from Scots but would look at applications from other parts of the UK.Universities say this was because they had already filled most of the places available to Scots and were adamant Scots were not being refused places to allow fee-paying students from the rest of the UK to get in.</body>

      <title>New drug approval process revamped</title>

      <body>More people will soon have access to new and expensive medicines, according to the Scottish government.Health Secretary Alex Neil has told the Scottish Medicines Consortium to be more flexible when evaluating drugs.Mr Neil said there should be a new approach for medicines to be used in end-of-life care and for treating very rare conditions.The changes are the first step in a wider process which will look at how medicines are evaluated.Mr Neil's announcement came on the day a new treatment for lung cancer was approved by the SMC but a breast cancer drug will not routinely be made available in the NHS in Scotland.The decision to accept the drug crizotinib, which could be an alternative to chemotherapy for some lung cancer patients, means Scotland is currently the only part of the UK to approve the drug for use on the NHS.But at the same time the SMC ruled that new breast cancer drug - Perjeta - will not be recommended for use.Drugs manufacturer Roche said patients with the HER2 positive breast cancer taking Perjeta lived on average just over six months longer without their disease getting worse than those treated with Herceptin or chemotherapy alone.The Scottish government, which has no direct involvement in SMC decisions, is keen to make the process more transparent.Announcing his plans to revamp the system, Mr Neil extended a special fund to pay for new medicines until 2016.He also created a new approval system for doctors who want to prescribe drugs which are not routinely available.Mr Neil said: "It is only right that Scottish patients have access to medicines that are clinically justified."We have listened carefully to patients, charities and consultants and put in place a comprehensive range of measures which will increase access to new medicines and make the system better and more open for patients."Professor Angela Timoney, chair of the Scottish Medicines Consortium, said: "We share the Scottish government's objective of increasing access to new medicines for patients in Scotland."</body>

      <date>1381190817</date>
      <body>A lack of available properties and "burgeoning" demand among buyers has forced house prices up in Scotland, according to a monthly survey.The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) found house prices increased in September.Last month, 32% more respondents reported prices rises rather than falls in the Rics survey.A net balance of 78% more surveyors also reported an increase in new-buyer inquiries.However, Rics said the lack of homes coming onto the market resulted in the number of new instructions failing to keep pace with the "burgeoning" level of demand.Looking ahead, more than half of those surveyed expected prices to continue to rise in the next three months.Responding to the latest survey, Rics director Sarah Speirs said: "It's encouraging that the market is starting to improve in all parts of the country, with more buyers looking to make a move and more sales going through."Even so, it's a big concern that the supply of property coming to the market is lagging so far behind demand, particularly with the recent launch of Help to Buy in Scotland."This imbalance is likely to result in further upward pressure in prices over the coming months, particularly in popular areas."The report comes as it was revealed that house prices in and around Aberdeen have more than doubled in the last decade.Data from the Nationwide Building Society showed that the increase is only matched by Islington and Westminster in London.The growth in the north east has been largely put down to the expanding oil and gas industry and the workers it attracts to the area.</body>

      <title>IMF cuts global growth forecast</title>
      <description>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has trimmed its forecast for global economic growth at the same time as lifting its UK growth projection.</description>

      <date>1381259442</date>
      <body>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has trimmed its forecast for global economic growth at the same time as lifting its UK growth projection.It now expects global growth of 2.9% this year, a cut of 0.3% from July's estimate. In 2014 it expects global growth of 3.6%, down 0.2%.It cited weakness in emerging economies for the cut.The forecast for UK growth this year received a significant upgrade to 1.4%, up from July's estimate of 0.9%.And for next year the IMF expects UK growth of 1.9%, up from July's projection of 1.5%.The IMF's upgrades for its outlook on the UK are larger than those it made for any other country in its World Economic Outlook - its twice-yearly assessment of the global economy.It credited recent data indicating higher consumer and business confidence, for the increase.However, it warned that it would still take years for the UK economy to recover fully from the 2008 financial crisis. It suggested that the government could help boost growth by bringing forward planned public infrastructure spending, such as building new homes.The UK Treasury said the IMF upgrade showed the government's economic strategy was working."But risks to the global economy remain high, and the recovery cannot be taken for granted. That is why the government will not let up in implementing its economic plan," a spokesman added.Despite the improvement in growth in advanced economies such as the UK and US, the IMF warned that a slower pace of expansion in emerging economies such as Brazil, China and India, was holding back global expansion.It expects growth in Russia, China, India and Mexico to be slower than it forecast in July.In part, it says this is due to expectations of a change in policy by US central bank the Federal Reserve. Simply the expectation that the US could trim back its efforts to stimulate the US economy has already had an impact on interest rates in emerging economies, the IMF said.It said an increasing belief that China's growth rate would slow would also hit global growth.The IMF expects the US to drive global growth.But it warns that the political standoff over raising the US government's borrowing limit, if it results in the US defaulting on its debt payments, "could seriously damage the global economy".It expects growth of 1.6% in the US this year and 2.6% next year, down 0.1% and 0.2% from its July forecast.In the US capital on Tuesday, Republicans in Congress and Democratic President Barack Obama remained at an impasse over a shutdown of the US government and legislation to increase the US borrowing limit.At a news conference, Mr Obama stressed that failing to raise America's so-called 'debt ceiling' would undermine the world's confidence in the United States and might permanently increase borrowing costs.Mr Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, leader of opposition Republicans who have demanded major policy concessions from the Democrats in exchange for approving a government budget and allowing debt limit increase, spoke on the telephone on Tuesday but failed to reach a resolution.Mr Boehner's office criticised the president for what it described as his unwillingness to negotiate, while the White House said Mr Obama was happy to negotiate with the Republicans but only after the US government was reopened and the borrowing limit raised.The impasse continued as the US sold one-month bonds at its highest interest rate in five years on Tuesday as investor fears rose over whether the government would reach a deal to avert a default on its debt payments.In the euro area, the IMF says business confidence indicators suggest activity is close to stabilising in peripheral economies, such as Italy and Spain, and already recovering in core economies such as Germany.Overall, it predicts growth will fall 0.4% this year, an improvement of 0.1% on its July prediction, and grow 1% next year."In short, the recovery from the crisis continues, albeit too slowly," said Olivier Blanchard, economic counsellor at the IMF."The architecture of the financial system is evolving, and its future shape is still unclear. These issues will continue to shape the evolution of the world economy for many years to come,"</body>

      <title>Stark believes in Scots recovery</title>
      <description>Billy Stark thinks his Scotland Under-21 side can bounce back from two big defeats when they entertain Slovakia.</description>

      <date>1381308160</date>
      <body>Billy Stark believes his Scotland Under-21 side can recover from shipping 10 goals in two games to challenge for European Championship qualification.The young Scots followed up a 6-0 hammering by England in a friendly by losing 4-0 in the Netherlands."We are probably where we would have budgeted to be at the outset of the tournament," stressed manager Stark ahead of Thursday's visit by Slovakia."We beat Luxembourg and lost the most difficult game in Holland."Stark believes his side put up an improved performance against the Dutch, who are Group 3 favourites."The two defeats happened under different circumstances," he said. "For the England game, they had 11 better players who were extremely motivated because they had the England manager in charge that night. They were trying like a beast."This sounds like excuses, but I've been asked the question, so I'm trying to put it in perspective."It was a one-off game, a friendly against England, and we didn't perform."But we said to the players that they have to be big enough to come back from that - and they did."In Holland, we should have been a couple of goals up by half-time in their back yard. We suffered in the second half, but that's the way it happens in international football if you don't take your chances."I don't mind people calling me daft for saying this, but on another night we could have come away with a victory. That tells me we can handle it."Slovakia won in Luxembourg and defeated Georgia at home and Stark believes the group will take shape after the next series of double headers.After Thursday's game at St Mirren Park, Scotland also take on Georgia, who have beaten Luxembourg in their other game, with the Dutch facing Slovakia and Georgia.However, Stark stressed that the under-21s were as much about preparing players for full international football as winning games, especially when there were so few qualifying places."Qualification is what we absolutely strive for in every squad we get," he said."The last three squads before this one have taken it to the last minute of the qualifying group and we have won the group and still not qualified."You are qualifying for the last eight in Europe and, if people are thinking that we should be qualifying regularly for the last eight in Europe, they are needing a reality check."As a coach, I'm feeling in a good position because they have something to prove."If you've got players with ability with something to prove then that's a pretty good mix."In-form St Johnstone striker Stevie May looks to have won a starting place against Slovakia."Stevie's been with us the last couple of squads and came on and he's continued his scoring form," added Stark. "Stevie's earned his chance."</body>

      <title>Burns wants rematch with Beltran</title>
      <description>WBO lightweight champion Ricky Burns aims to fight again in February and wants a rematch with Raymundo Beltran.</description>

      <date>1381242444</date>
      <body>WBO lightweight champion Ricky Burns aims to fight again in February, with a rematch against Raymundo Beltran his preferred option.The 30-year-old Scot suffered a broken jaw in last month's controversial draw with the Mexican in Glasgow."I think it's only right to fight Raymundo again," said Burns. "I think it's the fight the fans want to see."Terence Crawford is the WBO's mandatory challenger, while a third option would be a unification fight.IBF champion Miguel Vazquez would be the likely opponent if Burns' camp went down that route.The Scot's title defence at the SECC in Glasgow on 7 September ended with Beltran's manager saying this fighter had been robbed.The challenger had the Coatbridge boxer on the floor in the eighth round.However, one judge gave Burns the verdict by 115-112, another gave it to Beltran by 115-113, with the third judge scoring it 114-114, which meant the bout was tied.Burns, evidently in pain as the fight progressed, was taken straight to hospital, where he underwent surgery to have a metal plate inserted into his jaw."My jaw is on the mend," Burns told BBC Scotland. "It's healing the way it should."I've been doing light training and hopefully I'll be back boxing in five to six weeks."Once I start sparring and the jaw has taken a couple of skelps, I'll be more confident with it."Burns confessed to having doubts about his future in the immediate aftermath of his injury, which was sustained in the second round."I don't know how I managed to get through it," he said. "The pain was unbelievable."The surgeon said it was stupidity," he joked, before adding: "It's just the way I am. If I'm in a fight, I'll fight to the end."I think people knew that wasn't the real me in that ring. I was in survival mode from the second round."I wouldn't say it crossed my mind that I would never fight again but I was thinking 'is the same thing going to reoccur?'"The much-hyped Crawford has won all of his 22 professional bouts and the American had no trouble beating Russian Andrey Klimov by a 10-round unanimous decision at the weekend.A planned meeting between Burns and Vazquez in London was cancelled at short notice in March, with the Mexican IBF champion citing a viral infection.Promoter Eddie Hearn said that he thought Beltran had done enough to win the last contest in "a close fight"."I think he deserves his shot and, more importantly, Ricky wants to put the record straight," he said."The key now is the rehabilitation of Ricky Burns. We can't rush things. We really won't know until he is back in sparring, taking blows on that jaw again."</body>

      <title>CSI Scotland: How forensics caught Peter Tobin</title>
      <description>The forensic scientist who helped to catch a serial killer</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-24430345</url>
      <date>1381273998</date>
      <body>The discovery of the body of young Polish woman Angelika Kluk hidden under the floorboards of a Glasgow church led to one of the most high-profile forensics investigations in recent years. Senior Forensic Scientist Carol Weston was the woman who gathered the evidence which would eventually catch serial killer Peter Tobin.Angelika Kluk, a 23-year-old languages student, went missing in September 2006. She had last been seen in the grounds of St Patrick's Roman Catholic Church in the Anderston area of Glasgow.Days later her body was found hidden below a small wooden hatch in the floor of the church, her hands were tied and she was covered by a tarpaulin.The chief investigating officer on the case, Det Supt David Swindle, tells the BBC's Crime Scene Scotland the way she was found showed a "total disrespect for human life".Det Supt Swindle says he was "mindful of removing the body without disturbing evidence" and so he called in a specialist forensics team. The key person was Carol Weston.Ms Weston, 39, says she felt "very strongly" that Angelika's body should not be moved and samples should be taken "in situ"."So I wanted to actually go under the floorboards down beside the body so I could get the maximum amount of forensic evidence," she says.However, the entrance to the hatch containing the body was very small and it was "bisected" by a beam.The team discussed cutting the beam but instead it was decided that Ms Weston would squeeze in through the hole beside the body."The first thing we had to do was remove the items which were obscuring the body, which was a tarpaulin and a black bin bag with items in it," says Ms Weston."At first we were worried because they smelt so strongly of decomposing matter."We were worried there were perhaps other body parts or something else down there biological."But it turned out it was very heavily blood-stained clothing, a towel and what, in our opinion, was the murder weapon used to stab Angelika - a knife."Angelika had suffered a "very violent death", with multiple stab wounds to the head and body.Her clothing was in disarray, suggesting a sexual motive for the attack.Ms Weston says: "Eventually we did take all her clothing off in situ."The reason for that was to preserve anything that was on the clothing."Once Angelika had been stripped we could look at moving the body."She adds: "I thought the whole examination would take an hour. I was shocked when I came out from the floorboards and realised how long I had actually been there - three and a half hours."The earth beneath Angelika's body had to be laid out in grids, removed and sieved in case there was something significant buried in the soil. Key exhibits were logged. The pathologist took "intimate samples", which would prove any sexual activity.Ms Weston says it is only after all the work is complete that there is time to deal with human aspect of her job.She says: "You have finished your examination, stopped thinking so much just as a scientist and that's when it becomes a bit real."You are always very aware that you are dealing with somebody's daughter, somebody's brother. It's not some evidence. It is always a person."The last man to see Angelika alive had been the church handyman, who was known as Patrick McLaughlin.He quickly became the police's prime suspect but evidence was needed.Officers had been unable to find where the murder had taken place.Angelika had last been seen at the garage attached to the church parish house but at first there was no evidence of a violent murder.Crime scene examiner Michael Young says: "It was not obvious to anyone there was anything in there."I remember Carol finding a very tiny blood spot within the garage and she put a highlighter around it."Then she found another one and another and I remember standing back and seeing the fine spray."At first the spray was not visible because of the dark red sandstone brick but then they traced evidence of "impact spatter blood spots", which are produced when someone is beaten or struck or kicked."As soon as we found these blood spots we knew we had the right place," Ms Weston says.It took four days to painstakingly log every item in the garage.Having found evidence of the crime being committed they still needed to link their prime suspect to the murder.Seminal fluid inside Angelika's body indicated that she had sexual intercourse about the time she was murdered.Ms Weston was confident that swabs of the fluid would be able to give her a DNA profile which would match with the Scottish DNA database, which contains about 280,000 profiles.But, surprisingly, there was no hit on the database.Ms Weston says: "It is your worst nightmare. You do a lot of work. You get a profile and you've got no name."The murder was in Scotland, the prime suspect was Scottish, so a hit in England seemed remote.However, the English database came back with the name Peter Tobin, who had been convicted of a sex offence in Hampshire in 1993 and released in 2003.Fingerprint evidence from the bin bag and tarpaulin was also linked back to Tobin.There was also a wooden table leg with blood on it found in the garden of the church.The hunt was on for Tobin and he was discovered by chance when a nurse at a hospital in London recognised his picture in the media.When Tobin was arrested he was wearing a T-shirt which was stained on the lower front.The staining proved to be a mixture of his semen and cellular material matching Angelika Kluk.In May 2007, Tobin was found guilty of raping and murdering Angelika.Judge Lord Menzies said Tobin should serve a minimum of 21 years, describing him as "an evil man".The case later helped link Tobin to the murders of two other young women: Vicky Hamilton and Dinah McNicol.Crime Scenes Scotland: Forensics squad is one BBC One Scotland on Wednesday 9 October at 22:35.</body>

      <title>Why did Nelson Mandela thank Glasgow?</title>
      <description>Why did Nelson Mandela thank Glasgow?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-22976781</url>
      <date>1381306559</date>
      <body>Three years after his release from almost three decades in prison, Nelson Mandela went to Glasgow to thank the city for its support in the fight against apartheid in his native South Africa.Nelson Mandela praised the "Citizens of Glasgow" for being the first to offer him the Freedom of the City, at a time more than a decade earlier when many others were still condemning him as a terrorist for his role in challenging the system of racial segregation in his home country.In a speech at the City Chambers in Glasgow on 9 October 1993, he said: "While we were physically denied our freedom in the country of our birth, a city 6,000 miles away, and as renowned as Glasgow, refused to accept the legitimacy of the apartheid system, and declared us to be free."Mandela's visit to Scotland's largest city in 1993, the year before he became president of the Republic of South Africa, was the culmination of a long association between people in the city and his campaign for freedom, which began when he was imprisoned in 1962.Scottish anti-apartheid activist Brian Filling campaigned from the 1960s against the system in South Africa which allowed the white minority to oppress the majority black inhabitants.He had joined the campaign when his parents got to know the English theatre director Cecil Williams, who had allowed Mandela to pretend to be his chauffeur and had been in the car with him when he was arrested.Mandela had been convicted of charges including conspiring to commit acts of sabotage and guerrilla warfare for the purpose of violent revolution.However, the trial was condemned by the United Nations Security Council and nations around the world.Mr Filling says that, despite some of the dreadful things happening in South Africa in 1960s and 70s, it was "not fashionable to be associated with Mandela because he was widely regarded and reported in our media as a terrorist".However in 1981, Glasgow Council decided to set its face against this opinion and awarded Mandela the Freedom of the City.Mr Filling remembers that just a couple of years earlier the previous Lord Provost of Glasgow, David Hodge, had hosted a lunch with the South African ambassador, which had sparked a protest outside the City Chambers and a threat by catering staff not to prepare the food.He says: "The incoming Lord Provost, Michael Kelly, partly as a reaction to all this, wanted to give the freedom of the city to Nelson Mandela."Dr Kelly says: "It was a bold step for the Labour Party in Glasgow because Mandela was regarded as a terrorist by a lot of people and many people thought Glasgow should not become involved in this at all."So it was an uphill struggle and we received a lot of bad publicity, but eventually when Mandela's story got through people began to see that we and he were in the right."Glasgow's promotion of Mandela's cause quickly led to other cities following suit and within a year Kelly had launched a declaration for the release of Nelson Mandela. It went on to gain support from 2,500 mayors from 56 countries around the world.The declaration got the backing of the United Nations in New York and Dr Kelly, on behalf of the city of Glasgow, had the "privilege" of being invited to speak first in support of the petition.In 1986, Glasgow brought more attention to the jailed freedom fighter by changing the name of St George's Place in the city centre to Nelson Mandela Place.The name change was made more significant by the fact that the South African consulate-general was based on the fifth floor of the Stock Exchange building, at an address which now bore the name of the country's most famous political prisoner.By now the efforts to free Mandela had become mainstream with global pop stars such as Jim Kerr, from Glasgow band Simple Minds, writing songs and playing concerts in support of his freedom.International pressure, in the form of sanctions against the South African regime, eventually led to Mandela's release.At the age of 71, Mandela was freed on 11 February 1990 after 27 years in prison.During the 1980s he had been given the Freedom of the City by nine UK regions - Aberdeen, Dundee, Greenwich, Islwyn in Gwent, Kingston Upon Hull, Midlothian, Newcastle, Sheffield and, of course, Glasgow.It was the city which was chosen to host Mandela as he arrived to accept all these awards in October 1993.Brian Filling, who set up the 1993 trip and spent two years getting agreement from all the other cities that Glasgow should be the venue, says: "He was very appreciative of the people of Britain for their support, rather than the government - which seemed to hold out against imposing sanctions on South Africa."I think there is a special place in terms of his heart and mind for the people of Scotland."Dr Kelly was able to ask Mandela if he knew about Glasgow awarding him the freedom of the city back in 1981, while he was locked up on Robben Island.The former lord provost says: "He confirmed there was a grapevine and through that he'd received these snippets of information. So at the time he had known about the award, and it kept him and his fellow prisoners going."Mr Filling says there had always been a concern about whether the man he had campaigned to free for so many years would live up to the "legend"."But in fact, he did. If anything, he was even greater than he had been imagined."</body>

      <title>One city's house price surge</title>
      <description>The city where property prices have doubled in a decade</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24348196</url>
      <date>1381100429</date>
      <body>Two cities in the UK - one is a centre of commerce, has runaway house prices, and welcomes a constant stream of overseas property buyers. The other is London.House prices in and around Aberdeen have more than doubled in the past 10 years, according to data from the Nationwide Building Society.That increase is only matched by the trendy north London borough of Islington, and by Westminster in the heart of the capital of the UK.Recent figures show that Scotland's third city is recording a fresh surge in property prices. One estate agent describes the area as a property force field."Everywhere outside is doom and gloom, but it is boom time here," says Brian Sutton, of James and George Collie solicitors and estate agents.Take a closer look at Aberdeen, and its picturesque, shimmering granite homes, and you can see the complexity of the UK property market.The city has demand from first-time buyers willing to pay above valuation levels, interest from workers moving to the area, investors keen to get in on the act, and a lack of homes for sale.All this pushes up prices. Yet, in Scotland as a whole, prices are only creeping up after years of stagnation.It shows that averages can be misleading and that local areas can have very different trends to neighbouring regions, for reasons ranging from the quality of local schools to employment levels.It also questions a widely held belief that the London property market is unique - that soaring prices in the south-east of England are unequalled in the rest of the country.At the mouth of Aberdeen Harbour, next to the fishermen's village of Footdee, is a landmark called the Roundhouse.The Shoremaster's accounts for 1797-98 show that more than £225 was spent on the new house and telescope on the site.Nowadays, first-time buyers in the city can expect to pay up to £140,000 for a one-bedroom flat, or up to £500,000 for a bigger property.Competition for homes means many buyers are paying 5% to 10% over valuation at the moment, says Bill Barclay, partner at Raeburns solicitors and estate agents.Often sales go to sealed bids, with first-timers stretching their savings to compete with buy-to-let investors.Spend a few minutes standing by the harbour and the reason for this active property market is clear - North Sea oil."It drives the local economy," says Mr Barclay. "Big companies are making long-term financial plans for the area, so we are not going to see much changing."The area was not immune to the financial crisis. Banks were not lending at the levels they had been before 2008, but Mr Barclay says Glasgow and Edinburgh suffered much more.Now, he says - using a phrase apt for an oil-producing region - the banks are "starting to open the taps" again to fund mortgages.Figures published by the University of Aberdeen show a 25% increase in the volume of sales in the second quarter of the year compared with the same three months in 2011. Prices were up by 5.5% in the city and its suburbs over the same period.Sales volumes of flats were up by 53% in that time, as buy-to-let investors find the finance and predict demand from tenants.All this is gloomy news for potential first-time buyers. One 32-year-old tells the BBC he has been renting on the south coast of England and then Aberdeen over the past 15 years and is unable to save anything close to what is needed as a deposit.You hardly see a sale sign erected within the city's sought-after areas, with supply low and competition picking up. But the market is far from overheating, as it was in 2007, according to estate agent Brian Sutton."We had people in their early 20s buying property, with 10 to 20 bidding for one property. Competition has come back, but it is three to four people bidding," he says."First-time buyers are in their early 30s, not their 20s, often with their parents helping."He predicts the housing market will continue to rise at a "sustainable rate", especially as the oil companies build headquarters in the area and continue to relocate staff to the region.Prices may grow by single figures year-on-year, he says, but nobody wants to return to the days of 20% a year increases.Much the same point was made by Business Secretary Vince Cable when he raised concerns about a property bubble potentially being inflated by government schemes to kick-start the market."In London and the south east, in the north-east of Scotland, in other areas, there are serious housing inflationary pressures," he said.Despite his warning, the second phase of the Help to Buy scheme has been brought forward by three months in England, and the Scottish government has announced the start of its own scheme.The UK and Scottish governments both argue that Help to Buy, which includes allowing buyers to apply for a shared equity loan for part of the property, are vital to give people the chance to secure a mortgage from risk-averse lenders.Buyers only qualify under the Scottish scheme if they are buying a newly built property.Critics might argue that they should encourage the developers to follow the example of the fishermen's cottages at Footdee - where the front doors face inwards to protect occupants from incoming storms.</body>

      <title>Looking into Scotland's black history</title>
      <description>Scotland's long and intriguing black history</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-24347632</url>
      <date>1381191204</date>
      <body>October is Black History Month, an event first marked in the UK 25 years ago. Scotland has close associations with the black African and Caribbean communities it celebrates.Black History Month has been held annually in the US since the 1920s and in the UK from the late 80s.It is a celebration of the contribution that black African and Caribbean communities have made on a local level and across the world.Hackney, London, is where it all started in British terms and the London borough is holding various events to mark the 25th anniversary.Scotland's black history is populated by interesting and important characters, many of whom had to endure prejudice and racism. But who were some of these people?On the bottom of in Eddrachillis Bay near Drumbeg, in Sutherland, lie three cannon and part of a wooden hull of an age-old ship.Archaeologists believe it could be the remains of a Dutch vessel that got into difficulty off Scotland's remote north-west Highland coast between 1650 and 1750.One theory is that the vessel was owned by the Dutch East India Company, also known as VOC.Founded in 1602, it was the world's biggest and most powerful trading company until it collapsed in financial ruin in 1799.Its vessels regularly sailed around the north of Scotland because of the favourable winds and also to avoid the English Channel, particularly at times of war and tensions in Europe.The cannon could have been used by the Drumbeg ship's crew to ward off privateers, privately-owned armed vessels commissioned by a state to attack an enemy's shipping.And it has been suggested some or all of the crew may have survived their ordeal.There is possible evidence of foreign sailors setting up home in the north of Scotland after their vessel foundered off the Sutherland coast.The First Statistical Account of Scotland published between 1791 and 1799 records how the climate of the area was pleasant enough for "natives of the East and West Indies" to live there.Philip Robertson, a Historic Scotland marine archaeologist, told BBC Scotland in March that the origins of the Drumbeg crew, and their fate, was still unknown.But he added: "The wreck gives us a unique window into our history and, interestingly, the trading activity off the Scottish coastline and across the world."Scots were heavily involved in the slave trade of the 18th and 19th Centuries, something which leading historian Prof Tom Devine has accused Scotland of ignoring today.Men and women were put to work in Scots-run plantations in the colonies. Female slaves were also sexually abused by their owners.An exhibition on slavery held in 2011 involving the Centre for History in Dornoch and Edinburgh Beltane organisation featured correspondence detailing the keeping of sex slaves.The letters were sent by Highland owners to relatives in Inverness and their contents were described as "graphic" and "disturbing" by researchers.Scotland's slave past is also recorded in other sources.In 2007, historians were intrigued by a mysterious black figure who appears in a tapestry depicting the Battle of Culloden of 16 April 1746.Some at experts at the National Trust for Scotland had a theory that he may be a Jamaican servant of an officer on the government side.Little is known of the 18th Century needlework, and the trust said it was not clear if the tapestry was a true depiction of a scene from the battle, or one featuring later influences.Papers in the JLM Mitchell Archive of the Gaelic Society of Inverness, meanwhile, include a Scottish soldier's request to take his daughter Mary's black slave with him to war in 1782.Lt Soirle MacDonald, from Skye, was a British Army officer in the American War of Independence.His daughter's slave was called Doll. She was likely to have been made to do domestic duties.Records detailing compensation paid by the British government to slave owners after slavery was abolished mention Gen Sir James Duff, an army officer and MP for Banffshire.He was awarded £4,101, more than £3m in today's money, to compensate him for the 202 slaves he was forced by law to give up on the Grange Sugar Estate in Jamaica.David Alston, a local historian and Highland councillor, has also examined slavery.He was drawn to the subject after discovering that fossil hunter, geologist and writer Hugh Miller sat next to a black pupil in the school he attended in Cromarty.Dr Alston said: "I gradually noticed more and more local connections with the Caribbean, including references on gravestones."Slowly it became clear just how many Highland Scots had connections to slave-worked plantations and how many children were born to these Highlanders and either enslaved or 'free coloured' women."Further research led Dr Alston to find that almost every prominent school in the Highlands had black pupils on its roll at some time between 1790 and 1830.He said: "I keep my research very focussed on the three former Dutch colonies which later became British Guiana, now Guyana, on the north coast of South America."Almost everyone will recognise the name of one of the colonies - Demerara."I have now identified almost 450 people with Highland connections involved in the plantation of Guyana before emancipation of slaves in 1834."But Scots also fought against slavery.They served in the Union army in the American Civil War of 1861-65. Slavery was among issues that divided American society at the time, and led to a violent conflict.Lt Col William L Duff, Sgt Maj John McEwan, Robert Steedman, James Wilkie, Robert Ferguson and Alexander Smith are listed on a civil war memorial in Edinburgh.Other Scots who fought for the Union included Glasgow-born John McTammany, who served in the 115th Ohio volunteers.Another was George Henry Mackenzie, who was born 175 years ago in North Kessock, a small community across the Beauly Firth from Inverness.As a captain, he led Black Union soldiers.Football was where two key figures in Scotland's black history excelled in the face of extreme prejudice in the late 1800s.Carrie Boustead played in goals for a number of teams including Mrs Graham's XI, a women's team set up by Helen Matthew, the daughter of a Montrose-born master mariner.Richard McBrearty, of the Scottish Football Museum, said: "A degree of mystery surrounds Carrie Boustead."It is believed that Carrie Boustead was originally known as Clara Berry and was raised in Liverpool during the 1870s."Carrie first comes to prominence in 1896 when she played in a series of football matches north and south of the border."Boustead was in goals for a London team that played at Barrowfield Park in Glasgow in May 1896, and also in a game held in Stirling.She was listed as being goalkeeper for Mrs Graham's XI in a match played at Wishaw in Lanarkshire.Boustead is among women footballers of the 1800s portrayed in paintings by Scots artist Stuart Gibbs.Mr McBrearty said: "At a time when there was widespread cynicism towards women playing football, Boustead was a successful proponent of the women's game and she, along with her team mates of the period, should be remembered for their achievements north and south of the border as pioneers."While much of Boustead's life is a mystery, the career of Andrew Watson, Scotland's first black international footballer, is well documented.Mr Brearty said: "Watson was one of the greatest defenders of his generation."He played in three of the greatest and most high profile teams of the 1880s - Queen's Park FC, Corinthians, and Scotland."Watson, who was born in Georgetown, British Guiana, and whose father was a plantation manager and former slave owner from Orkney, played for Scotland at a time when they dominated international football.His three caps for Scotland were a 6-1 and 5-1 win over England and a 5-1 win over Wales.Mr Brearty said: "On his debut in 1881 he captained Scotland to a 6-1 win over England at the Oval in London - this remains England's heaviest defeat on home soil."He added: "Watson only won three caps because he moved away from Scotland and down to London in 1882 and was beyond the gaze of the international selectors."While in London in 1882 he played for the London Swifts in an FA Cup match and became the first known black footballer to play in the FA Cup."He is the first black international footballer and international football captain."England's Corinthians included a few non-English players. Watson was the first of those footballers and he played in the team's 8-1 win over reigning FA Cup holders Blackburn Rovers in 1884.But Watson's star qualities on the pitch did not protect him from racial abuse.Mr McBrearty said: "The Scottish Athletic Journal provided an overview of his career in 1885."It stated: 'Although on more than one occasion subjected to vulgar insults by splenetic, ill-tempered players, he uniformly preserved that gentlemanly demeanour which has endeared him to opponents as well as his club companions'."This suggests that he experienced racism on the field, but that he was able to rise above insults and let his sporting ability shine through on the park."But he added: "One of the best complements to Watson's ability can be found in his selection in an all-star Scotland team in 1926. JAH Catton, editor of the Athletic News, selected Watson at left back in his all-time Scotland team, 44 years after his last Scotland appearance."Eugene Bullard - America's first black combat pilot - must rate among one of the most unusual characters from Scotland's black history.Georgia-born Bullard's ancestors included slaves from Martinique who were brought to America by their French owners as they fled the Haitian slave revolution.His father spoke French and also talked fondly of France, instilling in Bullard a belief that it was the true land of opportunity, free of prejudice.Spurred by an attempt to lynch his father and his own brushes with racial hatred, Bullard worked towards getting himself to Paris. This journey first took him to Scotland.According to Craig Lloyd's book Eugene Bullard: Black Expatriate in Jazz-Age Paris, Bullard was barely in his teens when he stowed away on a German cargo ship at Norfolk, Virginia.The captain of the Marta Russ first threatened to throw Bullard overboard, before giving him the chance of working on the ship on its passage to Aberdeen.Bullard left his ship shortly after it reached Aberdeen. He spent a day in the Granite City before taking a train to Glasgow.While he was relieved to find he was not the target of vicious racial abuse in Scotland, Lloyd said that Bullard did have one immediate problem.Lloyd wrote: "At first he had difficulty with the Scottish dialect and accent: 'the language the natives spoke was sort of like English'."Bullard spent five months in Glasgow and earned money acting as a lookout at illegal gambling dens.He later headed for Liverpool and then finally France.In World War I, he served with the French Foreign Legion and saw action at some of the bloodiest battles, including the Somme and Artois Ridge.Wounds he suffered at Verdun ruled him out from returning to the front line as a soldier, but he was offered a chance to become a pilot with the French Flying Corps.In 1917, he qualified as a flyer. He earned one officially confirmed kill.When the US entered the war, Bullard sought a transfer to its air force. His request was ignored.Bullard remained in Paris after the war.He became part-owner of a night club, got married and had three children.During World War II, he fought with the French resistance until he was badly wounded and was smuggled into Spain.Thirty-three years after his death in 1961 the US Air Force posthumously commissioned him as a lieutenant in honour of his war-time exploits.</body>

      <title>Obama to nominate new Fed chief</title>
      <description>US President Barack Obama will nominate Federal Reserve vice-chair Janet Yellen to be the next head of the US central bank on Wednesday.</description>

      <body>US President Barack Obama will nominate Federal Reserve Vice-Chair Janet Yellen to be the next head of the US central bank on Wednesday, according to a White House official.If confirmed by the US Senate, Ms Yellen would replace Ben Bernanke, who has held the post for eight years.She has been his deputy for the last two years, and would become the first woman to head the Federal Reserve.Ms Yellen and Mr Bernanke are due to appear with the president on Wednesday.She has taught at Harvard University and the London School of Economics, as well as holding a series of senior administrative positions in the US.Ms Yellen, like Mr Bernanke, is seen as a "dove", meaning she prefers to prioritise boosting employment by keeping rates low rather than worrying about inflation.Her nomination has been widely expected after former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers withdrew his candidature.One senior US senator, Democrat Charles Schumer, said Ms Yellen had the backing of politicians and would win Senate confirmation "by a wide margin".The chairman of the US Senate Banking Committee, Tim Johnson, said she had "a depth of experience that is second to none"."I have no doubt she will be an excellent Federal Reserve chairman," he added.The BBC's chief business correspondent, Linda Yueh, says the transition from Mr Bernanke to Ms Yellen is likely to be "seamless" and will not have much impact, because the two already work so closely together."I don't think there's going to be a radical change," she said on Radio 4's Today programme, adding that the changeover was unlikely to alter the timing of the Fed's withdrawal of economic stimulus.Ms Yellen's most recent academic post was at the University of California, Berkeley. A former colleague of hers there, Laura Tyson, professor of business and economics, told the BBC her nomination was "terrific news"."We have an outstanding candidate who is a wonderful match of skills and experience and temperament and reputation around the world at a time when monetary policy is extremely important," she said."Continuity is important and Janet is an outstanding candidate."A former member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve, Prof Randy Kroszner, told the BBC that Ms Yellen was "battle tested" and would be driven by the data in deciding when to reduce support to the markets.On the US budget crisis, he added: "There isn't as much adult supervision in Washington as anyone in the world would like," but the process did help stop the US reaching Greek levels of indebtedness.</body>

      <body>The rail industry's power to increase fares in England is to be curbed as part of a government drive to overhaul the rail fare system.Until now, some regulated fares could potentially have gone up by 9.1% next January.They will now be capped at 6.1%.But campaigners say it is not enough, and point out that commuters will still have to pay an above- inflation increase next year.Regulated fares are those which the government controls, and include season tickets, "anytime" single tickets around major cities, and off-peak inter-city return tickets.They will go up in 2014 by an average of 4.1%, a number calculated using an average of inflation - as measured by the retail prices index (RPI) for July - plus 1%.Train companies can add up to 5% on top of the average rise, although fares that go up by more than the average must be balanced by others that rise by less or fall.The government plans to limit that extra increase to 2% in the future. But the provision for the average regulated ticket price to go up by 1% more than inflation remains.The move is part of the government's Fares and Ticketing review being published by the Transport Secretary, Patrick McLoughlin.The review will also detail a pilot scheme that could see all long-distance rail tickets sold on a single-leg basis, not as returns.The government says this could allow passengers to more easily "mix and match" different ticket types when planning a return journey.Other plans to be revealed by the Transport Secretary include:Mary Creagh, the shadow transport secretary, said the new cap on fares would be "cold comfort for commuters"."It has taken 18 months, delivers fare increases of up to 6% and is too little too late," she said."This announcement doesn't go as far as Labour's plans which would prevent train companies from increasing fares beyond one per cent above inflation."</body>

      <body>Samsung Electronics, the world's best-selling smartphone maker, has launched a handset with a curved display screen.Called the Galaxy Round, the smartphone will feature a 5.7in (14.5cm) display.The launch comes just days after rival LG said it would begin production of curved-screen phones next year.Digital display technology has been progressing towards curved screens. Both Samsung and LG already offer curved organic light-emitting diode (OLED) television sets.Samsung said the curved screen display would help consumers use some of the features on the phone, including those that enable users to check information such as date, time and missed calls when home screen is off, with more ease.At the same time, users can also change music tracks on their phone, even while its display is off.The Galaxy Round will initially be launched only in South Korea. The firm gave no indication of its plans for a global launch.The global smartphone market has been growing rapidly.According to research firm CCS Insight, worldwide smartphone sales will hit nearly one billion in 2013 - accounting for more than half the total of 1.7 billion mobile phones sold.As as result, smartphone manufacturers have been keen to offer new products to win consumers.With display technology moving towards flexible and bendy screens, it is one area that companies have been looking at.Some analysts said that while the initial offering of curved-screen phones may not see huge sales, the segment of flexible displays was one to keep an eye on."These phones may not be a game-changer today, but they are definitely an indication of things to come," Manoj Menon, managing director of consulting firm Frost and Sullivan, told the BBC."Flexible displays have a huge role to play as the market place for 'internet of things' grows."This refers to the idea that many things in homes or offices - not just typical computers - will soon be connected to the internet.The sector is tipped by many to be a major industry in the near future.Mr Menon said that as flexible screens became more advanced and cost-effective to make, it was likely to speed up growth in the sector.</body>

      <date>1381310710</date>
      <body>UK industrial production fell unexpectedly in August, showing its biggest decline for nearly a year, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Industrial output decreased by 1.1% month-on-month, surprising analysts, who had expected a 0.4% rise.The biggest factor in the decline was a big fall in manufacturing output, which was 1.2% down on July levels.It was the biggest overall drop in output since September 2012.At the same time, the ONS published figures showing that the UK trade deficit was largely unchanged in August.The gap between imports and exports for the month was estimated at £3.3bn, compared with £3.4bn in July.The decrease in UK manufacturing output was led by companies making pharmaceutical products, electronics, food and beverages.But other sectors also contributed to the surprise fall in overall output, with the oil and gas industry also underperforming.Private-sector surveys of production have been less downbeat. Last week, the Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for September indicated that UK manufacturing had grown for the sixth consecutive month.Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturers' organisation EEF, described the latest ONS figures as "a mixed bag of data which breaks the run of consistently upbeat indicators in recent months".She added: "Whilst August unwound some of the gains in June and July, the declines were particularly concentrated in a few sectors, namely food, pharmaceuticals and electronics."However, the trade news was a little more positive, with exports edging higher, thanks to gains in markets outside Europe."Despite this monthly setback on production, manufacturing should make a positive contribution to third-quarter GDP growth and other business surveys seem to align behind a continuation of this trend through the final months of the year."However, Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency brokers World First, said the figures were "a further sign that the UK's economic revival cannot be guaranteed"."While the IMF may have sung the UK's praises [on Tuesday], today's number shows that the broad-based recovery that so many have been hailing has significant tasks attached," he said."The divergence between the recent, multi-year highs on PMIs and the official data is worrying and a little difficult to explain. Could businesses be overly exuberant without cause?"</body>

      <title>'No bailout' for the Earth's climate</title>
      <description>Governments forced to rescue the world's banking system are being warned by the OECD that there will be no bailout if there is a climate crisis.</description>

      <date>1381303090</date>
      <body>Governments forced to rescue the world's banking system are being warned there will be no bailout if there is a crisis in the Earth's climate system.That is the view of the head of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).Angel Gurria is expected to rebuke nations failing to curb CO2 emissions in a speech on Wednesday.He will say the analysis of the climate threat is far clearer than were the warning signs for the financial crisis.Mr Gurria is due to address the topic of climate change, investment and energy policies in a London lecture co-organised with the London School of Economics and the Climate Markets and Investors Association (CMIA)The talk coincides with a report in The Independent newspaper that claims UK Chancellor George Osborne is about to reject the recommendations of government advisers by slowing the drive to tackle global warming.In his speech, Mr Gurria will ask if leaders overseeing the financial system that led to the "train wreck" of the banking crisis would have been happy to take the risks if they had known the consequences.“Unlike the financial crisis, we do not have a 'climate bailout option' up our sleeves,” he will say.“And despite all the attention given to climate change deniers, our understanding of the scale of the risk is much better developed than our understanding of the financial risks, pre-crisis.”An OECD source said the secretary-general's remarks were directed both at countries which had dragged their feet on reducing emissions and those which had taken a leadership position but were now starting to wobble.Asked if the latter group included the UK, where the chancellor argued last week that Britain "should not be in front of the rest of the world” in tackling climate change, the source said the OECD was fully aware of the situation in Britain and all its member states.Mr Gurria will also warn that renewable technologies will be harmed by stop-start policies. Renewables firms in the UK have benefited from a stable policy framework in the medium term, but are uncertain about long-term investments as right-wing Conservatives attempt to abandon CO2 targets for 2030, arguing that they damage competitiveness.He also takes a swipe at fossil fuel subsidies, currently estimated at over $500bn a year globally. These typically provide cheap motoring for the rich, he says, and fail to help the poor.The world, he says, needs to become zero-carbon in the second half of the century, and needs to start on that pathway immediately if climate change is to be stabilised.Mr Gurria, like the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon last week, is trying to galvanise action for an ambitious agreement in the planned 2015 UN climate conference in Paris.Rich nation governments struggling against recession have been going slow on climate change policies, and developing nations have argued that they need space to expand emissions to grow their economies and draw people out of poverty.Mr Gurria will argue that creating an infrastructure that leaves people dependent on fossil fuels will prove more costly overall in terms of the economy and public welfare.Interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, he said: "Countries like Britain have been leading the charge (on climate change) and have to continue to do that. It's because of leadership of UK that EU has seen that this is the way to go - and the rest of the world too."He said energy policy has become extra challenging following technology improvements on exploiting fossil fuels. "We grew up with scarcity of oil and fuel, now we are entering a world of abundance so we're really going to have to think very hard on this."The OECD is to publish a paper on the most effective ways of managing carbon cuts in the economy.Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin</body>

      <date>1381307167</date>
      <body>Alitalia risks having its fuel supplies cut off as the company struggles to avert a financial crisis.Italian oil company ENI said it could not keep supplying fuel if the airline failed to raise fresh finance.ENI's chief executive said his firm could not provide credit "to a company whose future seems no longer assured".After years of losses, Alitalia is trying to raise 100m euros ($136m; £84m) from its shareholders to keep the business running.Those shareholders are due to vote whether to extend fresh financing on 14 October.Alitalia was rescued from bankruptcy in 2009 by a consortium of investors.Under the deal Air France KLM took a 25% stake in the carrier.Analysts say Air France KLM wants to buy the rest of Alitalia.But the French carrier is unlikely to want Alitalia's debt burden and would probably want to make deep cost cuts."This is a tug of war over the price," said Andrea Giuricin, a transport analyst at Milan's Bicocca University."Air France KLM would like to buy Alitalia as cheaply as possible, preferably without having to take on its debt, while the Italian shareholders want to get something out of this as well."Reports say that Italy's civil aviation authority ENAC will meet company executives this week to assess whether Alitalia is a viable concern.On Tuesday the government held talks with the company to resolve the crisis and further talks are due this week.</body>

      <body>(Open): Shares in Greggs rose 2.5% in early trade as a revamp of the bakery chain showed signs of progress.Like-for-like sales fell 0.5% in the 13 weeks to 28 September, but this was better than a 2.9% drop in the first half of the year.The chain has been refitting and relocating stores to focus on its "food-on-the-go" format.The FTSE 100 was down 19.46 points at 6,346.37, as the impasse in resolving the US federal budget dragged on.Shares in Vedanta Resources fell 3.5% after Morgan Stanley cut its rating on the stock to "underweight".But housebuilders were having a better day after Goldman Sachs raised its profit forecasts for sector. Persimmon shares climbed 4.5% and Taylor Wimpey added 3%.Home shopping group N Brown fell 3.6% despite it reporting a 7.1% increase in half-year pre-tax profits to £45m, with sales up 8% to £409.6m.Thorntons shares rose 1.3% following its latest trading update. The chocolate maker reported a 2.1% rise in total sales to £47m in the 14 weeks to 5 October, as rising sales through supermarkets offset a drop in business at its own stores.On the currency markets, the pound fell 0.6% against the dollar to $1.5980 and dropped 0.3% against the euro, with one pound buying 1.1812 euros.</body>

      <body>Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, has agreed to dissolve its joint venture with one of India's leading business groups, Bharti Enterprises.Wal-Mart will acquire Bharti's stake in the venture, which operates wholesale cash and carry stores in India.The US firm said that it was still keen to grow its business in India.It said it would "continue to advocate for investment conditions" that allow foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail in the country."Through Walmart's investment in India, including our cash and carry business, supply chain infrastructure, direct farm programme and supplier development, we want to serve India and its people," Scott Price, chief executive of Wal-Mart Asia said in a statement.India opened up its multi-brand retailing sector to foreign investors last year. But so far no foreign firm has applied to enter the market.Many industry players and analysts have said that strict pre-conditions attached to investments have kept companies away.Prompted by these concerns, India eased key rules governing foreign direct investment (FDI) in the sector in August this year.The previous rules made it mandatory for foreign supermarkets to source 30% of their products from small Indian firms.The government has retained that requirement, but says foreign firms will be given five years in which to reach that target, giving them the option of importing goods from overseas initially.Foreign retailers will also be allowed to set up shop in cities with a population of less than one million, which they had been barred from earlier.</body>

      <body>Yum Brands, the owner of fast food chains KFC and Pizza Hut, has posted a 68% drop in quarterly profits after food scares in China hit sales.It made a net profit of $152m (£88m) in the three months to 7 September, with sales in China, one of its biggest markets, falling 11% from a year ago.Yum's Chinese revenues took a hit after a food safety scare in December 2012.That was followed by a bird flu outbreak which further damaged the firm."China division third-quarter sales and profits were impacted by adverse publicity surrounding the December poultry supply incident and subsequent news of Avian flu," the company said in a statement.The business also warned it was unlikely that sales at its KFC stores in China would turn positive in the fourth quarter.Yum shares fell more than 7% in after-hours trading in the US.Yum, which is based in the US, makes about three quarters of its revenue from its China operations.It is the largest foreign restaurant chain operator in China - the world's second-biggest economy.David Novak, chief executive of Yum, said that despite the recent challenges it had faced there, China continued to remain a key growth market for the company."As evidence of this, we expect to open at least 700 new units in China this year, as we capitalise on the world's fastest growing consuming class," he said.The company opened 132 new stores in its third quarter in China, bringing the total number of new stores this year to 458.Yum said that it expected to see its profits to bounce back in 2014.</body>

      <date>1381249277</date>
      <body>Some older Samsung gadgets look set to be banned in the US following a patent row with Apple.In early August, Apple won a case at the US International Trade Commission (ITC) that found Samsung had infringed two patents covering mobile technology.That victory called for an import ban on some Samsung products but this was postponed pending an appeal.A US official overseeing the patent row has now rejected Samsung's appeal, meaning the ban will come into force."After carefully weighing policy considerations, including the impact on consumers and competition, advice from agencies and information from interested parties, I have decided to allow the commission's determination... to become final," said US trade representative Michael Froman.The patents in dispute cover detecting fingers on a touchscreen and the workings of the audio jack on smartphones and tablets. In August, Samsung was cleared of violating four other patented technologies.So far, it is not clear which products will be banned from sale. In its appeal, Samsung said it had, for newer products, developed its own technologies that did not draw on Apple's patented ideas. The ITC has already approved the workarounds for the disputed technologies.In August, US President Barack Obama overturned another ITC ruling that called for a ban on Apple products. He issued the first presidential veto for 26 years on an ITC matter when he decided to stop the ban on older iPhones and iPads.Apple and Samsung have regularly clashed in court over the past few years and have fought patent battles across 10 countries.</body>

      <title>Obama: Republicans using 'extortion'</title>
      <description>US President Obama says he is willing to hold budget talks with Republicans, but not if they "demand a ransom in exchange for doing their jobs".</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24453693</url>
      <date>1381285503</date>
      <body>US President Barack Obama has said he is willing to hold budget talks with Republicans, but not until they agree to lift "threats" against the economy.Republicans "don't get to demand ransom in exchange for doing their jobs", Mr Obama said, by demanding concessions in policy before reopening government.The US government shut down last week when Congress failed to agree a budget.Republican leaders on Tuesday renewed their calls for Mr Obama to open negotiations over ending the impasses.Republican House Speaker John Boehner told reporters he was "disappointed that the president refuses to negotiate".He said the president's position not to talk with Republicans "until [they] surrender" was not sustainable, and any discussions regarding the debt ceiling must address how the nation is "living beyond its means".At the White House, Mr Obama said he had spoken to Mr Boehner and was "happy to talk with him and other Republicans about anything".But Mr Obama said any negotiations on the ongoing government shutdown or the debt limit "shouldn't require hanging the threats of a shutdown or economic chaos over the heads of the American people"."We can't make extortion routine as part of our democracy," Mr Obama said. "Democracy doesn't function this way. And this is not just for me. It's also for my successors in office, whatever party they're from."He also warned of the repercussions of defaulting on the government's debt should Congress fail to raise the borrowing limit, currently set to be reached on 17 October.Mr Obama said breaching the borrowing limit could disrupt capital markets, undermine international confidence in America, permanently increase the nation's borrowing costs, add to its deficits and debt, and pose the "significant risk of a very deep recession".The US government partially shut down operations on 1 October after Republicans who control the House of Representatives refused to approve a budget, saying they would only do so if Mr Obama's healthcare reform law were delayed or stripped of funding.Mr Obama and the Democrats have thus far refused, noting the law was passed in 2010, subsequently approved by the Supreme Court, and was a central issue in the 2012 election which Mr Obama won.At the same time, the Republicans have refused to approve an increase in the US debt limit unless it is accompanied by significant spending cuts and other policy concessions.Mr Obama maintains Mr Boehner could end the current government showdown by allowing the House to vote on a "clean" budget bill that does not alter the health law, because that could pass with votes from both Democrats and moderate Republicans.But doing so would risk damaging his standing with the most conservative elements of his caucus, analysts say.US and foreign officials and economists have warned of severe economic consequences if the US defaults on its debt because the government is unable to borrow money to fund its obligations."Failure to lift the debt ceiling would be a major event. Prolonged failure... would almost surely derail the US recovery," said International Monetary Fund economic counsellor Olivier Blanchard on Tuesday."But the effects of any failure to repay the debt would be felt right away... leading to potentially major disruptions in financial markets both in the United States and abroad."Philippine President Benigno Aquino warned that what happens in the US "affects us all"."The US economy is the number-one economy in the world," he said while attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) in Bali."The world economy obviously is not in a position to withstand too much shock at this time."At the White House, Mr Obama said that if the US eventually dealt with the impasse "the way we should", then "folks around the world will attribute this to the usual messy process of American democracy but it doesn't do lasting damage".He sought to reassure US bond holders and others that the country remained good for its debts, despite the shutdown."My message to the world is the United States always has paid its bills and it will do so again," Mr Obama said.The shutdown has already had a significant impact in the US.Hundreds of thousands of workers have been sent home without pay, national parks, museums, and tourists sites have been closed, research has halted, and more.Visitors to the iconic Grand Canyon in Arizona have got no further than locked gates around the site, which normally attracts 18,000 visitors a day as weather cools about summer highs.Workers in small towns that depend on Grand Canyon tourism for their livelihoods are having to resort to food banks.On Monday, US defence contractor Lockheed Martin said it would put 3,000 workers on unpaid leave, warning that number would rise if the government shutdown continued.That announcement followed United Technologies' decision to lay off 2,000 employees temporarily, saying manufacturing had halted because there were no government inspectors working to sign off products.</body>

      <title>IMF cuts global growth forecast</title>
      <description>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has trimmed its forecast for global economic growth at the same time as lifting its UK growth projection.</description>

      <date>1381259442</date>
      <body>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has trimmed its forecast for global economic growth at the same time as lifting its UK growth projection.It now expects global growth of 2.9% this year, a cut of 0.3% from July's estimate. In 2014 it expects global growth of 3.6%, down 0.2%.It cited weakness in emerging economies for the cut.The forecast for UK growth this year received a significant upgrade to 1.4%, up from July's estimate of 0.9%.And for next year the IMF expects UK growth of 1.9%, up from July's projection of 1.5%.The IMF's upgrades for its outlook on the UK are larger than those it made for any other country in its World Economic Outlook - its twice-yearly assessment of the global economy.It credited recent data indicating higher consumer and business confidence, for the increase.However, it warned that it would still take years for the UK economy to recover fully from the 2008 financial crisis. It suggested that the government could help boost growth by bringing forward planned public infrastructure spending, such as building new homes.The UK Treasury said the IMF upgrade showed the government's economic strategy was working."But risks to the global economy remain high, and the recovery cannot be taken for granted. That is why the government will not let up in implementing its economic plan," a spokesman added.Despite the improvement in growth in advanced economies such as the UK and US, the IMF warned that a slower pace of expansion in emerging economies such as Brazil, China and India, was holding back global expansion.It expects growth in Russia, China, India and Mexico to be slower than it forecast in July.In part, it says this is due to expectations of a change in policy by US central bank the Federal Reserve. Simply the expectation that the US could trim back its efforts to stimulate the US economy has already had an impact on interest rates in emerging economies, the IMF said.It said an increasing belief that China's growth rate would slow would also hit global growth.The IMF expects the US to drive global growth.But it warns that the political standoff over raising the US government's borrowing limit, if it results in the US defaulting on its debt payments, "could seriously damage the global economy".It expects growth of 1.6% in the US this year and 2.6% next year, down 0.1% and 0.2% from its July forecast.In the US capital on Tuesday, Republicans in Congress and Democratic President Barack Obama remained at an impasse over a shutdown of the US government and legislation to increase the US borrowing limit.At a news conference, Mr Obama stressed that failing to raise America's so-called 'debt ceiling' would undermine the world's confidence in the United States and might permanently increase borrowing costs.Mr Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, leader of opposition Republicans who have demanded major policy concessions from the Democrats in exchange for approving a government budget and allowing debt limit increase, spoke on the telephone on Tuesday but failed to reach a resolution.Mr Boehner's office criticised the president for what it described as his unwillingness to negotiate, while the White House said Mr Obama was happy to negotiate with the Republicans but only after the US government was reopened and the borrowing limit raised.The impasse continued as the US sold one-month bonds at its highest interest rate in five years on Tuesday as investor fears rose over whether the government would reach a deal to avert a default on its debt payments.In the euro area, the IMF says business confidence indicators suggest activity is close to stabilising in peripheral economies, such as Italy and Spain, and already recovering in core economies such as Germany.Overall, it predicts growth will fall 0.4% this year, an improvement of 0.1% on its July prediction, and grow 1% next year."In short, the recovery from the crisis continues, albeit too slowly," said Olivier Blanchard, economic counsellor at the IMF."The architecture of the financial system is evolving, and its future shape is still unclear. These issues will continue to shape the evolution of the world economy for many years to come,"</body>

      <body>Three large UK mortgage lenders remain undecided on whether to join the government's Help to Buy scheme.Barclays, Santander and Nationwide Building Society all said they were reviewing the details of the scheme, published on Tuesday, before reaching a decision on participation.Other lenders have unveiled the cost of mortgages they plan to offer.The government's initiative is designed to allow those who can afford only small deposits to buy a home.RBS, NatWest and Halifax will start taking applications this week, with HSBC, Virgin Money, Lloyds, TSB and Aldermore joining later. That means lenders representing about 40% of the UK mortgage market have committed to the scheme.RBS and NatWest are offering a two-year, fixed-rate mortgage starting at 4.99% for those with a 5% deposit, with no fee.RBS, which owns NatWest, said it had already filled all of its mortgage appointments across its branch network for the rest of the week. And it said its new online Help to Buy pages were being viewed 40 times per minute.Halifax will be taking applications by the end of the week at a rate of 5.19% with a £995 fee for those with the same deposit.Prime Minister David Cameron said he was happy with the interest being shown so far."I am very content that we are going to get a good range of products in the market and that is going to help people who want to get on to the housing ladder, who want to own their own home, who can afford mortgage payments but can't currently get mortgages," he said."Those are the people we want to help."Comparisons on the interest rates are difficult, as there are so few 95% mortgages on the market at present.The most competitive, widely available two-year fixed rate mortgage before Help to Buy, for those offering a 5% deposit, has an interest rate of 5.95%, according to financial information service Moneyfacts.For those able to offer a 10% deposit, the cheapest mortgage deal was 3.54%, with a fee of £1,675, Moneyfacts said.The first phase of the Help to Buy scheme in England started in April, when buyers of newly built homes were eligible for a 20% equity loan from the government on top of their 5% deposit.Similar schemes are operating in Scotland and Wales.Under the second phase, buyers across the UK only need to provide a small deposit, with the government offering a guarantee of 15% of the loan to the lender - for a fee - to encourage the bank or building society to offer the loan.That fee charged to the lender is up to 0.9% of the original loan level. This is a one-off fee dealt with entirely by the lender, which guarantees 15% of the mortgage for seven years.Borrowers who apply will face checks to make sure that they can afford the mortgage payments. The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), which represents lenders, said affordability checks would be as "rigorous" as they were with any borrower.The scheme will be available for first-time buyers and home movers borrowing to buy new and old homes valued at no more than £600,000. It is expected to continue for three years.It means a buyer looking to purchase a home costing £200,000 would have to put down a deposit of around £10,000. Demands have been much higher than this for many first-time buyers since the start of the financial crisis, usually about 20% of the value of a home.An influential group of MPs has echoed concerns about the potential effect of the Help to Buy scheme. The Treasury Select Committee said that great care was needed from the government when setting up and running the scheme."Mistakes could distort the housing market or carry threats to financial stability," it said.It said that - without care - the scheme could raise house prices, rather than stimulate the number of homes for sale."We continue to believe that the government of the day will face strong incentives to extend the scheme, with the attendant risk that the mortgage guarantee scheme becomes a permanent feature of the UK mortgage market," it said.Last month, Chancellor George Osborne asked the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) to make annual reviews of the scheme, starting next September. The committee had been due to make an assessment only after its first three years of operation.Treasury officials said that the FPC would advise on the fee that lenders had to pay, which could be changed each year, and whether to change the £600,000 limit.Mr Osborne said that the housing market was recovering from low levels of activity and the latest extension of Help to Buy would help many more people get a foot on the ladder.Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, questioned whether homes as expensive as £600,000 should be included in the scheme, and said that more affordable homes should be built."Unless George Osborne acts now to build more affordable homes, as we have urged, then soaring prices risk making it even harder for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder. You can't tackle the cost of living crisis without building more homes," he said.The scheme is getting under way as surveyors report their sales levels are at their highest for nearly four years.The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said a large majority of surveyors were expecting house prices to rise.</body>

      <title>Royal Mail staff take up share offer</title>
      <description>Just 368 out of the 150,000 Royal Mail staff chose not to accept free shares in the privatised company, the BBC learns.</description>

      <body>Just 368 out of the Royal Mail's 150,000 staff have chosen not to accept free shares in the privatised company, the BBC has learned.Latest figures show that 99.75% of staff have accepted the share offer, which will be worth about £2,000.BBC political correspondent Norman Smith says government sources hope the overwhelming acceptance will undermine the threat of sustained strike action.The public can apply for the shares online until Tuesday 8 October.Members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) are voting on whether to strike over the government's privatisation plan.The ballot closes on 16 October and strike action could begin as early as 23 October.Our correspondent says that the government hopes that the backing of postmen and women for the share sale "might have drawn the sting" from any industrial action."Ministers deliberately opted in Royal Mail staff to the share scheme, so those wishing to reject the offer had to fill out a lengthy form," he said.The Royal Mail sale has been heavily oversubscribed, meaning that members of the public are unlikely to get all the shares they have applied for.The oversubscription has sparked a row over whether this means that the service is being sold off too cheaply.Business Secretary Vince Cable has written to Labour's Chuka Umunna rejecting his assertion that the sale is "short-changing" taxpayers, while providing a windfall for hedge funds and professional investors.Mr Cable said the criticism was "irresponsible", as it may imply an "easy bargain" was to be had.Most private investors will not know how many shares they have been allocated until after unconditional trading on the London stock market starts on 15 October.According to the Royal Mail prospectus, investors who applied online will get an "email within two days" of the start of full trading. People who applied by post will receive a letter "by post within one week".Included in the emails and letters will be details of how private investors can dispose of their shares.Investors who applied via a stockbroker are likely to be told their allocation by their broker on Friday, the day the final price of the shares is set.</body>

      <body>The head of Slovenia's central bank, Bostjan Jazbec, has said it will consider asking for outside help if the country's funding costs stay high.He also said Slovenia's GDP would shrink by 2.6% this year, more than April's 1.9% forecast.Slovenia's banks are largely state-owned and saddled with bad loans worth 22.5% of its GDP.Mr Jazbec's comments are likely to fuel speculation over whether Slovenia will be bailed out by the EU.Mr Jazbec said he would consider asking for aid if yields on Slovenia's bonds remained high.During a news conference, he said the country was doing everything it could to bring its funding costs down."If that is not successful, then there is a possibility to ask for help within various programmes," he added.Meanwhile, Slovenia's Prime Minister, Alenka Bratusek, has admitted to parliament the amount needed to rescue the banks is "completely unknown".But Ms Bratusek told STA, the state-owned news agency: "We are very intensely preparing measures that are needed, so as to avoid asking for help."The results of the bank's stress-tests, out at the end of November, will indicate whether or not a bailout is needed.Eurozone members can ask for help from the European Stability Mechanism, set up in 2012.</body>

      <title>Dyson balks at EU 'dust-free' tests</title>

      <body>British manufacturer Dyson is mounting a legal challenge against the EU's labelling policy for vacuum cleaners, saying it gives a misleading impression of the firm's products.Sir James Dyson, the firm's founder, said the EU's energy efficiency ratings were based on dust-free lab conditions, favouring "old-fashioned technology".Dyson said home performance was "very different to that in the laboratory".The firm has pioneered the bagless vacuum cleaner since 1991.From September 2014, all vacuum cleaners sold in the EU will be rated according to their performance and energy efficiency, on a scale from A to G.The EU says the measure is part of efforts to meet its goal of cutting carbon emissions and saving energy.It wants consumers to take the environment into consideration when they are buying household appliances.Dyson said it had launched a judicial review at the European General Court in Luxembourg, because it felt the rating system would mislead people looking to buy a new vacuum cleaner."The regulations stipulate that vacuums should be tested in laboratory conditions: empty and with no dust," said the firm."This does not simulate real-life conditions and is not representative of the view of testing and standards bodies across Europe."Dyson said its bagless design meant that its cleaners did not clog with dust and therefore wasted less energy.It also said the EU's tests did not take into account the cost, "on both the pocket and the planet", of replacement bags and filters for older types of vacuum cleaner."Dyson fully supports the ambition to make the environmental impact of a machine easier to understand," said a spokesman for the firm."However, we are challenging aspects of the label because it will mislead consumers - notably the fact that the machines are tested in lab conditions free of dust, and the fact that environmentally damaging and costly consumables are not considered."</body>

      <body>Commemorative coins marking the christening of Prince George will be priced at between £13 and £50,000, the Royal Mint has announced.Twenty-two of the most expensive coins will be struck containing a kilogramme of fine gold each. A range of coins at different prices is being struck.It is the first time that a royal christening has been marked with coins.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son will be christened on 23 October, just over three months after his birth.The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, will perform the christening at the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace.The prince, who was born on 22 July at St Mary's Hospital in London, is third in line to the throne.The coins are starting to be struck on Tuesday at the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf.They feature a lily font from the Tower of London, which has links with royal christenings.The inscription is flanked by two harp-playing cherubs. The motto at the foot of the coin is the traditional "Dieu et mon droit" or "God and my right", which is the motto of Prince George's great grandmother, the Queen.The prince has already had coins minted in his honour. The Royal Mint gave away 2,013 silver pennies to babies born on the same day as the duke and duchess's son.</body>

      <title>Oxford challenges tuition fee limit</title>
      <description>Oxford University's vice-chancellor questions the long-term sustainability of the £9,000 fixed upper limit for tuition fees.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24444600</url>
      <date>1381255629</date>
      <body>Oxford University's vice-chancellor has questioned the long-term sustainability of the £9,000 fixed upper limit for tuition fees.Andrew Hamilton told a university gathering the real cost of an Oxford undergraduate course was £16,000.He asked how a "market" in higher education could operate if everything "regardless of content and quality, is the same price".The university faced an annual funding gap of £70m, said Prof Hamilton.He argued that different types of institutions should be able to charge different levels of fees."Given the great diversity of the institutions in our higher education system, the notion of different universities charging significantly different amounts, doesn't feel inherently unnatural."It is the current situation that seems out of kilter. What matters surely is that an institution's charges are clearly aligned with what it offers and that they are demonstrably not a barrier to student access."A university spokesman said that the speech was not proposing that students would have to pay fees of £16,000 per year to bridge the shortfall.But Prof Hamilton suggested a "system of tuition charges more closely related to the true cost", with the "strongest guarantees" of support for poorer students.Prof Hamilton argued that there needed to be a more sustainable funding model for universities where £9,000 did not cover their costs.He had heard that some universities were "doing very nicely thank you" with fees of £9,000."That may or may not be the case for them, but one thing I am quite sure about is that it doesn't add up for Oxford, where the new regime of increased tuition charges for students, but greatly reduced government spending on teaching, have done little to change the basic financial equation."Along with ideas such as increasing philanthropic donations, he floated the idea of raising funds through issuing bonds to investors.The raising of tuition fees to £9,000 was a highly controversial measure, prompting violent protests and occupations, in the biggest upsurge of student activism for decades.Academics at the University of Oxford passed a symbolic motion of no confidence in Universities Minister David Willetts and his higher education funding reforms.But with the funding changes in place, the speech on Tuesday by Prof Hamilton shows there are still far-reaching financial questions for such leading institutions.How can they compete on an international stage with better-funded rivals?Harvard University's financial figures, released last month, showed the US university has an endowment that has grown to $32.7bn (£20.3bn).A fundraising drive by Harvard, launched last month, aims to raise an additional $6.5bn (£4bn).Last year, Oxford hailed the donation of £75m as "the largest such benefaction for undergraduate financial support in European university history".Responding to the speech, Sally Hunt, general secretary of the UCU lecturers' union said: "Prof Hamilton should perhaps be applauded for going after one of the rawest nerves in politics to try and get higher education funding back in the spotlight - something we fear no party will be keen to do this side of the general election."However, higher university fees are not what this country needs."Prof Hamilton is correct to say our universities need more funding - we invest just 1.4% of GDP on higher education, compared to an international average of 1.7%."However, he is wrong to argue that students should pick up tab when we already have the most expensive fees in Europe."</body>

      <title>Hi-tech $100 banknote goes into use</title>
      <description>The US Federal Reserve issues a new high-tech $100 banknote, comprising several new security features designed to beat the counterfeiters.</description>

      <date>1381195653</date>
      <body>The US Federal Reserve has issued a new hi-tech $100 banknote comprising several new security features.It includes a blue 3D security ribbon and a bell and inkwell logo that authorities say are particularly difficult to replicate.These combine with traditional security features, such as a portrait watermark and an embedded security thread that glows pink under ultraviolet light.The 2010 design was delayed because of "unexpected production challenges".The 3D security ribbon - which is woven into the note, not printed on it - features images of 100s that change into bells and move upwards or sideways depending on how you tilt the paper.Referring to the embedded security thread Chadwick Wasilenkoff, chief executive of security paper company Fortress Paper, told the BBC: "It's not a small incremental step up for security, it's a giant leap."Tilting also reveals a green bell within a copper-coloured inkwell to the right of the blue ribbon.In addition, the 100 number in the bottom right-hand corner shifts from copper to green.The redesigned banknote, which features a portrait of US founding father and scientist Benjamin Franklin, also includes raised "intaglio" printing that gives the notes a distinctive feel, and microprinted words that are difficult to read without magnification.Over a decade of research and development has gone into the new note, the Fed said, in a joint project with the US Secret Service and the Department of the Treasury.Advances in design software and high-resolution copying and printing have made it easier for counterfeiters to print fake money and harder for retailers to spot the forgeries.US authorities say that $100 bill is the most counterfeited of all US banknotes, but accurate figures for the total value of counterfeit cash in circulation are hard to come by.The US Secret Service estimates that counterfeit bills account for less than 0.01% of the $1.1 trillion (£683bn) of US money in circulation.It says about $80.7m of counterfeit currency changed hands domestically in 2012, and about $14.5m abroad.The authorities seized $9.7m in counterfeit cash before it could make it in to the US money supply, and seized $56.8m abroad in 2012.Bruce Schneier, security expert at BT, told the BBC: "Bills have to be easy to produce cheaply and in large quantities by the government, yet hard to reproduce in small quantities by counterfeiters."Making something that costs less than a dollar to produce and over $100 to reproduce is a very difficult problem."</body>

      <body>Bank card fraudsters have targeted Surrey residents in a series of attempted thefts over a period of 24 hours, police said.Ten reports of attempted scams were reported to police, with the latest three calls received just after 21:00 BST on Saturday.The fraudsters phone people claiming to be a police officer and try to get them to hand over cash and cards.Attempted thefts happened in Guildford, Woking, Pyrford, Burpham and Chobham.The callers use a variety of stories including saying the person's bank card has been used by somebody they have in custody.They then ask the card holder to phone the bank to cancel the card and say they will send a courier round to collect it.The fraudster stays on the line and obtains the person's bank details whilst they think they are phoning the bank.A courier then visits the victim's home, saying they have been sent by the police to collect the card.The latest calls were received in Upshot Lane, Woking; Frog Grove Lane, Wood Street Village and Burnet Avenue, Burpham.An attempt was also made in Boltons Lane, Pyrford at about 17:30 BST, when a man claiming to be a courier attempted to get bank cards from an elderly resident.He is described as white, aged about 40, 5ft 8in (1.7m) tall and spoke with an eastern European accent. He was stocky, with short dark hair and was wearing a dark jacket and trousers.Officers have urged anyone who receives a suspicious call not give away any details and to call the police.</body>

      <title>UK upturn 'is gathering momentum'</title>
      <description>A British Chambers of Commerce survey says the UK recovery is gaining pace, while a British Retail Consortium report underlines that some sectors remain fragile.</description>

      <date>1381220184</date>
      <body>UK companies saw sales and optimism jump in the third quarter, according to the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC).Service firms saw UK sales and orders rise at the fastest pace since 2007, while the rises for manufacturing were the sharpest since the early 1990s."It's clear that the UK upturn is gathering momentum," said David Kern, BCC chief economist.But a British Retail Consortium survey showed UK retail sales slowed for a second consecutive month in September."These figures are a reality check and will make retailers nervous as we enter the run up to Christmas," said David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG, which helped compile the BRC data.The British Chambers of Commerce said the results of its quarterly survey mean that it was likely to revise up its GDP forecasts for 2014.The quarterly survey is based based on responses from 7,400 companies, making it the UK's largest business survey.On the basis of the results, the BCC estimates that GDP growth will be in the region of 0.9% and 1% in the third quarter.The survey reported that employment prospects are brighter. A balance of 26% of services firms planned to increase staffing in the next three months, the highest reading since 2007.For manufacturing, the reading was 29%, the highest since the survey began in 1989.The BCC's director general, John Longworth, said in a statement: "It is fantastic to see our small yet dynamic manufacturing sector doing so well, with our results suggesting a recent growth spurt."However, we need to ensure that this does not become an aberration, but rather the norm, particularly when the economic recovery is still facing external risks."He said that levels of investment were still a concern, and that more support was needed for exporters through increased trade promotion and better access to finance."The Government mustn't get distracted, and has to put growth first at all times," Mr Longworth said."We will be looking ahead to the Autumn Statement in the hope that the chancellor uses this opportunity to make a real difference and go all out in the name of growth," he said.Meanwhile, the BRC data showed that like-for-like sales - which strip out changes in floor space as retailers open and close outlets - rose 0.7% in September. This was less than half the rate of growth of the previous two months.Grocery sales showed a weak performance in September, although sales of children's clothing and shoes put in a strong showing, due to the tail-end of the traditional back-to-school spending spree.The BRC said that a slowdown in food and drink sales reflected the tough battleground for market share. And the warm weather had also put people off spending on winter clothes."Consumers are still cautious about spending and are reluctant to restock their wardrobes with winter woollies until the weather cools," Mr McCorquodale said in a statement.The survey underlines that some sectors remain weak, despite a recent run of strong economic data.Some of Britain's biggest retailers, including Morrisons and Next, remain cautious about the strength of the UK recovery.</body>

      <title>Serbia announces austerity reforms</title>

      <date>1381248607</date>
      <body>Serbia has announced plans to cut public sector wages by as much as a quarter, as part of wide-ranging austerity measures.The reform package also includes raising taxes and slashing subsidies for loss-making companies.Finance Minister Lazar Krstic said Serbia would be bankrupt within two years if it did not take action now.The country is mired in a deep recession, with 25% of the workforce unemployed.Mr Krstic unveiled the measures during an open session of government in Belgrade."Even though these reforms, which some people would say are 20 years overdue - I'd say they're at least 10 years overdue - we can carry them out in a responsible way," he said.The measures should provide about 200m euros (£169m) annually, and a further 150m euros would be generated by reducing the so-called grey economy, smuggling and illegal tobacco trafficking, he said.The BBC's Guy DeLauney in Belgrade says the government is calling it a "solidarity tax" - but the public sector workers on the receiving end are likely to see it as a brutal wage cut.As public sector workers' income decreases, their expenditure will rise - because of an increase in sales tax.Jobs will go too because of a privatisation programme, with almost 200 state-run companies to be affected.Our correspondent says the government has won plaudits for anti-corruption campaigns and a pragmatic approach to Kosovo, but restructuring Serbia's long-neglected economy will be painful for hundreds of thousands of voters.</body>

      <title>EU exit would be suicide, says Clegg</title>
      <description>It would be "economic suicide" for Britain to leave the European Union and supporters must "speak up", Nick Clegg says.</description>

      <date>1381230965</date>
      <body>It would be "economic suicide" for Britain to leave the European Union, Nick Clegg has warned.The deputy PM said a new "coalition in the national interest" was needed to make the case for membership, and asked businesses and charities to help.He attacked David Cameron's proposed referendum, calling it a "short-sighted political calculation" which could see the UK "stumble out" of the EU.Eurosceptic group Business for Britain accused Mr Clegg of "scaremongering".In a speech at the London headquarters of Swiss technology firm Buhler Group, Mr Clegg said EU withdrawal would leave Britain "isolated and irrelevant in our own backyard" and not "taken seriously" by world superpowers.He has written to 100 businesses, charities and trade groups urging them to speak out about the benefits the EU brings."My great fear, in all of this, is that pro-Europeans are being too slow to wake up to the danger ahead," the Liberal Democrat leader said."The day I dread - the day I hope never comes - is a time when it is all too late: Britain has stumbled out of the EU, and we look back to these days and say we should have done more."It will not be enough to speak up on the eve of a referendum. We need to start challenging some of the ludicrous myth-making by the isolationists now."Mr Clegg said he accepted a referendum was inevitable but believed it should be held after the change to EU rules.Mr Cameron has promised a public vote on EU membership in 2017 if the Conservatives win the next general election.But Mr Clegg said that was designed to "plaster over" internal Tory divisions over Europe until after the 2015 general election.Mr Clegg said: "Next May the Euro elections are bound to become a proxy for the bigger questions of 'in versus out' - a debate that will play out in the 2015 general election, too."He argued that "you cannot overstate the damage" that leaving the EU would do and predict that having to negotiate individual trade treaties would take a decade."We simply will not be taken seriously by the Americans, the Chinese, the Indians, all the big superpowers, if we're isolated and irrelevant in our own backyard," he said.On Sunday Conservative backbench MP Adam Afriyie said he would try to force the government to hold the referendum in 2014, and Mr Clegg said it was "not even clear" Mr Cameron would be able to delay the vote until 2017.He also questioned whether any reform of Britain's relationship with the EU would "ever be acceptable to the large swathes in the Conservative Party who want to be semi-detached from the EU or out of it altogether".Business for Britain chief executive Matthew Elliott said: "Nick Clegg has shown today that he is out of touch with how the majority of the British people, including thousands of British business people, feel about the European Union."He added: "Contrary to what he said in this speech, it is the deputy prime minister rather than David Cameron who is 'playing with fire'. By writing off the process of renegotiation before it has even properly begun, Nick Clegg is increasing the likelihood of Britain voting to leave."But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: "Nick Clegg is right to make the case for the EU and say that paid holidays and other workplace rights are some of the best arguments for EU membership. Leaving the EU would be disastrous for jobs and investment."Separately, in a Westminster debate on UK-US relations, Conservative MP Michael Fabricant said: "The United States is very keen that we remain in the European Union but that is partly because some US diplomats have said privately they think the United Kingdom is the only sane voice in the European Union when it comes to some issues."</body>

      <description>A profile of Harriet Green, the boss of Thomas Cook, and how she is trying to turnaround the fortunes of Thomas Cook.</description>

      <date>1381152216</date>
      <body>It is safe to say that Harriet Green, the boss of Thomas Cook, is not lacking in confidence - or the desire to take on a big challenge.Ms Green was appointed chief executive of the UK-based travel company in July 2012, after she cold-called the chairman and told him she was the right person to lead the troubled group's recovery.At that time Thomas Cook, the world's oldest travel business, was struggling with losses caused by a general fall in tourism numbers as a result of the global recession, and unrest in the Middle East hitting its package holidays to Egypt and Tunisia. The company was also saddled with debts of more than £1bn.Ms Green, 51, was convincing enough to be given the job, despite having no previous experience of working in a travel company.She says her strength of purpose can be traced back to coping with the death of her father when she was 14."You know I lost a parent in my early teens, and for a child that is the worst that can happen," she says. "And if you can cope with that, pretty much everything else - except a very similar situation of loss - is unlikely to derail you."Staff engagementMs Green, who was previously boss of electronic components distributor Premier Farnell for six years, says her first job at Thomas Cook was to boost staff confidence, and get them on side."You need to be really working on the psychology of the business, building belief, beginning to rebuild a culture, giving people a self, a sense of renewed self-esteem," she says.Ms Green emailed all 35,000 employees, asking them to share with her "everything you think and feel about what we need to do in this company".More than 8,000 workers replied, sharing "chapter and verse" with her.And while Ms Green continued to formulate her detailed plan for the turnaround, she says she was aware that she had to calm her own go-getting, no-nonsense attitude."Thomas Cook was quite unwell and so... I moderated my style and approach," she says."I was much less edgy, much less aggressive. I was still very focused on time and the issues, but [at the same time] creating this environment where people could believe."However, Ms Green did show early steel when she replaced most of the previous Thomas Cook board.Ms Green said the core turnaround focus was then very simple - "managing our cash better and reducing cost".In March of this year, she unveiled her strategy. The company intends to save £350m by 2015, largely through cutting the number of its physical stores, and focusing instead on internet sales. At the same time, non-core parts of the business will be sold.More than 2,500 jobs are going, and 199 shops out of 1,069 in the UK are shutting.Transport union TSSA, which represents many Thomas Cook staff, was angry at the job losses, but says they were the result of "the over expansion and bad decisions" of Thomas Cook's previous regime.In May the company completed a £1.6bn capital refinancing, which helped to halve its net debt. Then in August it announced that its nine-month losses had fallen to £470m from £667m a year earlier.Meanwhile, on Monday, 7 October the company announced the sale of two businesses in Egypt and Lebanon. The two units in question - Thomas Cook Egypt and Thomas Cook Lebanon - offer outbound travel to Egyptian and Lebanese customers.The markets have so far welcomed Ms Green's efforts, and Thomas Cook's share price has soared. In May of last year, before she joined, the shares were trading at 21 pence each. They finished last month at 153.13p.TSSA is also hopeful that the company is now moving in the right direction.Manuel Cortes, its general secretary, says: "We believe that Thomas Cook staff are its biggest asset and that the company is now back on track. We are confident that it can once again be a successful company and a great British brand."Ms Green herself says she should be judged after five years in the job.As Ms Green continues her work at Thomas Cook, she says successful chief executives have a wide range of skills, which she terms "a rich DNA toolkit".While she highlights traits such as resilience, agility, and ability to lead speedy change, she says the most important factor is the need to be good with people, something she sees in herself.Ms Green says: "It is my experience that [chief executives] that really enjoy people - either love to develop them, or coach them or support them, or engage with their work - are much more successful than those who really are great on strategy, love the numbers, but don't really love the people aspect."I think there is an authenticity that comes through, and if you don't love the people that you work with, that begins to show. So I think it's hard to be a successful [chief executive] if you don't really like working, developing [and] supporting other people."Ms Green adds that the DNA needed to make a good chief executive is "not gender specific". However, she does agree that more needs to be done to see more female bosses of large companies."There are gender issues associated with why there are so few of us female [chief executives], but I think that's a different issue about role-modelling, education, the media that we can all help with," she says.Regarding the future of Thomas Cook, which traces its history back to 1841, Ms Green has eyes on East Asia."Thomas Cook is not yet in the East, which I think is an amazing opportunity," she says. "Helping Chinese and Korean customers to explore Europe would be amazing."Yet despite the big plans for Thomas Cook's future, Ms Green says she won't stay forever."I generally think [chief executives] spend far too long in the same business," she says. "I think you should... make the business great, stay around a little while to enjoy that, and then probably move on to the next thing."</body>

      <title>The drink of kings makes a comeback</title>
      <description>Mead, the stuff of kings and Renaissance fairs, is growing in popularity again in the US, as the BBC's Kim Gittleson reports.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24184527</url>
      <date>1380755618</date>
      <body>Long relegated to the dusty corners of history, mead - the drink of kings and Vikings - is making a comeback in the US.But what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe."Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour.When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel."If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works," he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge."We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day," explains Mr Alexander.It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead."It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages," he gushes.After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business.His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US.It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China.Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead.Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade."We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years," she says."I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once."Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree.Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead "is becoming more and more available - similar to cider".Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry.But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments."I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is," says Mr Alexander."You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience."The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers who were just looking for something good to pair with food. But mead has since changed."People don't realise that just because it has honey in it, [mead] doesn't need to be sweet," says Ms Rowe, citing the proliferation of not only dry meads but also meads flavoured with fruits, herbs, and spicy peppers.Yet hampering efforts towards building mead awareness is also the name mead itself.Technically, mead is classified as wine by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which regulates alcohol sales and labelling in the US.This means that mead has to be labelled as "honey wine", which doesn't help combat people's perception of the drink as being as cloyingly sweet."How do people recognise it as mead if you can't say the word?" says Ms Rowe.Ironically, the alcoholic beverage that most credit with the resurgence of the mead business is beer.The craft brewing movement, which was recently singled out in a report by the Atlanta Federal Reserve as a source of job growth, inspired many home brewers to expand their repertoire."I was a home brewer, and at first I liked mead because I had never had it," says Brad Dahlhofer of B Nektar meadery in Detroit, Michigan."Every home brewer has the same dream of, 'Hey what if I could sell this? Wouldn't that be great?'" he says.After he spent months making batch after batch of mead, perfecting his recipe, he realised that mead was "kind of an untouched category", and that no-one, at least back in 2008, was really doing it commercially.So when he and his wife, Kerri, were both laid off of their jobs in Detroit's car industry during the recession, they decided to take the plunge.Now, B Nektar is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, US meadery, shipping 1,100 cases a week across the country.But for Mr Dahlhofer and his fellow mead enthusiasts, that's just the beginning."If you look at craft beer 25 years ago, they had 1% of the total beer market, and now they have 8%," says Maine Mead's Mr Alexander."So we've got a long way to go, but I feel like it's got the opportunity because of the diversity of the beverage."You've got a canvas with very few limits."</body>

      <title>Putting the best foot forward</title>
      <description>The BBC's Jennifer Pak speaks to Lew Fong Voon about his passion for shoe design and how he came to create his own brand in Malaysia.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24330094</url>
      <date>1380668759</date>
      <body>What makes an entrepreneur? The BBC's Jennifer Pak spoke to Lew Fong Voon (now known as Lewre Lew) about discovering his passion for shoe design while working in a manufacturers and how, despite initial obstacles, he came to create his own brand.In 1991, Lew Fong Voon thought he had a big break when his shoe trading company was chosen as one of nine businesses to represent Malaysia at an international exhibition.He gathered all of the best designs sourced from Malaysian factories because he said that the GDS fair in Germany was "like the Olympics" of the shoe industry.But nobody looked at his collection.People had no idea where Malaysia was or how to even pronounce the name of the country, said Mr Lew."It was very discouraging and at the same time humiliating," he said.Mr Lew did not get any business that year or the next two years after that but he continued to show up at the annual international shoe fair even when the other Malaysian companies had given up.He believed Malaysia had very good shoe craftsmen but didn't have updated designs. Bringing back ideas from the fair, he aimed to change this.In the fourth year, two customers finally ordered a thousand pairs of shoes from Mr Lew. The small shipment helped launch his overseas business.Over the next decade he produced shoes for international labels, but there was a slow push in the country to not only rely on natural resources and cheap manufacturing.Mr Lew was inspired to work on his own brand after he met fellow Malaysian designer Jimmy Choo.He produced his mid-priced collection under the name Lewre, a loose combination of his surname and the name of his first company, Roondy, in 1997 at the start of the Asian financial crisis.The venture was risky but it also meant that production costs became cheaper, he says.Mr Lew's company weathered the financial crisis. He attributes this to the fact that his childhood prepared him for the tough battle. He was one of ten children in his family. Food was a struggle. At eight years old, he started working at a plantation in northern Perak state, tapping rubber trees before dawn to help make ends meet for his family.Mr Lew 's commute to work required him to walk across terrain filled with snakes and the sounds of tigers growling nearby."It was full of challenges [and] I think full of fun," he said.Today, Mr Lew has exchanged the jungle for a spacious office on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur and has expanded his brand to more than 20 countries.He turned an initial capital investment of RM50,000 ($15,000; £10,000) in shoe manufacturing in the late 1980s into a company whose revenue is expected to reach $25m (£15.5m) in three years' time.At the Lewre headquarters in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia, middle-aged women sit in the back of the workshop sewing each bead onto a satin heel.Mint-green shoe moulds belonging to affluent women, including actress Michelle Yeoh and the Duchess of Cambridge, hang in the backroom.The recent global downturn has not slowed down Mr Lew's expansion plans. He is set to open a couture shop in London and the company has invested millions to develop several new sub-brands.Mr Lew describes his designs as "fashion forward". He wants to prove that Asian brands can produce quality products that appeal to a global audience.His future projects could make even more customers take notice - Mr Lew has considered designing high-heel shoes for men.It was normal for women to wear 4-5in (10-13cm) heels now, so as our women got taller so the men needed to "catch up," said Mr Lew.</body>

      <body>The NFL will stage three games in London next year as it pushes towards having a franchise in the city.The Jacksonville Jaguars, Atlanta Falcons and Oakland Raiders will all play 'home' games in 2014 at Wembley against opponents yet to be named.The Jaguars face the San Francisco 49ers this month in the first of four games they have committed to play at Wembley each year until 2016."Our fans in the UK want more," said NFL commissioner Roger Goodell."Both of this year's games in London sold out quickly. The fan enthusiasm for our sport continues to grow."By playing two games in the UK this year, we are creating more fans. We hope that with three games in London next year we will attract even more people to our game."Last month, a crowd of more than 83,000 watched the Minnesota Vikings beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 34-27 at Wembley.Wembley has hosted regular-season games every year since 2007, but this season is the first in which it has staged more than one match.The Jaguars are owned by Fulham owner Shahid Khan, and he is keen for the team to create a strong link with UK fans by returning regularly.Khan said: "The experience the Jaguars have had already in London has been every bit what we anticipated and more, and this is all before we've even played our first game in Wembley Stadium."We made the right decision to commit to playing a home game in London each season through 2016."Atlanta and Oakland will be venturing outside the United States to play a regular-season game for the first time.The Raiders were last in London for a pre-season contest against the New Orleans Saints at the old Wembley Stadium in 1990.</body>

      <body>Rangers chief executive Craig Mather and finance director Brian Stockbridge have held discussions in South Africa with Dave King over the club's future.King invested heavily during Sir David Murray's Ibrox reign and maintained interest during recent club events.But issues with South African tax authorities prevented him from playing a more significant role.King recently agreed to pay almost £44m to the Revenue Service as criminal charges against him were dropped.A spokesman for the Rangers board told BBC Scotland: "Craig Mather and Brian Stockbridge have been meeting a number of investors."Craig is returning from South Africa tonight (Monday) and has also been in Dubai. Brian was in South Africa last week."King did not wish to comment when contacted by BBC Scotland.He has, however, spoken in recent weeks of his desire to invest in Rangers.The Glasgow-born businessman has been a fierce critic of both Charles Green, who led a purchase of the business and assets of The Rangers Football Club Plc, and Craig Whyte, whose ownership ended with that company going into administration and then liquidation.You can follow Alasdair on Twitter: @BBCAlLamont </body>

      <title>Profile: Janet Yellen</title>
      <description>The first woman to lead the US central bank</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24263548</url>
      <date>1381301942</date>
      <body>Janet Yellen is now expected to succeed Ben Bernanke as chair of the US Federal Reserve, becoming the first woman to lead the Fed.As Mr Bernanke's deputy for the past two years, she was widely seen as the most likely candidate after the surprise withdrawal of former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers from the race on 15 September.President Barack Obama received a letter signed by 350 economists last month urging him to choose Ms Yellen, and she was the preferred candidate of many Senate Democrats.The economists pointed to her early warning about the sub-prime mortgage crisis, democratic leadership style and commitment to job growth.But she was not thought to be Mr Obama's favourite, having spent the financial crisis outside of his close circle of economic advisers.Brooklyn-born Ms Yellen, 67, has a strong academic background, with firm connections to both of the highest-ranked Ivy League universities.She received her PhD in economics from Yale in 1971 and went from there to be an assistant professor at Harvard until 1976.Her first link to the US central bank came when she took up a job as an economist with the Fed's board of governors from 1977 to 1978.After a further series of academic posts, she served as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers from 1997 to 1999, while former US President Bill Clinton was in office.Financial markets generally preferred her over Mr Summers, because her approach was seen as being similar to Mr Bernanke's.Investors believe that she will continue Mr Bernanke's extraordinary efforts to prop up the US economy longer than Mr Summers would have.This is because she is thought to have a more relaxed attitude than Mr Summers to inflation, preferring instead to prioritise boosting employment by keeping rates lower for longer.In the jargon of the markets, she is seen as a "dove".This view of "business as usual" under Ms Yellen is held not just by investors, but by central bank insiders as well.William Dudley, president of the New York Fed, said on 23 September that she was unlikely to make major policy changes.He told CNBC that he thought Ms Yellen's approach "would be very consistent with the monetary policy that we've had in the past".Ms Yellen is far from being the only economist in her family. She is married to the Nobel Prize-winning economist, George Akerlof, an emeritus professor at the University of California, Berkeley.Prof Akerlof was awarded the prize in 2001 for a study he had written more than 30 years earlier, which analysed the used car market as one in which the buyer and seller had different levels of information in a transaction.The couple's son, Robert, has followed in his parents' footsteps. However, he has crossed the Atlantic in order to do so. He is now an assistant professor in economics at the University of Warwick in England.</body>

      <description>Bribery and corruption in the classroom</description>

      <body>Corruption in education is a serious blight that undermines the quality and availability of schools and universities around the world, according to an international report.Anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International have published a global survey showing that about one in six students has had to pay a bribe for education services.In parts of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia this might be requiring parents to pay a fee for a school place that should be free.In Eastern Europe, it might be paying to gain an advantage in university admissions.The Berlin-based campaign group is best known for its annual "global corruption barometer", which measures levels of dishonest payments in more than 100 countries, based on more than 114,000 household interviews.This year's survey also asked questions about people's first-hand experiences and perceptions of dishonesty in education.In some countries these perceptions are distinctively negative. The report says that almost three-quarters of people in Cameroon and Russia see their education systems as "corrupt or highly corrupt".The findings show a huge range of malpractice.In Pakistan, there are warnings of thousands of "shadow schools" without any real students, but drawing public funding to pay for "ghost teachers"."Leakages" in the funding of schools in Kenya had the equivalent value of losing more than 11 million text books, says the report. A study of 180 schools in Tanzania showed that more than a third of intended funds had failed to reach the school.In Greece there are warnings about nepotism in jobs and promotions in higher education.In Vietnam there is a problem with bribery for places in the most sought-after schools.The report quotes figures from the United Nations showing 110 countries where fees are levied, despite in theory having free education enshrined in law. The report describes "myriad pretexts" to impose charges on parents.So why should education be so vulnerable to corruption?Parents want the best for their children, says the report, and they can be exploited by unscrupulous officials controlling access to places.It also involves a great deal of public money filtering down from central government to local school authorities. In Nigeria, the report says, $21m (£13m) intended for schools was lost in two years.But it's not only a problem for the developing world or those providing the basics of schooling.The massive expansion in demand for university education has created rich opportunities for illicit charges.Students need degree-level qualifications more than ever and are under great pressure to get university places and to leave with good grades, opening up fertile territory for corruption and cheating.Eastern European and former Soviet states are highlighted as having had particular difficulties.In Georgia, there have been reforms to stop corruption in university admissions. This hadn't simply been "cash-filled envelopes", but included a complex system of having to buy tutoring, Transparency International found.There could also be more practical types of illicit charges, with suggestions that in Romania access to university accommodation depended on bribery.The demand for qualifications has also generated its own industry in fake universities.In the United States, the report estimates, there are about a thousand "degree mills" in operation, selling bogus qualifications.This isn't only harmless self-delusion, says the report, as these bought qualifications are used to gain graduate jobs, including in one case working in a nuclear power plant.It also highlights the case of Colby Nolan, a student who ostensibly gained an MBA degree in 2004, until his owner revealed that the graduate was a six-year-old cat. He had gained the equivalent of an upper second class degree.The growth of higher education as a globalised, multi-billion dollar business has also spawned a parallel opportunity for fraud, says Philip Altbach, director of the Center for International Higher Education in the Lynch School of Education at Boston College.He has described the "spectre of corruption haunting" the move towards a more internationalised higher education system.And he has called for more co-ordinated international efforts to set standards and share information.The Transparency International study says that corruption has a corrosive effect on education, raising the cost and lowering the quality."Many people wouldn't realise the extent of corruption in education, right through from the financing of education through to academic corruption," says report editor, Gareth Sweeney."In some countries it's such a serious problem that it could undermine the credibility of their education systems."There is some good news as the report highlights efforts to tackle bribery.In Chile, anti-corruption lessons have been introduced to the school curriculum and in Bangladesh there is an "integrity pledge" taken by officials.The proliferation of mobile phones in Africa is being used to allow people to expose concerns about bribery in schools.Legal advice centres have also been developed in a number of countries to help community groups make legal challenges against school corruption.There are also international efforts to improve the monitoring and tracking of education funds.But corruption is still there leaching away education budgets. It's a particularly bleak problem when there are still tens of millions of children without any access to school."Corruption is an obstacle to a fundamental human right to education," says Mr Sweeney.While there are campaigners calling for education for all, such as Malala Yousafzai in Pakistan, this report also warns of the barriers being created for the poorest communities by demands for corrupt payments.Teachers take bribes to offset poor wages or irregular payments and that in turn raises questions about the lack of funding coming from higher up the chain.Mr Sweeney says that there should be a way of measuring good governance in any future global education targets."Even when formal school fees are abolished, many households are still being forced to pay informal fees. How is a family supposed to be able to afford these costs, when they cannot afford their daily meals?," says Pauline Rose, director of Unesco's Global Monitoring Report, which tracks progress towards primary education for all."Until these hidden costs are eradicated, we will not be able to call education free, and universal primary education will continue to remain a distant goal for the poorest."</body>

      <title>My Business Asia: Touring Taiwan</title>
      <description>Entrepreneur who helps visitors tour Taiwan like a local</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24427027</url>
      <date>1381276427</date>
      <body>What makes an entrepreneur? The BBC's Cindy Sui hears from Yen Tseng, a Taiwanese Canadian who, with his elder brother, founded a travel business called iBeengo. It takes tourists off the beaten track and helps them experience Taiwan the local way.Yen Tseng got the idea to start a travel business about a year ago because he loved to travel. He was born in Taiwan and attended middle school there, but went to Canada for his early, secondary and university education. By the age of 25, he had travelled to 25 countries.But starting this business in Taiwan wasn't an easy decision for him and his brother Ronnie, 30. Both are highly educated and their family had expectations of them. "The biggest risk is still the fact that we didn't take the nine-to-five job and we didn't take a stable salary."Initially, Yen and his brother wanted to help people take the pain out of travelling - so with a loan of one million New Taiwan dollars ($34,000; £21,000) from their parents, they created iBeengo in September 2012. It allows travellers to pick and choose the itinerary they want and create custom-made tours.Most of their clients are Chinese independent student travellers curious about Taiwan who see visiting the island as a lifelong dream. Many are women because they like to get out there and explore, but also want the safety of being in a tour with a local guide, Yen says.What makes iBeengo's tours different from those of big travel agencies is that they allow travellers to sleep in if they want, skip parts of the tour and rejoin the group later, take their time at each location, and request locations off the itinerary."People don't actually like bus tours. Bus tours are like food on a flight, there's no choice. What we do is buffet style; you come here, pick out what you want, and go at the pace you like," said Yen.Some of the places iBeengo takes tourists to are popular scenic attractions, and they also offer free walking tours for interested tourists.Wearing their eye-catching bright green iBeengo t-shirts, Yen, his brother, and college-student volunteers point out locally known trivia, such as the stall that sells the best Taiwanese fried chicken patty at a night market, the locations where popular Taiwanese films were shot, or the childhood hangout of a Taiwanese pop singer.In its first year, iBeengo has taken 400 tourists around Taiwan. Yen says they try to keep their average tour size to fewer than 15 people and aim for an ideal ratio of one tour guide to five tourists, much less than the traditional ratio of one guide to 30 travellers.What makes starting up a business relatively low cost for Yen is that he and Ronnie hooked up with a start-up incubator which rents office space to young companies cheaply. They pay only NT$3,000 per person per month.Advertising in person also helps them cut costs. They fly to China to drop off brochures at universities and advertise on Chinese websites to reach out to their target customers - young Chinese people.IBeengo for the moment is mainly a travel exchange programme for students, but the brothers are hoping to raise the US$200,000 (£125,000) to register their company as a fully functioning tourism business for all.In the future the brothers plan to operate tours around Japan and further afield. But for now, they are enjoying helping tourists from mainland China - Taiwan's former rivals during the war decades ago - get to know the island and see not only its scenic beauty but unique character."Just the fact that our customers are going home and telling their friends about us and their friends are coming to us asking us to organise tours for them, that gives us a lot of satisfaction," Yen said.</body>

      <title>Escape games attract Hong Kong youth</title>
      <description>How breaking out of rooms is becoming big business</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24424943</url>
      <date>1381187165</date>
      <body>When 27-year-old commercial video producer Danny Ip wants to blow off steam, he does not automatically head to the nearest shopping mall or karaoke joint.Instead the Hong Kong native is fond of frequenting a non-descript office building in the heart of the city's Tsim Sha Tsui neighbourhood.Inside, behind several doors, he can choose to escape to the old American West, a Chinese Wuxia (martial arts) adventure, a gory haunted house or a cartoon wonderland - but only for 45 minutes at a time.Mr Ip is a fan of playing real-life room escape games, the latest trend to catch on with Hong Kong's young, technology-savvy generation."Hong Kong is a busy city. We don't have much time for leisure," he said after a recent game with three of his friends."We always go to the same stuff, like karaoke and bars. It's the same thing over and over again. But this is something new, something different. That is why we enjoy it here."His friend, Ophelia, agrees: "It's very smart and full of imagination. You trap yourself inside a room and you have to use all your brain juice to come out. I think it is fun."The group had just successfully solved a series of puzzles and escaped from cowboy country.In reality, they were playing in a series of three small rooms designed to look like Wild West.It is the physical equivalent of computer games Mr Ip played as a child. But instead of playing alone, you must join forces with at least one other person, solving riddles and breaking codes as a team.The games, in either Chinese or English, are being offered by Freeing Hong Kong, the first company in the city to offer room escape games.It was started less than a year ago by chief executive Raymond Sze and three other partners. They estimate about 100,000 people have played so far.The company now has locations in five Hong Kong neighbourhoods, as well as Taipei, Singapore, Macau and Guangzhou.All the games are created in-house by a team of about three dozen developers led by Mr Sze, who is also a 20-year-old student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (UST).His parents were entrepreneurs, but they did not want the same for their son. Instead, they admonished him to study hard.But Mr Sze, who got his first job at 16, had other ideas. He was dying to start his own business and fulfilled his dream at the age of 19, when Freeing Hong Kong opened."One of the reasons they like to play these games is that it provides a different experience for them. Maybe they want to escape from reality, because you know, reality is very stressful and very competitive," Mr Sze says."It's not because they need to think about their food or their way to live. It is something about society's expectations. They need to achieve so many things."Although Hong Kong is one of the wealthiest cities in Asia, its success has made life difficult for many young people, who struggle to land high-paying jobs to get their foot on the property ladder.The city has some of the most expensive real estate in the world - a recent survey from the Chinese University of Hong Kong suggests salaries are falling far short of property prices.And locals are increasingly competing against ambitious mainland Chinese and Western expatriates for jobs.Mr Sze says he wants to create a healthy outlet for players."You know, Hong Kong people love computer games and actually they lack communication with their friends or their family. In these games, they need to solve the problems and co-operate with each other," he says.The four founders were friends who loved Japanese comics, mysteries and adventure novels.It takes anywhere from a week to three months to come up with a concept. Because they get many repeat players, all the games must be updated or replaced regularly.Mr Sze jokingly calls his school the "University of Stress and Tension", and is currently taking a year off to focus on expanding the firm.He says he had no idea how to set up a company at first. "I Googled everything: how to start a company, how to get a licence, how to get fire insurance," he recalls, laughing.The work seems to have paid off, at least personally."Actually it was very tough for me at the very beginning, but after a few months, when the game became more popular, my parents started to see the media coverage and said, 'Okay, you can take a gap year for this'."</body>

      <description>Celebrating the Pi with fire, vegetables and pets</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24395858</url>
      <date>1381187049</date>
      <body>There's no doubt that the Raspberry Pi bare-bones computer has captured the imagination of makers, hackers and artists around the world.The computers have been put to some novel uses, including a controller for a robot boat that is piloting itself across the Atlantic Ocean.As the millionth Raspberry Pi rolls off its UK production line, the BBC takes a look at a few of the more ambitious and creative projects that the bare-bones computer has made possible.Created by US teenager Chris Marion, Fire Hero mates the Raspberry Pi with canisters of propane and a microcontroller to add pyrotechnic effects that synchronise to music being played on an electric guitar.Hit the right notes and flames will shoot from a rig of six small propane "poofers", four medium-sized "poofers" and two huge cannons.The big ones produce flames that shoot more than 30m (100ft) into the air.Mr Marion said work on the original Fire Hero began in 2010, but the Pi helped him refine his control of the flames.The Pi sits at the centre of the system, reading data from the guitar and passing it to a separate device that opens and closes valves releasing the propane that is then ignited.Programming the Pi to act as the controller was not the hardest part of the project, he told the BBC."The real programming magic lies in the intelligent note and chord detection algorithms to transfer the data stream from the instruments to the Fire Hero device," he said.Fire Hero 3 has been shown off at a few music festivals in the US and its success has led Mr Marion to plan a bigger, flamier set up that, he estimates, will be six times the size of the latest version.It will still have a Pi at its core and is set to debut at a festival in 2014."My vision is to be able to bring a revolutionary new kind of special effects to live performances that enthrals the audience and provides additional sensory stimulation to further immerse them in the performance," he said.The Pi is not just helping people, man's best friends are benefiting too.In particular, a Hungarian vizsla dog called Judd has done very well thanks to a Pi-controlled treat dispenser.Created by Judd's owner, John Saunders, the little web-connected gadget dispenses doggy treats when an email is sent to a specific address.The dispenser drew on many of Mr Saunders's skills, but as he was weakest at coding, getting the Pi to co-ordinate all the moving parts had been tricky, he said."I'm not a programmer by trade, so that was much harder for me than the machining and design," he said.At the time the project was being developed, there was little information or code examples online to help get the gadget working. A web-based appeal helped him debug his code.The Pi was essential to the interactive part of the treat dispenser, he said. Rival controllers, such as the Arduino, were just as good at connecting to electronics but the Pi was much better when it came to working with the web."The machine received so many emails (including corresponding "thank you" emails) that Google shut down the account due to spam-suspicion - so that was frustrating," he added.Judd liked it too."The servo motor does a 'wiggle' upon receiving an email (which happens a few seconds before the treats fall out)," Mr Saunders told the BBC. "Judd learned to recognise this servo noise just about anywhere in the house and would run over to the machine."Most Pi projects just use one of the machines as a central controller. But one was nowhere near enough for Simon Cox, an engineering professor at the University of Southampton.Prof Cox created a supercomputer for less than £2,500 using 64 interconnected Raspberry Pi devices. The computing cluster runs off mains power and can address 1TB of memory."Building it was absolutely not about computer power," he said. Instead the system, dubbed Iridis Pi, was built to help people get to grips with the computational challenges of working with large numbers of tightly connected computers."It's about understanding all the pain of getting them to work together and the intricacies of building an algorithm to use them," he said.That was a skill all engineers needed in order to design and test their ideas, he said, but one that few had a chance to exercise before they reached university.The schematics and software for Iridis-Pi had been publicly released so anyone could replicate it and start developing that much-needed competence with computational science, said Prof Cox.Most Pi-based projects flaunt their wires and make a virtue of the tiny computer at their heart. Not so with Scott Garner's Beet Box project.In the creation of these interactive vegetables, Mr Garner, a designer and craftsman, was more interested in what he calls "invisible technology"."I like the idea of the next generation growing up in a world that isn't all screens and buttons - I think some nice wood and a few vegetables make for a good alternative," he said."Having done some experiments with both capacitive sensors and 'edible circuits', I decided it would be interesting to combine both concepts," he added."I spent a little time trying to think of the perfect vegetable-instrument combo and once I hit on beats from beets there was no looking back."The Pi won out over other ways to connect up and control sensors and speakers because of its processing power. Despite its flexibility this Pi project did present some unique problems."Dealing with produce as part of a circuit definitely comes with some challenges," said Mr Garner."The biggest difficultly is that as the beets dry out, their ability to conduct the touch signals is weakened."In practice, though, they suffered cosmetic damage from so many hands long before they failed as sensors, so having a few spares at the ready was necessary."The Raspberry Pi computers that Brendan O'Connor has used for his project are also hidden, albeit for very different reasons.Mr O'Connor has used the devices to help create some passive surveillance devices that can sit and sip the air for all the data leaking out from smartphones, tablets and laptops.Mr O'Connor's plan was to spread a series of the Pi-powered sensors, or Distributed Object Locators (Dols), around a city and use them to gradually build up information about the gadgets that pass by.Each one is about the size of a can of spam and is battery powered so it could sit unobtrusively in a locker, on top of a cupboard or in a bush in a park for weeks grabbing data.The Pi helped make it possible to get the boxes co-ordinating the information they find and sending it to their controller.The boxes - called CreepyDols - gather up the many status and query messages sent out by the gadgets that people carry around, said Mr O'Connor.Most of them had no idea their gadgets were broadcasting this information or that it could be used to pick them out of a crowd."Even a very savvy user has no way to stop it being shared," he said.Passive surveillance systems were also finding a role in environmental monitoring, said Mr O'Connor, where many different local conditions, such as humidity, temperature and rainfall, needed to be logged over a long period of time.</body>

      <title>The tech modernising Kenya's matatus</title>
      <description>How tech is modernising Nairobi's ramshackle buses</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24426676</url>
      <date>1381187146</date>
      <body>Matatus - the ramshackle public minibuses seating between 14 and 24 people that zip along the streets of Kenya's capital Nairobi - carry a third of the city's residents to and from work each day.The journey from the city centre to the working-class suburb of Rongai takes between 45 minutes and two hours, depending on traffic.Yet inside the "Ferguson" matatu - named for its colourful images of the former Manchester United manager - half a dozen passengers seem oblivious to the length of their commute.Instead, they sit glued to their smartphones, checking the latest news, YouTube videos and catching up on emails.Ferguson is one of more than 1,000 matatus in the city now equipped with free wi-fi for passengers to enjoy through a service called Vuma Online, launched this April by Safaricom, Kenya's biggest telecom company.The goal, according to Kevin Bett of Safaricom, is to "convert [passengers] to internet users".But for matatu drivers and conductors it's giving them an edge over intense competition for passengers."We get more passengers," says Victor Njuguna, a Vuma-equipped matatu conductor. "They actually wait for our bus - they want to enjoy free wi-fi."Nairobi is East Africa's economic, business and technology hub.It has grown from half a million residents in the 1970s to more than three million today. It has grown outward, not upward resulting in an unplanned semi-urban sprawl.It is perhaps no surprise then that the city ranks as the fourth most painful commute in the world, according to IBM's Commuter Pain Index.The government estimates that traffic jams cost the economy more than 50m Kenyan shillings (£365,000; $585,000) per day in lost productivity, fuel consumption and pollution.While the government has ambitious plans to build new roads and bypasses for the city, and even establish a mass rapid transit system and rapid light rail by 2030, progress, like the traffic itself, seems painfully slow.Though Nairobi's commute is dreadful to most, for some of Kenya's burgeoning "silicon savannah" techies, it's an opportunity."Commutes can be up to three hours long," says Jeremy Gordon, chief executive of FlashCast, a Kenyan tech start-up. "That's a captive audience whose time is pretty under-used."Launched in 2012, FlashCast has designed a location-based advertising system for buses and matatus, using a red LED marquee display connected to a GPS unit and 3G modem installed in the vehicles.Yet advertising alone can be boring."If we can't make it an entertaining, engaging experience, it's not worth it for them," explains Mr Gordon. "We also display news headlines, short quizzes, games, word scrambles and discussion topics."For example, in April they asked riders on selected buses to nominate the #BestDressed Passenger on the bus.The replies ended up being a huge hit, with responses such as "Red lipstick grey top blue jeans seated back seat next 2 the window on the left side. #pliz…""People have a desire to be stimulated when they're sitting in traffic," says Mr Gordon, "so it's a win win."It's also a win for the vehicle owners, since they earn a share of the advertising revenues.However, entertaining commuters - and occasionally helping them hit on each other - isn't the only service FlashCast offers.Since its GPS units track vehicles in real time, it is making that traffic information available through its Android mobile app so that customers can track the location and movement of certain buses, to help figure out which route to take to beat the traffic.Traffic delays are just one part of Nairobi's commuter woes. A greater problem lies in the structure of the public transportation system itself - a semi-formal and chaotic set-up of 20,000 privately owned matatus and buses.Although in theory there may be set prices, the market forces of supply and demand come into play. So if it rains, for example, prices go up.And since passengers pay cash fares directly to drivers or conductors, the matatu and bus owners have no way of knowing how much profit their vehicles are making.As a result, owners simply demand a flat daily fee from their staff, with the remaining profits split between the driver and conductor.While in Europe and other parts of the world prepaid cashless systems for public transportation are the norm, in Nairobi cash is still king.Yet that may be about to change. In May, Google launched a cashless, prepaid card system for the city's public transport, called BebaPay.Conductors are equipped with small, NFC (near-field communication) enabled smartphones. Passengers simply tap their BebaPay card to the phone.Money is then digitally transferred from the card to the phone, and passengers get a message on their phone confirming the transaction.The physical BebaPay cards can be purchased and topped up with credit at various locations across the city. The service doesn't require a bank account - just a Google account - and the cards and phones work without an internet connection."Cashless will lead to greater transparency, accountability, organisation… and ultimately better public transportation infrastructure," says Denis Gikunda from Google's Nairobi office.BebaPay is part of Google's broader strategy to "simplify payments", he says, and improve lives of people in emerging markets."Transport was a great place to begin, because it captures all the problems - a lot of transactions, frequently, all cash-based."Eventually, he says, BebaPay will not just be used for transportation, but for payment services across the city - from taxis, to public toilets and small retail kiosks.These high-tech solutions are certainly helping commuters in various ways, but few address one of passengers' main concerns - safety.The World Health Organization's Global Status Report on Road Safety estimates that there were nearly 8,500 deaths from traffic incidents in Kenya last year.One-third of all fatalities are passengers, many a result of "unsafe forms of public transportation". The finger is often pointed at reckless matatu drivers."What [passengers] want most is safety - to arrive at the destination in one piece," says Simon Kimuta of the Matatu Owners Association of Kenya.For that, he says, what Nairobi needs is better fleet management to monitor activity, and vehicles fitted with gadgets to monitor speeding, so owners can react.Yet more simple methods may also be effective.An initiative called the Zusha Project, funded by Georgetown University, recently randomly assigned stickers to the passenger cabs of 2,500 matatus around Kenya, with mottos such as "stand up and speak up" against bad driving.The idea was to get passengers to complain directly to the drivers about their reckless driving.After looking at aggregated insurance data, the project found matatus with stickers were in fact half as likely to get into accidents.As Billy Jack, associate professor of economics at Georgetown University who was part of the project, puts it: "Sometimes it's a low-tech solution that works the best."</body>

      <title>The Republicans' debt limit gambit</title>
      <description>Why some Republicans want the US to breach the debt limit</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24393350</url>
      <date>1381193516</date>
      <body>A faction of the Republican Party believes it cannot lose the battle over raising the US government's borrowing limit - either they dismantle the Democrats' healthcare reform, or the country has to live within its means for a while. But will the rest of the party stick with them?It is a high-stakes gambit - the US has never before breached its authority to borrow money to fund its obligations, and most experts warn it could be catastrophic.But a group of hard-line conservatives in Congress think it is worth the risk.Dozens of Republican politicians, such as Steve King of Iowa, Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, and Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, have suggested in interviews that the US government could prioritise its payments in the event of a debt limit breach, choosing to fund some government expenses - while drastically cutting others."If you don't raise the debt ceiling, what that means is you have a balanced budget," Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said on CNN last week. "It doesn't mean you wouldn't pay your bills."The strategy hinges on convincing President Barack Obama that conservatives are willing to break the debt ceiling and devastate the Democratic Party's government priorities, while assuring Republican big-business backers that this would not destroy the economy.It is a fine line, but conservative grass-roots groups think they have found the silver bullet to kill Mr Obama's 2010 healthcare reform law, which Republican Representative John Fleming of Louisiana called in typical remarks "the most dangerous piece of legislation ever passed in Congress".If the debt limit is breached so that "Obamacare" can be destroyed and Americans be taught they can live with less government, so be it."Liberals might be so concerned about settling this issue because they do not want Americans to realize that we can survive just fine with a lot less government spending," Jeffrey Dorfman writes in Forbes. "Perhaps we will be better off in the long run if government gets a little taste of what so many families have been experiencing for years: staying within a budget."First-term Republican Representative Ted Yoho of Florida said in an interview with the Washington Post that hitting the debt limit would "bring stability to the world markets", as it would prove the country is serious about balancing its budget.Without the risk of a sovereign debt default, and with Democratic interests feeling the pain of a predicted 32% cut in overall government spending, the theory goes, Republicans would finally have a negotiating advantage."We hit the debt ceiling, and the world won't end," says Dean Clancy, vice-president of public policy for FreedomWorks, a conservative grassroots activism group."Once the public and Wall Street understand that default is not really a possibility, the president's leverage will be greatly diminished and a bipartisan compromise will be achievable."Other Republicans counter that such a strategy is both impractical and dangerous. Even if the treasury department could figure out how to prioritise payments, the uncertainty created by such an action would devastate financial markets."The issue here is honouring our debt obligations," says Bill Hoagland, a senior vice-president at the Bipartisan Policy Center who served as a budget aide to former Republican Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist."It's stupid, and it's unbelievable we're even having this conversation."Speaker of the House John Boehner, a reluctant recruit to the current budget fight over healthcare reform, has shown hesitation to take the plunge with the conservative caucus once more.Although he continues to assert that his party is united, there were reports in the media last week that he told nervous colleagues that he would not allow a default on the debt - even if that meant relying on Democratic support to pass a debt limit increase.Civil warAccording to Republican campaign strategist and pollster Matthew Towery, the hard-line conservatives will soon learn their plan is unworkable.As in the economic crisis of 2008, when Congress did not pass an economic rescue bill until the stock market took a 700-point drop, rank-and-file Republicans will turn once the financial markets show signs of stress, he says."The president has blatantly stated that Wall Street should be concerned," Mr Towery says. "He wants a drop, as he knows what that would do. They would have to take immediate action."At that point, enough Republicans would come around to give Mr Boehner cover to bring a debt limit increase to a vote in the House."The [Republican] House majority has a pack mentality until things start to go wrong," Mr Towery says. "Once that happens, Boehner not only will have the votes, he'll probably get a majority of the conference to go along with him."As the debt limit approaches, what has been termed a Republican "civil war" between hard-line conservatives and the party establishment may be approaching its end game.The conservative caucus has proven it is willing to continue to escalate the standoff until it achieves unconditional victory. With strong backing from voters at home and a view the "Obamacare" healthcare reform is an existential threat to the country, compromise is not an option.At some point, however, the rest of the Republican Party may decide it is ready to get off this ride."I think Republicans just want out of this mess altogether," Mr Towery says.</body>

      <description>More than £600m is to be handed out towards major projects in a bid to stimulate the economy in Wales, as local councils reel from cutbacks in funding from the Welsh government.</description>

      <body>More than £600m is to be handed out towards major projects in a bid to stimulate the economy in Wales.It includes £62m for the South Wales Metro transport project and £140m for a help-to-buy housing scheme.Finance Minister Jane Hutt says it will create or sustain 11,000 jobs and tackle poverty.The announcement comes a day after she unveiled big cuts for councils and in other areas to pay for a £570m increase in the health budget.One senior council figure warned some local authorities could "go bust".Ms Hutt announced a series of capital spending commitments, including:Ms Hutt said: "The tough economic conditions continue but I am determined to use every pound available to invest in infrastructure and boost economic growth in the long-term."Councils were still reeling from Tuesday's funding announcement by Ms Hutt and the likely knock-on on services such as leisure centres and libraries.Local government spending will fall from £4.648bn this year to £4.466bn next year, a cut in cash terms of 3.91% or 5.81% in real terms.Their budgets will be around 9% lower in real terms between now and 2015-16.Councillor Russell Goodway, cabinet member for finance on Cardiff council - Wales' largest local authority - said: "I think there will be some local authorities in Wales that will go bust in the next two or three years. They will run out of money."From where I am sitting we are in a very dark place this morning and I don't think that some local authorities are going to survive."He told BBC Radio Wales that Cardiff has to save £20m this year which it was struggling to achieve let alone the £50m in cuts it needs to find in 2014-15."Even if we stopped spending every single penny that we spend on discretionary services that would not be enough to cut our spending. We have got to find different ways of doing things."Steve Thomas, chief executive of the Welsh Local Government Association said the cuts will affect services."It's a very tough budget and it's £175m coming out of council services," he told BBC Wales."We can't keep delivering the range of services that we're currently delivering so it will impact on things such as leisure services, libraries, refuse collections and the conditions of our roads."We run something like 735 services so there's going to be a massive impact for the Welsh public."He added: "We're not the number one priority and clearly what has happened is with the mixture of Westminster cuts and the prioritisation of health spending, local government has become in effect the poor relation in terms of this budget."Mr Thomas said one way of making up the shortfall would be to raise council tax - he did not expect any councils to freeze their rates next year."We've yet to see the local government settlement but once we see it, I think there will be more pressure on the council tax," he said."It is a source of income but I think we've got to consult the public and see what services they want to prioritise."We've got three years to make these cuts and it's going to be a very tough period for local authorities to do that."In announcing her draft budget, Ms Hutt said it was not possible to "shield" all services from UK government spending cuts.She stressed the priority was to protect health, schools and universal benefits such as free prescriptions, school breakfasts and bus passes for older people.</body>

      <title>50% rise in children playing sport</title>
      <description>Almost 50% more children are taking part in sport and physical activity regularly than two years ago, says a survey by Sport Wales.</description>

      <body>Almost 50% more children are taking part in sport and physical activity regularly than two years ago, says a new study.Sport Wales' School Sport Survey also suggested boys were still more likely than girls to regularly join in sport.The body spoke to 110,000 pupils from nearly 1,000 schools across Wales.The number of children taking part in physical activity three times a week or more rose from 27% in 2011 to 40% in 2013.Sport Wales is responsible for increasing participation and improving performance in sport in Wales.Sport Wales chair Professor Laura McAllister said the figures showed sport and education were working together, and described the survey results as "encouraging".She added: "They also help us understand how to encourage tomorrow's generation to participate more in sport and physical activity."But there are still challenges ahead and we need to build upon the success that we are creating uniquely in Wales."We risk losing the enormous gains made if we do not listen to the voice of our children."At a time of public austerity it is not a question of more money. It is about investing in our children's future through the health, education and sports sectors working better together to give our children the best start in life."Earlier this year, a group led by Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson called for PE to be given the same status as maths and English.The Welsh government said it would consider the recommendation.Pembrokeshire badminton player Jordan Hart agreed that sport played a crucial part in her life.She competed in the School Games 2012, and now the 18-year-old is bidding to qualify for next year's Commonwealth Games."I don't know really what I would have done if I hadn't chosen to do sport," said Ms Hart, who is now studying a sports degree at Loughborough University."Personally, I think everybody should be involved in some sort of sport."It's a major factor in people's lives and it has definitely improved my life. I think it is definitely a positive."The results of the survey will give local authorities, education services and health boards detailed information to help boost the number of young people participating in sport and physical activity.Sarah Powell, chief executive of Sport Wales, said the survey showed its efforts had made a difference."The work in primary and secondary schools funded by Sport Wales over the last 10 years, with after-school clubs and the wider sports community, has opened up opportunities for every child to try out a wider variety of sports and physical activities."These have been delivered in an enjoyable and fun environment, building children's confidence and interest to do more."The School Sport Survey results build on other evidence suggesting an increase in participation since the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games - for instance sports club membership in Wales passed the 500,000 mark for the first time ever and there has been a big rise in disability sport opportunities."Although London 2012 was a point of inspiration, we need to sustain growth in sports participation through better understanding of young people and by delivering services they want."</body>

      <title>Lake legal row to end after 20 years</title>
      <description>A farmer is expected to win a 20-year-long legal battle for planning permission for a large lake on his land.</description>

      <date>1381300439</date>
      <body>A farmer is set to win a 20-year-long legal battle for planning permission for a large lake on his land.John Rogers built the Bwlchyllan lake and embankment in Lampeter in 1991 without permission and two years later Ceredigion council said the land had to be restored following safety fears.Mr Rogers has been fined twice by magistrates for ignoring an enforcement notice to restore the land.But now the council is set to accept the lake is now part of the landscape.The lake is on sloping land and is about 180m (590ft) long and 80m (262 ft) at its widest point with a depth of 3.7m (12 ft).A retrospective planning application was refused in January this year because it again failed to demonstrate that the lake was safe.But it has since been deemed "as safe as can reasonably be expected," allowing planners to approve the plans.Despite the long legal history, councillors are being asked to deal with this fresh application on its own merits.A planning report says the lake has now become part of the natural environment and landscape."Whether rightly or wrongly the lake has now been in existence since 1991, a period of over 20 years," says the report."As a result the site has been given the opportunity to develop naturally so it is surrounded by natural vegetation with reeds along the lake shore and on a small island in the centre of the lake."The embankment is now completely covered with mature vegetation which broadens densely on the lower reaches of the embankment."Meanwhile, structural engineers say because the lake and embankment have managed to survive significant flooding over the last 20 years, they should be considered stable.Councillors have also been told that there may be water voles at the lake and Natural Resources Wales wants an investigation to see if they do live there.But opponents are worried that the embankment is not safe and could give way at some point.Geoffrey Stubberfield, who lives near by, said: "We have concerns that the bank could be well unstable."Nobody saw how it was built. It's terribly dangerous. If there's a catastrophic collapse, it could mean lives."And Michael Jones, who also lives close to the lake, added: "There's evidence of weeping from it but it hasn't collapsed."</body>

      <title>Firm considers leisure park appeal</title>
      <description>The firm behind proposals for a leisure resort on Anglesey which could create 600 jobs, says it will appeal if planners do not reverse their decision to refuse it.</description>

      <body>The firm behind proposals for a leisure resort on a country park on Anglesey which would create 600 jobs, say they will appeal if planners do not reverse their decision to refuse it.Developer Land and Lakes wanted to create a "quality destination" leisure resort with about 800 lodges but it had faced opposition over its size and impact.The development is based at three sites at Penrhos, Cae Glas and Kingsland.But councillors rejected the plans by five votes to two with one abstention.The plans will now come back to a further meeting of the authority on 6 November because the refusal was against officers' advice.Land and Lakes chief executive Richard Sidi said an appeal would be the "last resort"."I'm shocked [with the refusal] after three years working with the planning officers who imposed quite extensive conditions," he told BBC Wales."I'm equally shocked at the reaction from the local people. We've had nearly 100 people begging us not to give up on the project."He added that someone had set up an online petition which had 600 signatures from the local area.The proposals submitted had planned for Penrhos to be the base for the leisure resort with approximately 500 lodges and cottages and a water park along with a sports hall, spas, saunas, restaurants, walking and cycling routes.Cae Glas would have been used in the short term to house workers for building the Wylfa B nuclear power station and will also be home to a hotel, football and cricket pitches.It would have later been turned into extra 315 lodges and a nature reserve will be created.The Kingsland site would initially have had 360 houses which would be used for construction workers building on the Cae Glas site before being turned into residential housing.Land and Lakes had been working with land owners Aluminium Metals, Anglesey council and the Welsh government on the matter.The former smelting works at the Anglesey Aluminium Metals (AAM) site was closed in 2009 and put up for sale the following year, with offers invited in the region of £10m.First Minister Carwyn Jones called the proposals "ambitious" when they were announced 12 months later, adding that the plans could "enhance the tourism offer of both Anglesey and north west Wales".Anglesey council also welcomed the proposals for the site.But opponents to the scheme have "significant" concerns over its size.Natural Resources Wales said it did not object to the proposal in principle but was concerned about the impact on an area of outstanding natural beauty.The development had conflicted with the adopted development plan which meant the Welsh government could have called in the application for determination had it been approved by Anglesey council."I want to make sure people realise the benefits this application brings," Mr Sidi added. "It should be a flagship for Wales."It's not a Centre Parcs, but it's similar. It's a real bonus - it's hundreds of millions of pounds we are looking to invest."I think there was a worry about the scale of the development but there's something bigger that's about to hit Anglesey and that's the Wylfa B project."An appeal is the last resort but we would have no option. We've got an officer's recommendation here."It's not a route we want to go down though."Following last week's decision to turn down the application, council leader Ieuan Williams and spokesman for economic development Aled Morris Jones said: "This has been an emotive application which has been met with much local objection."The application, however, also offered significant opportunities for job creation and economic growth which was also widely recognised."As planning committee members chose to vote against officer recommendation, there will now be a one month 'cooling off' period before the application returns to the committee to be ratified."</body>

      <description>Scam mail should be disposed of at sorting offices to help protect vulnerable people from fraudsters, a charity says.</description>

      <body>Scam mail should be filtered out at the beginning of the postal chain and disposed of at sorting offices to protect vulnerable people from receiving it, a charity has said.Age Cymru said barriers must be built between fraudsters and older people.It comes as a cross party group of Welsh AMs meet to discuss ways of preventing pensioners receiving scam mail.The National Fraud Authority said every year in the UK £6bn is lost to scams.Age Cymru's campaigns co-ordinator Gerry Keighley said: "We want to see some protection for older people and for vulnerable people from scams."This means we want to see barriers created between older people and the scammers by both legislators and the big telecommunication industries that currently inadvertently host the scams."We believe some of the scam letters could be filtered out because you can see through the cellophane wrapper that they are offering outrageous sums of money that cannot possibly be genuine."They have to filter them out at the beginning of the postal chain."Widow Shirley Whitman, 78, from Cardiff, told BBC Radio Wales she had received two to three scam letters a week for the last five years.She said: "It makes me cross because I know that other people will fall for it. I don't normally open them, they look very genuine."I know a lot of people, they won't admit it usually but they do answer these things. One lady in her late 80s was sending them off regularly and she was housebound and I think once you're housebound having a letter of any sort can be something."A cross party group of AMs will meet at the assembly on Wednesday to discuss the issue.Chairman of the group Mike Hedges, Swansea East AM, said: "What's especially upsetting to note is that there's one community in particularly that's being targeted by fraudsters and criminals - older people."Such crimes have a devastating impact on so many older adults each year and can leave them in a very vulnerable and helpless position."Andrew Bertie, head of Scambusters Wales, will give evidence at the committee."Scammers are organised criminals who set out to con people," he said."They commit fraud on a large scale and live a lavish lifestyle. Studies have shown that such incidents are hugely under reported, mostly due to embarrassment on behalf of the victim and the thought people may have that they can no longer cope."He said 63% of scam victims are repeatedly targeted.Age Cymru will also call for 'No Cold Calling Zones' across Wales.</body>

      <description>Malky Mackay's head of recruitment is suspended, prompting fears the Cardiff City boss could be unsettled by the move.</description>

      <body>Cardiff City have suspended head of recruitment Iain Moody and brought in Kazakhstani Alisher Apsalyamov as his acting replacement.After taking over in 2011, Scotsman Malky Mackay added Moody to his staff.Ex-Watford press officer Moody helped the Premier League newcomers sign summer recruits such as Gary Medel and Steven Caulker in his scouting role.BBC Wales football correspondent Rob Phillips said: "The worry for Cardiff fans will be the unsettling of Mackay."The Cardiff City website  says Moody's football career began as a Uefa-appointed interpreter for Italy during the 1996 European Championships.He went on to become a writer at the Football365.com website in 1999, moving to a sports management agency in 2001.Ten years later Moody joined Watford as press officer before becoming their football operations manager alongside then-Vicarage Road boss Mackay.BBC Wales football correspondent Rob Phillips said: "Ian Moody has been an unobtrusive, yet hugely significant influence at Cardiff City."Moody is a trusted lieutenant of Malky Mackay, who brought him when he arrived from Watford."He has been the man in whom Mackay put total trust on transfer dealings, culminating in the eye-catching arrivals of Steven Caulker, from Spurs, and Gary Medel, from Sevilla,"The worry for Cardiff fans will be the unsettling of Mackay - a highly rated young manager - after a decent start to the season. With Mackay pinning much faith in the team ethic throughout the club these will be worrying developments."Midfielder Medel and defender Caulker apart, Moody also helped the Bluebirds sign French right-back Kevin Theophile-Catherine, £8m Denmark striker Andreas Cornelius, and forwards Fraizer Campbell, Jordon Mutch and Kim Bo-Kyung.</body>

      <body>A burglar was "devastated" after causing injuries to a householder that led to her death but he did not intend to kill her, a murder trial has heard.Glynis Solmaz, 65, was killed in the bedroom of her Wrexham home in February, Mold Crown Court was told.Alexandros Wetherill, 24, from Wrexham denies murder but admits manslaughter.Christopher Curran, 34, from Wrexham, denies murder. Both admit conspiracy to burgle with Mrs Solmaz' ex-son-in-law, Christopher Natt, and David Lovell.The prosecution claim Natt, of Ponciau, Wrexham, had previously lived in the same house as Mrs Solmaz and had installed a safe in her bedroom wall.It was his idea to rob her as he believed she was wealthy with cash, jewels and possessions.The court heard Mrs Solmaz had inherited between £30,000 and £50,000 from several legacies, which on the town's Caia Park estate where she lived, would have led to her being considered wealthy.The prosecution alleges that Mr Wetherill, a bricklayer, went beyond the plan merely to steal from Mrs Solmaz and Mr Curran did nothing to stop him.Giving evidence on Tuesday, Mr Wetherill told the court he could not keep his head above water and was in debt.He said the boiler had gone at his home and his partner and newly born baby daughter had moved to her parents home, and he wanted them back as a family.He had been told there was a lot of money in the house, he thought it would be a quick burglary and he told the jury that he had been to the house on earlier occasions to check if a bathroom window was open.Mrs Solmaz was not supposed to be at home and he had been told that if her Corsa car was not there then should not be at home.He told jurors that he knocked the door a couple of times, went in when there was no answer, but that she then appeared from somewhere and "caught me red handed".He said that he grabbed her and held her away from him so that she would not see him and then claimed she took him upstairs as he still held her.She mentioned keys to the safe, they returned downstairs but she could not find them, and they returned upstairs and he held her with one arm while he tried to open the safe with a screwdriver with the other.But as he released his grip she grabbed a light shade and started to hit him with it and kicked back at him, he said.He said he panicked and tried to calm her down, and tightened his grip - and it was then he said she went limp and started to snore.In evidence, he said believed that she had fainted or was temporarily unconscious, he had not seen any injuries or any blood, and he lowered her on to the floor.Mr Wetherill said that the injuries from which she later died had occurred before Mr Curran came into the room and that Mr Curran had not physically touched her.When Mr Curran did enter the bedroom Mr Wetherill said that he had his foot on Mrs Solmaz's head so that if she woke up she could not turn and see him.Mr Curran had been in the room a matter of minutes, left to get tools, but Mr Wetherill said that he got the safe out of the wall.They later shared out the money, and he left his track suit bottoms and hooded top and hat at a house in Brymbo where Mr Curran was then staying.A couple of days later, on the Wednesday, Mr Curran rang him to say she had died.Mr Wetherill said that simultaneously he heard it on the radio news and he said that he turned white, broke down, felt sick and was shaking.He decided to give himself up which he did on the Friday.Asked how he felt about what he had done, he said: "Absolutely ashamed. I am devastated. I still cannot believe the reality of what actually happened."The hearing continues.</body>

      <body>A trial of a former mayor accused of setting off explosives has heard how residents were left "terrified".John Larsen, of Lenten Pool, Denbigh, is accused of blowing up a car and causing other explosions near his home.The 46-year-old denies three arson charges, one of causing an explosion and two of possessing explosives - one with intent to endanger life.Caernarfon Crown Court heard Lenten Pool was plagued by the sound of loud bangs at night.The incidents took place two or three times a week, culminating in an attack on a Land Rover in March, the court was told.The prosecution told the jury there was a "compelling" case against Mr Larsen, who was a local town councillor and had been mayor of Denbigh in 1999.Mr Larsen might have been "getting a thrill from what he was doing and the attention it was generating," the court heard.Lenten Pool resident Shirley Clarke described how explosive bangs began in January this year."People often said they were fireworks - they were not fireworks," she told the court."They were humongous. They were more than fireworks, it was like a bomb."Mrs Clarke, who is a nurse, told the jury that the booms and bangs got louder as the incidents escalated in the following weeks."I was terrified," she stressed.She told the court how she stopped sleeping in a front room bedroom at night while her husband worked away and instead shared a bedroom with her 14-year-old son.On 14 March, she found her Audi car, parked on a patch of waste ground near the house, had been damaged.The car bonnet had been burned and the windscreen and wings damaged."It had burned through the windscreen," she said.A few days later, she returned home to find glass in the porch had been smashed.Then on 24 March, her family were woken just after midnight by a loud explosion after a device was set-off under the Land Rover.She told the court how she had rushed out on to the street with her husband and son.They found the windows in the porch had smashed with ball-bearings lying inside the porch.Upstairs, her front bedroom window had also been smashed and another ball-bearing was found."It had come through the window. I had a pine headboard and it had hit the pine headboard before ricocheting from there," Mrs Clarke told the jury.She agreed with the prosecutor that the only reason she had not been in the bed at the time was because she had fallen asleep on the sofa.Since the episodes, Mrs Clarke and her family have sold their home and moved out of the area. She told the court the incidents in Lenten Pool had prompted the move.Mr Larsen was arrested by police at his nearby home on 19 April.Police found a manual on pyrotechnics in the house, a computer file named "gunpowder mix", modified fireworks and rockets, and ball-bearings.The court has heard that he told police he had a legitimate interest in fireworks and had bought some materials online.He denies all charges against him and the case continues.</body>

      <body>Tributes have been paid to a former president of the Football Association of Wales (FAW) and community stalwart who has died aged 84.Tegwyn Evans MBE, of Welshpool, Powys, died in the early hours of Tuesday, a week after suffering a heart attack.Mr Evans was "passionate" about football, serving as an FAW council member since 1975 and as president from 2003 to 2006.He was also Welshpool's mayor and president of the local football club.The FAW described Mr Evans, who was chairman of the Central Wales FA, as a "lifelong stalwart of mid Wales football"."During his time at the FAW he was a fine ambassador for the game at home and abroad and made many friends," it said."Everyone at the FAW salutes his service to football in Wales and our thoughts are with his family and friends at this sad time."Away from football, Mr Evans was heavily involved in his local community and was widely known as "Mr Welshpool".He served on Welshpool Town Council for many years, including a spell as mayor between 1981 and 1983.In 2002, he was awarded the MBE by the Queen for his services to the town and to Welshpool Football Club.Robert Robinson, clerk of Welshpool town council, described him as an "absolute gentleman"."Nothing ruffled him and everybody you speak to only has good words to say about him," he said."His main love was football and he did a tremendous amount of work with that. He was very passionate about it."The amount he put into Welshpool Town Football Club was incredible."And you don't become the FAW president for nothing. He was still travelling very long distances for meetings and was still involved in top level football with the Welsh FA."He also looked after the local carnival for 20 years and handed it over to me just a few weeks ago."He was one of those characters you wanted around and will be hugely missed."Tributes were also paid to Mr Evans on Twitter.Glyn Davies, MP for Mongomeryshire, wrote: "One of Montgomeryshire's big personalities has died. Tegwyn was a great servant of Welshpool, and long term champion of Welsh football."Llanidloes Town FC tweeted: "Sad news again today. Mr Tegwyn Evans has passed away. True gentleman and great ambassador for football in Wales."Fellow Powys club Llanfair United FC added: "Sad news regarding the death of Mr Tegwyn Evans today."</body>

      <body>The first minister says he expects Wales to have improved its position in a worldwide ranking of schools systems, despite warnings to the contrary.The next Pisa results, which test the abilities of 15-year-olds in reading, maths and science, are due in December.Wales was ranked lowest of the UK countries in the 2010 results.Carwyn Jones says he expects Wales to do better but there have been previous warnings it may be too soon to see the results of reforms.Concern about schools standards was prompted by the worldwide Pisa assessments, which are published by the international body the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).The tests ranked Wales as the lowest country in the UK in December 2010 with Wales' teenagers below average, alongside the Czech Republic, in reading.Out of 67 countries taking part, Wales was ranked 38th for reading, 40th for maths and 30th for the tests for science.At the time the then-education minister Leighton Andrews called the results "unacceptable" and said everyone involved should be "alarmed".The rankings led to changes being brought into the education system with the aim of getting Wales into the top 20 countries by 2015.But last year, Mr Andrews - who has since left the cabinet to be replaced by Huw Lewis - was reported as saying that he did not expect the changes to deliver a "real improvement" in time for December.Education expert David Reynolds, an adviser to the Welsh government, has also said that "nobody is expecting the Pisa 2013 results to be very different from what they were in the Pisa before".At question time in the Senedd on Tuesday, Mr Jones said he expected to see an improvement in December's results."We saw the improvement in GCSE results with the gap narrowing even against the results in England... so it's absolutely right we should say that," he said."The other thing we've done, of course, is to make sure that school spending is protected in the budget."That's something that you would expect me to say; that is a commitment we have as a party."I contrast that of course with the desire of the opposition, the Conservative Party, to cut the education budget by 12%."The OECD compares educational outcomes in dozens of countries.In December 2012, Mr Andrews asked it to review Wales' education system and to look for "further value" that can be added to Welsh government reforms.</body>

      <body>The planned shut down of Britain's oldest nuclear reactor may be extended by 15 months after its owners applied to keep it open until the end of 2015.The 42-year-old Wylfa reactor 1 on Anglesey was expected to stop producing power in 2014 but it could now continue until the following December.Magnox Limited has submitted a document to the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) proposing to prolong operations.The ONR said it would respond to the proposal.Earlier this year, Magnox said it was considering extending the lifetime of the reactor as it wanted to ensure it maximised any electricity generating potential in the remaining fuel.A periodic safety review, carried out every 10 years to ensure reactors are safe to run, has been submitted to ONR.The 490-megawatt reactor has been operating since 1971 next to its twin reactor Wylfa 2, which permanently shut down in April 2012.In August last year, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority gave the go-ahead for a fuel transfer between the two Wylfa reactors that allowed Wylfa 1 to continue operating.A site adjacent to the existing power plant has been earmarked for the construction of a new nuclear power station.Japan's Hitachi plans to build two to three new reactors at the site.</body>

      <body>Plans for the next phase of a scheme to transform the promenade in Colwyn Bay are to be submitted to Conwy council.Part of the council's Waterfront Project, including a water sport centre and beach, has already been built and was officially opened last month.The next stage would see more sea defence work and promenade improvements.A planning decision is expected by December and if granted, work would take around six months to complete.A £5m Welsh government grant has been earmarked for coastal defence works.The money would be used to import sand for the beach stretching from east of the pier to the eastern end to an area known as the Cayley embankment.Repair work would be carried out to the existing sea wall, and the section of the promenade between Porth Eirias and the pier would be renewed with the promenade itself being raised and resurfaced.Work would also focus on improving the links between the promenade and the town, particularly the area under the railway bridge opposite the pier."It is exciting to see the plans for the next stage of the Waterfront Project, which will provide vital protection for the town and promenade itself," said councillor Mike Priestley, Conwy council's cabinet member for highways, environment and sustainability."Also, having seen for myself how popular the recharged beach was this summer, I have no doubt extending it further, coupled with the promenade improvements, will provide a waterfront that residents can once again enjoy and be proud of."He added: "The work on the town centre link will also allow the improvements being made on the waterfront to act as an economic catalyst for the town itself, drawing visitors from the promenade towards the town and vice versa."An public information event will be held at Porth Eirias on 6 November between 10:00 and 19:00 and information will be available on the Waterfront Project later this week.</body>

      <body>Joe Anyinsah scored his second goal in as many games as Wrexham ended a four-match winless run against Southport.The Sandgrounders were marking their 1,500th non-league game, but had nothing to celebrate in a seventh away defeat of the season.Osayamen Osawe and Paul Rutherford combined to waste a wonderful 72nd-minute chance.And two minutes later Anyinsah struck to seal victory as Dean Keates returned following pre-season toe surgery.The Dragons climbed a place to 19th in the Conference Premier, while Southport went from 14th to 15th.Wrexham boss Andy Morrell told BBC Wales:"It's a massive relief, especially after the first half with the chances we created."I'm just thinking 'not one of them, especially tonight', but the lads dug deep. They stuck at it and it just proves in a minute, the football there, the fine lines between winning and losing a football match."They're two on one with the keeper to beat and Coughs [Andy Coughlin] makes two unbelievable saves and the lads get back and get him out of the mire."And then we play a ball forward. If Bish [Andy Bishop] touches it, it's offside. He misses it and it goes through to Joe [Anyinsah] and he rounds the keeper and scores."Crazy, crazy, but thankfully a bit of fortune has gone our way this time."</body>

      <description>Work on new defences to prevent a repeat of flooding which devastated a Denbighshire estate is expected to start this year.</description>

      <body>Work on new defences to prevent a repeat of flooding which devastated a Denbighshire estate is expected to start this year.Denbighshire council and building firm Taylor Wimpey will meet two-thirds of the cost to help protect the Glasdir estate in Ruthin.More than 120 homes were hit when the River Clwyd overflowed last year.The council said it was waiting to see if the Welsh government would provide the last third of the £300,000 needed.However, work will start anyway and is expected to be completed in March next year.In September a report by independent investigators said blocked culverts had led to the flooding.The report said screens around the culverts on the estate were poorly designed and did not comply with recognised standards.The council was not blamed but it said lessons must be learnt.Hundreds of homes in nearby St Asaph were also flooded when the River Elwy burst its banks.Councillor David Smith, the cabinet lead member for environment, said the work to prevent a recurrence was an urgent priority, and he was not prepared to wait for the full funding to be in place before it could begin."Since publication of the investigation report, officers have undertaken further work to understand the costs and timescales for implementing [the] recommendation," he said."This analysis suggests the cost of works to increase the height of the flood defence bund would be in the region of £300k and that it could be in place by March 2014."Mr Smith said the council and Taylor Wimpey had agreed to pay a third each of the cost."We have made a similar request of Welsh government," he said."We have yet to hear back from them however if they are also willing to contribute towards this much needed improvement."They have already made a commitment, through Natural Resources Wales, to improve defences in St Asaph for the benefit of local residents there."He said the work was at the design stage but could be expected to start by December and completed in March next year."I am concerned that we have not yet had confirmation of funding from Welsh government but I am not prepared to allow this to delay the start of these works," he said.The Welsh government has been asked to comment.</body>

      <body>Housing projects in Aberystwyth have received an £800,000 boost from a scheme to help rejuvenate the town.The Welsh government's town regeneration fund is supporting plans for 20 flats on the derelict Tabernacle chapel site with a £337,500 grant.It is also giving £400,000 to a project to bring empty properties back into use in the town centre.A housing improvement grant scheme run by Ceredigion council, and targeting Corporation Street, receives £100,000.The Victorian Tabernacle chapel in Mill Street was gutted by fire in July 2008 and demolished on safety grounds. There had been hopes of converting the listed chapel into flats before the blaze.Plans for the 20 one-bedroom flats on the site are being developed by Mid Wales Housing Association in partnership with Ceredigion council.Welsh government Housing and Regeneration Minister Carl Sargeant said: "When the action plan for Aberystwyth was developed one of the key themes was the development of quality housing for local people."The demand for housing in the area is significant and in the past it has not been of the highest quality."Empty properties are a wasted resource in an area such as Aberystwyth where demand for housing of all types is very high."There are a number of vacant and under-used properties and vacant spaces above commercial areas throughout the town, specifically in the town centre, and these do little to enhance the visual appearance of the area or encourage investment."The Welsh government named Aberystwyth as a regeneration area in October 2009 and it was awarded £10.3m in March 2010.Projects which have already benefited from the fund include a new circular road linking Aberystwyth University and the National Library of Wales, along with a new bus service. This opened last year."This latest investment will redevelop a site which is seen as an important location in Aberystwyth and has been an eyesore in recent years," said Ceredigion council leader Ellen ap Gwynn, who is also chair of the fund's partnership board."While this development focuses on housing it contributes to the larger picture of making Aberystwyth an attractive place to work, live and visit and future projects, such as the redevelopment of the bandstand, will also complement our overall aim."More than £8m of the regeneration money has been spent on Aberystwyth so far and more projects are in the pipeline, she said.Meanwhile, a scheme improving access to the town's railway station and an area for buses received £1m from the fund in 2011.</body>

      <body>Two hundred pupils at a secondary school in Neath Port Talbot are being offered the MMR vaccination.Tuesday's special session was organised following one confirmed case of measles and four suspected cases linked to Cwmtawe School in Pontardawe.Two pupils and a member of staff have been affected by the outbreak, said health officials.There are two other suspected cases, believed to be relatives who are pupils at another school.Public health officials said those two probable cases had been identified in children at Ysgol Y Cribarth, Abercrave, Powys.Parents of children who are not protected against measles but who are showing symptoms, including a fever, runny nose and rash, are being asked to keep their children at home.Health officials said a disappointing number of children at Cwmtawe had been vaccinated.Of 1,260 pupils, 62 are recorded as having received no doses of the MMR vaccine and 142 have received only one dose.But at Ysgol Y Cribarth, the number of unvaccinated children is so small Powys Teaching Health Board is making arrangements for children to be immunised individually.It comes three months after Wales' biggest measles outbreak ended.The Swansea area epidemic saw suspected cases first reported last November before it spread to mid and west Wales.By the time the outbreak was declared over in July, it had resulted in 1,219 notifications of measles cases in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, Hywel Dda and Powys health board areas.Some 88 people visited a hospital due to measles during the outbreak and more than 75,000 were vaccinated throughout Wales.Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, from Swansea, died from pneumonia after contracting the virus at the height of the epidemic.The symptoms of measles include a fever, fatigue, runny nose, conjunctivitis and a distinctive red rash.Two MMR doses are needed to provide the maximum 99% protection against measles, say experts.</body>

      <body>Chris Coleman's new contract as Wales manager will not hinge solely on their final two World Cup qualifiers.Football Association of Wales chief Jonathan Ford had previously hinted Coleman's future could depend on the results against Macedonia and Belgium.But Ford told BBC Radio Wales on Monday that "we're not going to judge anybody on just two games", although he also stressed that more wins were needed.Coleman's current contract expires at the end of November 2013.The 43-year-old, who was appointed in January 2012 on a two-and-a-half-year contract following the death of Gary Speed, has said he is undecided whether he will sign his new contract with Wales.But Coleman has said he will lead Wales against Macedonia on Friday night, Belgium on 15 October and in a friendly against Finland at the Cardiff City Stadium on 16 November.Wales have won just three of their 12 games under Coleman, with their last victory coming against Scotland in March, and they sit bottom of their qualifying group."Chris has been there a couple of years of course and, forgive me, there's been some fantastic periods within his reign where we've seen some fantastic football," Ford said."Let's not forget the circumstances in which he took over. It took a while, it would take any manager - no matter what their skill level - a while."And of course we've seen some fantastic performances: two great performances against Scotland; a fantastic win against Austria; very, very close [to winning] against Croatia and arguably we should have won that."Ford recognised that Coleman has an uphill task in the games against Macedonia and Belgium, as injuries and suspensions have seen the Wales boss forced to call up nine replacement players to his squad."With the injuries that we have of course it's going to be very, very difficult," Ford said."Nobody is going to judge one person on any one match and certainly not in these circumstances... if he was on trial now I think anybody would pack in right now."But the FAW chief did concede that Wales "need to win considerably more than we lose".He added: "It's a results-based business... I want to win every single match, I want to be with the fans - every fan in this country wants us to win every single match, that has not changed, it will never change in the future."We must win, we must look to win, we must look to qualify, that must be our objective, that has to be our goal."We do need to ensure that we have a full evaluation period, look back over the last couple of years with Chris and decide with him what is the best way forward."</body>

      <body>A record number of writers have been shortlisted for this year's Dylan Thomas Prize because of the strength of the entries, say judges.Seven debut works - three novels, two poetry books and two short story collections - are vying for the £30,000 award, which started in 2006.The Swansea-based prize normally features a shortlist of five or six.The award is given to an author of a novel, play, poetry or travel book in the English language who is under 30.The winner will be announced in November.Judging panel chair Peter Florence said: "We had such a strong shortlist this year that we had to include a seventh title, as they are all contenders."In all my years on the judging panel of the prize, I've never seen a higher standard of entry from young writers."Next year sees the centenary celebration of Swansea-born writer Thomas, whose global success was the catalyst for the launch of the prize.It celebrates the legacy of a poet who wrote most of his work in his 20s.It was set up initially as a biennial award - one of the world's highest paying literary prizes for young writers under 30.Since then, the judges claim it has become a reliable guide to the best new literary talent by unearthing and recognising young writers from around the world.The prize's chair, Peter Stead, said: "The seven books on this year's shortlist indicate the truly international scope of the Dylan Thomas Prize."There are two young poets - one English, one Welsh - and five prose writers from around the world whose stories take us to Nepal, war-torn Sudan, South Africa, Nevada and the Near East of Classical times."These are amazingly and accomplished books by writers who are all under 30 and who will be coming to Swansea to speak to aspiring young writers and to hear the judging panel's choice of winner."The first winner was Rhondda writer Rachel Tresize, and her successors include Nam Le, a Vietnamese-born writer based in New York, Belfast writer Lucy Caldwell, and last year's winner Maggie Shipstead from California.The 2013 prize judges include Hay Festival founder Mr Florence; author, singer and radio presenter Cerys Matthews; journalist and author Carolyn Hitt; and University of Texas English professor Kurt Heinzelman.In addition to the prize money, the winner is also presented with a bronze cast of a young Dylan Thomas at the awards ceremony in Swansea.</body>

      <body>Wales forward Craig Bellamy has confirmed he is to retire from international football.The Cardiff City player will bow out after the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Macedonia and Belgium.Bellamy, 34, has won 76 caps for Wales and scored 19 goals during a 15-year international career."Players come and go and my career has definitely come and gone," the former Coventry, Newcastle and Liverpool striker said."I have to do what's best for the national team and this group of players are the future. The next qualifiers, two-odd years, I'm not going to see it."He said the current set of talented younger players gave Wales a better chance of qualification for Euro 2016."They have to have a better opportunity of qualifying. I have to cut myself short," he said.Friday's penultimate World Cup qualifier against Macedonia at Cardiff City Stadium is set to be Bellamy's final Wales appearance on home soil.And it could be his final cap if he picks up a second yellow card which would see him miss Tuesday's qualifier against Belgium in Brussels through suspension.He was penalised the first time in Wales' 3-0 defeat by Serbia on 10 September.Bellamy says he will not play in the friendly against Finland at Cardiff City Stadium on 16 November.Former Wales captain Bellamy will go down as one of his country's greats. He is the third most-capped Welsh player of all time and is fifth on the all-time scorers' chart with 19 goals."I'm just grateful for every game I've been lucky enough to play for my country, and I really mean that," Bellamy added."It's an honour to play for your country at any level at any sport."[Playing] 70-odd times, it's been the best. Even the disappointments, even the lows, even the times I didn't want to play again because sometimes defeats can do that to you."Seventy-odd times having that honour like singing the anthem… it's still the best and Friday will be the best and hopefully I will get the chance to do it again on Tuesday. [It] will be hard to let go."My daughter will probably come out with me [before the Macedonia game] but it will probably hit me more after it... when you're watching the team."Bellamy made his debut as an 18-year-old in a friendly against Jamaica in March 1998, replacing Gareth Taylor during the second half of a goalless draw at Ninian Park.He scored his first international goal against Malta two months later and scored the winner in a Euro 2000 qualifier against Denmark in October 1998.His most famous goal for Wales was the winner in the famous 2-1 victory over Italy in a Euro 2004 qualifier at the Millennium Stadium in October 2002, a game Bellamy considers his best moment in a Wales shirt.One of his most memorable games for Wales came when he scored twice in a 5-2 win in Slovakia in September 2007, a display which then manager John Toshack described as a "scintillating performance".His career has been dogged by on and off-field controversies including being sent off for violent conduct during Wales' defeat in Belarus in September 2000.Bellamy, whose spell as captain of the national team was during Toshack's reign in 2007 to 2011, also represented Great Britain at the 2012 Olympic Games.He came close to retiring from international football following the death of Wales manager and close friend Gary Speed in November 2011.But the Cardiff-born forward, who played in Speed's memorial match against Costa Rica in February 2012, decided to prolong his international career under new manager Chris Coleman.However the former Manchester City frontman hinted the 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign would be his international swansong.He has even suggested he could retire from football altogether at the end of the season, when his current deal with Cardiff City expires.Bellamy revealed in June his ambition to manage Wales and Cardiff City in the future but added he had a long way to go before stepping into management.</body>

      <body>Commemorative coins marking the christening of Prince George will be priced at between £13 and £50,000, the Royal Mint has announced.Twenty-two of the most expensive coins will be struck containing a kilogramme of fine gold each. A range of coins at different prices is being struck.It is the first time that a royal christening has been marked with coins.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son will be christened on 23 October, just over three months after his birth.The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, will perform the christening at the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace.The prince, who was born on 22 July at St Mary's Hospital in London, is third in line to the throne.The coins are starting to be struck on Tuesday at the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf.They feature a lily font from the Tower of London, which has links with royal christenings.The inscription is flanked by two harp-playing cherubs. The motto at the foot of the coin is the traditional "Dieu et mon droit" or "God and my right", which is the motto of Prince George's great grandmother, the Queen.The prince has already had coins minted in his honour. The Royal Mint gave away 2,013 silver pennies to babies born on the same day as the duke and duchess's son.</body>

      <title>£600m in major projects unveiled</title>
      <description>More than £600m is to be handed out towards major projects in a bid to stimulate the economy in Wales, as local councils reel from cutbacks in funding from the Welsh government.</description>

      <body>More than £600m is to be handed out towards major projects in a bid to stimulate the economy in Wales.It includes £62m for the South Wales Metro transport project and £140m for a help-to-buy housing scheme.Finance Minister Jane Hutt says it will create or sustain 11,000 jobs and tackle poverty.The announcement comes a day after she unveiled big cuts for councils and in other areas to pay for a £570m increase in the health budget.One senior council figure warned some local authorities could "go bust".Ms Hutt announced a series of capital spending commitments, including:Ms Hutt said: "The tough economic conditions continue but I am determined to use every pound available to invest in infrastructure and boost economic growth in the long-term."Councils were still reeling from Tuesday's funding announcement by Ms Hutt and the likely knock-on on services such as leisure centres and libraries.Local government spending will fall from £4.648bn this year to £4.466bn next year, a cut in cash terms of 3.91% or 5.81% in real terms.Their budgets will be around 9% lower in real terms between now and 2015-16.Councillor Russell Goodway, cabinet member for finance on Cardiff council - Wales' largest local authority - said: "I think there will be some local authorities in Wales that will go bust in the next two or three years. They will run out of money."From where I am sitting we are in a very dark place this morning and I don't think that some local authorities are going to survive."He told BBC Radio Wales that Cardiff has to save £20m this year which it was struggling to achieve let alone the £50m in cuts it needs to find in 2014-15."Even if we stopped spending every single penny that we spend on discretionary services that would not be enough to cut our spending. We have got to find different ways of doing things."Steve Thomas, chief executive of the Welsh Local Government Association said the cuts will affect services."It's a very tough budget and it's £175m coming out of council services," he told BBC Wales."We can't keep delivering the range of services that we're currently delivering so it will impact on things such as leisure services, libraries, refuse collections and the conditions of our roads."We run something like 735 services so there's going to be a massive impact for the Welsh public."He added: "We're not the number one priority and clearly what has happened is with the mixture of Westminster cuts and the prioritisation of health spending, local government has become in effect the poor relation in terms of this budget."Mr Thomas said one way of making up the shortfall would be to raise council tax - he did not expect any councils to freeze their rates next year."We've yet to see the local government settlement but once we see it, I think there will be more pressure on the council tax," he said."It is a source of income but I think we've got to consult the public and see what services they want to prioritise."We've got three years to make these cuts and it's going to be a very tough period for local authorities to do that."In announcing her draft budget, Ms Hutt said it was not possible to "shield" all services from UK government spending cuts.She stressed the priority was to protect health, schools and universal benefits such as free prescriptions, school breakfasts and bus passes for older people.</body>

      <title>MP questions 'bedroom tax' success</title>
      <description>Changes to housing benefits, the so-called "bedroom tax", are not working as well in Wales as other parts of the UK, says a senior Conservative MP.</description>

      <date>1381239171</date>
      <body>Changes to housing benefits - the so-called bedroom tax - are not working as well in Wales as other parts of the UK, says a senior Conservative MP.David Davies, on a visit to Blaenavon, Torfaen, blamed a shortage of smaller properties for people on benefits to move into compared to large cities.The reforms see housing association and council tenants having benefits cut if they are deemed to have spare bedrooms.Since April it has meant a 14% cut for one spare room and 25% for two.Mr Davies is chairman of the UK Parliament's Welsh Affairs Select Committee which is looking at how the changes are working in Wales.The committee is due to publish its own report on the changes shortly.Monmouth MP Mr Davies said: "These reforms are not working as well in Wales as in London or Birmingham where there is a larger stock of smaller properties."He was speaking as the BBC Wales Week in Week Out programme went behind the scenes with Bron Afon Housing Association, which has 509 properties in Blaenavon but only 23 one-bedroom flats.A third of the larger homes are under-occupied and affected by the benefit changes.Mr Davies met residents in the town as part of Tuesday's programme.He said ministers should be up front that some people would lose out from the UK government changes when they did not deserve to.One woman is losing £21 a week due to the changes and now faces having to leave Blaenavon where her family has lived for generations.Gail Harris has rented the same three-bedroom house for 25 years and now faces the prospect of having to leave the town if she cannot find a smaller property.She has more than £400 arrears and said the changes were "really cruel".Mr Davies told the 59-year-old he was "sorry" that she may be one of the people who could lose out."There has to be a recognition - and ministers may be reluctant to do this - when you change the law there are unforeseen and unfortunate consequences," he told her."In other words there are some people who will lose out who don't deserve to lose out - and I believe you could be one of those and I am really sorry for that."He added: "That doesn't mean we can reverse the whole thing or change it, because there is a wider issue."With limited housing stock and very limited money you can't have a situation where large numbers of people are under occupying - people living on their own in social housing with two or three bedrooms."That situation couldn't be allowed to continue."Mr Davies also provoked anger when he spoke to a young couple."You are not going to like what I have to say to you," he told 17-year-old Amy Evans and her partner Lloyd Mulry."The government have brought this in because we are in a terrible financial situation - absolutely unbelievable."And the days when we were able to fund people in your situation are gone."He told Amy he would move back home if he was in their position and that Lloyd should leave Wales for somewhere like London if he could not find work in Blaenavon.Housing officer Claire Dullea told the programme she could see why the legislation had been introduced.But she added: "If we haven't got those one bedrooms available for people to be able to move into then it's not going to happen - and those people left in the three-bedroom houses paying the bedroom tax are really, really struggling."Week In Week Out is on BBC One Wales, Tuesday 8 October at 22:35 BST.</body>

      <title>Coleman set for Collins peace talks</title>
      <description>Wales boss Chris Coleman and defender James Collins will meet on Wednesday to try to patch up their differences.</description>

      <body>Wales manager Chris Coleman will meet defender James Collins on Wednesday in an attempt to settle their differences.Coleman has stood by his claim that the West Ham player rejected the chance to join the Wales squad before their World Cup qualifier with Serbia in September, an accusation that Collins denied.But 41-cap Collins made the first move with a telephone call on Tuesday.Wales have 10 players out injured for Friday's qualifier with Macedonia and the trip to Belgium on 15 October.Included in that lengthy injury list is captain Ashley Williams, plus fellow defenders Adam Matthews, Ben Davies, Danny Gabbidon and Sam Ricketts.The return of Collins, 30, for the next two games would add some much-needed experience to Coleman's backline, as Wales attempt to avert finishing bottom of Group A.Coleman has painfully few centre-half options with Chris Gunter - normally a full-back - and Owain Tudur Jones - a midfielder and last capped in May 2011 - tipped to start against Macedonia in the middle of defence.The Wales boss has yet to agree a contract extension with the Football Association of Wales beyond the end of his current deal in November.Coleman's hopes of finishing the campaign with a flourish, and adding to his three wins from 12 games in charge, have been further undermined with his midfield options shattered by injury.The world's most expensive player, Gareth Bale, Liverpool's Joe Allen, Celtic's Joe Ledley and Brighton's Andrew Crofts - although he would have been suspended for the Macedonia game in Cardiff in any case - also withdrew injured.The injury crisis could yet get worse as Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey and Burnley striker Sam Vokes took no part in training on Tuesday because of injury concerns.</body>

      <title>Wales squad best since 1958 - Bellamy</title>

      <body>Craig Bellamy believes the Wales squad is the best since the country last reached a World Cup in 1958.The Cardiff City forward will retire from international football after the upcoming World Cup qualifiers, which Wales go into bottom of their group.But Bellamy, 34, says he is leaving a squad of "world-class players", such as Real Madrid's £85m signing Gareth Bale."This group of players is a better group than any of the groups down the 50-odd years," said Bellamy."We have so many world-class players now but also we have strength in depth, which we haven't had. The quality of players we've got - this is not like teams down the years."Wales have not qualified for a major tournament since their appearance at the World Cup in Sweden 55 years ago.That squad - which reached the quarter-finals - included Welsh greats Jack Kelsey, John and Mel Charles, Ivor Allchurch and Cliff Jones.The current national side are bottom of their World Cup Qualifying group with two games of the campaign left against Macedonia and Belgium."I haven't qualified for a major tournament because my teams haven't been good enough and I haven't been good enough. That's the simple fact."We have to get out of that routine of 'poor old Wales' and 'unlucky'. I'm fed up with it. We owe it to this group of players now."Chris Coleman's preparations for Friday's qualifier against Macedonia at Cardiff City Stadium have been disrupted by injuries.Winger Bale, the Swansea pair of captain Ashley Williams and left-back Ben Davies and Celtic midfielder Joe Ledley are among the players missing - and Bellamy admits their absence is a blow."There's no denying that the type of players we've lost would have a huge impact on any team," Bellamy added."It shouldn't really get in the way of getting a positive result against Macedonia. There's no excuses in this game."We can't finish bottom - this group of players can't. For me it just can't happen."W Hennessey (Wolves), B Myhill (West Brom), O Fôn Williams (Tranmere), C Gunter (Reading), N Taylor (Swansea), D Alfei (Swansea), J Wilson (Bristol City), R Wiggins (Charlton), A Richards (Huddersfield), D John (Cardiff), A King (Leicester), A Ramsey (Arsenal), D Vaughan (Sunderland), L Isgrove (Southampton), O Tudur Jones (Hibernian), S MacDonald (Bournemouth), D Cotterill (Doncaster), C Bellamy (Cardiff), S Church (Charlton), H Robson-Kanu (Reading), S Vokes (Burnley), J Easter (Crystal Palace).</body>

      <body>Wales have suffered another blow ahead of World Cup qualifiers against Macedonia and Belgium with skipper Ashley Williams of Swansea ruled out.Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey and Burnley striker Sam Vokes also missed Tuesday's training session.Defender Williams' ankle injury leaves boss Chris Coleman without 10 regulars.Adam Matthews, Ben Davies, Gareth Bale, Danny Gabbidon, Sam Ricketts, Jack Collison, Joe Allen, Jonathan Williams and Joe Ledley were already ruled out.Uncapped Southampton midfielder Lloyd Isgrove, 20, is one of nine call-ups.However, Williams's absence is a further defensive worry for Coleman, who has again left West Ham United centre-back James Collins out.After the 3-0 defeat by Serbia in Cardiff on 10 September, Coleman was critical of Collins, saying the player had rejected the chance to join the squad before the game, a claim Collins denies.Owain Tudur Jones, Daniel Alfei, James Wilson, Rhoys Wiggins, Jermaine Easter and Shaun MacDonald have been called up.David Cotterill and Jazz Richards also return to international duty as Coleman plugs gaps created by injuries and Andrew Crofts' suspension against Macedonia.Cardiff forward Craig Bellamy, 34, has been included for what will be his final games for the Dragons after announcing his international retirement at the end of this campaign.Bale was an early withdrawal, having made three appearances since his world record move to Real Madrid.Davies suffered a suspected hamstring injury late in Swansea's 2-0 defeat at Southampton on Sunday, while Matthews hurt his collarbone playing for Celtic and Gabbidon (hamstring) missed Crystal Palace's trip to Liverpool at the weekend.Gabbidon's team-mate Jonathan Williams is another injury absentee, adding to the problems in midfield with Allen, Ledley and Crofts all missing.Newcastle United defender Paul Dummett could have been considered for his first senior cap, but the Wales Under-21 player has injured a hamstring.Wales go into Friday's clash against Macedonia at Cardiff City Stadium bottom of Group A and travel to leaders Belgium on Tuesday, 15 October.Coleman's side have six points from eight games, leading to speculation over his future as Wales boss.He is still in negotiations to extend his deal beyond the qualifying campaign.Football Association of Wales  chief executive Jonathan Ford had hinted much could depend on the next two results in the next two World Cup qualifiers.But Ford has since told BBC Radio Wales that Coleman will not be judged solely on their two remaining group clashes.W Hennessey (Wolves), B Myhill (West Brom), O Fon Williams (Tranmere), C Gunter (Reading), N Taylor (Swansea), D Alfei (Swansea), J Wilson (Bristol City), R Wiggins (Charlton), A Richards (Huddersfield), D John (Cardiff), A King (Leicester), A Ramsey (Arsenal), D Vaughan (Sunderland), L Isgrove (Southampton), O Tudur Jones (Hibernian), S MacDonald (Bournemouth), D Cotterill (Doncaster), C Bellamy (Cardiff), S Church (Charlton), H Robson-Kanu (Reading), S Vokes (Burnley), J Easter (Crystal Palace).Wales Under-21 squad (against Lithuania on 11 October, 14:00 BST and San Marino on 15 October, 14:00 BST at the BookPeople Stadium, Bangor): Connor Roberts (Cheltenham Town), Danny Ward (Liverpool), Kieron Freeman (Derby County), Lee Evans (Wolverhampton Wanderers), Morgan Fox (Charlton Athletic), Elliott Hewitt (Ipswich Town) George Ray (Crewe Alexandra), Scott Tancock (Swansea City), Joe Walsh (Crawley Town), Billy Bodin (Torquay United)Bradley Reid (Wolverhampton Wanderers), Tom O'Sullivan (Cardiff City), Gwion Edwards (Swansea City; on-loan St Johnstone), Lee Lucas (Swansea City), Wes Burns (Bristol City), Ellis Harrison (Bristol Rovers), Josh Pritchard (Fulham; loan Tromso), Tom Lawrence (Manchester United).</body>

      <title>Extra £570m NHS cash in Welsh budget</title>
      <description>Councils facing tough choices as NHS gets more money in budget</description>

      <body>The NHS in Wales will get £570m of extra funding over three years, Finance Minister Jane Hutt has announced.It includes £150m for this financial year she told AMs as she unveiled the Welsh government's draft budget.She said the extra money would help the NHS in Wales to avoid a scandal such as the one in Stafford Hospital, where hundreds of patients died as a result of neglect and abuse.However funding for local government will see a cut of 5.81% next year.Early calculations suggest that local government cuts are particularly tough.Local government spending will fall from £4.648bn this year to £4.466bn next year, a cut in cash terms of 3.91% or 5.81% in real terms.Their budgets will be around 9% lower in real terms between now and 2015-16.Meanwhile, Ms Hutt said the pressures faced by the NHS "will continue to grow".Welsh NHS spending will rise from £5.722bn to £5.927bn next year, an increase of 3.58% in cash terms or 1.68% in real terms.Earlier in the day, Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood and Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams agreed to help the minority Labour administration get its budget through the assembly chamber.But Conservative shadow finance minister Paul Davies criticised the budget deal."Clearly they are willing to prop up this failing Labour government," he said.Under the terms of the deal, ministers will devote £100m to Plaid and Lib Dem spending priorities in return for the two opposition parties abstaining in the crucial vote in December.The money included £50m to treat more patients in the community rather than hospital and the doubling of funding for the pupil deprivation grant, a scheme to help poorer school pupils.Whilst praising the extra spending Welsh ministers had agreed to as part of the budget negotiations, Ms Wood raised concerns about the impact of local government cuts."What effect will this have on their ability to provide essential services?" she asked the finance minister."What will this mean for council tax increases next year?"What advice do you intend to issue to local government about council tax, and what impact will this budget have on young people trying to stay in education and gain qualifications?"Ms Hutt said it was not possible to "shield" all services from UK government spending cuts."Rising demand levels, cost increases and pressures resulting directly from the UK government's welfare reforms are biting," she said.She stressed the priority was to protect health, schools and universal benefits, such as free prescriptions, school breakfasts and bus passes for older people."We have also been clear that our focus will continue to rest on creating growth and jobs for the Welsh economy."Our commitment to tackle poverty by raising educational attainment and supporting children, families and deprived communities, will also help to achieve a fairer, healthier Wales," Ms Hutt added.Lib Dem finance spokesman Peter Black AM urged Ms Hutt to ensure the money got to those "in most need" and was spent as effectively as possible.Commenting on another key element of the budget deal his party and Plaid Cymru had made with Welsh ministers, he said: "I'm very proud indeed that we now have £71.3m supporting the poorest pupils in our communities next year, a commitment to investment in education and training."According to the Welsh government, these are the main areas of investment:BBC Wales health correspondent Owain Clarke writes:The Welsh government hopes the extra funding for the NHS will be a shot in the arm for a service which has often this year looked as if it is struggling to cope.The health and finance ministers spent the summer looking at the problems the NHS faced and came up with a figure. The result - £570m - exactly the three-year package of extra investment announced today.But bear in mind some economists estimate that the NHS here needs more - well in excess of £200m extra a year just to stand still.Why? Most of the money is spent on staff - and most of them on contracts which give them incremental rises each year. So unless jobs are cut, or there's a pay freeze then the bill increases.Also spending on drugs and medicines increases year on year, as does the costs of replacing equipment.Don't forget either we're living longer, putting more strain on the service and the NHS is also a notoriously inefficient organisation.So a big chunk of the extra money could be swallowed up almost immediately. The Welsh government's budget deal also includes a £50m fund designed to keep people out of hospital who don't need to be there.A huge rise in the number of elderly people going to AandE put the NHS under a massive strain in the spring. There's also almost £10m for robotic cancer surgery.Up until now dozens of Welsh men have had to go to England for less invasive prostate cancer operations and pay up to £15,000 for the privilege.But one of the key questions will be what will the seven Welsh health boards do with the rest money coming their way? Will they invest in sorting out some of the longer term challenges they face or take their foot off the pedal?The British Medical Association (BMA) Wales welcomed investments into a new intermediate care fund and enhancements to health technology funding, which it said was "long overdue".Secretary Dr Richard Lewis said: "Doctors and healthcare staff need to know that our limited resources are being targeted at services that matter to patients and support their day to day work."The government need to be honest with the profession and the public about what can and cannot be delivered in these financially straightened times."There has to be a focus on clinical priorities and safe services. There is no room for unnecessary bureaucracy and empty targets."The Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents health boards, welcomed the investment but said: "Even with this additional funding, change must take place right across Wales to ensure efficient, safe and sustainable health care services are provided within the resources allocated by Welsh government."This will inevitably mean that difficult choices have to be made on what services are provided where and when."The Unison union said it applauded the Welsh government for its "commitment to a publicly owned and financed" NHS as well as the increase in funding.Wales secretary Margaret Thomas said: "Under the circumstances, this is a responsible budget proposal from the Welsh government."Councillor Aaron Shotton, the Welsh Local Government Association's finance spokesperson said by the end of 2015-16, local government will have "borne the brunt of austerity" in Wales."This will see councils potentially having to close libraries and sports centres, slash pothole and other day-to-day maintenance budgets, cut bus subsidies and switch off streetlights between midnight and dawn," he said."While local councils will do everything they can to protect frontline services like education and social care, they will simply not be able to protect everythingCommenting on the budget, the TUC in Wales said this was a "hugely challenging time for all who believe in social justice and quality public services".General secretary Martin Mansfield said the Welsh government had worked to mitigate the impact of UK cuts since 2010,He said: "The UK government has slashed our finances by £1.7bn a year in order to pursue their austerity ideology - on top of Wales already being under funded due to the Barnett formula."The Welsh government approach is prioritising the best use of the resources left available to them."It will be a very difficult process but we will try to support them in that effort."All public service employers must play their full part in holding together our Welsh public service ethos."He said there must be "no knee jerk moves" towards pay cuts, job cuts and privatisation".BBC Wales economics correspondent Sarah Dickens writes:With the economy of Wales held back by too many people in low paid or low skilled work and many others not well enough to work, this budget appears to be trying to tackle that to make Wales wealthier.While extra money for health will flow back into the wider economy in the short term, it is hoped that increasing the impact of Flying Start's parenting support and the extra money for teaching children who are eligible for school meals will together try to break the poverty cycle.In an attempt to get more young people working the Jobs Growth Wales programme is being extended and an extra £12.5m is being spent to create another 4,000 job opportunities for 16-24 year olds. At the same time £20m will support apprenticeships.The losers as expected are local authorities. The local government budget is being cut by 3.9% in cash terms. That's equivalent to cuts of 5.8% when inflation is taken into account.It also needs to be remembered that two thirds of local government spending is covered by education and social services, leaving just one third to absorb those cuts.That includes leisure services, libraries, road repairs and street lighting but also planning and economic regeneration that can have a direct impact on jobs and prosperity locally.We shall hear how that directly affects local councils next week.The Federation of Small Businesses's Welsh policy unit chair Janet Jones said:"On the face of it the budget announced today appears to be well grounded, with the Welsh Government embracing the use of innovative forms of finance to invest in much-needed infrastructure projects."BBC Wales education correspondent Arwyn Jones writes:The Pupil Deprivation Grant (PDG) was introduced last year.Schools are allocated funds of £450 per child on free school meals, aged five to 15, which goes directly into their budgets.Following today's deal, that should more than double to £918 in 2014/15.The Welsh government has always stressed that each school will be able to decide how it spends its allocation of money.But it does expect the money to help challenge the link between poverty and achievement in schools, with a particular focus on literacy and numeracy.However earlier this year there were reports that schools were absorbing the money into their budgets, using the money to buy tablet computers and to pay for teaching assistants.So now schools have to account for their spending by publishing an online breakdown, as part of a push for greater transparency.Last month a survey of schools by the Liberal Democrats suggested that only 23% of schools use the PDG funding strictly for pupils on free school meals.But that's the only real evaluation to date of the PDG.To be fair, it is still early days, and the Welsh government has commissioned a team from Cardiff University to monitor how effective the grant has been. They're due to start reporting their findings next year.So, yes, the money may have doubled. But we'll have to wait to see if it's money well spent.Following the announcement of the draft budget, the National Union of Teachers (NUT) said while education had not been shielded from the implication of cuts to Welsh government finances, they were pleased with the "significant investment" for the PDG.NUT secretary David Evans said: "We are still lagging behind other parts of the UK. However, I think it is fair to accept that in the face of swingeing cuts to the Welsh government's funding to have £35m earmarked for schools through the PDG is something to be positive about."</body>
